            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode, REDSEC, is getting an esports competition, the Elite Series, featuring a $1 million prize pool in the first season from December 10 to January 18. </p>



<p>The Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series will kick off on December 10, 2025. Alongside the Elite Series, we will also see the launch of Open Series on December 12, 2025. The Open Series will be a competition for players of all skill levels, whereas the Elite Series will be the best REDSEC has to offer in the competitive phase. All competitions will feature cross-platform and cross-input environments, with players able to use a controller or mouse &amp; keyboard on PC or console. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-battlefield-redsec-elite-series-work">How Does Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series Work?</h2>



<p>The new Elite Series will feature weekly competitive cash cups divided across three regions: The Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), and Asia-Pacific (APAC). 50 team captains from each region will be invited, each with a squad of 4, for a total of 600 competitors. </p>



<p>These 50 squads will go through a series of six REDSEC Battle Royale matches, which will end with the top eight squads battling head-to-head in a gauntlet. The format will be repeated over three Qualifying Match Days, with squads earning Elite Series Points for their performance.&nbsp;After this period, the top-25 squads will progress to the regional Season Finals. </p>



<p>All matches will be online, streamed by all competitors, and Battlefield Studios will host the Season Finals broadcast for each region. The Americas region will have a $50,000 USD prize pool for each Qualifying Match Day, as well as a $500,000 USD prize pool split across all participating squads in the Finals Gauntlet.&nbsp;The APAC and EMEA regions will have a $20,000 USD prize pool for each Qualifying Match Day, and a $285,000 USD prize pool for the Finals Gauntlet.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-elite-series-season-1-schedule">Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series Season 1 Schedule</h2>



<p>The start time for each season will be announced closer to the Qualifying match day, but here are the Match Day and Season Finals dates: </p>



<ul>
<li>Match Day #1 – Wednesday, December 10, 2025</li>



<li>Match Day #2 – Thursday, December 11, 2025</li>



<li>Match Day #3 – Tuesday, December 16, 2025</li>



<li>Season Finals – Thursday, December 18, 2025</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-does-battlefield-redsec-open-series-work">How Does Battlefield REDSEC Open Series Work? </h2>



<p>The Open Series will also be held in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Players can register their squads on <a href="http://repeat.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Repeat.gg</a> (see the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/redsec/news/introducing-competitive-battlefield-redsec?utm_campaign=battlefield_hd_ww_ic_ic_twitter_&amp;utm_content=1763655670&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> for more details), and on each match day, they can find the tournament code in the Repeat App. Scoring will be based on the cumulative 10 best Battle Royale and the 10 best Gauntlet matches played across all three Match Days. The top 250 teams will qualify from each region for the Season Finals, and the top 8 teams will qualify for next season’s Elite Series. </p>



<p>Open Series will feature a $30,000 prize pool, with $10,000 reserved for each region. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first gameplay trailer for Hellraiser: Revival has dropped, and it’s absolutely not for the faint of heart. If you thought the debut trailer was wince-worthy, this is just as nasty and as vile as you’d expect. It’s heaven, in hell.</p>



<p>A pleasant (also unpleasant) surprise dropped in July 2025 with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellraiser-revival-trailer-revealed-saber-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellraiser: Revival Trailer, revealed by Saber Interactive</a>. It marks the first time the horror title has ever had its own standalone game, and the first gameplay trailer shows that you should expect every bit of the nastiness of the movies rolled into one.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on Gamescom preview</a> tells you everything you need to know about Hellraiser: Revival.</p>



<p>An “hour-long theater of violence and sadism” was one of many lines we used. Now, you can see the evidence for yourself through the first Hellraiser: Revival gameplay trailer. It has everything a Hellraiser fan is looking for: Nudity, graphic violence, and a sprinkling of Pinhead.</p>



<p>There’s also a lot of visceral combat, a look into the game’s brand-new story, and you also get a look at the game’s insistence on going the extra length with platforming and puzzling.</p>



<p>You can check out the footage for yourself, if you dare. All jokes aside, <strong>viewer discretion is advised</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An insider has stated that Resident Evil Requiem is definitely getting at least one DLC, which is currently in development. </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem doesn’t arrive until next year, and as we wait for the game’s launch, the only things getting us by are leaks. We recently saw the producer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">address rumours</a> about the photo of Leon Kennedy with an eye patch that surfaced online. Now, an insider has revealed some details about the DLC. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-dlc-might-star-alyssa">Resident Evil Requiem DLC Might Star Alyssa</h2>



<p>The details about the Resident Evil Requiem DLC come from Dusk Golem (Aesthetic Gamer), known for RE leaks. Their latest post on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1991047135551500624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) states, “There’s definitely at least one DLC for Resident Evil Requiem in development right now. I’ve heard about it a few times, believe it stars Alyssa.” The leaker had previously stated that Alyssa Ashcroft is also the giant monster following Grace in the trailer, and will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable for a bit</a> in the game. </p>



<p>Dusk Golem was also asked on the same day whether Leon Kennedy is being considered the main character or a side character in the upcoming title. Golem <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1991130594076696831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a> that they don’t have a blueprint for the game to give that answer, but they do know that Leon has “some very large levels, the biggest in the series to date”. Players should take both details with a grain of salt, as it does not come from an official source. </p>







<p>In other news, Capcom expects Resident Evil Requiem to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell better</a> than Resident Evil Village. Additionally, the developers recently revealed why they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-reveals-why-multiplayer-was-ditched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ditched the multiplayer aspect</a> of the title. What are your thoughts on the new claims about Resident Evil Requiem definitely having at least one DLC in development?
