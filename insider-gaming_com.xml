<p>Destiny 2’s next major update has reportedly been delayed due to the forthcoming release of Marathon, Bungie’s new extraction shooter, in early March.</p>



<p>Destiny 2: Shadow &amp; Order was originally slated for a March 3 release. However, after Bungie officially announced Marathon’s release date on Monday, Forbes’ <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/2013302457787437355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paul Tussi reported</a> that the next free Destiny update has been postponed. There’s no tentative release window for the content at the moment.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have heard Shadow and Order will in fact be delayed to make room for Marathon on March 5, given that it was supposed to come out on March 3. Not sure how long, or when it will be announced, however. <a href="https://t.co/ImVb50bOUZ">pic.twitter.com/ImVb50bOUZ</a></p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/2013302457787437355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Shadow &amp; Order is slated to be the final major update of the Year of Prophecy season of the game, which started back with the Rite of the Nine in-game event that occurred in May 2025.</p>











<p>While it’s full steam ahead on the marketing push for Marathon, pre-ordering Bungie’s new game scores Destiny players new cosmetics, Sparrows, and Ships. There are also new shaders, emotes, and more in celebration of the upcoming release.</p>

<p>Ball x Pit’s first major update, The Regal Update, has officially been announced, and it’s set to launch on January 26, 2026. Better yet, the update will be completely free for all players to claim.</p>







<p>This marks the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-devs-announce-3-free-content-updates-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first of three major updates</a> promised for the game, with the remaining two currently scheduled to arrive in April and July. But before those roll around, The Regal Update is bringing plenty of new content to dive into.</p>

<p>A trailer shared on the official Ball x Pit <a href="https://x.com/BALLxPIT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account revealed the headline additions: two brand-new playable characters joining the roster.</p>



<ul>
<li>The Carouser, a character whose returning balls orbit around him</li>



<li>The Falconer, who is flanked by her two trusted falcons that throw balls</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-january-2026-regal-update-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Regal Update</a> will also introduce eight new balls, alongside several new passives to expand build variety. To top things off, the developers teased a mysterious “nice surprise” that they’re refusing to reveal ahead of launch. If their confidence is anything to go by, you’ll want to jump in on January 26 to see it for yourself. </p>







<p>Here’s the full trailer, which showcases the two new heroes in action.</p>

<p>From January 29, prospective fans of Marathon, Bungie’s all-new extraction shooter, can pre-order the limited edition DualSense and Pulse Elite wireless headset. The exclusive range is being manufactured to welcome Marathon to the market, and the announcement comes at the same time as the game’s release date was confirmed.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on March 5, but for now, you can stoke your excitement by <strong>preparing </strong>to preorder the limited edition controller and headset.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-s-marketing-march-starts-now">Marathon’s Marketing March Starts Now</h2>



<p>Bungie dropped a new trailer earlier today, revealing the full release date for Marathon, the upcoming extraction title. It came hours after the full trailer was leaked online, uncovering the game’s launch date before Bungie could drop the announcement.</p>



<p>What wasn’t revealed ahead of time was the new DualSense controller and Pulse Elite wireless headset, produced in honor of the new game.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky road for Marathon and Bungie over the last year or so, but by all accounts, things are starting to straighten up ahead of the game’s ultimate release.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at the new controller:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And a nice glimpse at the new Pulse Elite wireless headset:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While you can pre-order the peripherals from January 29, you won’t get your hands on them until the game launches in March. Also, you can <strong>only </strong>pre-order the Pulse Elite wireless headset from PlayStation Direct.</p>



<p>Here are your pricing points:</p>



<p><strong>DualSense –</strong> $84.99</p>



<p><strong>Pulse Elite</strong> <strong>– </strong>$169.99</p>



<p>Marathon could turn around all expectations and smash into the extraction space with a mighty roar in just a few weeks. People are approaching the game with bated breath, but recent playtests have suggested that it’s potentially shaping up to be something enjoyable, at the very least.</p>

<p>Heartopia will likely end 2026 as one of the most lovingly titled games, and the life-sim title established itself early on as a game to keep an eye on. Its popularity boomed very quickly, and if you PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo owners want in on the action, there are answers for you all.</p>



<p>You’d think you can only have so many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-forget-gta-6-2026-is-all-about-the-life-sim-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-sim</a> games like Heartopia. Yet, the game from developer XD is proving once again that humanity can’t get enough of building houses and completing menial tasks that would be more productive if done in the real world—but we’re all gamers here, it would be hypocritical to suggest you go touch grass.</p>



<p>If you have a Heartopia-shaped box on your mind, its console status should be of interest.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Heartopia On PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pretty bubbles in the air. Credit to XD</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s an arrow through the heart for PS5 users as Heartopia isn’t available to play on PlayStation consoles at launch.</strong></p>



<p>Heartopia’s launch day player numbers on PC were fantastic, as were the ones after it! Before it came to Steam, Heartopia actually launched on the Google Play Store and the App Store. It garnered a reputation very first, making its Steam release a popular one. Tens of thousands of people got straight to work on creating homes and virtual lives.</p>



<p>For now, PlayStation 5 owners must miss out and play the waiting game. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Heartopia On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Heartopia is bypassing Xbox consoles, leaving Xbox Series X|S users to have their hearts skip a beat.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone is striking out with Heartopia. The life-sim title doesn’t have any love in its heart for Microsoft and Xbox owners right now. It follows the same sorrowful fate as PlayStation players, but let’s hope there’s a future where this can change.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Heartopia On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 owners can also get in the same loveless boat, as Heartopia isn’t on a Nintendo console either.</strong></p>



<p>Per the Heartopia Discord Server, one of its main moderators (sweetkayla_xo) <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1128257488375005215/1420319877507579988/1458417800250134569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“No – Heartopia isn’t launching on consoles yet.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s unclear how much official information they have on the game. If they do know the inner-workings of the game’s development and reach, then this is a surefire sign that Heartopia is coming to consoles; we just don’t know when.</p>



<p>Are you playing Heartopia on mobile or PC? Do you have anything to say about the poor console players who are missing out?

            <title><![CDATA[Stellar Blade 2 Location Tease Points To Post-Apocalyptic China]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-location-post-apocalyptic-china/</link>
            <guid>1410166</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Shift Up recently posted an image on social media revealing a ‘location scout’ for their ‘next title’, which is almost certainly Stellar Blade 2. The follow-up to the 2024 post-apocalyptic sultry slasher was confirmed a while back, and by now, it should be full steam ahead for Shift Up in terms of piecing it together.</p>



<p>The apocalyptic landscape shared by the team on social media is a snippet taken from Chongqing, China. This is a gargantuan, dense cityscape with a population of <span>over 32 million people, but in Stellar Blade 2, it appears&nbsp;<strong>as</strong></span><strong> a ghost city</strong>. </p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-2-promises-to-turn-heads">Stellar Blade 2 Promises to Turn Heads</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade dropped on PlayStation 5 in 2024, emerging as a game that intrigued players because, while it was marketed almost as a ‘gooner game’, it turned out to have some immensely satisfying combat mechanics and a decent story.</p>



<p>The game’s lead, Eve, wastes no time in showing as much flesh as possible, and that’s why the game perhaps didn’t get as serious a stamp of approval as it should have from some critics.</p>



<p>Regardless, it was a commercial success that was compounded by a hugely successful launch on PC a year later, and recently, the team at Shift Up revealed that <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/">another game in the series</a> is coming</strong>.</p>



<p>The recent post <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/2012973553562321375">on social media</a> shows a crumbling, abandoned landscape, which eagle-eyed fans immediately identified as being a rendition of Chongqing, China. This was confirmed by Shift Up shortly after, giving fans the impression that, whenever Stellar Blade 2 arrives, it might take inspiration from or be directly set in and around the Chinese city.</p>

<p>It’s no big secret that Chinese fans were hugely approving of the game. It was estimated that 58% of PC-related sales of Stellar Blade were <strong>from </strong>China.</p>







<p>We know nothing about Stellar Blade 2, outside of these tiny tidbits from Shift Up. The nature of the game is yet to be revealed, but it might not be too long before <strong>it is</strong>. Fans expect something to be uncovered <strong>in the coming months</strong>.</p>
