<p>Fortnite is gearing up for this weekend’s huge end-of-chapter event, bringing an end to The Simpsons mini-season with a huge battle featuring collabs from throughout Chapter 6, and it seems downtime could end sooner than expected.</p>



<p>The Zero Point event in Fortnite takes place on Saturday at 2 PM PT, with Chapter 7 expected to kick off the following day, November 30. However, it’s claimed that the start date will be earlier.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-reportedly-releasing-november-29">Fortnite Chapter 7 Reportedly Releasing November 29</h2>

<p>While the standard practice for major Fortnite updates is downtime beginning at 2 AM ET, which was expected to be the case with Chapter 7’s launch on November 30, players could be back in significantly earlier than that date.</p>



<p>Reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1993774545241858172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> states Chapter 7 will be released on November 29, “just a few hours after the live event.” While there’s no specific time mentioned, that could mean as much as 12 hours before downtime was expected to begin.</p>



<p>There are, however, some caveats to this, and even if the information is accurate, it would all depend on everything running smoothly in the deployment of Chapter 7.</p>



<p>Downtime for a new Chapter is often longer than the usual turnover for seasonal updates in Fortnite, and there’s a larger amount to deploy—including an entirely new map and POIs, NPCs, weapons, vehicles, and more.</p>



<p>That means there are even more things that could go wrong and extend downtime, and even if Epic Games were to publicly announce a release time, it would still be subject to change.</p>



<p>What is known, however, is that content creators have already gotten their hands on Chapter 7 during an early access event, with full details set to be shared ahead of the launch—which could become a standard approach for Epic Games, with a similar early access event ahead of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>

<p>There are probably a few collectors around the world who are keen to buy and own every piece of Fortnite media in existence. One of the most lucrative and desirable pieces of memorabilia is the game itself, and a physical copy of Fortnite has become the most expensive ever.</p>



<p>It’s hard to imagine there’s a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> collectible that hasn’t been manufactured. Epic Games continues to sit on one of the richest and phattest cash cows in gaming. While more unorthodox merchandise is out there, including Fortnite Crocs—because even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-special-edition-crocs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox is doing Crocs</a> now—the physical game itself in perfect condition is where it’s at.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-most-expensive-fortnite-physical-copy-has-sold">The Most Expensive Fortnite Physical Copy Has Sold</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The smell of money. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/xbox/fortnite-wata-10-a-sealed-storm-master-weapon-pack-xbox-one-gearbox-2017-usa/a/7428-28105.s?ic4=ListView-ShortDescription-071515#auction-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Heritage Auctions</a> oversaw the sale of a sealed “Fortnite – Wata 10 A++.” This means the box is in perfect condition, sealed, and has achieved the highest grade possible in terms of its quality, condition, and other factors.</p>







<p>It’s also a 2017 original physical copy, too. With all this in mind, it’s sort of no surprise to see the prized possession sell for <strong>$42,500!</strong></p>



<p>Some would argue this might be too much for a sealed video game that no one has the intention of opening. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Wow. Credit to Heritage Auctions</figcaption></figure>



<p>The beauty of Fortnite is that it’s a free-to-play digital title, so the user can still easily play Fortnite anyway, but have a desirable collectible on display to marvel at in between hard-earned dubs.</p>



<p>How much would you be prepared to pay for a collectible? Is this a great purchase given that it’s likely to appreciate more as the years go by? As usual, the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is the perfect place to tell all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New job listings have revealed that Sledgehammer Games is currently hiring developers who have past experience with the Nintendo Switch, suggesting that their next Call of Duty title could be coming to the platform.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4347622051/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> for a Senior Technical Artist was found on LinkedIn and states that someone with “AAA mobile or Switch experience” would receive “bonus XP” with their application.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-finally-heading-to-switch">Call of Duty Finally Heading to Switch</h2>



<p>For those out of the loop of Call of Duty, the series hasn’t been released on Nintendo platforms since 2013, with the last in the series on Nintendo being Call of Duty: Ghosts.</p>



<p>However, as a part of the Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was finalized in October 2023, it was ruled that Microsoft must release Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms for 10 years. At the time of writing, that agreement has not yet started as Call of Duty has remained to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>



<p>Presumably, Call of Duty hasn’t been released on Nintendo platforms due to hardware limitations, a concern raised by regulatory bodies during the proposed acquisition. However, since the Nintendo Switch 2’s release earlier this year, it has proven that it can release games of similar hardware demands, suggesting that the Switch 2 could easily run Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Whether or not Sledgehammer Games’ next title, believed to be released in 2027, will be the first in the series to release on the Nintendo Switch 2 remains to be seen, as Infinity Ward is set to release Modern Warfare 4 in 2026, set in Korea.</p>

<p>One of the biggest advertised features for Black Ops 7 multiplayer was open lobbies. For the first time in years, Treyarch was removing the SBMM shackles from Call of Duty players, offering a more open and varied matchmaking experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sbmm-cod-creator-debunk-conspiracies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skill-based matchmaking</a> is not supposed to be the main factor considered for Black Ops 7 matchmaking. The game’s open lobbies are supposed to represent this new ideology, but CoD content creator TheXclusiveAce has conducted a small test to check if everything is as transparent as it seems.</p>







<h2 id="h-sbmm-could-be-affecting-black-ops-7-lobbies-more-than-you-think">SBMM Could Be Affecting Black Ops 7 Lobbies More Than You Think</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What’s the truth? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the creator’s ‘XclusiveReloaded’ YouTube channel, they asked an important question in a new video: “Is Skill Really ‘Minimally Considered’ in Black Ops 7?”</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is supposed to favour certain conditions, such as region, proximity, and numerous other factors, before taking into account a player’s skill level—the final parameter being the heartbeat of SBMM. </p>



<p>TheXclusiveAce opened by discussing the ongoing narrative in the community that SBMM is stronger and more prevalent than advertised. Many think it’s been ramped up as of late. This is where the renowned data tracker compared some numbers.</p>







<p>“I do feel my experience has been changing as time has been going on. I have been feeling like my matchmaking times are going up, my connection quality is no longer nearly as consistent as it was early on, and as it was in the open matchmaking in the beta build of the game. On top of that, I’ve been noticing that more often than not, my lobbies are a lot more difficult than they were in the first few days.”</p>



<p>TheXclusiveAce used two accounts to test their theory: Their regular account the play the majority of Black Ops 7 on, and their bot account that’s sole purpose is for offline testing, as they constantly check weapons and attachments to find meta loadouts with it. They played at the same time of day, and kept the variables and controllable factors consistent.</p>



<p>In 10 matches, the creator used traditional Team Deathmatch matchmaking to see the results for each account. The final stats are quite interesting.</p>



<p>The main account’s 10 matches took 34 seconds on average to find a game, compared to 28 seconds on the bot account. 6 seconds isn’t the end of the world, but leans ever-so-slightly in favor of SBMM. However, the average ping was a different story.</p>



<p>The average ping for the main account was 42ms, whereas it was 25ms for the bot account. TheXclusiveAce says the best ping they can get is 20ms, and the bot account was within 5ms of this in eight matches out of 10. The main account achieved this feat <em>once</em>, with several games reaching into the high 40s and low 50s.</p>



<p>SBMM generally takes longer on average, as the system has to find players in your skill bracket, which means it might have to go further around the world to find players, which adds more time to matchmaking, and can influence ping. This data and study aren’t conclusive—due to it being such a small data sample—but the initial numbers are eyebrow-raising and only support the narrative that Black Ops 7’s SBMM might be stronger than first thought.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Latest ARC Raiders Patch Destroys One of the Most Annoying Exploits]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-patch-destroys-annoying-exploits/</link>
            <guid>1366273</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has just pushed out a small but mighty update for ARC Raiders – 1.4.0. This patch addresses some of the game’s most critical bugs and exploits, including one that has been plaguing players for the last couple of weeks.</p>



<p>It’s a graphical and quality-of-life thing more than anything else, and while no <strong>new content </strong>has been added with the 1.4.0 update, the improvements included in the change are being welcomed with open arms by players.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-more-locked-door-exploits-in-arc-raiders">No More Locked Door Exploits in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>The full list of content and bug fixes included in the ARC Raiders 1.4.0 update is being appreciated by fans of the ambitious extraction adventure:</p>



<ul>
<li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.</li>



<li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick-use item and back.</li>



<li>The exterior access to Spaceport’s Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low-resolution textures in the Main Menu.</li>



<li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.</li>



<li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.</li>



<li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.</li>
</ul>



<p>The locked door exploits were a huge bugbear for players legitimately using keys (which are often single-use) to enter high-tier areas, only to find that somebody had already scooped loot from the room without needing to bring in the key at all, some of which are drastically rare.</p>



<p>With this update, players attempting to access locked rooms without keys will now be incinerated. That’s right, <em>burned to death</em>.</p>



<p>The other bug (read: exploit) that was disturbing users everywhere was the ‘double pump’ gun exploit that allowed users to swap to a quick-use item and back again, flicking between two shotguns to produce an alarming rate of fire and damage output.</p>



<p>It was seen being used even by the game’s most prominent streamers, and it made close-quarters PvP almost unwinnable.</p>



<p>That has also been addressed by this small patch, which is available to download and install <strong>right now</strong> on all platforms.</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced plans to acquire Bandai Namco’s Studio in Singapore, where they already have an existing relationship due to contributions in developing the likes of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco Studio Singapore, which was established in 2013, has worked on the likes of Ace Combat 7 and Splatoon 3, and will now be brought under the Nintendo umbrella.</p>







<h2 id="h-bandai-namco-studios-singapore-to-become-nintendo-studios-singapore">Bandai Namco Studios Singapore to Become Nintendo Studios Singapore</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Partnership. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo announced</a> that, subject to approval, an acquisition of 80% of the studio’s shares will be acquired on April 1, 2026, with the remaining shares being acquired “after a certain period.”</p>



<p>Nintendo will rename the studio Nintendo Studios Singapore, which will become a subsidiary of Nintendo, but the studio will “continue its development operations.”</p>



<p>The Singapore studio is likely to become a support studio for Nintendo, continuing in a similar role that it has operated in for the past decade, with Nintendo stating it has “strong expertise in creating in-game art assets.” Nintendo adds that the acquisition “will have only a minor effect on Nintendo’s results for this fiscal year.”</p>



<p>Nintendo’s ongoing business relationship with the Singapore studio should lead to an easy transition, with the studio already familiar to the working processes given their involvement in the development of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>The ongoing expansion of Nintendo is already set to bring more of its famous IPs to life in the movie scene, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-movie-franchises-mario-zelda-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo involved in multiple projects</a> set for release after The Legend of Zelda in 2027.</p>
