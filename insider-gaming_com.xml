<p>Palworld’s update version v0.4.14 is live now, bringing new Spring Festivals skins, specific adjustments, balancing changes and bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld has introduced 5 new Spring Festival Skins in this update, each featuring unique elements reminiscent of the Chinese New Year. However, players should have the corresponding Pals to equip the skins. The new collection includes Lucky Cattiva, Fortune-Bringer Lyleen, Fortune-Bringer Lyleen Noct, Lion-Dancer Chillet and Lion-Dancer Chillet Ignis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the new skins, Palworld has introduced some specific adjustments that change Pals’ behaviours and add new elements to some world regions. After the latest adjustments, Pals will attack the nearest enemy after being summoned. The behaviour of large pals at bases has been made the same as that of small pals to allow them to pass through narrow areas. Lastly, earth and water elements were added in various places.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding balancing, Palworld has adjusted rewards, expanded the range of area near the reticle, and made some enhancements to crude oil production, along with other changes. In terms of bug fixes, a game-crashing bug was fixed. Also, some issues with UIs, treasure chests, PS5s and more have been resolved.

<p>The director of Assassin’s Creed Shadows has revealed that the game was delayed a second time due to ‘polishing’ and ‘complex roofs.’</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is finally set to arrive on March 20, 2025, and now we know why the game was delayed a second time. During a conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-says-recent-delay-was-to-polish-parkour-especially-on-super-complex-roofs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Charles Benoit, AC Shadows’ Game Director, revealed that the month-long delay was “mostly about polishing,” “a couple of things in progression” to make the game more engaging and balanced, and Japan’s “super complex” roofs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game director explained that Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ roofs and other Japanese architecture might be the “most complex thing” he has worked on compared to AC Odyssey and Syndicate. The developers had to work on “specific codes and specific animations” to make the parkour transition for these areas more fluid. The roofs and parkour around Japanese Architecture were feedback they wanted to address, and they believe that they have “improved since the last few months.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was initially scheduled to be released in November 2024, but two delays pushed the release to February 2025 and the second to March 2025. Players hope this month-long extension will end up being the final obstacle in the game’s release. </p>
