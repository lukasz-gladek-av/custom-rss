<p>Battlefield’s Factions determine which regions fight each other in matches. The concept has been around for decades, and Battlefield 6, which may release in 2025, will again feature waging Factions.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> could be pivotal for both EA and the storied shooter franchise. Recent Battlefield games haven’t fared too well. Battlefield 1 was solid, whereas Battlefield 5 focused too much on what fans didn’t ask for. On the other hand, Battlefield 2042 was the series’ comparison to jumping the shark.</p>



<p>2025 aims to bring Battlefield 6 and make it one of the best. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> Factions have been the topic of conversation, so let’s dig into the latest details.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-factions-confirmed-so-far">Battlefield 6 Factions Confirmed so far</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you fight? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6’s 2025 pre-Alpha footage has shown NATO and what looks to be a PMC outfit called Pax Armata</strong> <strong>as the main opposing Factions.</strong></p>



<p>There are a few things to consider with Battlefield 6’s Factions so far. Firstly, this is a pre-Alpha, and it’s <strong>likely EA is using a ton of placeholders and unofficial names</strong> for now. The focus is on the gameplay, network connectivity, and overall game stability.</p>



<p>Given recent criticism of the franchise, it’s understandable if the multiple developers aren’t as bothered about the names of the game’s Factions for now. Secondly, don’t be surprised if EA does end up sticking with more generic Factions such as NATO and either an unnamed PMC (Private Military Company), or the generic use of “PMC” instead.</p>



<p>Real-life global tensions mean these decisions can’t be taken lightly. Battlefield 2042 did use “Russian Army,” “United States Marine Corps,” and “British Army,” but times change. So don’t be surprised to see Battlefield 6 adopt safe Faction names.</p>



<p>Even if Battlefield runs with NATO, you likely won’t be stuck with the same few default selections. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j6wy6t/thats_a_union_flag_right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Reddit post</a> has identified a Union Flag on a soldier’s uniform using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 leaks</a>. This means there’s potential wiggle room for customization options. The OP for the post said: “I’m hoping Dice is brave and gives us some clear depictions of Russian, Chinese &amp; Iranian uniforms for the opfor Faction.”</p>



<p>Again, real-world scenarios and events have a bearing on how Battlefield 6’s final content looks. We’ll have to see how close EA and DICE push the boundaries.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re still not 100% sure when Battlefield 6 is set to launch, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA has claimed it will be before April 2026</a>. We’re still not ruling out a 2025 launch either. </p>



<p>What do you think of Battlefield Labs so far? Does the game look promising? Are we finally due a brilliant Battlefield game?</p>

<p>ESRB has rated Indiana Jones and The Great Circle for the PS5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/wario64/status/1899020272331575558?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>, if you search for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on ESRB’s <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40439/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will find two search results now, one for Windows PC and Xbox Series and one for the PS5. The game has been rated ‘T’ (Teen) with “Blood and Gore, Drug Reference, Mild Language, Violence” highlighted on the listing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in August last year that the game would arrive on the platform in Spring 2025. However, an ESRB rating for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the PS5 hints that things are well in motion and an official release date announcement could be around the corner. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The ESRB rating summary describes the game as a first-person action adventure in which players uncover mysteries, solve puzzles, and defeat villains. The game includes different types of combat, such as hand-to-hand, stealth, whip use, and ranged combat with the help of machine guns and rifles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The summary also highlights some of the game’s sequences that aren’t for all audiences, such as a scene with a severed arm and another with a corpse impaled with a spike trap. It also mentions certain drug references and curse words that were heard in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, more Indiana Jones games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-indiana-jones-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are reportedly in development</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-brings-a-%E2%80%98spitting-image-of-solid-snake%E2%80%99-to-death-stranding-2.1129707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed that Death Stranding 2 will be released worldwide on June 26. Alongside the reveal, Hideo Kojima’s team at Kojima Productions released a new trailer to showcase the ambitious (and somewhat confusing) sequel to the 2019 epic that sold almost 20 million copies. The trailer, which was bursting with cinematic quality, boasted a runtime of a whopping 10 minutes.</p>



<p>In the trailer, we get a look at Neil, a mysterious character played by Luca Marinelli. If you get Solid Snake vibes from his character’s reveal, that’s because it’s almost by design.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-solid-stranding">Solid Stranding</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMIVpVnef5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an Instagram post</a> from 2020, Hideo Kojima noted that Luca Marinelli had ‘caught his eye’. He remarked that the actor would be the ‘spitting image of Solid Snake’ if he put on a bandana, and lo and behold, he does just that in the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2 all these years later.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH | Pre-Order Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdzIwQhYABQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Luca Marinelli’s reveal in the Death Stranding 2 trailer could be pulled straight out of a Metal Gear remake – but the similarities to franchise that arguably made Kojima more than two decades ago don’t end there.</p>



<p>Further in the trailer, we get our first look at ‘Magellan Man’, a hulking construct that could be an alternate rendition of a Metal Gear weapon.</p>



<p>We don’t see much of Luca’s character in the Death Stranding 2 trailer, but like everything else featured, it’s more than enough to get the hype train stoked a little further. This is easily one of the most highly anticipated releases of 2025, and it promises to be a cinematic showstopper.</p>



<p>In tandem with the development of Death Stranding 2, Hideo Kojima is working with A24 to produce a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-adaptations-kojima-confirm/">Death Stranding movie</a>, as if the man wasn’t doing enough with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OD</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-physint-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physint</a>.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has been a long time coming – are you excited about the impending release? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/motive%E2%80%99s-iron-man-game-might-be-demo-ready-at-gdc.1129704/</guid>

<p>In just a few days, GDC will take place in San Francisco (and <strong>Insider Gaming </strong>will be in attendance!). It’s a proving ground for countless developers and publishers to show off what they’re working on, as well as for manufacturers to reveal the latest and greatest in gaming technology.</p>



<p>One topic that has surfaced recently concerns EA Motive’s Iron Man game, which has been kept mostly under wraps since it was revealed more than two years ago. In a recent schedule post, it was revealed that Motive will be presenting <strong>something </strong>to do with Iron Man at GDC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-stark">Becoming Stark</h2>



<p>Almost nothing is known about the Iron Man game being pieced together by Motive, but there are high hopes that it’ll deliver nicely on expectations. Fans are wishing for an open-ended game with full suit customisation that allows them to immerse themselves in the role of Tony Stark.</p>



<p>In September 2022, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motive-studios-officially-announces-new-iron-man-game/">revealed that Motive</a> is working on the game, as well as contributing to the ongoing development of the next Battlefield title. Historically, Motive has contributed to the Dead Space Remake, Star Wars Squadrons, and Battlefront II.</p>



<p>On the Iron Man front, all we know right now is that it’s a single-player, third-person action title. Shortly after the game was announced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motives-iron-man-game-already-starts-playtesting/">we covered the playtests</a> that were going on behind closed doors, and since then, production has kicked off in earnest, so it must be in a much better state by now.</p>



<p>Recently, eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j7gl6h/motive_may_show_off_iron_man_game_at_gdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit users</a> discovered an Advanced Graphics Summit segment <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/advanced-graphics-summit-revolutionizing-texture-pipelines-eas-journey-with-texture-sets/909461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taking place at GDC on March 17</a>. The session is being led by a technical artist from Electronic Arts, and the content is set to be focused on the development of texture sets for Dead Space and Iron Man at Motive. </p>



<p>The belief is that Motive will be showing off at least <strong>something </strong>from Iron Man during this segment, which would represent our first look at the game since it was announced in 2022. Even if the technical demo provides little more than <strong>a look </strong>at Iron Man’s suit, fans will be satisfied.</p>



<p>As you need certain credentials to access the tech summit hosted by EA at GDC, it’s highly unlikely that anything will be released publicly around this time, but you never know. It’s also entirely possible that we’ll see some kind of demo or trailer revealed during the Epic Unreal showcase at GDC, given that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-iron-man-game-to-use-unreal-engine-5/">Iron Man is being built in UE5</a>.</p>



<p>What hopes do you have for Motive’s Iron Man? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-insider-claims.1129701/</guid>

<p>Recently, rumours started circulating that developers are starting to prepare games for the ‘next Xbox’. The focus title of these rumours was Call of Duty 2026 – it was claimed that it’d be released on whatever hardware the tech titan produces next, but a recent insider has suggested that might not be the case and that the next Xbox device will likely arrive in 2027 <strong>and not </strong>2026.</p>



<p>It was also suggested that the next Xbox won’t be a console at all, but more of a gaming PC with defined hardware that developers can better work with.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-consoles-for-xbox">The End of Consoles for Xbox</h2>



<p>For a while, Xbox has been teetering on a precipice. The brand has well and truly lost this generation of home consoles to the PlayStation 5, and the Xbox One generation should be forgotten about entirely at this point. Recently, a marketing campaign from Xbox proved that ‘everything is an Xbox’ and that you don’t even need a console anymore to be an Xbox-based gamer.</p>



<p>A former Xbox executive even went on record suggesting that Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-consoles-microsoft-would-not-make-choice/">would stop making hardware</a> right now if it had the choice.</p>



<p>In a segment on the most recent episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAOt7CKUEFY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Xbox Two podcast</a>, Jez Corden, an insider with a solid track record, mentioned that something drastic might be on the horizon.</p>



<p>Instead of creating a full-fledged Xbox console for a 2027 release, he said that Microsoft will instead produce ‘a PC in essence but with a TV-friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind.’</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Developers will be building for a Windows PC in a way but in such a way that they know exactly what the specs will be, so they can optimise exactly for it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Corden also leaned towards writing off the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/">Call of Duty 2026 rumours</a>, explaining, <em>‘the devkit talk is more about what kind of specs they’ve been told to target for the next Xbox. I’m pretty sure the new hardware is not 2026; it’s 2027.’</em></p>



<p>The general assumption now is that the next Xbox will be a micro-form Windows-powered PC in a ‘console-like’ shell and chassis that can sit nicely under a television. </p>



<p>It’ll be compatible with all manner of peripherals and inputs, and it’ll likely have a ‘switchable mode’ that ports between a gaming interface and a general Windows layout, so you can treat it like a desktop PC as much as you would a home gaming console. </p>



<p>What do you think about these predictions? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-lost-15-maps-back-to-back/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>OpTic Texas has found itself in a sticky spot since 2025 kicked off. The team’s last win in a qualifying stage was at the end of January, and at the Major in Madrid, the team crashed out after winning just one series in the lower bracket. The squad is on a historic losing streak, losing 15 maps in sequence and sitting one from the bottom in the CDL stage standings.</p>



<p>The team is drawing a 50-50 win-loss record right now in the overall season standings, but one more loss will push them into negative ground and could move them further down the leaderboard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-texas-in-turmoil">Texas in Turmoil</h2>



<p>The impact of the losing streak has been visible on the faces of the OpTic Texas crew in recent weeks. They’re looking sullen and extinguished on their camera feeds, and the energy that usually drives them is sorely lacking.</p>



<p>Recently, the organisation’s owner, Hector ‘H3CZ’ Rodriguez, made a controversial statement on stream, dubbing the squad the worst OpTic team ever. This losing streak is indeed like nothing we’ve ever seen for the organisation.</p>



<p>This stage alone, OpTic Texas has lost with an 0 – 3 scoreline against:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>
</ul>



<p>The running joke now is that even the Vegas Falcons, a team that has lost two dozen Hardpoint rounds since the season started and sits on a record of 0 – 16 overall has put up a better fight this stage.</p>











<p>OpTic’s most recent loss came at the hands of Toronto Ultra, which laid the utter smackdown against the team from Texas. In this series, JoeDecieves (ULT) set a new KD record at 2.05, helped by going double positive in the opening Hardpoint.</p>



<p>It was a crushing blow for Texas through and through, and the closing round of Control was a 3 – 0 masterclass from Ultra. Ironically, this is OpTic Texas’ Major event. The upcoming LAN tournament will be played at the arena in which they won their CDL Championship last year, and they’re entering the running in the worst position possible.</p>



<p>On social platforms everywhere, fans of the OpTic franchise are writhing and desperately figuring out a plan to right the ship. The consensus is that a major roster change is needed, but nobody seems to know who is at fault. The finger pointing is generally levelled at Kenny, and one of the most common claims is that Huke never should have been pushed back out for the return of Pred.</p>



<p>What do you think needs to be done for OpTic Texas to win a series? Let me know in the comments.</p>
