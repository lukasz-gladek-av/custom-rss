<p>Embark Studios has revealed its plans for the future of ARC Raiders, and it looks like content will be dropping thick and fast. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The roadmap</a> details plans up until April 2026, but the first batch of updates falls under a mysterious title—Headwinds.</p>



<p>Substantial updates are what keep live-service titles like ARC Raiders alive and fresh, and the rust-belt has been pretty barren since Cold Snap ended. Well, new content is just around the corner, as Headwinds is set to soar into the game pretty soon.</p>







<p>Here’s when you can expect Headwinds to arrive in ARC Raiders, as well as what content has been confirmed for the update. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-headwinds-release-in-arc-raiders">When Does ‘Headwinds’ Release In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s looming on the horizon. Image by Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Headwinds update has been confirmed by Embark Studios to arrive in ARC Raiders on January 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>When the roadmap was initially revealed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-arc-raiders-february-2026-content-map-update-raider-deck-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, it was fairly surprising to see a slate of content listed to arrive in January, as the month was practically over. However, Embark Studios clearly didn’t plan to partake in dry January, as new content is just around the corner. </p>



<p>Headwinds is expected to launch at the usual update times for ARC Raiders, but if you’re unfamiliar with those, Insider Gaming has them listed down below:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Headwinds Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PST)</td><td data-align="center">1:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">3:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (EST)</td><td data-align="center">4:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">8:30 PM—January 27</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-headwinds-confirmed-content-for-arc-raiders">All ‘Headwinds’ Confirmed Content For ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roll on April. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As announced within the roadmap, three new pieces of content can be expected to drop with the Headwinds update for ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>These are the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>New Matchmaking Option Level 40+</li>



<li>New Minor Map Condition</li>



<li>New Player Project</li>
</ul>



<p>As things stand, further details are scarce. The Player Project is bound to be another five-stage project filled with items you’ll need to submit in return for rewards, but the new Minor Map Condition and Matchmaking Option remain a mystery.</p>







<p>Early player theories are that the new Map Condition will be a sandstorm, as alluded to by the background image in the roadmap, as well as the Headwinds title. If this were the case, then the likelihood is that it’ll be exclusive to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-find-guitars-shakers-in-arc-raiders-buried-city-easter-egg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buried City</a>, and maybe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hidden-bunker-arc-raiders-how-to-open-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spaceport</a>, as a sandstorm sweeping through The Blue Gate might be a bit far-fetched. </p>



<p>As for the new Matchmaking Option, it’s interesting that they highlight it’s for Level 40+ players. It might be in an effort to circumvent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-will-implement-significant-changes-to-crack-down-on-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheaters</a>—who primarily use new, low-level accounts—from ruining the match experience for high-level players with valuable gear.</p>



<p>Should more information be announced before the Headwinds update, Insider Gaming will be sure to update this article with the latest details. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Code Vein 2 On Xbox Game Pass? Code Vein 2 Game Pass Status, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>1415977</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass keeps receiving new games. With increased Game Pass costs, it begs the question of whether Code Vein 2 is coming to Xbox Game Pass to justify the cost, and if not, if it will ever happen.</p>



<p>Soulslike fans should be in for a good time with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein 2</a>. There was plenty to enjoy from the genre in 2025 with Nightreign, The&nbsp;First&nbsp;Berserker:&nbsp;Khazan, and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Code Vein 2 is the first real Soulslike contender of 2026, and if it’s on Game Pass, it’s a win-win.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-code-vein-2-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Code Vein 2 On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An unsuccessful ride. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Xbox Game Pass isn’t adding Code Vein 2 as a launch-day game, meaning all players need to buy the game outright to own it and play.</strong></p>



<p>The pro of Xbox Game Pass is that you get a <em>lot</em> of free titles as part of your subscription. The bad news is that you only get a select variety of games. Also, even if you have the more expensive Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier, your day-one release entitlement is limited, and it depends on any agreements between Microsoft and other publishers.</p>



<p>A quick check of the Xbox store shows that under Code Vein 2’s listing, there is nothing about Xbox Game Pass. There’s no Game Pass icon or mention, nor has it been referenced in any Code Vein 2 trailers. It hasn’t been outed by Bandai Namco, nor Microsoft or Xbox, so we can safely assume that it’s not on Xbox Game Pass, and it probably won’t be in the foreseeable future.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-code-vein-2-ever-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Code Vein 2 Ever Come To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>This one has to be filed under ‘Unlikely,’ as the first Code Vein hasn’t even debuted on Xbox Game Pass at any point.</strong></p>



<p>Any sort of a sequel is great as it gives plenty of background data on previous entries in a series, and if they’ve ever been on Xbox Game Pass. The original Code Vein doesn’t appear to have been on Game Pass (but we’ll update this if it’s incorrect), making the case for Code Vein 2 on XGP quite bleak.</p>



<p>Like Code Vein 2 itself, it’s not impossible, and a Game Pass addition could be doable in the future. Stay tuned for further updates.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/</link>
            <guid>1415941</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new mention of Starfield 2.0 is leading fans to believe the update is real; however, there’s still no word on when it might be released. </p>



<p>We have heard about Starfield getting a new update and a DLC several times back in 2025, without a concrete release date. We have seen Bethesda mention it for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third time</a> some months ago, and we also saw a tease with the words ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ in an anniversary post; however, no concrete details have been shared. </p>







<h2 id="h-bethesda-is-handling-starfield-2-0-in-a-weird-way">Bethesda is Handling Starfield 2.0 in a ‘Weird’ Way</h2>



<p>The latest mention of Starfield 2.0 comes from the popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXqlxb0a6xk&amp;t=8136s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defining Duke Podcast</a>, with co-host MrMattyPlays, who claims he saw it behind closed doors. When talking about Starfield 2.0’s upcoming update with guest Gene Part, Matty started by saying, “The way Bethesda is handling 2.0 (Starfield 2.0) is weird.” </p>



<p>Matty confirmed that he saw it “behind closed doors”, but he can’t say anything else other than the fact that he saw it. He also confirmed that he wasn’t provided a release window. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-starfield-2-0">What to Expect from Starfield 2.0?</h2>



<p>Though no concrete details have been revealed about Starfield 2.0, some information has been shared in a previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>. It seems the game’s spaceflight mechanics will step away from loading screens for “more free-form and continuous” traversal, and the Creation System has also been enhanced for better spaceflight and future-proofed for upcoming titles. </p>



<p>Additionally, the Starfield 2.0 update will bring the long-anticipated PS5 and Switch 2 ports, with the developers optimising the title for “low power” devices like handhelds. Some sources have also shared that it won’t be on par with Cyberpunk 2.0. However, readers should treat this info with caution as it hasn’t been officially confirmed. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-all-kennys-quests-explained/</link>
            <guid>1415938</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite’s collab with South Park continues, with the stars of the show dishing out a bunch of tasks to tick off to earn rewards, but understanding Kenny’s quests is a tough task.</p>



<p>There are no direct instructions to complete Kenny’s quests in Fortnite, so you will be shooting in the dark unless you know exactly what is being asked of you.</p>



<p>To make the task much easier, Insider Gaming has all the details on exactly what you need to do to work your way through Kenny’s tasks in Fortnite before they expire.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-kenny-quests">All Fortnite Kenny Quests</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tick them off. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kenny’s quests in Fortnite shouldn’t take too much difficulty to complete, once you know what they are, as they can mostly be ticked off by general gameplay.</strong></p>



<p>The tricky aspect comes from the fact that you need a translator to understand what Kenny is tasking you to do as, just like in South Park itself, it’s difficult to understand exactly what he is saying.</p>



<p>Like the other South Park quests, completing these tasks provides CRED and Memberberries to advance the Born in Chaos mini pass. However, they won’t appear or be completable until you complete four of the Cartman quests. If you haven’t completed the stages before that, there’s a fair bit of grinding ahead of you.</p>



<p>A full list of the quests is shown in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Fortnite Kenny Quest</th><th data-align="center">How to Complete</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpphmmph</td><td data-align="center">Visit the zipline tower in Battlewood Boulevard</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mmmmpmpph mmhhmph</td><td data-align="center">Get Eliminated</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpmphh mmmph</td><td data-align="center">Get revived by teammeates three times</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mphmmph mhhmmph</td><td data-align="center">Get 10 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mmmh mpphh mmmph</td><td data-align="center">Travel 200m in the air</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpph mhppmmph</td><td data-align="center">Hire a Specialist</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-when-do-kenny-s-quests-in-fortnite-expire">When do Kenny’s Quests in Fortnite expire?</h2>



<p><strong>Kenny’s quests will remain available in Fortnite until the end of the South Park collab on February 6.</strong></p>



<p>That gives players plenty of time to tick off all of the tasks and claim all of the rewards before they disappear, though, if you do miss out, the items could return to the Item Shop in the future.</p>



<p>Kenny’s quests are not the final batch coming to Fortnite before the end of the collab, either, as Part 6 will arrive on January 29, providing more tasks to complete.</p>

<p>Your Code Vein 2 efforts will be in vain without knowing the Code Vein 2 trophy list. Imagine getting all the way through the game and not knowing a crucial piece of information or encountering a missable trophy? The game’s trophies and achievements will test you.</p>



<p>Finishing a Soulslike deserves a physical trophy in itself. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein 2</a> isn’t going to be easy, and anyone could tell you that, judging from the first game and what was shown before launch. In addition to the relentless difficulty and dastardly obstacles Bandai throws at you, there are plenty of extra things to do through trophies and achievements.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Nothing to worry about, right? Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can find 36 trophies and achievements to earn throughout your Code Vein 2 journey, with Xbox owners only getting 35, due to the PlayStation’s Platinum Trophy counting as extra.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not an exhausting amount from the outside. However, the reality is that bosses, exploration, and upgrading abilities and items to the maximum is going to take time. Make sure you’ve got plenty of free time for this one!</p>

<p>A new announcement for the devs has revealed that Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition has been delayed indefinitely, with no new release date announced. </p>



<p>Back in September 2025, Koei Temco surprised fans with an announcement trailer revealing the return of a beloved 2001 title: Dynasty Warriors 3. The Remastered edition is recreated in Unreal Engine 5, with striking new visuals and other significant upgrades. However, it seems that the developers will need more time to bring it to the level the fans deserve. </p>

<p>A new <a href="https://x.com/KoeiTecmoUS/status/2015726489149276652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) from the official Koei Tecmo America account announces the delay of Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition. It was earlier scheduled to arrive on March 19, 2026, and now a new release date will be announced at a later date. The producer of the upcoming title has revealed that, as this is the first remaster of the series, they would like more time to “fully satisfy” the fans and “improve the quality of the game”. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered includes the original game and the Xtreme Legends expansion. The upcoming title will feature a cast of more than 40 officers, with iconic 1 vs 1,000 action sequences all redone for modern systems. Additionally, the Xtreme Legends comes with new stories, bodyguard customization, new weapons, and four types of challenge modes. Check out the announcement trailer below: </p>
