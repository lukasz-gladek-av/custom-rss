            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/united-videogame-workers-union-official-launches-in-north-america/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>United Videogame Workers (UVW), in conjunction with the Communication Works of America (CWA) and the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) have announced the first ever industry-wide, direct-join union in North America. The UVW-CWA Local 9433 was revealed during Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2025 in San Francisco, California.</p>



<p>As a direct-join union, anyone working in the video game industry in both the United States and Canada can join. That includes artists, developers, QA tester, and more whether they are freelance or full time. It also doesn’t matter how many people from their specific company have joined.  </p>



<p>“The creation of this union was not done in isolation; it’s a cumulative effort by the thousands of video game workers who have been fighting for years to redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power in one of the largest and highest-grossing industries on the globe,”&nbsp;said CWA’s Senior Director of Organizing Tom Smith <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-launch-industry-wide-union-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via press release</a>. “These workers are taking a bold stand, joining together to build power for the workers behind the games we all know and love.”</p>



<p>CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. added: “As video game studios have consolidated, the workers whose creativity, dedication, and skill bring the games to life have become more an afterthought. They are subject to endless cycles of layoffs and rehiring as corporate executives pursue short-term profits at the expense of a sustainable future.”</p>



<p>The press release adds that as part of the union’s launch, its members will be running a petition “demanding dignity and job security for all video game workers, particularly those facing layoffs.” They will also have a large presence around GDC 2025, including panels and other events.</p>



<p>The unions mission statement reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Our mission is to take back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs; to empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers laboring invisibly to keep this industry afloat</em>. <em>We are going to create a game industry that works for us, one that nourishes its talent and invests in its future, rather than constantly seeking short-term profits. We are the ones that make the games, so we must be the ones that set the terms of how we work.</em></p>




</blockquote>



<p>As of publishing, there have been a <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">known 1,493 jobs lost</a> due to layoffs in 2025 across 47 companies. This comes after an estimated 16,000 people lost their jobs in 2024.</p>

<p>The Boys’ collaborations in the gaming world are popping up left, right, and centre, with the latest one being with Rainbow 6 Siege.</p>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-6-siege-the-boys-bundles">Rainbow 6 Siege The Boys Bundles</h2>



<p>The collaboration between The Boys and Rainbow 6 Siege introduces new bundles to the game, which include Operator skins, weapon skins and charms. The first bundle is called the Ace Homelander Bundle, and it turns the Operator into one of the main antagonists from The Boys, with his themed weapon skin and charm. Similarly, the other bundle sees the Operator, Deimos, put on the Black Noir outfit, along with his special weapon skin and charm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rainbow 6 Siege is not the first game to collaborate with The Boys.

<p>Krafton is publishing Inzoi and feels strongly about the game’s attempt at the life-sim genre. This isn’t a case of art imitating life as Inzoi almost looks like life itself, and its system requirements on PC might make your eyes water.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-simulator-inzoi-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> looks to follow in the steps of other life-sim hits such as The Sims, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. It allows you to escape the rigors of everyday life to create the ultimate, perfect society in virtual form. Inzoi looks to incorporate all aspects of life and roll them into one streamlined experience.</p>



<p>Developer Inzoi Studio’s creation was birthed several years ago, and it’s nearly time to be born.</p>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-minimum-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi Minimum Requirements on PC</h2>

<p>The Inzoi minimum requirements let us play Inzoi—and that’s good enough for many. It sucks to miss out on a game for technical reasons, so at the very least we want to hit the minimum requirements.</p>



<p>Check out the complete list of minimum PC specs below, which is provided on the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2456740/view/518581441632667234?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Minimum PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 5 3600 / Intel i5 10400</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT (6G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 2060 (6G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">12 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 40 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-medium-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi Medium Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>In between the minimum and recommended requirements are Medium settings. This is for those with better hardware than the bare minimum, but still falling short of optimal performance.</p>



<p>Here’s every Medium requirement for Inzoi. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Medium PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Medium Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D / Intel i7 11700</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 6600 (8G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 3060 (8G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 50 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-recommended-requirements-on-pc-0">Inzoi Recommended Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>We’re moving up to the upper tiers of requirements now. The recommended PC specs are quite powerful compared to most, but if you can meet most (if not all) of these requirements, Inzoi will look very fine.</p>



<p>Check each of these values carefully.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Recommended PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Recommended Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D / Intel i7 12700K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT (16G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 3070 (8G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 60 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-high-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi High Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>The High requirements—otherwise known as the best specs—are reserved for mighty rigs and heavyweight computers comprised of thousands of dollars worth of parts. A lot of top-end gear is required to meet the High requirements.</p>



<p>However, this is how to enjoy peak Inzoi performance and bring the game to life.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi High PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi High Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D / Intel i7 14700K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX (24G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 4080 (16G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">32 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 75 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Fallout 76’s Ghoul Within update is live and allows players to transform into a ghoul.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-transform-into-a-ghoul-in-fallout-76">How to Transform into a Ghoul in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>After being updated to version 1.7.18.22, players can turn into a Ghoul, but they will have to go through a quest to do so. The quest in question is called “Leap of Faith”, which takes players into a new section of the Savage Divide. Here, players will find new characters who will help them transform. Completing the questline will allow players to fully transform into a ghoul and use abilities like Glow and Feral. They will also have access to 30 new Ghoul-exclusive <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/24uIqswESsK1aunG5a2oyS/fallout-76-ghoul-within-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">perks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players need to be at level 50 to undergo this transformation, and after becoming a Ghoul in Fallout 76, they need to watch out for some things. Factions like Brotherhood of Steel and others will be hostile towards Ghouls, so players will have to disguise themselves with new costumes that they receive from Jaye, a new NPC. This disguise will allow players to interact with blocked content they may find when playing a Ghoul.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, your transformation into a Ghoul in Fallout 76 is not final, and players can become Human again. To do so, you must return to the character selection screen. However, once you become a human, you cannot transform into a Ghoul again, as the questline for the Leap of Faith cannot be replayed. If you still wish to return to the Ghoul life, you can purchase a Ghoul Retransformation from the character screen for 1,000 Atoms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Palworld’s highly anticipated cross-play update is now live, adding additional features, adjustments and other changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After today’s update, Palworld players can play with friends across any platform, thanks to the new cross-play feature. The Global Palbox has also been added, allowing the storage of Pal data and the transfer of Pals between worlds. A new storage system called Dimensional Pal Storage provides players with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox. Guild members can access this box, which can also be used as personal storage.</p>



<p>Apart from cross-play and world transfer for Pals, Palworld has some cosmetic and photo mode changes for the game in the new update. The new cosmetic armour system is essentially a transmog system, allowing players to equip armour cosmetically at the Antique Dresser without affecting any stats. Moreover, the photo mode is now accessible through the Pal Command Wheel, and players can combine low-rarity blueprints to make high-rarity ones. Lastly, Mac has dedicated servers now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, Palworld has made specific adjustments, like connecting pieces of a roof or foundation, which will automatically align, and players can now sit on chairs and cushions. There are some balance adjustments, like summoned raid bosses cannot damage other bases and adjustments to the NPC rewards. Players interested in these adjustments, the new UI changes, and bug fixes can check out the full <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1902195801461514742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patch notes here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pocketpair also confirmed that dedicated servers for the PS5 version of Palworld are currently unavailable. The devs are working towards adding support and releasing this feature in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘came as a shock’</a> to the devs. Also, Pocketpair publishing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has warned players</a> not to expect more Palworld.
