<p>Screenshots of the cancelled God of War multiplayer game have surfaced online. The Bluepoint-led project, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was shelved</a> alongside a Blur Studio game, was never confirmed, but known to be worked on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s been revealed that <strong>screenshots from a in-progress build</strong> of the title have emerged online. Even more so, it confirms that the God of War project would have returned to an early time: during the original trilogy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-multiplayer-game-would-ve-returned-to-greece-screenshots-reveal">God of War Multiplayer Game Would’ve Returned to Greece, Screenshots Reveal</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mp1st has been a very reliable source of information for quite some time. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-cancelled-everwild-screenshots-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a>, they’ve been quite accurate with their reports. Now, the outlet has <strong>found screenshots of the cancelled God of War multiplayer title</strong>.</p>



<p>Its source has provided them with a ton of screenshots, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-first-look-at-cancelled-god-of-war-multiplayer-game-unveiled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available here</a>, and provide some interesting insight. It’s important to note that, while it may be true, take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most notable detail in the screenshot is that <strong>it would have taken place in Greece</strong>. The God of War series hasn’t been back to the setting since God of War: Ascension in 2013. Even more so, mp1st’s source told them that Hades would’ve been involved in some way. This means that the game would’ve taken place prior to his grotesque demise in God of War 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is the only information we have at the moment. As the project wasn’t officially confirmed, details, like gameplay and such, will likely be as hard to find as Pandora’s Box. Still, it’s interesting to see what the vision Bluepoint was going for with the live-service project. The future of God of War is a bit uncertain, but, with reports of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-filming-march-2026-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon TV show</a> starting up next year and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2.5D game</a>, it won’t be long before Kratos (or his brother) picks up those blades once again.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-minecraft-movie-launches-%E2%80%9Cfor-your-consideration%E2%80%9D-awards-campaign.1335250/</guid>

<p>A Minecraft Movie is officially launching an awards campaign for consideration for upcoming ceremonies like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. Yes, you read that right, and yes, it is official from Warner Bros. itself.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, A Minecraft Movie brought the blocky world of Minecraft to live-action and the results were rather decent. However, the real success came from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its large box office</a>, which came as a result of successful marketing and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internet memes</a>. Now, there is now a chance we could hear “Steve’s Lava Chicken” sung on the Oscars stage or Jack Black thank ‘Chicken Jockey’ at his Golden Globes acceptance speech.</p>

<p>Warner Bros. has launched campaigns for many of its films to be considered for end-of-year awards like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. While some films, like the smash-hits Weapons, One Battle After Another, and Sinners, are among the names, one is a bit out-there: <a href="https://www.wbawards.com/screenings/film/?film=aminecraftmovie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Minecraft Movie</a>. It’s not out there for movies, even okay ones, to do award campaigns, as it could snag some nominations if it’s lucky. However, Warner Bros. is putting everything up for the film, including it’s main cast and director.</p>



<p>The full list of contested categories can be <a href="https://www.wbawards.com/screenings/film/?film=aminecraftmovie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found here</a>. Notable ones include Best Picture, Jared Hess for Best Director, and Jack Black for Best Actor. Will it get any of those? Seeing how the race is, definitely not. However, personally, it does have a shot at Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Production Design, and Best Visual Effects. Depending on how some future movies do, you could even put “I Feel Alive” up there for Best Original Song. </p>



<p>While a weird campaign, it’s not surprising for Warner Bros. to do so. As mentioned before, A Minecraft Movie had a meteoric rise at the box office. In fact, it’s currently the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">third-highest-grossing film of 2025</a> behind Lilo &amp; Stitch and Ne Zha 2. A sequel is already greenlit and in production as of earlier this month. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see if it leads anywhere and, if it does, it will be quite entertaining for sure.</p>
