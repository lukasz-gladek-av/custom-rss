<p>Several Bend Studio contractors have reported on their LinkedIn profiles that they will no longer be working at Bend Studio from February 14.</p>



<p>The news comes just two weeks after it was reported that PlayStation had cancelled two of its live service projects, one of which was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service God of War game by Bend Studio</a>. </p>



<p>The number of those effected is currently unclear, but according to some posts, only a handful of contractors were given full-time opportunities, while others where let go.</p>



<p>Bend Studio’s game cancelled means that the studio has not published a game since Days Gone in 2019, which sold 7.32 million units by February 2022, a number obtained by the Insomniac Games leaks.</p>



<p>With current game development timelines, it means that almost certainly it will be a decade between Days Gone and whatever is next for Bend Studio.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on if anyone at Bluepoint, another studio who faced a project cancelation has been effected.</p>



<p>What do you think Bend Studio will be working on next? Would you like to see Days Gone 2? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>In the latest BioWare update on the development of the next Mass Effect stage, the developer says it does not “require support from the full studio,” and has moved several employees to other teams at Electronic Arts. While the developer says it is reimaging how the company works, it still touts the leadership of veterans of the original trilogy.</p>



<hr>



<p>Following the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, a “core team at BioWare” is hard at work on the next Mass Effect game, the company <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/08/23/an-update-on-the-state-of-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in a blog post</a> today. However, an unclear number of employees have been moved to “other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.” IGN has also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that a small number of Dragon Age team members have had their roles terminated.</p>



<p>In their post, BioWare highlighted members of the veteran leadership leading production on the next Mass Effect game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Michael Gamble: Manager and Producer on Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3, and Andromeda.</li>



<li>Preston Watamaniuk: Lead Designer on the original trilogy.</li>



<li>Parrish Ley: Cinematic Animator for the original trilogy.</li>



<li>Derek Watts: Art Director for the original trilogy.</li>
</ul>



<p>Many believe this next Mass Effect title is a make-or-break release for BioWare. Dragon Age: The Veilguard went through a lengthy, turbulent development cycle, and despite some critical success, the 1.5 million copies sold was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/">half of what Electronic Arts expected</a>. This combined with EA Sports FC 25 missing internal expectations resulted in a massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-stock-drops-17-percent/">17% drop in EA’s stock value</a>. Veilguard’s game director Corrine Busch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/">left the company earlier this month</a>, after 18 years with the company.</p>
