<p>According to a new leak, Pokemon TCG Pocket will feature a new Ranked Battles mode in March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Pokemon TCG Pocket’s Ranked Battles mode news comes from popular leaker <a href="https://x.com/eb576dcfe/status/1894572652054155489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pyoro</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1894588040359625000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CentroLeaks</a>). Besides the mode releasing in March 2025, the leaker didn’t provide any more information. However, Pokemon Presents is all set to be hosted tomorrow, February 27, and players might hear more information about the new Ranked Battles mode and details about other Pokemon games then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Pokemon TCG Pocket receives a Ranked Battles mode, it will become the third battle game mode, after Versus and Solo. The developers could implement a rank system reminiscent of other online competitive titles with its reward tree. At the same time, the game would need competitive changes which balance gameplay. However, it is all just speculation at this point, and we will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another TCG Pocket leak arrived today through CentroLeaks. This leak shed light on the upcoming booster pack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-triumphant-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a>, featuring an Arceus Ex card. The leaked pack will reportedly be released this week; learn more about it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket card listings were recently&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-are-being-listed-on-ebay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted on eBay</a>. Also, the game recently gave away&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-gifting-players-free-trade-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free trade tokens</a>&nbsp;after the community’s feedback on the restriction of the feature. What are your thoughts on Pokemon TCG Pocket’s Triumphant Light booster pack?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has adjusted pricing for Escape from Tarkov in LATAM regions to ‘balance things out’. To celebrate the new pricing structure, the team has published a small gift bundle that all users can take advantage of. It includes a full kit – a weapon, plate vest, headset, ammunition, and so on.</p>



<p>The downside is it’s only redeemable in PvP, so PvE players have once again missed out on this limited-time promotion.</p>



<hr>







<p>To get your hands on this latest Tarkov gift bundle, you’ll need to log into your account on <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">escapefromtarkov.com</a> and access your profile. From there, click on ‘Activate Promo Code’ and enter the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>TARKOVLATAM</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>This code will unlock the bundle instantly and it’ll be ready to collect when you next log in.</p>



<p>It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mk 16 Assault Rifle</li>



<li>Takedown BP</li>



<li>STRIKE Helmet</li>



<li>Banshee Rig</li>



<li>ComTac IV Headset</li>



<li>3 x GEN M3 Magazines</li>



<li>100 x M856A1</li>



<li>Propital Injector</li>



<li>Condor Glasses</li>



<li>EXPS3 Optic</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though. Battlestate Games is running a Twitch Drops campaign from February 26 – March 1 for Escape from Tarkov, and from March 1 – March 3 for Tarkov Arena. </p>



<p>On social media, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>LATAM regional pricing for Escape from Tarkov and Tarkov Arena is now in place! Prices for all digital products have been adjusted to match regional rates, enhancing the local accessibility of our games.</p>



<p>To celebrate the LATAM regional pricing, use the promo code in the launcher to receive in-game rewards: TARKOVLATAM.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Battlestate Games continues to evolve Escape from Tarkov, which was first released almost ten years ago (in beta). This year, big things are on the horizon, and the game moves ever closer to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">the fabled 1.0 version</a> that’ll be classed as a full graduation.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Tarkov or have you dropped off until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">the next wipe</a> arrives? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Monolith Studios has shut down, and now fans wonder what will happen to its famed Nemesis System, which is locked under a Warner Bros. Games patent until 2036.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nemesis System was seemingly set to make its grand return with the now cancelled Wonder Woman game. The game’s cancellation came along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-warner-bros-games-cancels-wonder-woman-shuts-down-multiple-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutdown of the following studios</a>: Monolith Studios, Player First Games, and WB San Diego. Due to the sudden closure, the future of the Nemesis System has become uncertain, too, as the studio responsible for creating it no longer exists, and no other game developer will be able to utilise the system as Warner Bros Games holds its patent till 2036.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/wonder-woman-video-game-announced-in-2021-reportedly-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/warner-bros-owns-nemesis-system-until-2035-despite-monolith-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>), the Nemesis System was patented by Warner Bros. Games in 2021, which barred other game developers from using the system in their games. The patent will remain locked under Warner Bros. Games until 2036 if the company continues paying its associated fees, even after Monolith Studios has been shut down. This means that the Nemesis system may not see the light of day again unless Warner Bros. Games decides to do something about it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-nemesis-system">What is the Nemesis System?</h2>



<p>For those wondering, Monolith’s Nemesis System debuted with Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and was also used in Shadow of War. The system allows enemy NPC characters, who are usually unforgettable, to have more personality. With the Nemesis system, the player’s actions would be fed into the enemies, and their reaction towards the player character would change according to the decision made in battles, providing a personalised story and fresh encounters to players according to their choices. Thanks to the system, each enemy feels like an evolving rival to the player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the Nemesis System being locked under Warner Bros. Games till 2036?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm was shamed last year when he admitted to inappropriately messaging a minor on Twitch in 2017. That sequence made up the main reason why he was permanently banned from the platform in 2020. In the wake of the revelation, sponsors, friends, and peers alike all abandoned the controversial creator.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Dr Disrespect <strong>erupted</strong> against those who have ‘disrespected him’ over the last few months. That long list of people includes NICKMERCS, Dr Lupo, Kai Cenat, and the entire ‘streaming network’ at large.</p>



<p>Despite having built an entire persona based on being disrespectful to others, Beahm is now struggling to contend with being shunned by the industry around him.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crashing-out">Crashing Out</h2>



<p>In a perfect video posted on social media HUN2R, we see the best showcase possible of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-dr-disrespect-streamer-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Disrespect</a>‘s recent mid-stream tirade. It’s a bizarre segment that lasts far too long, with Beahm calling out all his former associates while simultaneously bagging on several outlets, industry personalities, and the wider streaming community.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Dr Disrespect RANTS on stream saying: 

– </span><a href="https://twitter.com/NICKMERCS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@NICKMERCS</a><span> is a phony and a p*ssy 
– </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DrLupo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@DrLupo</a><span> has always copied him and is a rat
– “That’s how you get knocked tf out” 
– “We didn’t admit nothing” 
– </span><a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@timthetatman</a><span> and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ZLaner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ZLaner</a><span> are good people, and he would accept their apology privately
-…</span></p></article></div>







<p>He labelled NICKMERCS ‘the biggest p*ssy in the world’, said that Dr Lupo is ‘a big-ass fake’, and suggested that publications are busy d*cksucking Kai Cenat’s content.</p>



<p>Hilariously, the creator said multiple times that he wasn’t going to say anything and wouldn’t address these ‘phony’ people <strong>before </strong>launching into a rant about some of the biggest names in the business.</p>



<p>Dr Disrespect said ‘We didn’t admit nothing’, reverting to the narrative that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-admits-minor-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he didn’t cop to messaging a minor</a> on Twitch. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>What the f*ck did we admit? Some jokes and bantering? That’s what we said? Wake up – we didn’t admit nothing!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the segment unravelled, Dr Disrespect became increasingly flustered, stating that for streamers like TimTheTatman and ZLaner to play games with him again, they’d need to <strong>publicly apologise </strong>for abandoning him in 2024.</p>



<p>It was just a few days ago that Guy Beahm posted on his personal social media profile <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-twitch-plead-reinstated-stream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requesting that Twitch unban him</a>, stressing that he never should have been banned in the first place. It’s one hell of a rabbit hole here, folks.</p>



<p>And all this news comes after Dr Disrespect was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-loses-followers-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped by prolific sponsors</a>, removed from Midnight Society (which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-comments-midnight-society/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently shut down</a>), and signed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-run-rumble-head-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a deal with Rumble</a> that he seems to already be neglecting somewhat.</p>



<p>What a wild ride.</p>

<p>A new Pokemon TCG Pocket leak has revealed the upcoming booster pack Triumphant Light, which will feature the Legendary Pokemon Arceus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coming from reliable Pokemon TCG Pocket leaks source <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1894551923203637657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CentroLeaks</a>, their new post on X reveals information on the upcoming pack, Triumphant Light. The post features a video that was “uploaded early to Pokémon’s TikTok”, where we see new Eevee, Magnemite, and Goldbat cards coming out of the new pack. At the end of the video, an Arceus Ex card is showcased, and the Legendary Pokemon’s battle skills are revealed, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Underneath the new post, CentroLeaks has commented that the TCG Pocket’s Triumphant Light set is “confirmed” and will be released “this week.” This information aligns with the source’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous leak</a>, which said the next themed booster pack (A2a) will be released on February 28, 2025, which arrives this Friday. </p>



<p>As per TCG Pocket’s Triumphant Light leak, the Arceus EX card will feature two abilities: Fabled Luster and Ultimate Force. Fabled Luster makes Arceus immune to any Special Conditions and doesn’t cost anything. Ultimate Force, on the other hand, inflicts 70+ base damage and 20 more points for each benched Pokemon. Players need three energy points to use the Ultimate Force and two to Retreat with Arceus Ex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket card listings were recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-are-being-listed-on-ebay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted on eBay</a>.

<p>Rebellion’s 2025 has Atomfall as a headline maker. The survival title shows a new side of England, and Game Pass subscribers—and everyone else—could benefit from a unique history lesson if an agreement is in place between the two companies.</p>



<p>There are genres and tropes it’s hard to get bored of. A dystopian world operating on an alternate timeline is fascinating. Atomic Heart showed us a terrifying look into an alternate-history Soviet Union. Whereas Wolfenstein’s Nazi-dominated world is also an eye-opening prospect. But Fallout is arguably where the focus usually falls.</p>



<p>Bethesda’s post-apocalyptic franchise looks at different areas of America in a world where nuclear war devastated the world. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> doesn’t focus on nuclear devastation but more on radioactive consequences. The concept alone deserves attention, so let’s see if Game Pass is happy to risk it for a radioactive biscuit.</p>

<p><strong>The good news is Atomfall’s release day also coincides with a day-one debut on Game Pass—Xbox’s subscription service.</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft users must apply their radiation suits, arm themself, and prepare for an unpleasant trip to the Lake District. Thankfully, the Lake District is a lovely area of the UK in real life, but in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/atomfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>, it’s likely to be riddled with mutants and cultists.</p>



<p>It’s more than tolerable when it’s free though, and this is the benefit you get if you have Game Pass. Rebellion is enjoying a nice partnership with Microsoft as another 2025 release has already gotten the Game Pass treatment—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-sniper-elite-resistance-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>.</p>

<p>Atomfall is set to fill a Fallout-sized hole in the gaming calendar. With Bethesda’s next post-apocalyptic foray likely several years away, I think Atomfall should work. Do you think this could be the start of a new franchise? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>
