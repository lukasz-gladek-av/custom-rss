<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the most widely appreciated games of 2025. It’s a phenomenal medieval RPG with a winding, adventurous story, and it’s packed to the brim with top-tier talent and wonderful, cinematic sequences. That’s what I alluded to in my full review for the game, at least.</p>



<p>I recently had the chance to catch up (again) with Tom McKay at the BAFTA Games Awards in London. We spent a few minutes talking about the success of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is one of the best-selling games of 2025 and will <strong>surely </strong>be up for many awards as the year unravels.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<h2 id="h-huge-expectations">‘Huge Expectations’</h2>



<p>I was the first person <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">to interview Tom McKay</a> about Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is something I’ll never stop boasting about. I hold the series very close to my heart, having poured hundreds of hours into both games and connecting eternally with the characters, particularly McKay’s Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<p>When I chatted with Tom at the BAFTA Games Awards, I was eager to gauge just how much this game had defied their expectations:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The studio had huge expectations based on the first game, a ton of effort went into the development of the second game, and they took their time – they put everything they had into it.</p>



<p>They were certainly proud of the product and knew that what they had was a good thing, but you can never predict how people will see that. Ultimately, it’s the players who are the most important reviewers of all.</p>



<p>The kind of energy and support and positivity that we’ve had from the fans has been incredible, and I don’t think any of us anticipated that, I certainly didn’t.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The fan base for Kingdom Come has exploded in recent months. It helps that the cast and crew have been immensely supportive of what they’ve produced. The actor behind the iconic Hans Capon, Luke Dale, has taken to streaming the game and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hans-capon-superstar-streamer-kingdom-come/">become an overnight sensation</a>, racking up thousands of viewers.</p>



<p>I asked McKay how things had changed since we caught up just after KCD2 was announced to the world.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It feels amazing – it’s <strong>like a sort of fever dream</strong>, really.</p>



<p>I think back to the very beginning of the first game, when I flew out the Prague and had what was essentially a final audition and I met the core creative team for the first time. That just feels like a world away, you know? </p>



<p>It is like a fever dream that we’re actually having this conversation about this game. However, in terms of what they’ve achieved and what they’ve made, Warhorse Studios, that doesn’t feel like a fever dream, because they’re so talented and so passionate, so on that level, it feels totally fitting. </p>



<p>In terms of that, I salute all of them. The reason I’m standing here is because of the work they’ve done.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">one hell of a roadmap ahead</a>, with three planned expansions yet to drop this year. Warhorse Studios is also releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode/">Hardcore Mode next week</a>, complete with a new lineup of perks.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of life left yet in KCD2.</p>

<p>In my review for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I noted that most of the game’s wildlife is pretty pointless. All across the world, animals roam free with no real purpose or control, and you can’t <strong>hunt them</strong> like you could in previous titles.</p>



<p>One thing I can’t complain about in the animal stakes is the sheer volume of cute kittens, puppy dogs, baby deer, and other adorable creatures scampering around Feudal Japan. I’ve just learned that (at least) one of those cuddly pets is based on a real cat that belongs to a Ubisoft developer.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-perks-of-the-job">Perks of the Job</h2>



<p>When you work as a Production Manager on a game, one thing you’ll surely be able to do is immortalise your feline friend for all to see.</p>



<p>That’s what Nik Pantis did while working on Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Pantis revealed that his stark white kitty, Ghost, is immortalised in Assassin’s Creed Shadows as ‘Bakeneko,’ a one-of-a-kind supernatural yōkai or kaibyō – a <em>ghost cat</em>. </p>



<p>He shared an image of Ghost both in the real world and as the Bakeneko in Assassin’s Creed:</p>











<p>This isn’t the first time a legendary cat has found its way into an Assassin’s Creed game. In 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, a special cat belonging to a fan of the game surfaced – with a very interesting feature. The cat had a natural representation of the Assassin’s Creed logo across its face.</p>



<p>Sadly, the cat passed away before the game was released, but Ubisoft pulled some strings to immortalise a treasured companion.</p>



<p>I’m off to find me a Bakeneko.</p>

<p>I wasn’t very fortunate growing up when it came to gaming-based technology. I was always a generation behind, and I <strong>never </strong>got games when they were released – I’d wait to get them second-hand further down the line. When I caught up with Abubakar Salim at the BAFTA Games Awards, he echoed that with a similar sentiment – when he was young, it was one or two games a year, <strong>tops</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s partly why he posted a bold statement <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1907522479008203189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> when the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 console (and, by association, the games) was revealed a few days ago. He stressed that there was a good reason why he ‘fought’ to get Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the first game from his Surgent Studios, on the market with a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Check out the full video interview here before jumping in:</p>

<h2 id="h-why-make-it-harder">‘Why Make it Harder?’</h2>



<p>The price of the Nintendo Switch 2 shocked some fans when it was revealed last week – and the price of software left more than a few folks with slack jaws. It’s a world away from the Nintendo Switch and much more than you’d expect to pay for a console that is known far and wide as <strong>the </strong>family platform.</p>



<p>But don’t worry – Nintendo has advised that if you can’t afford the Switch 2, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cant-afford-a-nintendo-switch-2-buy-a-switch-1-nintendo-says/">just opt for the first console</a> that was released back in 2017.</p>



<p>Don’t even get me started about GTA 6 and the $100 base price tag…</p>



<p>As I caught up with Abubakar at the BAFTA Games Awards in London, we got onto the topic of his post on social media and took a trip down memory lane together:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I kind of look back to myself as a kid and what I was allowed to play, and you know, I had like my one or two games that I got a year, right? </p>



<p>I’m now in a position where I’m able to play more, but I think about the kids of today and what they’re able to play and what they have access to, and I think, you know, the reason why we made Zau $20 was because it was like, ‘What’s the price of pizza? What’s the price of something that you’ll get mates around and enjoy and have an experience with’, and that was essentially where that mentality was.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a phenomenal point, and it’s at the forefront of the minds of everyone trying to pre-order a Nintendo Switch 2 as I write this. We’ve already seen the scalpers selling their pre-orders on eBay for exorbitant sums, as if it wasn’t hard enough to get one already. </p>



<p>We then started discussing Nintendo’s position in the wider industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People kind of forget that accessibility also accounts to socio-economics – money, man. </p>



<p>We’re in a very tough time at the moment, so why make it harder and have that bar eventually so high? </p>



<p>Yeah, I was a bit upset about the price changes, because Nintendo is a family game, Nintendo is a family genre. It’s a family platform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Looking to the future and what we dubbed ‘the next generation’, Abubakar explained: “I know that there’s going to be a kid out there that’s going to be inspired to play games and do what I do.”</p>

<p>Whether you are on PlayStation 5, PC, or Xbox Series X, here is everything you need to know about the cost of Blue Prince and whether the game is free.  </p>



<p>Game prices are a hotly contested topic at the moment. Nintendo fans were shocked when it was revealed that Switch 2 games cost $80 instead of $60, as seen on the first Switch console. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo defended the decision</a> by arguing that it was due to the game’s value to players. </p>



<p>Additionally, physical Switch 2 games cost more than digital and will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost up to $98</a> when converted from Euros. This is, of course, in addition to the console itself, which is expected to cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$450</a> or more. Playing video games has always been a rather expensive hobby, but not all titles are increasing in price, as is the case with Blue Prince. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-blue-prince-cost">How Much Does Blue Prince Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Blue Prince is full of several mysteries to solve. Image via Dogubomb</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/BluePrince" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dogubomb community manager</a>, <strong>Blue Prince costs $29.99 / €29.99 / £24.99 on PlayStation 5, Steam, and Xbox.</strong> </p>



<p>Players can purchase the game digitally on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/blue-prince/9PFRTPRQ569Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Store</a>. Blue Prince will not be available physically, and there is only one edition, meaning there aren’t any pre-order bonuses or early access. </p>



<p>Blue Prince will not be available on the Epic Games Store or GOG at launch. Dogubomb revealed that the game will be Steam Deck compatible, but that won’t be until a later date. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-blue-prince-free-to-play">Is Blue Prince Free to Play?</h2>



<p><strong>Blue Prince is not free to play</strong>, but it is available as a day-one release on PlayStation Plus Extra and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. </p>



<p>An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription costs $19.99 a month, and it will set you back $14.99 a month to become a PlayStation Plus Extra member. </p>



<p>Blue Prince isn’t the only game coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-playstation-plus-game-catalog-games-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Plus in April</a>. The fresh batch of PlayStation Plus Extra upcoming titles includes the likes of Hogwarts Legacy, EA Sports PGA Tour, and Battlefield 1. </p>



<p>As for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>&nbsp;are both day-one releases for the service. And if that wasn’t already enough,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 5</a>&nbsp;is also coming to Game Pass on April 15. </p>

Check out the game’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-blue-prince-release-start-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank">release date</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-blue-prince-release-start-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank">achievements, and trophies</a>, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-blue-prince-on-playstation-xbox-switch-or-pc-all-platforms-explained/" target="_blank">list of</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-blue-prince-on-playstation-xbox-switch-or-pc-all-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> platforms</a> it will be on. It’s still too early to tell without having a chance to play, but first impressions from reviewers have been overwhelmingly positive. </p>
