<p>It’s Wednesday, but don’t let a little midweek madness stop you from continuing your NYT Connections streak with another successful puzzle. I’ve got the hints and solutions you need to get through today’s puzzle as quickly as possible. Don’t forget to leave a comment or join the Insider Gaming Discord server to let us know how your streak is going!</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections hints you need today! </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-22">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 22)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #864:</p>



<ul>
<li>FASHION</li>



<li>WRITER</li>



<li>PASTA</li>



<li>SHAPE</li>



<li>PHARAOH</li>



<li>TAILOR</li>



<li>FIRE</li>



<li>WATER</li>



<li>GAS</li>



<li>CARPENTER</li>



<li>ELECTRIC</li>



<li>MOLD</li>



<li>TELEPHONE</li>



<li>CAT</li>



<li>RIGHT</li>



<li>ARMY</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>What keeps your home humming?</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Custom-made or cleverly reshaped</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Tiny workers with big titles</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Duplication in all its quirky forms</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 22.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Discovery Announces Sale Bid, Potentially Impacting Game Divisions]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-discovery-sale-potential-game-impact/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-discovery-announces-sale-bid-potentially-impacting-game-divisions.1330480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced it is officially up for sale, following the suspected breakdown of a deal between the firm and Paramount Global, which has dropped into the rearview. The news broke today that the board of directors at WBD has kick-started a ‘review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.’</p>



<p>In a press release, the firm revealed it had received ‘unsolicited interest from multiple parties for the entire company’. Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Games started <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-restructures-around-its-core-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a restructuring effort</a> to focus on core franchises including Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, Gme of Thrones, and the DC Universe, and if WBD <strong>is sold</strong>, those efforts will come into question.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-happen-if-warner-bros-discovery-is-sold">What Will Happen if Warner Bros. Discovery is Sold?</h2>



<p>If Warner Bros. Discovery is sold, the stock price will become volatile, content licensing deals and studio operations will be reshuffled, and brands might have their faces changed. This is all just as likely to impact Warner Bros. Discovery’s television and movie arms, such as HBO and Discovery+, as it is the <strong>gaming </strong>arms.</p>



<p>Under the Warner Bros. Discovery header sit multiple studios, all of which could be up in the air if a mega-sized corporation swoops in and buys the company. We could see studios shut down or split off, fragmented, or have their operations altered drastically.</p>



<p>This would be the natural course after the evaluation and review of spending, costs, and the portfolio under Warner Bros. Games.</p>



<p>Time and again, we’ve seen large companies swallowed up by <strong>even larger companies, </strong>and the action is almost always followed by project cancellations, layoffs, and studio shutdowns.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-potential-alternatives-maximize-shareholder-value" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Warner Bros. Discovery reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While&nbsp;Warner Bros. Discovery (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:&nbsp;WBD) continues to advance its previously announced separation of Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, its Board of Directors today announced it has initiated a review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, in light of unsolicited interest the Company has received from multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>This suggests the previously reported split has now evolved into an outright sale.</em></p>



<p>CEO and President, David Zaslav, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today’s evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally. We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think there will be drastic changes thrown into the mix if WBD is sold? What do you think this means for the studios under the WBD label? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dispatch Episodes 1 & 2 Spoiler-Free Review]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review.1330378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Imagine a superhero game where you’re not the one flying into danger in a cape or a suit. Instead, you’re stuck behind a desk. That’s the vibe of Dispatch, an episodic adventure game where each episode lasts roughly an hour. You play as Robert Robertson (voiced by Aaron Paul), better known as Mecha Man, whose mech suit has been destroyed. Now, he finds himself managing a squad of, let’s say, unique, reformed villains at the Superhero Dispatch Network (SDN).</p>



<p>Available on PC and PlayStation 5, Dispatch is part strategy, part narrative, part workplace comedy. I like to think of it as a primetime office drama with superpowers. You’ll choose who to send where, dealing with egos the size of Los Angeles, and try to pull off heroics from the sidelines. But how does it all work, and does developer AdHoc Studio manage to capture the charm that had people fall in love with games like The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead, and Batman: The Enemy Within?</p>



<h2 id="h-dispatch-spoiler-free-review-episodes-1-amp-2">Dispatch Spoiler-Free Review: Episodes 1 &amp; 2</h2>



<p>The first thing you notice with Dispatch is just how beautiful the game looks. It gives off Invincible vibes, but with a bit more polish to the environment, shadows, lighting, and more. It’s not going to appeal to everyone, but, to me, it’s one of the best-looking games of the year.</p>



<p>At the start of Episode 1, you find out who Mecha Man is and why you end up losing your suit. From a gameplay standpoint, things are a slow build. The first episode is more about getting you into the feeling of how things will go as opposed to diving into the full experience. You’ll meet important characters like Blonde Blazer, Chase, and the group of “heroes” you’ll be managing. </p>



<p>From the get-go, you feel the weight of everything in front of you, from the emotional state of Robertson and the loss of identity to what the SDN is trying to accomplish. Part of a government project known as Phoenix, this <s>Suicide Squad</s> Z-Team of former villains all have unique track records and abilities that you need to learn. There are five different stats to be aware of with your team: Combat, Charisma, Intelligence, Strength, and Vigor. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The core gameplay loop is simple but satisfying: dispatch your team of “reformed” villains to handle a variety of situations. You’ll need to decide whose skills and abilities are the best fit for the job. Some are as simple as helping someone across the road, while others require you to try and put out blazing infernos. Each character has their share of strengths and weaknesses, with some even working well together on multi-person dispatches. </p>



<p>At the end of your shift, you get a recap of how successful your dispatches were and how the team improved.</p>



<p>Dispatch includes quick-time events (QTEs) during cinematic sequences, though thankfully, they can be toggled off. Personally, I recommend it because it can get a bit distracting to deal with during the game. If I had to find one main complaint, it’s that the QTEs just feel like something that was added for the sake of putting more in the game. They don’t really add anything to the experience.</p>



<p>Another area of the gameplay is the hacking minigames. Through two episodes, they are few and far between, but still provide a nice break during various moments of the story. As the game moves forward, the hope is that not only will there be more instances of them, but they’ll actually provide a challenge.</p>



<h2>A Story Worth Loving With Great Acting To Boot</h2>



<p>With this being a game from a studio of former Telltale Game employees, it’s no surprise that Dispatch leans heavily into branching choices and dialogue. It’s hard to talk more about the choices you make without spoiling anything, so I won’t go into what the options you get are. </p>



<p>What I will say, however, is that you don’t get to the point where they all matter too much just yet through two episodes. Every choice you make—the game tells you that various characters will remember what you say and do—sets up something, and it feels like we’re left waiting a bit longer for what that something is. And that’s not a complaint because some decisions do impact what happens immediately after, but you can tell when the bigger ones are being made. It adds to that feeling of wanting more that Adhoc is clearly going for here.</p>



<figure><figcaption>In the early stages of Dispatch episodes 1 &amp; 2, you get a quick introduction to most of the characters.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you listen to the dialogue and watch scenes unfold in each, it’s easy to tell that Dispatch is a game that knows when to be serious while at the same time bringing in a nice blend of sarcasm and humor to it all. It didn’t even take half of the first episode to realize how perfect Paul’s casting was for the role of Robertson.</p>



<p>In fact, every voice actor fits their character so well. Jeffrey Wright nails the crass attitude of Chase, while Charles “MoistCr1TiKaL” White’s voice captures the arrogance of Sonar, who might be one of my favorite characters so far, despite limited screentime through two episodes. Hell, even the seemingly harmless scene with Royd in the bathroom shows the personality of Dispatch at every level.</p>



<p>Of course, things can go off the rails over the next six episodes, so a follow-up review and final verdict—with some spoilers—on Dispatch will come after the final episodes are released on November 12. Until then, I can’t wait to see how the rest of Robertson’s story unfolds.</p>
