<p>EA has announced that Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to meet the company’s internal expectations. In its <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preliminary Q3 FY2025 earnings report</a>, EA revealed that it was forced to lower its revenue forecast for both the quarter and fiscal year after the first Dragon Age game in 10 years missed expectations by a wide margin. </p>



<p>“Dragon Age engaged approximately 1.5 million players during the quarter, down nearly 50% from the company’s expectations,” the company said. </p>



<p>Because of the lower player engagement of Dragon Age: The Veilguard—as well as EA Sports FC 25—EA adjusted its expected net bookings for the year to be between $7-$7.15 billion compared to the originally expected $7.5-$7.8 billion. For the quarter itself, EA has adjusted its expectations to $2.21 billion in net bookings.</p>







<p><strong>“</strong>During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio; however, Dragon Age and EA SPORTS FC 25 underperformed our net bookings expectations,” said EA CEO Andrew Wilson in a prepared statement. “We remain confident in our long-term strategy and expect a return to growth in FY26, as we execute against our pipeline.”</p>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was released on October 31, 2024 to generally favorable reviews from critics. The game’s director, Corine Busche, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently left BioWare</a> after 18 years with the company for a new opportunity.</p>



<p>EA will present its full earnings on February 4 at 5pm ET/2pm PT. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the call when it takes place. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-2-gets-five-new-maps-including-one-classic-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is getting five new maps in Season 2. The first details for those maps were confirmed via the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-2-trailer-gives-more-details-on-maps-modes-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2 launch trailer</a>, but, now, Activision has released full details on the new multiplayer maps coming to the game. </p>



<p>The five new maps are Bounty, Lifeline, Dealership, Grind, and Bullet. Three maps—Bounty, Lifeline, and Dealership—will be available at launch on January 28 while the other two will come mid-season. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-two-maps-modes-announcement#Maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Details of each map</a> can be found below via Activision.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-2-multiplayer-maps">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 2 Multiplayer Maps</h2>



<p><strong>Bounty</strong> <strong>(at launch)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Bounty is a new 6v6 medium-sized map that takes place in a penthouse at the top of an Avalon skyscraper. </p>



<p>“From the starting point of a pristine Patio, move inside an opulent, gold-plated Nightclub and Lounge where top-shelf entertaining was provided to a variety of rich guests,” the map’s description reads. “Ambush enemies by jumping over the light fixtures hanging over the Lobby below.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Lifeline</strong> <strong>(at launch)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It may seem similar to Black Ops 2’s Hijacked map, but Lifeline appears to be much smaller an more chaotic. A new small-sized map for Strike 2v2 and 6v6, Lifeline sees you fight on a high-end yacht that’s burning in the middle of the sea.</p>



<p>“From Bow to Aft, it won’t take long to collide in the center Bar and gambling den, the disco room, or along the steps on Portside and Starboard,” says Activision. “Keep your head on a swivel or risk getting thrown overboard.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Dealership</strong> <strong>(at launch)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The last of the three Season 2 launch maps, Dealership is another medium-sized 6v6 map that takes place around the Pallasar car dealership. And while it looks like a dealership on the outside, it’s actually a front for a black market where cars are traded for weapons.</p>



<p>“Battle around the wreckage in the Car Lot and Showroom, pushing the fight into the interior Commissary and Lounge or out on the Courtyard and once offered an idyllic vista,” it’s description reads. “Open the sliding doors to either side of the Garage for a quick ambush or close them to stall incoming enemies.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Grind</strong> <strong>(mid-season)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A remaster of the classic map from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Grind is a 6v6 medium-sized map that takes place in a skatepark. In addition to the outdoor skatepark, there is a pro shop and indoor stadium to fight your opponents in.</p>



<p>“Use the ramps for cover and to get above the competition and bust out your best tricks like the 360-corkscrew one-shot. Also expect an additional surprise related to this map, later in the season,” Activision said.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Bullet (mid-season)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lastly, Bullet is another small map for Strike 2v2 and 6v6 multiplayer matches. The map takes players aboard a bullet train where you can go between train cars with little room to hide. If inside gets too tight, players can head to the roof of the train to fight.</p>



<p>“Race through the automatic sliding doors separating each car, from the first-class lounge through the dining car, second-class seats, and up to the cab where the fallen conductor dispels any hope of reaching the destination in one piece,” Activision writes.</p>
