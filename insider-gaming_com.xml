<p>Whether you need to tune up your catch-as-catch-can holds or work on throwing meaner right hooks than Logan Paul, 2K offering WWE 2K25 Early Access would have many ready, willing, and Gable to buy.</p>



<p>2K’s multimedia sports game empire is a winner every year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> is the natural successor to WWE 2K24, and is looking to be the Apex Predator of the group. More and more games offer Early Access, and WWE 2K25 is a natural fit for the incentive.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> already has it, so I’m here to tell you if you can expect it from WWE 2K25.</p>

<p><strong>WWE 2K25 offers 7-Day Early Access as a bonus for those who pre-order the Deadman</strong> <strong>Edition and Bloodline Editions.</strong></p>



<p>WWE 2K25’s Early Access is a chance to get stuck into MyGM, Universe Mode, and explore The Island as an early adopter. You can learn the new mechanics, get an Edge (pun intended) on other newbies, and become the King or Queen of the Ring.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-wwe-2k25-early-access">How to Play WWE 2K25 Early Access</h2>



<p>Three editions await those who want to secure their copy before launch: The Standard Edition, Deadman Edition, and Bloodline Edition. The final two are the key for Early Access. Pre-order the Deadman or Bloodline Edition for a seven-day headstart over the competition.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick guide on how to secure this big bonus:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25’s website</a>.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>pre-order now</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll down <strong>and choose either the Deadman or Bloodline Edition</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose your platform.</li>



<li>Press <strong>pre-order now</strong>&nbsp;to go to the storefront you desire.</li>



<li>Again, choose the newer&nbsp;<strong>pre-order now</strong>&nbsp;button.</li>



<li>Purchase the edition and confirm it.</li>



<li>You can download and play Early Access when it begins.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-when-does-wwe-2k25-early-access-start">When Does WWE 2K25 Early Access Start?</h2>



<p><strong>Early Access for WWE 2K25 begins on March 7, giving you seven full days to enjoy WWE 2K25 before it launches worldwide on March 14.</strong></p>



<p>If you think I’m telling an Eddie Guerrero-sized lie, I promise I haven’t cheated you, and I’ll steal the official confirmation from 2K itself. On the official <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/37145831078163--WWE-2K25-Pre-Order-and-Edition-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25 FAQ</a>, it says: “Standard Editions can start their throw-down journey on March 14, and the early access for pre-orders of Deadman and The Bloodline Editions will get access starting March 7.”</p>

<p>Are you prepared to pay a bit more and secure your ticket to the dance? Or will you turn down the offer and take the brunt of a John Cena heel turn?</p>



<p>It’s not exactly from the dirt sheets, but many other WWE 2K25 details are known. This year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-showcase-mode-matches-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Showcase Matches</a> are announced, and we know all about 2K25’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-wwe-2k25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> eligibility.</p>

<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, a remaster of the third and fourth games in the franchise, has been officially revealed. The reveal comes after weeks of rumors and teases about the game’s announcement.</p>



<p>Launching on July 11—confirming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-3-4-details-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier leak</a>—Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 will feature the game’s original parks with a “classic roster of skaters”. There will also be new parks, skaters, and tricks for all players to experience on all platforms.</p>

<p>“Skate through a robust Career mode taking on challenges across two tours, chase high scores in Single Sessions and Speedruns, or chill out and dig into the map in Free Skate,” Activision said via release. </p>



<p>The game is being developed by Iron Galaxy Studios, the team that handled the development of the Steam version of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2. Vicarious Visions, which initially developed the first remaster, was merged into Blizzard back in 2021 and rebranded as Blizzard Albany.</p>



<p>It was also announced that the game  will have cross-platform multiplayer supporting up to eight players at once. There will also be a New Game+ mode for players that want to play through the career multiple times without losing their stats.</p>



<p>When it launches, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It’ll also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC.</p>



<p>Those who pre-order the game will get access to the Foundry Demo in June. Lastly, players who buy the Digital Deluxe edition will get access to Doom Slayer and Revenant skaters along with extra in-game music, skate decks, and create-a-skater gear alongside three days early access on July 8.</p>

<p>It has just been announced that Escape from Tarkov Arena, the session-based multiplayer platform set in the EFT universe, is coming to the Epic Games Store. This marks the first time that an Escape from Tarkov title will be introduced to a digital storefront outside of Battlestate Games’ launcher and store.</p>



<p>It wasn’t given a release date, but users can wishlist Escape from Tarkov Arena on the Epic Games Store <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-surprising-change">Surprising Change</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has been the most popular extraction shooter for almost a decade. In December 2023, Battlestate Games released Escape from Tarkov Arena, a traditional multiplayer shooter with smaller maps, faster modes, and classic loadout mechanics. It was well received, but it has admittedly died off quite considerably in the months that have followed.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Wishlist Escape from </span><a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Tarkov</a><span>: Arena now! </span><a href="https://epic.gm/tarkov-arena" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epic.gm/tarkov-arena</a><span>

Intense, hardcore close-quarters PvP battles with realistic weapon mechanics, and advanced ballistics are coming your way. Are you ready to dominate the Arena?</span></p></article></div>







<p>Earlier today, Epic Games Store revealed that EFT Arena would be debuting on the platform <strong>soon</strong>. This is a landmark move, as Escape from Tarkov, and by extension, Arena, have only been purchasable directly from Battlestate Games since they were respectively released.</p>



<p>The team released a new trailer to celebrate the announcement:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov: Arena - Epic Games Store trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Wmz3Yh_3xU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>This is likely a bid to make Escape from Tarkov more accessible, with the hope that by making Arena more readily available, it’ll entice people to check out the full ‘version’ of Escape from Tarkov. For now, that’s still locked to Battlestate Games’ platforms and isn’t on Steam, Epic Games Store, or any other digital storefront.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov Arena is a great shooter, but it’s quite punishing – just like the full extraction shooter. It boasts a fairly realistic operating model, and it’s easy to come up against overpowered enemies. This also isn’t <strong>really </strong>a shooter for anyone who mains a game like Call of Duty – it’s not an arcade game at all, and it can’t be played with a controller.</p>



<p>Watch this space to learn when Escape from Tarkov Arena <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/escape-from-tarkov-arena-d3e23b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will be released on Epic Games Store</a>.</p>
