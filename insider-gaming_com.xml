<p>Screenshots from Rare’s cancelled multiplayer title Everwild have surfaced, according to one report.</p>



<p>Revealed in 2019, Everwild was set to be the next big thing from Rare under Xbox. With multiplayer and a forest-themed premise, the game had been silent for quite some time. It was still in the works whenever asked and development had seemed to be progressing. Unfortunately, due to Microsoft layoffs, multiple titles were cancelled, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark</a>, Project Blackbird, and Everwild. However, a credible report shows some screenshots of the game’s gameplay and UI that never made it to the public.</p>



<h2 id="h-everwild-reportedly-leaked-screenshots-include-gameplay-ui-elements">Everwild Reportedly Leaked Screenshots Include Gameplay, UI Elements</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/screenshots-rares-everwild-featuring-ui-gameplay-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Mp1st</a>, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Perfect Dark concept art</a>, the site obtained in-progress screenshots of Rare’s Everwild. In the pictures, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/screenshots-rares-everwild-featuring-ui-gameplay-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available here</a>, there are plenty of things to go off of. We get a look at some of the menu designs and characters, which seem on par with the reveal trailer. We also see some scenery and the playable protagonist alongside a gardening-esque system. Of course, these pictures are not yet verified, so take the news with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>Everwild, last time it was reported, was in a playable state. While we don’t know how far along it was, it seems it was shaping up quite nicely. Unfortunately, we may never be able to play it, though it is cool to see what it could’ve been. Rare has only shipped a handful of games under Microsoft and, given it’s only new notable IP is Sea of Thieves, Everwild would’ve been a nice breather. It’s unknown what is next for Rare and Microsoft, despite rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-banjo-kazooie-game-is-coming-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banjo-Kazooie returning</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think of the screenshots for Everwild? Do you hope it sees the light of day again? Are you sad that Xbox cancelled it?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Avatar: The Last Airbender is finally getting a fighting game from Gameplay Group and Paramount.</p>



<p>The Avatar: The Last Airbender series, which ran from 2005-2008 on Nickelodeon, remains a beacon of animation to this day. The elemental-combat and charming characters worked then and made a huge resurgence during COVID-19. With a new movie and series in the works, the franchise is still going strong. While games haven’t been a strong suit, a new title has been revealed, and it’s a genre fans have been waiting for.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://youtu.be/CmBG-Bi7Dmc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we get our first look at an Avatar-set fighting game, simply called Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game. Along with the announcement, we see some interesting hand-drawn 2D gameplay with fan-favorite characters like Aang, Zuko, Sokka, Azula, and Toph. It also looks like Korra from the sequel series The Legend of Korra, will be present, but no characters from the show were revealed as fighters. It will launch with 12 playable characters, with more released on a seasonal basis.</p>



<p>Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game will feature movement-centric gameplay and an original story. Alongside the additions are net code and crossplay, now must-haves for new fighting titles. The game is being developed by Paramount and Gameplay Group, who helped develop Them Fighting Herds. As of now, the title, Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game, is not official and may change. New features are also set to be announced later, though no hints were given. It will release on Nintendo Switch 2, PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2424420/Avatar_Legends_The_Fighting_Game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Steam page</a> was also released for players to wishlist the title. The Avatar series is way past due for a fighting game, so Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is sure to hit the spot. While it’s not coming until Summer 2026, it looks like it will be well worth the wait.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Sentence is The First Game That Journalists Are Guaranteed to Be Good At]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/final-sentence-game-journalists-good-at/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-sentence-is-the-first-game-that-journalists-are-guaranteed-to-be-good-at.1322992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone knows that video game journalists aren’t good at games, right? It’s as true as the sun rising in the morning or the knowledge that it was <strong>lag </strong>that led to you losing your match, and not your abilities (or lack of). That’s why it’s exciting that a game is coming out that journalists <strong>must </strong>be good at – <strong>Final Sentence</strong>.</p>



<p>In Final Sentence, up to 100 players face off in a battle royale like no other. It features typewriters, revolvers loaded with a single bullet, and a warehouse full of bodies… Except for one person, that is. As you advance through the rounds, you have to type as though your life depends on it (which it does), and a single typo could mean a bullet to the head.</p>



<h2 id="h-in-final-sentence-a-single-tpyo-could-mean-death">In Final Sentence, a Single Tpyo Could Mean Death</h2>



<p>Final Sentence is slated to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2413950/Final_Sentence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch on Steam</a> in Q4 2025, but until now, no concrete release date has been lined up for the title. Several months ago, the game’s solo developer, operating under the name Button Mash, revealed Final Sentence, explaining why the idea of the game surfaced in the first place:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am notoriously bad at typing myself, so I searched for the entertaining ways to improve. That’s when the idea of Final Sentence was born.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Final Sentence, players wake up in a warehouse full of people, all sitting at desks topped with a typewriter from days gone by. There’s a clock that ticks down seconds, and a masked man standing at every desk with a revolver. In that revolver sits a single bullet, and each mistake could mean <strong>death</strong>.</p>



<p>As you type, the other 99 (<em>up to</em>) do the same thing, and shots echo out around the room as a fatal mistake brings them to a grisly end.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a Russian Roulette of sorts, and it could be your first mistake or your sixth mistake that sends you to an early grave.</p>



<p>What’s bizarre is that the prompts you need to type in Final Sentence appear to reference pop culture classics and movies, with lines such as ‘Press F to pay respects’ and ‘Hide yo kids, hide yo wife’ being prompts.</p>



<p>Button Mash has explained that Final Sentence uses a ranking system that evaluates your performance and lets you know where to improve, so this is one battle royale title that has real-world, practical applications.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>It also runs on an utter potato, which is great news for PC gamers without the best equipment.</p>



<p>Games journalists can finally enjoy a title that they’re good at, without worrying about pretending that they like games just to appease the masses.</p>



<p>Let me know if Final Sentence looks like your kind of game over on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
