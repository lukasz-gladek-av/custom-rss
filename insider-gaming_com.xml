<p>One of the most well-received games of 2025 could be heading to Xbox Game Pass. A post on social media on Monday talked about the future of additions to Xbox Game Pass this year, with a not-so-subtle tease of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve got quite the release slate lined up for Xbox Game Pass so far, this is going to be a huge year,”</strong> <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/2023442179625259508?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the “email” reads.</a> <strong>“Oh, and speaking of upcoming releases… well, I shouldn’t say too much, but if you’re getting quite hungry for a fun adventure, all I can say is that something big is about to be deliverance’d to Xbox Game Pass…”</strong></p>







<p>While not specifically naming the game, using the term “deliverance’d” is a dead giveaway for what’s to come. Xbox is getting ready to announce the next wave of games for the service, which could see it come sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance is already available on the subscription service for those with an Ultimate, PC, or Premium membership.</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>The fifth chapter of Poppy Playtime is almost upon us, and console fans are bound to be wondering whether they can get in on the action. </p>







<p>It’s not one they’ll want to miss, either, as it’s rumoured to be the final part of the long-running saga. If you’re a PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch owner and a fan of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a>, here’s whether you can continue the journey or not.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On PlayStation 5? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Watch your step. Image by Mob Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite Chapters one through three being available on Sony’s latest console, Chapter 5 of Poppy Playtime will not be readily available on PlayStation 5 at launch. </strong></p>



<p>The franchise was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally released on PC</a> all those years ago, and ever since, the titles have first and foremost debuted there. Console ports were eventually developed for some older chapters, but it looks like PS5 fans will have to miss out—at least at launch.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that a PS5 port will be developed in the future, but how far away it is remains to be seen. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s equally bad news for Xbox fans, as Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 won’t be available on either Xbox console alongside the PC launch. </strong></p>







<p>Xbox fans often get the short end of the stick, with numerous titles opting to miss their systems in recent years. However, Chapter 5 of Poppy Playtime should arrive on Xbox eventually; it’s just a matter of when. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo fans don’t fare any better; Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 will not be on the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch.</strong></p>



<p>It might be majorly disappointing for Poppy Playtime fans, but there is a silver lining. As has been mentioned numerous times, console ports will arrive in the future, typically a few months after the PC release. It’s a shame, but console ports take time, especially for Indie devs like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mob-entertainment/" id="3160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mob Entertainment</a>. </p>

<p>Mob Entertainment has excelled at delivering grit-your-teeth, bite-your-nails action through the Poppy Playtime series. It’s always been a well-priced franchise for such replayable content, but questions are being asked about Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s price.</p>



<p>Greater quality means more work, which unfortunately factors in increased cost. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a> has gotten bigger as the years have gone on, but so has its price tag. Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 could be the end for the franchise, and it could go out with an expensive bang.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5">How Much Is Poppy Playtime Chapter 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Needs more light. Credit to Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>While there is no official confirmation as yet, Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is expected to cost about $25, possibly going up to $30.</strong></p>



<p>Everything shown from the Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 gameplay trailer suggests this is the most complete game to date. Mob Entertainment’s indie project has gone from free-to-play to a fairly premium price tag.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s unlikely Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is going to buck the trend, and it’s looking very likely that the price will go up again. In keeping with the previous chapter’s increase, Chapter 5 is probably going to cost in the region of $25-30 or £20-25. </p>



<p>Chapters 2 through 4 have seen a five-dollar increase each time. Still, this is mostly guesswork based on previous games and logic, so this is only a prediction for now.</p>



<p>This guide will be updated with the accurate price once the game is out and everyone knows for sure, so keep checking back!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-have-previous-poppy-playtime-chapters-cost">How Much Have Previous Poppy Playtime Chapters Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Historical data shows that each new chapter has raised the price between $5-10, with the first game having started as a free-to-play download.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, the first game was (and still is) completely free to play. The journey had to start somewhere, and the price has only gone up as the years have gone by.</p>

<p>It’s been a while since a new chapter brought the nightmare-inducing Huggy Wuggy to the fore, which is why you should check out Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s release date and start times to let some new horrors fester.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a> is rumored to be the final part of the saga. Whether this ends up being the case remains to be seen, but one thing’s for sure: You shouldn’t miss out on Chapter 5. The Prototype is there to explore in its entirety, and it’s not long until you can do so.</p>

<p><strong>Mob Entertainment has issued a February 18 release date for Poppy Playtime Chapter 5.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been on this journey to this point, number one, you’re brave, and number two, this could be the culmination of a five-year journey that has seen hilariously evil-looking Poppy Playtime merch appear all over the world and capture the minds and haunt the dreams of everyone in that time.</p>

<p>Huggy Wuggy has been anything but cute and adorable in that time (maybe the most misleading name in history), and it’s back to chase you around The Prototype.</p>



<p>The new chapter is scheduled for February 18, so prepare yourself.</p>
