<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is already off to an impressive start for sales, as Nintendo Japan reports it has sold almost 6 million copies in its first week.</p>



<p>As the latest in the franchise, Pokémon Legends: Z-A furthers Arceus’ open-air combat and brings it to Lumiose City. Sprawling with Pokémon of all regions and generations, the style and fun of past titles are on full display. Reviews for the title have been great, ranking among the best in the franchise. Plus, with Scarlet and Violet’s okay reception, Legends: Z-A has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-preview-the-new-battle-system-could-become-the-new-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a breath of fresh air</a> for all. Luckily, the sales are proof enough, with Nintendo Japan confirming its insane worldwide sales total for its launch week.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_pressreleases_20251023_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release from Nintendo Japan</a>, the company revealed that Pokémon Legends: Z-A, in its first week, has sold over 5.8 million copies worldwide. This does make the title one of the best-selling Nintendo Switch 2 games yet, which is an impressive feat. Given Mario Kart World, from stats from June 30th, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-sales-nearly-match-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 5.6 million</a> in its launch month, Pokémon is off to an incredible start. Furthermore, the press release claims that almost half of the sold copies were played on a Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>Seeing as Pokémon is one of Nintendo’s biggest franchises, it isn’t too surprising to see it launch with high sales. However, it’s still great for it to get almost 6 million in just the launch week. Furthermore, should the numbers get bigger, it can easily eclipse Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which sold 14.8 million within two months of its release in 2023. Overall, it seems Pokémon is here to stay, and fans wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Toronto Ultra Rebrands to Toronto KOI in the Call of Duty League]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League’s Toronto Ultra has unveiled a rebrand, taking on a new name and logo. In a press release, OverActive Media revealed the new name, ‘Toronto KOI’, in recognition of the organization’s association with KOI and Movistar. </p>



<p>This is the latest in a line of a few organizations to rebrand going into the 2026 Call of Duty League season. We recently saw the Riyadh Falcons, FaZe Vegas, and G2 Minnesota all surface amid ‘rostermania’. Merchandise and new jerseys to celebrate the new branding will launch in December, the organization advised.</p>



<h2 id="h-introducing-toronto-koi">Introducing: Toronto KOI</h2>



<p>In a press release, Adam Adamou, the CEO of OverActive Media, Toronto KOI’s parent company, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To be KOI is to belong</p>



<p>KOI has always been about connection, about fans, players and communities coming together under one banner. Toronto KOI brings that spirit home and gives it a global stage. This launch marks an important moment in our global strategy. It connects our North American operations with one of the most recognized and influential brands in global esports. </p>



<p>Bringing this illustrious brand to the Call of Duty League and to Toronto will benefit everyone, our fans, our players, our partners and the broader esports ecosystem. We are building a single, unified brand platform that scales across regions and delivers lasting value for all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This alignment brings Toronto Ultra into the core OverActive ‘KOI’ branding, offering fans something more tangible to connect to than the arguably arbitrary term ‘Ultra’.</p>



<p>It’s what ROKKR did by taking on the ‘G2 Minnesota’ label, and there are expectations that Gentlemates will deepen brand identity in the coming weeks by ‘moving’ LAG M8 to Paris. It’s a busy time to be a Call of Duty League fan, as everything is changing ahead of the long-awaited Black Ops 7 season.</p>



<p>It already feels like an age since the Call of Duty League Championship wrapped up towards the end of June, and there are still many weeks until the new season starts.</p>
