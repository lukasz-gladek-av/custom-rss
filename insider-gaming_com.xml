<p>The LEGO website has been updated to confirm their upcoming partnership with Pokémon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hours ago, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-pokemon-partnership-reveal-appears-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teaser video</a> about the partnership between LEGO and Pokémon surfaced online before being abruptly removed. Now, the LEGO website’s <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/pokemon/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">themes section</a> has been officially updated to feature the brand-new partnership with Pokémon. Not many details have been revealed about the collaboration other than the fact that it will arrive in 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/The-LEGO-Group-and-The-Pokemon-Company-International-team-up-to-bring-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>, the LEGO Group and The Pokémon Company have signed a multi-year partnership to bring the world of Pokémon to life through LEGO bricks. Until now, Pokémon had a licensing agreement with Mattel, which allowed the latter to sell buildable characters, play sets, building blocks, and sets for the franchise through its Mega Bloks brand. However, the new partnership should end Pokémon’s deal with Mattel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Julia Goldin, Chief Product &amp; Marketing Officer of the LEGO Group, has stated that “this partnership will create a range of new possibilities for Trainers and builders alike.” Gaku Susai, Chief Product and Experience Officer at The Pokémon Company International, added, “The LEGO Group and Pokémon have strong shared values of imagination, creativity and fun, making this the perfect partnership to deliver unique, meaningful and engaging ways for Trainers to experience the Pokémon brand.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-preload-guide-file-sizes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Our preload and file size guide for The First Berserker Khazan can get you armed and ready. Before you step into the shoes of the soon-to-be-influenced general Khazan, you first need to preload the game if you’ve pre-ordered it, and you definitely need to know how much space you need.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of expectation on the shoulders of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a>. It’s one of 2025’s biggest action-adventure and Soulslike titles, and it has a lot of fans already. We know the basics of the story, we’ve seen the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-trophy-list-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy List</a>, and we also know if it’s on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-first-berserker-khazan-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass</a>.</p>



<p>But for details on the preload process and how much space Khazan requires, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-the-first-berserker-khazan">How to Preload The First Berserker Khazan</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to process. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can preload The First Berserker Khazan approximately 24 hours before release if you have a confirmed pre-order digital purchase of the game.</strong></p>



<p>Preloading is another recent popular gaming trend. It allows you to have an upcoming game already installed on your device allowing you to play it as soon as its worldwide launch rolls out.</p>



<p>Here’s a basic step-by-step guide if you’ve never done this before:</p>



<ol>
<li>Decide if you’re playing The First Berserker Khazan on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC.</li>



<li>Head to your chosen digital storefront.</li>



<li>Find the search function and look for <strong><strong>The First Berserker Khazan</strong></strong>.</li>



<li>Choose any Khazan edition.</li>



<li>Confirm and complete your purchase.</li>



<li>Wait for the preload option to go live—we think it’s in the <strong>24 hours leading up to Early Access</strong>.</li>



<li>Click the download option once it’s available.</li>



<li>Once it’s installed, The First Berserker Khazan should be in your games library raring and ready to go.</li>
</ol>



<p>Using the Steam page as evidence, it says: “Pre-Purchase this edition and play the game starting three days ahead of full release. Starts in approximately six days.” This means you can expect the preload option to go live in the 24 hours building up to the start of Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-file-size-on-playstation-xbox-amp-pc">The First Berserker Khazan File Size on PlayStation, Xbox &amp; PC</h2>



<p><strong>The PlayStation File Size for The First Berserker Khazan is 25.820 GB, and you need at least 70 GB on Xbox and PC.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a notable discrepancy between PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, but I wouldn’t worry if you’re playing Khazan on the latter formats. <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1900166091801862261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>—a reputable source of file sizes—confirmed the PS5 file size, whereas the PC and Xbox sizes come from the official <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/the-first-berserker-khazan/9pkjwmbbgk38?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan Xbox</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2680010/The_First_Berserker_Khazan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam pages</a>.</p>



<p>Xbox and PC say you need a least 70 GB—but this doesn’t mean you need 70 GB or anything close come release. To be on the safe side, make sure you have 70 GB free, and if it does end up being far less, that’s a bonus!</p>

<p>LEGO Pokémon models are seemingly in the works, as a now-removed announcement post was uploaded early to their official LEGO Mexico account on Facebook.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LEGO is one of the most popular toy production companies. It is known to collaborate with various franchises, such as Mario, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, and many more. However, one of the biggest franchises has managed to skip LEGO’s grasp for years now: Pokémon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all that could change, as a now-removed teaser points towards an upcoming partnership announcement. Spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1je380o/lego_pok%C3%A9mon_has_been_officially_announced_coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/Legoleak</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1901974339597095025/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>), a teaser video for the LEGO x Pokémon partnership was posted early on the LEGO Mexico Facebook account, with a caption suggesting a ‘2026’ release window. The video has been removed from that account; however, you can still watch it on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1je380o/lego_pok%C3%A9mon_has_been_officially_announced_coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (at the time of writing).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 13-second teaser begins with yellow LEGO blocks coming together to form one of the most iconic tails in Pokémon: Pikachu’s tail. As electricity passes through the blocks, Pikachu uses his electric attack to illuminate two logos—LEGO and Pokémon—before vanishing into the darkness.</p>



<p>The LEGO and Pokémon partnership has not arrived sooner due to the latter’s licensing agreement with Mattel. Mattel, through its Mega Bloks brand, has sold buildable characters, play sets, building blocks, and sets for the franchise, including models for the most popular Pokémon like Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and more. However, this new partnership could mean the end of Pokémon and Mattel’s agreement.&nbsp;</p>
