            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 Remake Coming To Xbox]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team’s epic Silent Hill 2 remake smashed it out of the park on PS5 and PC. The title was a console exclusive for the PS5, but a new ESRB rating has revealed that the Silent Hill 2 remake is coming to Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p>



<p>It seems the Silent Hill 2 remake was potentially on a timed exclusivity agreement. This is the feeling as the horror remake has been rated by the ESRB for the “Xbox Series.” There’s still no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-switch-2-xbox-rumor-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch port</a> in the open, but the game’s console presence is about to become wider and more terrifying.</p>



<h2 id="h-esrb-rates-silent-hill-2-for-xbox-series-x-s">ESRB Rates Silent Hill 2 For Xbox Series X|S</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Happy Halloween! Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Poor James Sunderland, he has to relive his own personal trauma all over again on Xbox. On the plus side, it’s a nice Halloween treat for Xbox players who’ve upgraded to modern-gen hardware.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ESRB</a> website was updated on October 31 (of all dates) to show Silent Hill 2 being certified. The key difference this time is that it’s for “Xbox Series” platforms, and the news comes nearly a year after the PS5 and PC launches.</p>



<p>From what we can tell, nothing’s changed on the rating summary front. It’s still the same Mature 17+ rating, and features the same depraved content, the same gruesome and gory gameplay, and the same “Enemies with body parts sewn together.”</p>



<p>It doesn’t clarify when Silent Hill 2’s remake is coming to Xbox. We’ll have to wait for an official announcement in the future—maybe closer to The Game Awards?</p>



<p>For now, if you’re on Xbox and you haven’t played the second game’s exquisite remake, we advise you to get the sick bags on standby and have a nice supply of light bulbs at the ready, as playing this in the dark will mentally put you in Silent Hill while you’re trying to sleep!</p>



<p>Have you played the Silent Hill 2 remake? What do Xbox players have to look forward to?
