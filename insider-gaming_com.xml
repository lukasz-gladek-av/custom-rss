<p>Resident Evil Requiem spoilers are out in the wild, and while many are looking to avoid them, others are actively hunting them down to find out the fate of Leon Kennedy.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> releases <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-times/" id="177650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 27</a>, and Leon Kennedy is one of two playable characters in the game, alongside Grace Ashcroft. While Grace is a new face in the series, Leon is an established name in the franchise, and his fate is a significant talking point.</p>



<p>If you’re actively on the hunt to find out what happens to Leon Kennedy, the answer is below. If you don’t want anything spoiled, look away now!</p>



<p><strong>Warning: This article contains major spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem. This is your last chance to leave!</strong></p>

<figure><figcaption>Fate is sealed. Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The fate of Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil Requiem depends on the ending you experience, as there are two different endings you can encounter.</strong></p>



<p>Only one of these is the canon ending, however, which Capcom will use moving forward as the main timeline for the Resident Evil franchise. If you’re a fan of Leon Kennedy, the good news is that he’s not dead in canon, and will be around for future entries in the series.</p>

</ul>



<p>It is possible to have Leon die in your save, however, as the ‘bad’ ending results in his death. The ending ultimately comes down to a big choice of what you choose to do with Elpis.</p>



<p>If you choose to release Elpis, the ‘good’, and canonically, ending is shown, whereas choosing to destroy Elpis ultimately leads to the death of Leon Kennedy.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-to-leon-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem">What Happens to Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p><strong>As mentioned, the ultimate fate of Leon Kennedy depends on the action you choose to take with Elpis, but both endings have a significant impact.</strong></p>



<p>In the ‘good ending’, Victor Gideon appears at the end of the game to kill Zeno, and Elpis is released. This cures Leon’s infection, resulting in him de-ageing and becoming younger. It’s not entirely clear where Capcom plans to go from here, but making him younger in canon opens the door for him to star again in the future.</p>

</ul>



<p>The difference in the bad ending is that Gideon does not appear to save Leon from Zeno, who subsequently explodes Leon’s head. He doesn’t survive either, however, as the platform they are both on collapses.</p>

<p>The world of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a> is packed with lore that slowly comes together across each chapter. There’s a core narrative to follow, but players willing to dig deeper will uncover layers of hidden details and disturbing revelations scattered throughout the game.</p>



<p>Many fans expected Chapter 5 to finally provide the answers, especially with speculation that it would serve as the series’ finale. Instead, it delivers one of the biggest cliff-hangers yet, raising even more questions about how Mob Entertainment plans to conclude the story.</p>







<p>If you’re trying to piece together what it all means, you’re in the right place—Insider Gaming has broken down the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a> ending and explored what it could signal for the future of the franchise.</p>



<p>It should go without saying, but just in case it was unclear, <strong>Major spoilers ahead!</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-ending-explained">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 Ending Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>At long last. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The ending kicks off with Huggy Wuggy and Kissy Missy finally being reunited with one another—that is, until the Prototype barges in. </strong></p>



<p>After evading him at Lily Lovebraids’ tea party, the Prototype is back with a vengeance, as they make swift work of Huggy Wuggy and Kissy Missy, practically killing them in the process—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-huggy-wuggy-or-kissy-missy-die-in-poppy-playtime-chapter-5/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/did-huggy-wuggy-or-kissy-missy-die-in-poppy-playtime-chapter-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though their fates remain up in the air</a>. </p>



<p>It’s every man for themselves at this point, and the protagonist swiftly boards the train in an effort to escape the hulking Prototype. However, the metallic, arachnid body manages to keep up, and after a back and forth across the carriages, the train explodes with the Prototype onboard. </p>

</ul>



<p>You didn’t think it’d be that easy, did you? Before long, he rises out of the wreckage and gives the protagonist the same treatment that they gave the Wuggys—a sharp stab through the chest. As if that wasn’t bad enough, you’re dumped into a vat of Poppy Gel and left for dead. </p>







<p>Thankfully, Giblet is there to save the day, as you’re revived and shocked back to life. It’s revealed that the Prototype took off with Poppy, and you might think that Chapter 5 would end there, but there’s still one more big reveal left in store…</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-backup-in-poppy-playtime-chapter-5">What Is The Backup In Poppy Playtime Chapter 5? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>He’s back. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s not over yet, as you and Giblet finally arrive at the Data Storage, where the ‘Backup’ is supposed to be. </strong></p>



<p>You’ve been searching for it all chapter, and now it’s right in front of you. An old computer lies there waiting to be turned on, and once you bypass the Override, it’s finally activated, only for a familiar face—or eye—to be revealed. </p>



<ul>

Price, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The Backup isn’t just some files or documents that might help you defeat the Prototype. No, it’s much worse than that, as it’s none other than Harley Sawyer—the man behind converting orphans into the monstrous toys you’re constantly evading. As the computer boots up, the same eye flickers, looks around, before dropping one final, haunting line to close out the chapter. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Well now, this is a rather interesting turn of events…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Will he be friend or foe? Does he know how to destroy the Prototype? And will he even be willing to help you? There are tons of questions left unanswered once the credits roll, and it’s going to be an excruciating wait before an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inevitable Chapter 6 rolls around</a>, but one thing is clear: Harley Sawyer is back, and you’re going to need his help.</p>

<p>No one ever thought the day would come when we would return to the bombed-out, decrepit remains of Raccoon City. Resident Evil Requiem gives everyone one more round, and if you’re ready to load the chamber again, find out when the Resident Evil Requiem release date is and expected release times.</p>



<p>There’s always a special vibe when a new Resi game is on the way. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> isn’t <em>just</em> a new game; it brings back Leon Kennedy for his first new outing since Resident Evil 6 (not counting the remakes). Throw in Grace Ashcroft, a lot of combat, puzzles, and the odd zombie, and you know you’re in for a good time.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A new, terrifying tale. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem has set a date with destiny for February 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>When Requiem was first announced, there were so many questions: How will Grace differ from Chris, Jill, Leon, and everyone that came before? Then, with RPD being sighted, we wondered if Leon was going to make one final bow.</p>

</ul>



<p>So much has been learned since Requiem first came to light. Once the February 27 release date was locked in, it immediately became a date for the diary. Whether you’re taking a mysterious sick day or you’ve booked it off, everyone will be there on launch day for the next chapter in the mainline timeline. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-9-release-times">Resident Evil 9 Release Times</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could change. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to the PlayStation Store, Resident Evil Requiem launches at 9 PM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Companies generally only post release time sheets on social media a day or two before launch. Right now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> has done no such thing for Requiem. On the plus side, the PlayStation Store is known for posting an early look at a game’s launch time.</p>



<p>However, it must be said that this isn’t 100% accurate. It could change, and if it does, check back in as the guide is updated with new information to reflect this.</p>
