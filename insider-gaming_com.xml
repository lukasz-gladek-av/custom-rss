<p>Unknown 9: Awakening Developer Reflector Entertainment has announced that it is reducing the studio’s total workforce by 18%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developer of Unknown 9: Awakening announced on its <a href="https://reflectorentertainment.com/en/news/message-to-the-reflector-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unknown-9-developer-reflector-entertainment-reportedly-suffers-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameIndustry.Biz</a>) that it is shifting its focus as it enters a new phase of development. These changes aim to help the studio deliver on its objectives more efficiently and ensure that each team member can contribute meaningfully to ongoing projects. As a result, 18% of the workforce has been laid off.</p>



<p>Reflector Entertainment has announced that this decision is due to their “current reality,” which prevents them from guaranteeing “tangible work” for all employees. The studio will offer severance packages and access to medical support, emotional assistance, and career planning resources to ensure a smooth transition for those affected.</p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have stated that this decision will allow them “to take the necessary time” to refine and perfect their upcoming projects. The studio has released Unknown 9: Awakening and has two key production lines entering the early stages of development. They require their staff to be “laser-focused on contributing to the projects that wholly benefit from their skillsets.”</p>
