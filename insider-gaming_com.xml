<p>WWE 2K26’s new MyFACTION Team Chemistry will be influenced by, and change with, WWE TV feuds, alliances, and faction changes.</p>



<p>Team Chemistry is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-myfaction-adds-team-chemistry-and-quickswap/" id="178385">new features coming to MyFACTION in WWE 2K26</a>. Team Chemistry scores are influenced by both positive and negative reactions from factions. Scores can also be lowered by specific traits. There are 60 traits across 10 categories, with 30 positive and 30 negative to work with.</p>



<p>While it was presumed that current factions would gel together well in the game, it is now confirmed that as characters change on WWE television, their alliances will change in MYFACTION as well.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-show-never-stops-in-wwe-2k26-myfaction">The Show Never Stops in WWE 2K26 MyFACTION</h2>



<p>In a new interview with Richard Breslin of <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/wwe-2k26-confirms-world-tour-returns-856247-20260220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GAMINGbible</a>, MyFACTION associate designer Brian Mazique explains how storylines on TV can change MyFACTION. When factions break up on current WWE TV, new cards featuring former stablemates will have bad chemistry with one another.</p>



<p>For example, he mentioned Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan. While the Judgment Day stablemates are friendly right now, Morgan eliminated Rodriguez from the WWE Royal Rumble. Should that rift widen, future cards of Morgan and Rodriguez will have bad chemistry. Furthermore, he notes that players can mix and match to find the right chemistry cards to achieve different actions and traits.</p>



<p>“It’s a bit safe using positive chemistry with legendary factions like DX or the nWo, and things can change with current roster talent. But there will be other ways for players to experiment with cards and find the right chemistry combo for them to achieve different actions and traits, especially when creating unique factions,” said Brian.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Windrose has surpassed a major milestone pertaining to Steam wishlists.</p>



<p>Windrose is an upcoming pirate-themed survival, crafting, open-world PvE game. A demo was released during Steam Next Fest on February 17, where the game reached 22,000 concurrent players. Following that public demo, the game has been wishlisted by over 1 million Steam accounts.</p>



<p>The development team commented on the milestone with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3041230/view/498346952550778886?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a message on Steam.</a></p>



<p>“This past week has been a real whirlwind for our team with all the attention the game has been getting. And as the spotlight grows, so do expectations. We’re working hard every day to live up to them,” they wrote. ” Our biggest goal is to ship a great game and let you be the judge. It may take time, but with your support, this journey becomes a lot easier (and a bit more swashbuckling, too).”</p>



<p>The game was announced back in December during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted Showcase. There’s no set release date or price point for the game at this time. It is currently scheduled to release in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Chris Stockman, the design director of the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/saints-row/" id="1267">Saints Row</a>, has provided an update that is disheartening for the series’ fans.</p>



<p>The last we heard of Saints Row, Stockman said he had been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saints-row-1-director-asked-to-create-a-pitch-for-a-prequel/">asked to create a pitch</a> for a prequel to the series. At the time, he said that his dreams were a little closer to coming true. However, in his latest update, he seems to believe that the franchise as a whole is a thing of the past.</p>







<h2>Chris Stockman Feels Embracer Has No Ability to Do Anything with Saints Row</h2>



<p>There hasn’t been a Saints Row game since 2022. Replying to a user on Discord, Stockman said that he believed the franchise was dead. He went on to express his belief that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embracer/" id="2740">Embracer</a>, the parent company that owns the Saints Row IP, has no ability to do anything with the platform and stated that they ghosted him after he tried his best to offer a pathway forward.</p>



<p>“I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately. I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it. I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a pathway forward, but they’ve ghosted me,” he said.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Remember when we got excited about the prospect of a Saints Row prequel? Well according to Saints Row 1 Design Director Chris Stockman, Embracer is completely ignoring the idea.

Saints Row is once again dead.</span></p></article></div>







<h2 id="h-stockman-s-take-on-gta-6">Stockman’s Take on GTA 6</h2>



<p>Saints Row was once viewed as an alternative to Grand Theft Auto. GTA 6 is still on the way and is the most anticipated game of its generation. </p>



<p>Chris Stockman has previously stated that he believes the upcoming Grand Theft Auto Title would be deserving of a $100 price point. Read his full comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-deserves-100-saints-row-director-insists/" id="152091">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An apparent accident on the Southeast Asian YouTube page for Bandai Namco has revealed that the forthcoming Dragon Ball Game, codenamed Age 1000, is actually the next Xenoverse game in the Dragon Ball franchise.</p>



<p>The reveal was spotted by several individuals online when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bandai-namco/" id="1300">Bandai Namco</a> Southeast Asia had placed the Age 1000 reveal trailer in a now-deleted playlist titled “DRAGON BALL Xenoverse 3.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-xenoverse-3-has-been-a-long-time-coming">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 3 Has Been A Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>It’s been nearly a full decade since the last game in the franchise was released. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2/" id="2178">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a> was released in October 2016. The game has received numerous quality-of-life updates and has proven to be one of the most enduring modern Action RPGs.</p>



<p>The premise of the Dragon Ball Xenoverse titles is for players to create their own character in the universe of Z Fighters and level them up while experiencing brand new stories featuring classic heroes and villains from the Dragon Ball franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/" id="171842">When the game was revealed in January</a>, some believed it would be a follow-up to Dragon Ball Online, a 2010 MMORPG that has since been replaced by the Xenoverse line.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-game-features-new-work-from-akira-toriyama">The Game Features New Work From Akira Toriyama</h2>



<p>Despite his unfortunate passing in 2024, this new game will feature work from Akira Toriyama himself. Work began on the Age of 1000 project more than half a decade ago, and as such, Toriyama was able to work on world-building for the new title and brand-new characters.</p>



<p>More information about the game will be revealed during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour on April 18 and 19.
