<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of XDefiant and its studios</a>, Yves Guillemet sent an internal memo to Ubisoft employees about its future.</p>



<p>The internal memo reads,</p>



<p>“Hello everyone, </p>



<p>It has been some time since I last spoke to you, and I apologize for this silence, especially as the past months have been challenging and unsettling for Ubisoft and likely for each of you. </p>



<p>The announcement by Marie-Sophie regarding the discontinuation of XDefiant, the closure of the San Francisco and Osaka studios, and the ramp down of the Sydney production site is among the difficult decisions we’ve had to make. </p>



<p>I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the tremendous work done by the XDefiant’s teams. Their goal was to challenge the best shooter on the market, but despite the intensity of their efforts, it was not enough. </p>



<p>To everyone leaving Ubisoft, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the work you have accomplished and the contributions you have made. We will do everything possible to provide you with the best support during this transition phase. </p>



<p>We wanted to take a firm and clear decision to enable us to concentrate our investments and forces on more profitable projects. </p>



<p>I am well aware that, given the current context, such announcements may worry you, and that’s understandable. The entire industry is facing similar difficult decisions, yet often the scale of the impact is much larger. Our organization has allowed us to limit the impact of these kinds of decisions and make more targeted restructurings, and all our efforts are focused on trying to maintain this course and philosophy. We will continue working on evolving our organization to adapt it to market changes, and with a long-term perspective in mind. </p>



<p>Over the past few weeks, I’ve had the chance to read the results of the Ubisoft XP 2024 survey. The vast majority of you participated: the response rate was over 86%, and you’ve shared your questions and concerns about the future of Ubisoft via more than 55,000 comments.</p>



<p> I would like to sincerely thank you for your commitment, the quality of your feedback, and your collective intelligence. It’s very impressive. We are compelled to take your critiques to heart, live up to your expectations, and be accountable to you and your needs. </p>



<p>I want you to know that all my energy is focused on finding the means to guide Ubisoft through these turbulent times. I am working tirelessly with my team to identify the best solutions so we can maintain control of our destiny. </p>



<p>This company – the incredible gem we’ve built together over the past 38 years – means everything to me. It’s a part of who I am, it’s in my core. </p>



<p>I’m doing everything I can to help us regain momentum, so that we can continue to make Ubisoft a key player in our industry, a creator known for its unique and exceptional video games. </p>



<p>In the coming days, some members of the Executive Committee will reach out to you. Cécile Russeil will share new initiatives aimed at addressing some of the questions raised by Ubisoft XP. Marie-Sophie de Waubert will present initiatives to bring back a daily focus on creation, ensuring fewer unnecessary processes and more time dedicated to what truly matters to each of us: making the best games possible. Alain Corre will provide updates on the launch of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, progress made in strengthening our relationship with gamers, particularly regarding The Crew Motorfest and Star Wars Outlaws. </p>



<p>Thank you sincerely for your daily commitment and the quality of your work. The greatest strength of Ubisoft is its people. That strength is you. Thank you. </p>



<p>Yves”</p>







<p>Yves’ email came following the internal announcement from Marie-Sophie de Waubert that XDefiant and some of its studios would be closing. XDefiant’s closure will see 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney.</p>



<p>You can read Marie-Sophie de Waubert’s internal memo below:</p>



<p>Marie-Sophie</p>



<p>Hello all, Today, I wanted to share with you that we’ve made the difficult decision to discontinue development on XDefiant. </p>



<p>Despite an encouraging start, the team’s passionate work, and a committed fan base, we’ve not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market. As a result, the game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment, and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it. </p>



<p>Concretely, that means that as of today, new downloads, player registrations and purchases will no longer be available. Season 3 will still launch, and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025, out of appreciation for both our dev teams who worked on it and for XDefiant’s active players. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the discontinuation of XDefiant brings difficult consequences for the teams working on this game. Even if almost half of the XDefiant team worldwide will be transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft, this decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney. To those team members leaving Ubisoft, I want to express my deepest gratitude for your work and contributions. Please know that we are committed to supporting you during this transition. </p>



<p>Developing Games-as-a-Service experiences remains a pillar of our strategy, and we’ve achieved significant successes, like Rainbow Six, The Crew, and For Honor, among others. It’s a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles. </p>



<p>Globally, we are determined to take the necessary steps to put the company back on a path to growth, innovation and creativity and make sure we can set you up for success. This means continuing to radically evolve our mindset for Production and Business practices, which we will share more about soon, and doing targeted restructuring when necessary. I know that the situation brings questions and expectations, and we will share regular and transparent updates. </p>



<p>My sincere thanks for your continued dedication as we navigate these trying times together. </p>



<p>Marie-Sophie”</p>

<p>UFL is finally making its way to the pitch with a full Trophies and Achievements list. The free-to-play soccer title is looking to rival the best in the business, and while competing on the pitch, you also need to be as adept off it if you want every UFL Achievement and Trophy.</p>



<p>Multiple betas and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ufl-launch-delayed-strikerz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushbacks</a> later, and it’s time for UFL to make its mark. The new kid on the block wants to disrupt an established market dominated by the same two names—EA FC and eFootball. Using the last few years of the Premier League as an example, EA FC is Manchester City, and eFootball is Liverpool—which hurts to say as a Liverpool fan. The point is that few others have laid down a creditable title challenge, and this is where UFL steps in.</p>



<p>With high-profile investors on board—including Cristiano Ronaldo—UFL is looking to shake things up, and its Achievements and Trophies list is sure to appeal to many.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-ufl">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements in UFL?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Many matches come down to the wire. Credit to Strikerz Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>UFL has 25 Xbox Achievements and a further 26 PlayStation Trophies to obtain in the soccer simulation title.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re on PlayStation, you get an extra intangible award thanks to the Platinum Trophy. This is awarded once you complete the other 25 Trophies on the list. Xbox players simply get to pat themself on the back once they bag the 25th and final Achievement!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-ufl-achievement-amp-trophy">Every UFL Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p>Many of the UFL Trophies and Achievements are standard objectives for what you’d find in a game like this. Completing Ranked Matches, changing tactics, and being active in the transfer market all reward you with Achievements and Trophies.</p>



<p>Check out the full UFL list in its entirety—thanks to <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/UFL/achievements#:~:text=Here%20is%20the%20full%20list%20of%20all%2025,squad.%20Add%20your%20squad%27s%20third%20kit%20in%20Customization." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueAchievements</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/msi-claw-ai-devices-available-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/msi%E2%80%99s-upgraded-claw-ai-handhelds-are-available-now-but-they%E2%80%99re-expensive.1051371/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/msi-claw-ai-devices-available-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>MSI has released the souped-up Claw AI+ handheld units, unveiling in full the Claw 8 AI+ and the Claw 7 AI+. As the latest entrants into the handheld market, the AI+ devices boast several key innovations that’ll have gamers considering securing one over a close competitor, like the ASUS ROG Ally X.</p>



<p>The larger unit – the Claw 8 AI+ – will cost you a pretty penny, though. MSI has advised that the RRP for this device is $899.</p>



<p>Read on to learn what MSI is doing to make that price point seem worthwhile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-msi-claw-ai-is-on-the-market">MSI Claw AI+ Is On The Market</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-s-New-Claw-8-AI----Claw-7-AI--Handheld-with-Powerful-Performance-and-Low-Power-Consumption--Available-Now--145096?utm_source=msi-news-feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=msi-news&amp;utm_content=MSI%27s%20New%20Claw%208%20AI%2B%20%26%20Claw%207%20AI%2B%20Handheld%20with%20Powerful%20Performance%20and%20Low%20Power%20Consumption-%20Available%20Now%21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new MSI Claw AI+ handhelds</a> utilise Intel Core Ultra 7 processors and Arc graphics, and by all accounts, they boast some of the sharpest handheld gaming experiences available right now.</p>



<p>It might seem like a mid-generation refresh, but the MSI Claw AI+ range is much more.</p>



<p>The Claw 8 AI+ is the pick of the bunch, boasting an 8-inch 1080p 120Hz IPS display that offers crisp visuals and a smooth refresh rate. MSI has claimed that the Claw 8 AI+ offers around 20% better performance than competing devices, like the ROG Ally X. </p>



<p>The Claw 8 AI+ is riddled with tech, that’s for sure. It features Thunderbolt 4 ports for fast charging, which means the 80Wh battery will go from flat to full in no time at all. It now features hall-effect triggers and the on-board software has received a significant upgrade from MSI.</p>



<p>With 32 GB of RAM, the MSI Claw AI+ range outpaces the ROG Ally X, which totes just 24 GB of RAM.</p>



<p>Between the two devices (Claw 8 and Claw 7), there are some major differences. The larger device has a much more powerful battery, and it has better WiFi capabilities – it also weighs 120g more. </p>



<p>MSI has promised a more optimised experience with the in-built AI capabilities of the Claw 8 and Claw 7 devices. They’re built with power consumption, visuals, and ergonomics in mind, it’s just up to you if those enhancements are worth the $899 price tag.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-ceo-ai-human-game-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-human-touch-will-be-crucial%E2%80%99-playstation%E2%80%99s-ceo-on-ai-in-game-development.1051362/</guid>

<p>Hermen Hulst, one of PlayStation’s CEOs, has spoken to the BBC during the brand’s 30th anniversary. Before diving into the history of the company, Hulst was doorstepped with a question about AI in game development. It has been a sore spot for a while, with some developers leaning much more into AI, sometimes at the cost of human employees.</p>



<p>Hulst assured that while AI has the potential to revolutionise game development, ‘preserving the human touch’ is still of the utmost importance.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-authenticity">Authenticity</h2>



<p>In an interview with the BBC, Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino, the co-CEOs of PlayStation, spoke about the past, present, and future of the brand.</p>



<p>To open <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview</a>, Hermen Hulst spoke about AI in game development, given that he oversees software at Sony’s gaming giant, while Nishino focuses more on hardware development.</p>



<p>Hulst explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I suspect there will be a dual demand in gaming: one for AI-driven innovative experiences and another for handcrafted, thoughtful content</p>



<p>Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In many ways, AI is allowing for extraordinary leaps in the development process, allowing for procedural generation, the likes of which were previously unobtainable. AI is also being used to automate laborious, repetitive, or operationally impactful tasks that might have traditionally slowed down the development workflow.</p>



<p>In others, it’s putting jobs at risk, ‘stealing identities’, and putting fear into industry workers the world over.</p>



<p>As the interview unfolded, Hulst and Nishino explored the success of Astro Bot, recent leaps into live-action adaptations, and the origins of PlayStation. Nishino laid out a neat anecdote, recalling his mother’s toy store and how he would demo gaming devices for unaware shoppers when the technology was just starting to emerge.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s a world where AI and human-based game development can exist in sheer harmony? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The production of the second season of Fallout is well underway, and recently, Walton Goggins—who plays The Ghoul—appeared on social media to share a brief message. His post went hand-in-hand with a new image showing him in the makeup department having his ‘ghoul skin’ applied.</p>



<p>In Fallout, the live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic series that aired in April 2024, Goggins plays Cooper ‘The Ghoul’ Howard. He stars alongside Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten, and his performance in the show’s opening season was nothing short of stellar.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-feo-fuerte-y-formal">Feo Fuerte y Formal</h2>



<p>To celebrate his return to the character of The Ghoul, Walton Goggins posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It feels good to slip back into this skin. I do this shit for the love of the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was referencing a line his character utters in the show, and the image that accompanied the post showed him having a thick layer of prosthetics applied to portray a Fallout ‘ghoul’, a character warped by radiation.</p>



<p>In April, Fallout debuted on Prime, and it became the biggest launch the platform had ever seen. From there, things skyrocketed for the Fallout franchise. Across the entire suite of games, player counts and investment soared, and titles like Fallout 76 reached new heights, several years after being released.</p>



<p>It was recently suggested that the production for the second season of Fallout is moving ahead of schedule, but it’s still likely it won’t surface until 2026. These days, almost every show has a two-year gap between seasons, much to the chagrin of viewers.</p>



<p>For instance, the first season of The Last of Us was released in January 2023, and the second season isn’t expected to drop until a few months into 2025. </p>
