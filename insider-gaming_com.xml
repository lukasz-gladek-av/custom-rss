<p>Embark Studios has confirmed that recent server issues in ARC Raiders are due to DDoS attacks. </p>



<p>Since the new Headwinds update, players have been reporting several bugs and glitches, most notably one that causes a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-significantly-impacts-looting-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive drop in looting speed</a>. Additionally, several players observed stability issues, including being unable to move in the game. It seems the cause of the server issues has been found. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-hit-with-ddos-attacks-hotfix-arriving-later-today">ARC Raiders Hit with DDoS Attacks, Hotfix Arriving Later Today </h2>



<p>As revealed on the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/arcraiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> (via <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/arc-raiders-server-issues-caused-by-mass-embark-ddos-attack-as-devs-warn-players-not-to-login-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FRVR</a>), Embark Studios recently acknowledged the server issues in ARC Raiders and stated that they were actively investigating the issue. Now, it seems they have found the cause of this problem, as a new statement on the game’s official Discord says both ARC Raiders and THE FINAL are experiencing extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team is working to solve the problem, but at this moment, they are still facing attacks. </p>



<p>The developers have confirmed that a Hotfix will be released later today to address the bugs and glitches introduced by the Headwinds update, and the strike team is making “good progress” towards fixing the problem. Interested readers can check out the full statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey Raiders, both ARC Raiders and THE FINALS have been under extensive, co-ordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress – but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing. </p>



<p>Additionally, the team is also working on a hotfix which will solve some of the issues and unintended changes introduced in yesterday’s update, we hope to have that available later today. </p>



<p>We’ll update you all on progress as we have more information to share! </p>



<p>Stay vigilant, Raiders – and we’ll see you Topside when we’re through this.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders players have observed looting speed drops and server stability issues after the latest Headwinds update. </p>



<p>Embark Studios put out the Headwinds update for ARC Raiders yesterday, introducing new features and systems like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes-solo-vs-squads-bird-city-open-parties-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo vs squads, Bird City, Open Parties, and more</a>, along with new content. However, some bugs and glitches accompanied the new features and system, with several players experiencing issues. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-headwinds-update-impacts-looting-and-server-stability">ARC Raiders Headwinds Update Impacts Looting and Server Stability </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/embark-confirms-arc-raiders-new-update-broke-looting-speed-and-made-it-a-lot-slower-the-team-is-aware-of-this-as-its-not-intended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, the recent Headwinds update for ARC Raiders has significantly affected looting speed. Players have reported a 30% decrease in looting efficiency when using a skill designed to speed up the process. </p>



<p>This issue has been brought to the attention of the game’s official Discord, where community managers have responded. Community admin Ossen mentioned that Embark is “actively investigating” the problem, while community manager Boirdie confirmed that the “team is aware of this, as it’s not intended.”</p>



<p>Additionally, the Headwinds update appears to be causing the servers to become unstable, with players reporting multiple glitches and being unable to move once they load in. Embark has stated that this issue is under investigation as well, according to a post by CharlieIntel on <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2016474456655323351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). </p>
