<p>The Streamer Awards have wrapped for another year, and the trophies have all been dished out to the most deserving content creators of 2025. It was a mixed bag, and while most awards were fairly predictable, there were a few hidden gems in the line-up. The least surprising of all was the award for Best VTuber, which went to TheBurntPeanut.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has had a stellar year, putting up some remarkable numbers and growing at an alarming pace on account of his entertaining, high-energy content, hilarious animations, and genuinely enjoyable gameplay. This year, he pushed Ironmouse out of the spot that the former champion had held for three years straight.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-is-your-vtuber-of-the-year">TheBurntPeanut is Your VTuber of The Year</h2>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar with TheBurntPeanut, all you need to do is check out a compilation of his most entertaining clips on YouTube to get a taste of his brand. He’s an animated peanut that uses a mix of skins and ‘costumes’, combined with an energetic commentary and some hilarious gameplay, to keep tens of thousands of viewers entertained at any given time.</p>



<p>This year has been transformative for TheBurntPeanut, who has used games like Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders to propel himself into the major spotlight.</p>



<p>At The Streamer Awards this year, the nominations were pretty close to call:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chibidoki</li>



<li>Ironmouse</li>



<li>Kenji</li>



<li>Mori Calliope</li>



<li>TheBurntPeanut</li>
</ul>



<p>Ironmouse had previously won the VTuber of the Year award at The Streamer Awards for three consecutive years, but TheBurntPeanut’s stellar year managed to push him into the top spot.</p>



<p>In his acceptance speech, TheBurntPeanut said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am honored to accept this Best VTuber of the Year award.</p>



<p>It is a great honor to accept this Best VTuber of the Year award, big shout-out to QTCinderella for putting on this immaculate award ceremony as well as a shout-out to the Peanut team, making sure the streams are always the best they can be.</p>



<p>Obviously, the largest shout-out to the Bungulators, you guys are the best, thank you for all the support, gentlemen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full ceremony can be watched here:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>TheBurntPeanut also scooped the award for Best FPS Streamer, making him one of only a few streamers to walk away with more than one award at the event.</p>

            <guid>1375498</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major has already proven to be an energetic event loaded with drama and breakout performances, and the third stage is adding spice to that mix now that high-tier eliminations are taking place. In a decisive clash, FaZe Clan pushed 3DMAX off the board with a 2-0 sweep, fighting to keep their playoff dream alive.</p>



<p>FaZe walked into the series under some intense pressure, given their performance thus far, which has resulted in losses against both Team Spirit and The MongolZ.</p>



<p>What will happen next for FaZe Clan? Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-faze-clan-remains-firm-for-now">FaZe Clan Remains Firm For Now</h2>



<p>The earlier losses for FaZe Clan at the Budapest Major raised questions about the roster’s cohesion and ability to adapt, but coming out against the underdog squad 3DMAX, the team looked somewhat revitalized. Going forward, FaZe Clan will need to hammer home the point against Passion UA to break a 2-2 lock for both squads.</p>



<p>For 3DMAX, the StarLadder Budapest Major marks the end of their 2025 sprint. The squad did well to reach this far, but they scraped through the second stage and failed to make waves in the third. It was a tough ask, though. The team was pitted against the likes of FaZe, Vitality, and paiN during the awkward run, which is a huge hill to overcome for any squad.</p>



<p>During the short-lived series, FaZe Clan barely gave 3DMAX a chance for respite. The first map, played out on Dust2, was a wash, and FaZe Clan’s Jakub ‘jcobbb’ Pietruszewski wasted no time showing why he was a valuable new signing with a stunning quad kill. The end scoreline was 13-6, setting the tone perfectly.</p>



<p>The second round was even more dominant, with jcobbb showing up again and the FaZe squad managing to secure a 15-5 finish to push 3DMAX from the tournament.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan’s final match in this stage will be against Passion UA, while six other teams will also look to break the 2-2 deadlock:</p>



<ul>
<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>
</ul>

<p>Use these Roblox Catch A Monster monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Coins, Potions, XP and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the ultra-popular Japanese anime series Pokémon? If so, you need to stop what you’re doing and check out Catch A Monster on Roblox immediately. Catch A Monster can be considered the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-crash-bots-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> version of the various Pokémon games that have been released over the years. Players have to catch a variety of creatures and train them by fighting both trainers as well as other creatures. Each player will have a limited party of monsters they can have at any time, so picking the right ones is of crucial importance.&nbsp;</p>







<p>By training these creatures, players can increase their level and make them stronger, thereby allowing them to defeat harder and more powerful enemies. Players start the game on a basic island and have to work their way up the ladder, while also hatching eggs to gain pets. Bosses spawn at predetermined locations every 15 minutes in Catch A Monster, offering guaranteed drops and rewards. With plenty of things to do and a large open world to explore, fans of the popular Japanese series will surely enjoy their time in Catch A Monster.</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Catch A Monster is a simple process that doesn’t require players to complete any steps in advance. Input any of the active codes into the correct text box after navigating through the game’s menus to claim your rewards. If you’re new to the Roblox environment, however, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide that will make redeeming codes a walk in the park:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Catch A Monster.</li>



<li>Click on the Gift icon on the right side of the screen.</li>



<li>input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem’ button to claim your rewards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-catch-a-monster-codes">How To Get More Catch A Monster Codes</h2>



<p>Catch A Monster codes are usually released either through the game’s official channels or on the developers’ socials. Keeping track of all of these though, can be a hassle, especially because players are not notified when any of the existing codes expire. This is why we encourage all players to keep this page bookmarked, as we update it with new codes as soon as they release, while expired codes are also moved to their corresponding section.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release date for Phantom Blade Zero will be revealed during The Game Awards 2025. It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-release-date-reveal-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in August</a> that the Wuxia-inspired title will have its launch date shown before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Announced in 2023, Phantom Blade Zero follows an elite assassin finding the killer of The Order’s patriarch. With a mix of Soulslike gameplay and RPG staples, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zeros-boss-ai-uses-popular-fighting-game-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its intricate combat system</a> has been a highlight for fans. Earlier this year at the Future Games Show @ Gamescom, director Soulframe Liang stated that the game’s release date would be announced before 2025 ends. While many expected it to be at The Game Awards, it’s now been confirmed to be shown during the event.</p>







<h2 id="h-world-premiere-of-phantom-blade-zero-release-date-to-come-at-the-game-awards-2025">World Premiere of Phantom Blade Zero Release Date to Come at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1997456018897297841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> by The Game Awards, a short video reveals that Phantom Blade Zero’s release date will be unveiled at the event.  The video shows the protagonist painting a Chinese dragon, which goes berserk at the end of the clip. While no gameplay is shown in the short clip, it’s likely fans will see more at the world premiere.</p>



<p>Dated for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 11th</a>, The Game Awards are already stacked with reveals. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-look-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and Devil May Cry, there’s much to look forward to. Plus, with the mysterious statue that many are still figuring out, it’s sure to be one to watch. Now, Phantom Blade Zero joins the roster, with at least something certain being shown: the release date. 2026 is already a packed year with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and 007 First Light, but S-GAME’s action title is definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>Embark Studios has delayed the upcoming next part of the ARC Raiders’ Expedition Project. The Expedition, which now opens a few days later, will give you new items but practically wipe out your progress.</p>



<p>One of 2025’s hottest games has been the extraction shooter ARC Raiders. Made by Embark Studios (The Finals), the shooter has been quite popular with players and streamers. From peace pacts to all-out war, the title has already topped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-searched-game-2025-drop-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most-searched games</a> on Google and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-map-visit-25-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consistently broken player records</a> on Steam. On the roadmap, it was teased that the next expedition departure would be announced. Now, Embark Studios has revealed more info on the next Expedition, including a two-day delay.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-expedition-project-now-starts-december-17th-launching-december-22nd">ARC Raiders Expedition Project Now Starts December 17th, Launching December 22nd.</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>After a minor delay in the tunnels, the Expedition departure window will open on Dec 17; this is your Raider’s chance to roll out in the Caravan you’ve built and leave the Rust Belt behind.<br>Prepare to start a fresh new adventure with a brand new Raider, and…</p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1997350326311989689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog</a> on the ARC Raiders site, Embark Studios revealed that <strong>the next Expedition won’t start its window on December 15th</strong> as planned. Instead, <strong>the Expedition window will last from December 17th to the 22nd</strong>. Now, instead of players leaving on December 20th, the 22nd is now when those who signed up will depart The Rust Belt on their Caravan.</p>



<p>While the details of the Expedition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-have-optional-progression-wipes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are known</a>, the blog mentions some information regarding it. For one, player progress will be wiped, which includes blueprints, skill tree, level, stash, workshop, and crafting abilities. However, permanent upgrades like more inventory slots, XP boosts, and skill points will be included. It is a big choice to go on the Expedition, but seeing how ARC Raiders has shaped up to be since release, it does seem like a risk worth taking.</p>
