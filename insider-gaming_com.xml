<p>An official blog post released by Xbox today, the company inadvertently included a mock-up of the Xbox user interface that included a tab labeled Steam. Microsoft and Xbox have already removed the image from the post, but might have shown their desire to release an Xbox that could play games from your Steam library.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-xbox-players-finally-get-to-play-games-from-their-steam-library">Will Xbox Players Finally Get to Play Games From Their Steam Library?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> in question was penned by Leo Olebe, VP of Global Partnerships at Xbox, and titled “GDC 2025: Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox.” The original featured image, as discovered by XboxEra, highlighted a number of devices displaying the Xbox games library interface, including on a laptop, a phone, and an ROG Ally. In the background, a closer look at the library UI could be seen. And next to filters like Installed, Game Pass, and Recently Added, is one that simply reads “Steam.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Considering that it’s placed between Game Pass and Owned, the implication is that players in the future can access games owned on Steam though their Xbox library. This leads to speculation that the next Xbox could allow players to play Steam titles on the Xbox. Xbox is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-is-partnering-with-asus-for-upcoming-gaming-handheld-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly working on a new handheld in partnership with Asus</a>.</p>



<p>The blog post that remains up features numerous statements that support the “open” philosophy that Xbox has supported the past couple years. “We believe that gamers should be able to play the games they want, with the people they want, anywhere they want,” Olebe wrote. “Central to this vision is empowering game creators to deliver exceptional content across all platforms seamlessly. Our goal is simple: to make every screen in the world an Xbox.” Olebe also touted the Stream Your Own Game service which lets Game Pass subscribers to purchase and stream games “across PCs, mobile devices, and Smart TVs.”</p>

<p>Ubisoft has just announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows surpassed 1 million players on the first day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The official Assassin’s Creed account on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> has just posted, “It’s not even 4 PM here in Canada, and Assassin’s Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players!” The developers have thanked the community for helping them reach this meaningful milestone. Ubisoft’s Day One release plans on Steam <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shows-success-as-day-one-steam-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seem to be going well</a> for the game, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows had to undergo several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays</a> before releasing today, March 20. However, it seems the delays have helped, as the developers’ constant effort to polish and improve the experience has helped Shadows cross the 1 million mark on its first day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the franchise’s latest entry, taking players to Feudal Japan. This time, you play two characters: Yasuke, the Legendary Samurai, and Naoe, the stealthy assassin. The developers want you to explore this era of Japan to the fullest, and they have built the open world with castle towns, ports, peaceful shrines and war-ravaged landscapes for players to explore. Moreover, the game features changing seasons and reactive environments, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new comic book one-shot inspired by the immensely popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=marvel+rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> game, titled Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1, is coming to comic book shops this summer. The series features stories from some incredible Japanese comic book artists, including some who’s character designs have already appeared in-game.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-ignite-first-of-likely-many-game-inspired-comics">Marvel Rivals: Ignite First of Likely Many Game-Inspired Comics</h2>



<p>Marvel <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/marvel-rivals-ignite-new-comic-book-series-variant-covers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1 will feature a trio of stories from comic book artists Peach Momoko, Yuji Kaku, Mitsuyasu Sakai and Ryusei Yamada. Each of the three stories will feature two playable characters doing head-to-head. Sai (Psylocke) will take on Venom, Luna Snow will travel to Asgard to face Hela, and Punisher goes “face-to-face” with Peni Parker.</p>



<p>Momoko, who is authoring and drawing the Venom vs. Sai story, became a popular face in the comic book world though her own “Momoko-verse,” where she reimagined various Marvel characters through the lens of Japanese folktales. She’s currently writing the Ultimate X-Men series, but she’s contributed designs for in-game Peni Parker and Spider-Man skins based on her own unique style. It’s possible these skin designs of hers eventually launch in-game around June 11th, when Marvel Rivals: Ignite hits stores. Today’s announcement says that “Momoko’s new wave of in-game costumes take center stage” in Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1.</p>







<p>Manga artist Yuji Kaku is writing and drawing the Punisher vs. Peni Parker story. Kaku has only contributed to a couple of Marvel projects recently, but is famous for penning the Hell’s Paradise: Jigokuraku manga, which was adapted into an anime in 2023. Finally, writer Mitsuyasu Sakai and artist Ryusei Yamada will take on the story featuring Luna Snow and Hela. Sakai has written scripts for Japanese animation for nearly 30 years, including the episode “The Duel” from the Star Wars: Visions series. Ryusei Yamada adapted the anime REVENGER into a manga series in 2023.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement from Marvel implies that more one-shots inspired by Marvel Rivals could hit comic book stores in the future. Will you be heading to the comic book shop to pick up Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1 on June 11th?
