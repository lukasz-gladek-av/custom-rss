<p>Highguard is finally here, and after a long month of waiting and speculating, we finally know what the game is about. Not only do we know how the game plays, but we also know what it’s launching with, and it’s a whole lot of content. </p>



<p>For live-service games like Highguard intends to be, it’s important to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep content pouring in</a>. However, if there isn’t enough to start with, then players won’t have anything to get hooked to.</p>







<p>It doesn’t seem like Highguard will have that issue, as there’s a wealth of content to explore at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-wardens-amp-mounts-available-for-highguard-launch">All Wardens &amp; Mounts Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who is your pick? Image by Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are eight Wardens to choose from, each with their own abilities and skills, as well as three different Mounts. More are scheduled to come with future content updates.</strong></p>



<p>It looks like there’s a nice variety of Wardens to choose from in Highguard, with five playstyles seemingly catered for with their classes. There are three Assault and two Defensive Wardens, making them the most common class at launch.</p>



<p>The eight Wardens available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Warden Name</th><th data-align="center">Warden Class</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Redmane</td><td data-align="center">Destruction</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Condor</td><td data-align="center">Recon</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Atticus</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kai</td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mara </td><td data-align="center">Support</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Una </td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Scarlet</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Slade</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The three Mounts available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Horse</li>



<li>Panther</li>



<li>Bear</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-maps-amp-bases-available-for-highguard-launch">All Maps &amp; Bases Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Explore before the sword falls. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five maps to play at launch for Highguard, with a roster of six Bases to select from each match.</strong></p>



<p>Wildlight Entertainment describe the Maps and Bases very distinctly. The Maps are more open-world environments full of loot and gear to collect, whilst the Bases are smaller, typical FPS-style areas that offer more close-quarters combat. It looks set to offer diverse gameplay scenarios, and it’s notably different from other titles in the genre.</p>







<p>Here’s all five Maps available at launch in Highguard: </p>



<ul>
<li>Dustline</li>



<li>Kingdom</li>



<li>Rivermark</li>



<li>Summit</li>



<li>Vesper City</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-weapons-available-for-highguard-launch">All Weapons Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A solid selection. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ten Primary Weapons are available at launch in Highguard, with three Raid Weapons up for selection too—and don’t forget your Melee Axe!</strong></p>



<p>That makes a total of 14 weapons in Highguard, with plenty more bound to arrive across the year. It’s a simple but healthy selection that should hopefully see balancing not become an issue so early in the game’s lifecycle. </p>



<p>Here’s all 14 weapons available at launch in Highguard:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Weapon Name</th><th data-align="center">Weapon Type</th><th data-align="center">Weapon Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Corsair</td><td data-align="center">SMG</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kraken</td><td data-align="center">Pump-Action Shotgun</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Paladin</td><td data-align="center">Full-Auto Shotgun</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Viper</td><td data-align="center">SMG</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vanguard</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Big Rig</td><td data-align="center">LMG</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Dynasty</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Saber Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Burst Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Longhorn</td><td data-align="center">Revolver</td><td data-align="center">Marksman</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Ranger</td><td data-align="center">Bolt-Action Sniper</td><td data-align="center">Marksman</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Blast Hammer</td><td data-align="center">Sledgehammer</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Zipline</td><td data-align="center">Utility</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rocket Launcher</td><td data-align="center">Rocket Launcher</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Axe</td><td data-align="center">Axe</td><td data-align="center">Melee</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Developer Wildlight Entertainment went big with a year-long 2026 roadmap for Highguard. It features information on each episode and what to expect from every batch of new content: Each includes a new Warden and much more.</p>



<p>The time for talking is over as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> is out now. Geoff Keighley bigged it up as the second coming of Apex Legends and Titanfall, and it’s not bad at all. If you think Highguard’s base-raiding action is something that’ll keep you gripped for a while, then you need the full 2026 roadmap hub bookmarked for the good times ahead.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-1-2026-roadmap-content-explained">Highguard Episode 1 2026 Roadmap Content, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shoot to kill. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Highguard Episode 1 is the launch-day content. You obviously need content to get a game going, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-is-finally-getting-a-gameplay-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay showcase</a> revealed the shooter’s first Wardens, maps, guns, and the rest of the glitz and glamour for opening day:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 Maps</li>



<li>6 Bases</li>



<li>8 Wardens</li>



<li>3 Mounts</li>



<li>10 Weapons</li>



<li>3 Raid Tools</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-2-2026-roadmap-content-february-to-march">Highguard Episode 2 2026 Roadmap Content—February to March</h2>



<p>Following up on the launch episode is Episode 2, and this one debuts a fresh Warden, map, and Ranked Mode. Here’s the full list of content announced:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Map</li>



<li>Ranked Mode</li>



<li>New Mount</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Raid Tool</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-3-2026-roadmap-content-april-to-may">Highguard Episode 3 2026 Roadmap Content—April to May</h2>



<p>You’re going to see a familiar theme with a lot of this content as we go. The character selection screen will become more full, and the meta will be shaken up with a new weapon:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Loot Item</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-4-2026-roadmap-content-june-to-july">Highguard Episode 4 2026 Roadmap Content—June to July</h2>



<p>The biggest addition in Episode 4’s content (featuring the tropical months of the year!) is a new Limited-Time Mode. There aren’t many mentions of LTMs in the 2026 roadmap, so it’ll be interesting to see what the new mode is:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Map</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Limited-Time Mode</li>



<li>New Amulets</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-5-2026-roadmap-content-august-to-september">Highguard Episode 5 2026 Roadmap Content—August to September</h2>



<p>Episode 5 looks like a standard couple of months of new content. New additions to many of the Highguard’s core components await:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mount</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Loot Item</li>



<li>New Amulets</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-6-2026-roadmap-content-october-to-november">Highguard Episode 6 2026 Roadmap Content—October to November</h2>



<p>We’re getting the word, ‘Surprise.’ Given that it falls during Episode 6 and the Halloween season, it’s reasonable to assume the community is getting special spooky surprises, events, and costume tie-ins. Will Highguard do crossovers? We’ll have to see, check out the haul:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Map</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>Surprise</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Amulets</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-7-2026-roadmap-content-december">Highguard Episode 7 2026 Roadmap Content—December</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big 12 months awaits. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Rounding off Highguard’s first year is a rather sparse Episode 7, but more details are sure to be revealed closer to the time. A Winter-themed event and content are expected, and it carries on the tradition of a new Warden every Episode:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>Surprise</li>



<li>New Mods</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s always an element of unpredictability with a new live-service game. Highguard looks the part, but it remains to be seen if it can maintain its player base.

<p>Triple H is on the cover of the Deluxe Edition of WWE 2K26.</p>



<p>2K Games announced on Twitter that Paul “Triple H” Levesque would be featured on the cover of the Deluxe Edition, dubbed the “King of Kings Edition,” for the upcoming WWE 2K26 game. </p>



<p>A two-time WWE Hall of Famer, Triple H has appeared in every WWE video game since his debut in WWF In Your House, the 1996 title released for the original PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC.</p>



<p>Over the years, he has also been a frequent cover star, starting with WWF Attitude in 1999. Iconic games such as WWE SmackDown: Shut Your Mouth, WWE Day of Reckoning, and WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 also feature “The Game” on the cover art. However, this cover is historic for the “King of Kings” because it marks the first time he has been featured solo.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-this-is-not-the-only-cover-of-wwe-2k26-featuring-triple-h">This Is Not the Only Cover of WWE 2K26 Featuring Triple H</h2>



<p>As announced on January 23, WWE 2K26 will also have a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Attitude Era edition</a>. The cover art for that edition features many WWE legends from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Triple H was also on the cover. He was featured in the trailer alongside Shawn Michaels, Chyna, and the other members of D-Generation X.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE also announced a Monday Night War Edition of WWE 2K26. </a>Triple H appears on the cover, representing WWE alongside Steve Austin, Undertaker, The Rock, Chyna, and Kurt Angle. He also appeared in the trailer for this edition, which focuses largely on the promotional rivalry between WWE and WCW that dominated the late ’90s and catapulted wrestling to a new level of popularity and success.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-will-bring-back-classic-match-types-familiar-to-longtime-triple-h-fans">WWE 2K26 Will Bring Back Classic Match Types Familiar to Longtime Triple H Fans</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As first reported by Insider Gaming,</a> WWE 2K26 is expanding its gameplay offerings with four new playable match types. The game introduces the Dumpster Match for the first time while bringing back the Inferno Match, I Quit Match, and 3 Stages of Hell. Triple H has a history of competing in all three returning gimmick matches. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Island</a> will make its return this year, featuring a completely new storyline.</p>







<p>As of now, 2K Games has not announced any specific DLC coming to this year’s game. However, on January 24, WWE confirmed that the Monday Night War Edition will provide access to the most content.</p>



<p>Pre-orders begin on January 30. However, there’s currently no set release date or price point. Recent WWE 2K games have released in March. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Receives “Mostly Negative” Reviews On Steam After Launch]]></title>

            <guid>1416694</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/highguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> is out now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and at least one segment of the gaming community has already left their impressions on the game. Within an hour of its release, Highguard has received “mostly negative” reviews on Steam from players.</p>



<p>From reported performance issues to players saying they’ve been booted from the game, there seems to be a number of concerns from players. </p>







<p><strong>“Barely had 60 fps on a 5070 Ti &amp; 14700K,”</strong> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said one user</a>.</p>



<p>Another added that they <strong>“logged in immediately and got kicked out of the game.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>That said, while some of the concerns appear to be valid, there are many simply joining in on the belief of many that this will be a “Concord 2” situation. For what it’s worth, Concord peaked at just 697 players on Steam while Highguard has reached <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 100,000 concurrent players</a> as of writing. </p>



<p>And while the reviews are mostly negative in the early stages, there are plenty of positive reviews from players. </p>



<p><strong>“The biggest takeaway after the first few matches is that the rules are really different,” </strong>one review reads. <strong>“This isn’t just a Temu Concord or [Overwatch]. The build-up, flag, and siege phases give the match a clear rhythm, and once you get used to it, it’s way more fun than pure aim duels.”</strong></p>



<p>Another user said that nothing in the game felt <strong>“messy”</strong> despite the mixing of <strong>“a lot of gameplays”.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wildlight Entertainment’s Highguard has officially been released to the public after a long month of waiting. The multiplayer FPS is available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple platforms</a>, but it’s not always guaranteed that these systems can play alongside one another.</p>



<p>For an online game like Highguard, the matter of crossplay is an important one. Some fans out there will want to raid together with their friends, but if it’s platform-exclusive, that can put a serious dent in their plans.</p>







<p>If you’re unsure of what platform to download Highguard on and whether crossplay will be an issue, then read on: Insider Gaming has all the details you’ll need.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-crossplay">Does Highguard Have Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Breaking down those platform walls. Image via Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Highguard does have Crossplay across all platforms, allowing you to team up with friends across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</strong></p>



<p>Gone are the days when everyone had to play games on the same platform, as it’s common courtesy that multiplayer titles offer crossplay across all platforms—or at least as many as possible. </p>



<p>Highguard is no different, and it should prove to be a great feature going forward to get as many onto the newly-released shooter as possible. </p>

<p><strong>As things stand, cross-progression remains unconfirmed for Highguard, meaning your progress will probably be limited to one platform. </strong></p>



<p>That makes choosing your starting platform especially important. You won’t want to unlock cosmetics and gear for your Wardens, only to lose them if you decide to play somewhere else. </p>







<p>This could easily change in the future, as it has done for plenty of other titles in the past. If you’re hoping for a cross-progression announcement for Highguard, look nowhere else than Insider Gaming, as this article will be updated as soon as anything changes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wildlight Entertainment has officially released Highguard, a ‘new breed of shooter’, and by all accounts, it’s doing pretty well for itself. It follows a month of radio silence after the game was unveiled at The Game Awards in December. Earlier today, the team at Wildlight shared a massive, one-year-long roadmap packed with seven episodes of content.</p>



<p>The post-launch spree looks great on the surface, but time will tell if the player counts remain high enough for the delivery to matter. For now, there’s enough meat on the bones to get prospective fans very excited about what’s coming.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-2026-roadmap-has-content-drops-every-month">Highguard 2026 Roadmap Has Content Drops Every Month</h2>



<p>The surprising thing about Highguard’s 2026 roadmap is that there’s a content drop planned <strong>every single month</strong>. This isn’t the most standard approach for live-service games, but Wildlight obviously has immense stock in what it has created to reveal so much, so early. We’ve got content stacked in the pipeline way up until December.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It all begins with the game’s launch, but the second episode of content will hit in just <strong>two weeks</strong>. It’ll bring a new Warden (read: hero character), a fresh map, <strong>Ranked Mode</strong>, and a new mount, expanding on the bear, horse, and panther that already exist. The second part of that episode will drop in March, bringing a new <strong>base</strong> and a raid tool.</p>



<p>The difference between a map and a base? A Base is what you defend <strong>on </strong>the map, selecting it from a lineup of options when the match kicks off. This is the end zone of a match, and it’s the ultimate objective. The ‘map’ is the environment upon which you play… Simple?</p>



<p>Highguard’s roadmap expands further throughout the year.</p>



<p>There’s a new Warden coming every second month, as well as new bases, following that same launch pattern. We’ll get new maps in Highguard in June and October, and a special, limited-time mode is in the book for July. October and December yield ‘surprise’ events, and in terms of equipment, players can expect a hefty assortment to arrive as the year unfolds.</p>



<p>For instance, a new <strong>weapon </strong>will be added to Highguard in April, June, August, and October, while new <strong>amulets </strong>will appear in May, July, September, and November. Mods will be added in April, June, August, October, and December, and a new <strong>raid tool </strong>is coming in March <strong>only</strong>.</p>



<p>New loot items will be published in Highguard in May and September.</p>



<p>Oh, and all the content is <strong>entirely free</strong>.</p>



<p>This is a pretty dense roadmap, but time will tell how the delivery of it fares.</p>

<p>The hype surrounding Highguard is real and its here. Not only are players—including staff at Insider Gaming—reporting long queue times just to get into the game, but even it’s website has been brought down by traffic.</p>



<p>Developer Wildlight Entertainment launched Highguard on Monday along with a gameplay showcase for players. With the showcase over, many went to the game’s website to read more about features and future plans. Unfortunately, however, the website couldn’t handle the traffic numbers.</p>







<p>As of writing, heading to <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayHighguard.com</a> leads to a few seconds of loading before the site delivers a 404 error message. According to <a href="https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/playhighguard.com.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IsItDownRightNow.com</a>, the site is offline for everyone with no response. </p>



<p>As far as the game itself, SteamDB lists the player count at over 63,000 people in just 30 minutes. Whether all 63,000, and counting, players are actually able to get in and play a game is currently unknown.</p>



<p>Still, for a game to not have any news between its reveal and launch to have this type of up, it has to bode well for the future of Highguard. As long as the players remain invested once getting into the action, that is. </p>
