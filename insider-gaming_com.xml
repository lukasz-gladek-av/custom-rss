<p>A new job listing by Guerrilla Games suggests that the developers hope to attract more than 1 million players globally to their upcoming Horizon Multiplayer title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/horizon-multiplayer-game-live-service-player-count-ambitions-guerrilla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a> via (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horizon/horizon-zero-dawns-multiplayer-spinoff-has-big-dreams-as-guerrilla-confirms-its-hoping-to-attract-more-than-1-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), a new <a href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/join/senior-platform-engineer-decima/7779018002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> for a senior platform engineer at Guerrilla Games’ Online Infrastructure team has seemingly provided new details about the upcoming online multiplayer title based in the Horizon universe. One of the job requirements for this position is for the applicant to have experience in “building and operating multi-service, 1M+ user globally distributed systems across multiple public cloud providers”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though the listing hints that Guerrilla Games could expect over 1 million players for their Horizon Multiplayer game, the game itself is not mentioned. However, considering they do not currently have any other multiplayer games in the works (that have been confirmed), it can be speculated that it is the Horizon online title. At the same time, the million-player user base might be an upper limit to ensure the server can smoothly handle the influx of players during the launch period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Horizon Online Multiplayer title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in 2022, announcing, “A new internal team is developing a separate Online Project set in the Horizon’s universe.” Since then, no official announcements or news have arrived about the game; however, a recent job listing suggested that the online Horizon game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Horizon Zero Dawn movie was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced by Sony at CES 2025</a>. Also, according to a new claim, LEGO Horizon Adventures <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could come to Xbox in a few months</a>. What are your thoughts on Guerrilla aspiring to bring more than one million players to their Horizon online multiplayer game?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A isn’t being built to take advantage of the hardware improvements of the Nintendo Switch 2. That’s according to Jeff Grubb on his latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/TfkNfMonxoc?t=3942s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Last of the Nintendogs</a>” episode.</p>



<p>Grubb said that when the next Pokémon Presents takes place—likely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-pokemon-presents-date-seemingly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Pokemon Day</a>—all of the games shown will be developed for the current Switch console.</p>



<p>“I did hear that everything in that Pokémon Direct will be positioned as ‘These games are Switch 1 games’,” Grubb said. “They will work on Switch 2, but there will not be anything that is obviously made for Switch 2. Which is normal for The Pokémon Company.”</p>



<p>His co-host, Mike Minotti, seemed surprised by that with a belief that “of all that games that should get a performance boost on the Switch 2” it should be the next Pokémon game.</p>







<p>Announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during last year’s Pokémon Presents</a> on Pokémon Day, Pokémon Z-A is the follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus from 2022. The game features “a new adventure awaits within Lumiose City, where an urban redevelopment plan is under way to shape the city into a place that belongs to both people and Pokémon.”</p>



<p>More on the game is expected to be shown, including the announcement of a release date, during the upcoming Pokémon Presents event in February. There will also be new information on upcoming plans for Pokémon Go along with the expected surprises that always seem to appear during the events.</p>

<p>Microsoft is kicking off the year the same way it did 2024, holding layoffs across the company. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a>, Microsoft is letting go people from its sales, security, and gaming teams.</p>



<p>Business Insider sources say that employees started getting notifications of the layoffs on Tuesday. Microsoft told the outlet that the layoffs “are small” while not giving information on the number of cuts.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft about the exact number of people being let go from the gaming division in this latest round of layoffs. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-layoffs-affect-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let go 1,900 people</a> from its gaming team after it closed on its purchase of Activision Blizzard. More layoffs were held throughout the year via studio closures and other mass layoffs, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-650-people-lay-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including 650 people</a> in September 2024. The company even shut down four studios in May 2024, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. Tango Gameworks, however, would ultimately be purchased by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-acquired-by-pubg-publisher-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krafton </a>and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-rebirth-krafton-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunched</a>.</p>

<p>Last year saw nearly 16,000 people let go from their jobs in the games industry across more than 160 companies.  In the first 15 days of 2025, <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">there have been 10 known layoffs</a> and closures with at least 160+ people let go based on known numbers. With estimates, we are looking at well over 200 people thus far. </p>
