<p>Civilization 7 developer Firaxis is holding layoffs. Multiple employees at the studio have taken to social media to announce that they were being let go from the company.</p>



<p>Those let go from the company include writer Emma Kidwell, producer Maya H, lead character artist Matthew Davis, and more.</p>



<p>“Hi! I was laid off from Firaxis this morning,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emmakidwell.bsky.social/post/3lxzgvwuq6k2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kidwell said.</a> “I wrote leaders and civs for Civilization VII (NDA for now) and Deadpool and Storm for Marvel’s Midnight Suns.”</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mnhimel_opentowork-activity-7369387462151897089-FdX4/?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAAByD5EUBfxY4kCf3wHtdwCavc5euTv0rxzo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Maya H</a>, “”I was laid off this morning from Firaxis, which was my favorite job I’ve had.”</p>

<p>In a statement on the matter, 2K confirmed the layoffs at Firaxis were part of the a “restructure”.</p>



<p><strong>“We can confirm there was a staff reduction today at Firaxis Games, as the studio restructures and optimizes its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity,” </strong>the publisher said.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out for more clarification on how many people were impacted by the layoffs. Should a response be received, this article will be updated accordingly. </p>



<p>Recently, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick said that Civilization 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-admits-civilization-7-had-challenges-at-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“had challenges” with its launch</a>, though he admitted that it’s something that seems to regularly happen with the series. Civilization 7 took a bold new step for the franchise, introducing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-gameplay-showcase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Ages system</a> for players, which has been divisive among players since the game’s February 2025 release.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft charts its final course with Season 2, coming to Netflix in December 2025. </p>



<p>The show takes place after the events of the Survivor Trilogy and follows Lara Croft on her journey to become the iconic Tomb Raider. Originally premiering last year in October, the animated series by Powerhouse Animation Studios, was renewed shortly after premiering. While the news that Season 2 is the final one is new, there’s a lot in store, including a new cast member.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In an <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-legend-lara-croft-final-season-2-release-date-1236506397/">exclusive article from Variety</a>, it was announced that Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft will end with Season 2. It was also confirmed that the show will release on Netflix on December 11th, 2025. While no trailer is available, we do have an official logline, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-legend-lara-croft-final-season-2-release-date-1236506397/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanks to Variety</a>. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When adventurer Lara Croft (voiced by Hayley Atwell) discovers a trail of stolen African Orisha masks, she joins forces with her best friend Sam (Karen Fukuhara) to retrieve the precious artifacts. Lara’s thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodging the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Joining the star-studded cast, which includes MCU’s Hayley Atwell, is The Boys’ Karen Fukuhara. She will play the role of Sam, who returns from 2013’s Tomb Raider. Much like Camilla Luddington with Hayley, Karen replaces K-Pop: Demon Hunters’ Arden Cho, who portrayed Sam in the original. </p>



<p>The Tomb Raider news comes a day after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-tomb-raider-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Video’s update</a> on its live-action version. With Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, the show enters production in January 2026. As we don’t know what version Prime Video’s Lara Croft will be, Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft may be a good start.</p>

<p>Fans waiting for crossplay in Rematch will have to wait a bit longer. With Rematch patch 3 set to release on Thursday, September 4, developer Sloclap has announced that they had to delay its launch in order to investigate a new issue that appeared.</p>



<p>The third major patch for Rematch was originally planned for September 3 but was delayed to September 4 at the last minute to fix two bugs that were found during final testing. With the new date set, another major issue was found causing yet another delay.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-rematch-patch-3-be-released">When Will Rematch Patch 3 Be Released?</h2>



<p>In a message on the game’s official Discord, Sloclap said that during final testing, <strong>“a significant number of testers were stuck in matchmaking, unable to cancel or restart the process”</strong> when crossplay was enabled in Rematch. This issue, they said, has led to the decision to delay the update again due to crossplay being <strong>“at the core of this update”</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>“We know this is very disappointing news and we share your frustration,” </strong>Sloclap said. <strong>“Our recent track record with patch stability hasn’t been up to standards, and we don’t want to release a patch that will introduce new issues.”</strong></p>



<p>They continued: <strong>“Our focus right now is on resolving this matchmaking issue as quickly as possible. At the same time, we’re actively working on improving our production pipeline so that future updates are delivered with the quality and reliability you deserve – and more importantly, we will refrain from announcing release dates until we are absolutely certain that we can deliver the updates on time.”</strong></p>



<p>As of publishing, no new date has been set for Rematch Patch 3. When that is announced, it will be posted here on Insider Gaming.</p>
