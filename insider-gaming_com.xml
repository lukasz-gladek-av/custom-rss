<p>While Fortnite players are currently enjoying the slew of The Simpsons-related content in the game, further big changes are on the horizon with the release date of Chapter 7 rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s mini-season themed around The Simpsons will only be here for a few weeks before the setting of Springfield is left behind and a new adventure begins with Chapter 7, which will mark the start of the next year of content for Fortnite.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering just how long there is to enjoy The Simpsons content and want to know the release date for Chapter 7, we’ve got all the crucial details.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-fortnite-chapter-7-release">When Does Fortnite Chapter 7 Release?</h2>

<p><strong>Chapter 7 in Fortnite is set to kick off on November 29, following the end of The Simpsons-themed mini-season that brings a conclusion to Chapter 6.</strong></p>



<p>The end date of the current season, and the subsequent start of the next Fortnite chapter, was revealed in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> for The Simpsons mini-season, and we already know there will be the customary end-of-chapter event that marks the start of the new chapter.</p>



<p>Specific timing for the event and launch of Chapter 7 have not been revealed yet, however, and there will be downtime ahead of the start of the new chapter. Given how large of an update this will be, and the vast changes that will take place, the downtime could be longer than the standard end-of-season downtime.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-fortnite-chapter-7">What’s Coming in Fortnite Chapter 7?</h2>



<p><strong>Chapter 7 in Fortnite will see vast changes to the game, with a new map in Battle Royale, a host of new weapons, and tweaks to core gameplay.</strong></p>



<p>In previous years, new chapters have resulted in huge introductions like Fortnite Festival and LEGO Fortnite, alongside marking the start of major new collaborations. While specifics are lacking at this stage, it certainly promises to be an exciting time for Fortnite players.</p>



<p>Leaks have already started ahead of Chapter 7, with it stated that both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> will feature in upcoming collabs, while a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood setting is also rumored</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll also see the start of Winterfest 2025 during the first season of Chapter 7, likely during early December, which will likely offer the usual slew of free cosmetics.</p>

<p>Retroid has confirmed that there is no official licensing deal for Soulja Boy’s new handheld retro console, SouljaGameFlip. </p>



<p>The retro handheld console market has experienced significant growth in the past few years, with several new major players entering the scene in recent years. Retroid is a popular name in the retro handheld market, and it appears that some of their consoles are being sold by Soulja Boy as his own device, without an official deal in place. </p>



<h2 id="h-soulja-boy-is-selling-rebranded-retroid-consoles-at-more-than-double-the-price">Soulja Boy is Selling Rebranded Retroid Consoles At More than Double the Price </h2>



<p>Soulja Boy started marketing the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 as the SouljaGameFlip on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQlFjCpgLDq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">souljaboygame Instagram account</a>. One of their recent post has the hip-hop artist showcasing the console in his hand while talking about all the games and apps it features, including “Sonic, TikTok, Instagram and everything ya need.” </p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Retro Dodo</a>, Retroid was not aware that Soulja Boy was selling their retro consoles as his own. The official statement from a representative states, “I didn’t know about this. This is not any kind of official licensing deal. He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S by ourselves”. </p>



<p>If you visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.souljaboy.net/product-page/souljagame-flip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>&nbsp;where the SouljaGameFlip is being sold, it becomes blatantly obvious that the device is just a rebranded Retroid Pocket Flip 2; even the images for the console are the same ones used on Retroid’s website. Furthermore, the rapper has more than doubled the price of the original console, with the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 priced at $209 and the SouljaGameFlip costing $436.50. </p>

<p>Saints Row 1 Director has stated that he has been asked to create a pitch for a prequel instalment to the series, and it will not be a VR game. </p>



<p>The 2022 Saints Row reboot didn’t go down well with anyone, as most of the charm of the game was lost in this new version. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saints-row-2022-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly generated $1.7 million</a> before Volition closed down, but it failed to meet fan expectations due to its lackluster narrative and shift in tone. However, it seems that all is not lost for the Saints Row franchise, as a new game is currently being pitched. </p>



<h2 id="h-saints-row-1-director-is-going-back-to-his-roots-with-the-prequel">Saints Row 1 Director is Going Back to His Roots With the Prequel</h2>



<p>The revelation about a Saints Row prequel pitch comes from the design director of the first title, Chris Stockman, latest post on the r/SaintsRow <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/ive_been_asked_to_a_create_a_pitch_for_a_saints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/saints-row-1s-director-is-pitching-a-prequel-that-gets-back-to-the-roots-of-what-made-sr-1-entertaining-but-i-mostly-want-to-know-what-became-of-the-saints-row-2-pc-patch-whose-developer-died/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>). Titled, “I’ve been asked to create a pitch for a Saints Row prequel!” Stockman’s post says he has hopeful news for the fans, as he has been approached “to create a pitch for a Saints Row reboot.” He is unable to share any more information right now, but his “dreams for this game just became a little more than just dreams.” </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Moreover, Stockman also stated that the prequel will not be a VR title, and he is returning to his roots. Sotckman added that he has a “very clear vision” for the prequel as he was the director of the first game. He also indulged in other conversations with players, explaining his vision for the title. </p>



<p>Stockman stated, “The core idea of Saints Row ’77 is to go back to the roots of what made SR 1 entertaining in the first place. It was somewhat grounded in reality but also a bit zany too. It had a lot more satirical elements vs. the later entries.” He added, or maybe they could “start in the 90s, then go 80s, then go 70s! Bookmark this reply. *wink wink*.” Whatever this ends up being, fans definitely seem excited about a prequel instalment to the series. </p>



<p>In other news, <span>a recent report suggests that the 2022 Saints Row reboot was&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saints-row-reboot-reportedly-started-as-a-direct-sequel-to-saints-row-3/" target="_blank">originally intended to be a direct sequel</a>&nbsp;to Saints Row 3</span>.

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is launching on November 14, 2025, as previously announced; there will be no early access for the title. </p>



<p>A few days ago, there was speculation that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s campaign and Zombies modes would arrive a bit earlier than the multiplayer mode, based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-zombies-release-early-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-load dates</a>. There were also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumours</a> about the game’s release being preponed by a week. However, all of these rumours about playing Black Ops 7 early have been debunked by Activision. </p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-no-early-access-everyone-start-playing-on-november-14">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Has No Early Access, Everyone Start Playing on November 14</h2>



<p>Reliable Call of Duty news source CharlieINTEL debunked the game’s early access rumors through a recent post on their official <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1985132037498433755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post states that Black Ops 7 releases on Friday, November 14. “There is no early access. There is no change to the release date.” An Activision representative confirmed these details to CharlieINTEL, so this should clear up all the confusion that players had. </p>

<p>For those wondering, Black Ops 7 will feature a co-op campaign mode at launch, where players will be able to visit a variety of different environments, “from the neon-lit rooftops of Japan to the Mediterranean coast.” Coming to the multiplayer mode, players can start their BO7 journey with 16 6v6 maps and two 20v20 maps at launch. Lastly, round-based Zombies returns with the upcoming title as players descend into the heart of the Dark Aether. </p>

<p>Sentinels have announced they are exiting Marvel Rivals Esports, though the door has been left open for a return in the future.</p>



<p>The team competed in the inaugural Marvel Rivals Ignite mid-season finals in China, but, as preparations start to prepare for the end-of-season Ignite tournament, expected to take place next month, Sentinels announced they are exiting the competition.</p>



<h2 id="h-sentinels-leaving-marvel-rivals-esports">Sentinels Leaving Marvel Rivals Esports</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Departure. Image via Sentinels</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/senrivals/status/1985492677669110241?s=46&amp;t=SjOb542MOiUY8kbKILY2Og" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Sentinels stated they were “pausing” operations in Marvel Rivals, but they would “revisit the decision” if NetEase were to roll out a program with team incentives.</p>



<p>It’s added that all players in the team are “now free to explore new opportunities,” with those who were on the team now available to sign for another organisation.</p>



<p>The stance from Sentinels aligns with what the organisation’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sentinels-ceo-says-marvel-rivals-team-bundles-are-critical-for-esports-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CEO Rob Moore told Insider Gaming</a> at the Marvel Rivals Ignite mid-season finals, where he described the introduction of purchasable team bundles as “critical” for the future of the title in the Esports scene.</p>



<p>NetEase is yet to announce any decision regarding bundles, though <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1953474966185214111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esports Tournament lead Adam H</a>uang did state that skin bundles could be added in the future, which could contribute to the prize pools of the grand finals.</p>



<p>Similar incentives are commonplace across other Esports, helping to establish the economics of the scene, and it remains to be seen whether NetEase will introduce a similar stance.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase for comment on the Sentinels exit from the Esports scene and whether team incentives are being planned.</p>
