<p>When Highguard was released last week, one of the biggest points of contention concerned the game’s player structure. Each ‘raid’ in the game could accommodate just six players, three on each team. It made the game feel empty and promoted awkward pacing, and it was mere days before Wildlight, the game’s developer, introduced a 5v5 mode.</p>



<p>It was supposed to be a temporary thing to test the waters, but Wildlight has just confirmed that 5v5 is ‘here to stay’ after a successful trial period.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-5v5-do-anything-to-save-highguard">Will 5v5 Do Anything to Save Highguard?</h2>



<p>Highguard’s player count continues to drop, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-update-target-games-biggest-gripe/">the sentiments</a> surrounding the game are in a critical state. Any viewership has been almost eradicated, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/">the year-long roadmap</a> has done little to instill a sense of confidence in those who would call themselves fans.</p>



<p>Last week, Highguard launched after several weeks of radio silence following the game’s grand reveal at The Game Awards. It was an unveiling marred by negativity, and the game’s full release did nothing to abate the disappointment of gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>When it was discovered that this ambitious first-person shooter would accommodate just six players per match, prospective fans found themselves questioning the depth of their matches.</p>



<p>Then, along came Wildlight Entertainment, with an idea to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-adds-5v5-raid-playable-now/">trial a 5v5 mode</a>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Wildlight confirmed the trial was a success:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’ve been asking, and we’re happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay!</p>



<p>We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments under the post, the game’s fans put a positive spin on the change, suggesting it would cater to the more casual players and attract a wider audience. That hasn’t been reflected in the game’s player count, though.</p>
