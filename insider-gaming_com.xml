<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved strategy games. It started as real-time strategy matches against AI opponents in titles like Age of Empires, Age of Mythology, and Company of Heroes. I quickly found myself drawn to base-building and colony sim titles for the sense of progression and expansion they offer, though, and few compare to RimWorld. But then, there’s also Oxygen Not Included. They’re both exceptional, both offering countless hundreds or, in some cases, thousands of hours of gameplay. Which do you choose? Why not both? You can score two of the best colony sim games for under $35 with the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/46465/Terraform_Titans_Duo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Terraform Titans Duo</a> bundle on Steam!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rimworld">What is RimWorld?</h2>



<p>RimWorld is often considered the quintessential colony sim game, following in the footsteps of titles like Dwarf Fortress but offering a unique spin on the story generation mechanics. You’ll take control of a science fiction-fueled colony full of intelligent pawns that must contend with unique enemies, flora, fauna, psychology, climate, interpersonal relationships, and more.</p>



<p>After spending 1,000 hours playing the game, I can tell you that even the base version is worth every penny. But with the expansions and countless mods, you’ll easily score hundreds of hours from RimWorld if it’s your type of game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-oxygen-not-included">What is Oxygen Not Included?</h2>



<p>Also in the bundle, we have Oxygen Not Included. It’s another sci-fi colony sim game that focuses on the dynamic crew as they overcome obstacles, like alien lifeforms while harnessing the power of the asteroid they’re currently stranded on. For instance, you must consider logistics, like piping water and waste to and from the colony, to ensure no one falls ill. It’s complex and compelling in equal measures.</p>



<p>With ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ reviews, Oxygen Not Included is a grand time for any colony sim or base-building game fan!</p>



<h2 id="h-score-them-both">Score Them Both!</h2>



<p>With this partnership between Ludeon Studios and Klei Entertainment, you can currently score both colony sim games for less than $35. Oxygen Not Included is on sale, dropping the price of the bundle to its current total. You really cannot pass this one up!</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments below if you grab the bundle! Don’t forget to stop by and share screenshots of your colony in our General Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>



<hr>



<p>Did you know it can cost up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-can-cost-up-to-500000-for-a-spot-on-opening-night-live-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$500,000 for a spot on Opening Night Live 2025</a>? That’s an insane price to pay, and many indie developers can’t afford such extreme advertising costs!</p>
