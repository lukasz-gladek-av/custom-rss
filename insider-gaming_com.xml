            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout is almost an indictment of consumerism and capitalism. It’s bursting at the seams with shady, titanic corporations that almost always had some kind of dubious or deceptive subplot tucked behind the scenes in the run-up to the nuclear war that wiped the United States off the map. </p>



<p>In this list, we’re breaking down the most iconic brands from Fallout, determining which of the many organisations and corporations in the Fallout Universe stand out amongst the crowd.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-recognisable-fallout-brands">Most Recognisable Fallout Brands</h2>



<p>There are quite literally hundreds of brands, labels, organisations, and corporations in Fallout, but which of them can be counted as the most iconic? Here’s our definitive list to settle that debate and give you a little more visibility of the most iconic brands from Fallout.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-nuka-cola">1. Nuka-Cola</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuka-Cola is, without a doubt, the most recognisable and iconic brand in Fallout. It’s probably even more recognisable than Vault-Tec, which we’ll get to in a second. </p>



<p>In the Fallout Universe, Nuka-Cola is one of the biggest corporations, and its influence is felt far and wide across the post-apocalyptic wasteland. It’s the many millions of bottle caps from Nuka-Cola bottles that became the de facto currency after the bombs fell, after all.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-vault-tec-industries">2. Vault-Tec Industries</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vault-Tec Industries was responsible for the construction of the vaults that housed many thousands of people as the bombs rained down across the United States in the Fallout Universe. </p>



<p>It’s easily one of the most iconic brands from Fallout – its mascot alone, the blond-haired Vault Boy, is one of the most recognisable characters in modern gaming. It might have been a relatively evil, disingenuous corporation, but that’s the point.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-super-duper-mart">3. Super-Duper Mart</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Super-Duper Mart is Fallout’s representation of Wal-Mart, and it’s easily one of the most iconic brands from Fallout. It’s primarily an ‘East Coast’ organisation, so it has only been present in Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76, but that’s enough for the brand to have left a lasting impression on players. </p>



<p>One of the earliest missions in Fallout 3 takes players into the heart of a Super-Duper Mart overrun by Raiders, and that’s a hugely memorable portion of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-west-tek">4. West-Tek</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>West-Tek is one of those Fallout brands that didn’t gain mass prominence until Fallout 76, when players got the opportunity to visit buildings that once housed this titanic technological corporation. </p>



<p>It might not be common knowledge, but West-Tek is one of the most iconic brands from Fallout – it’s the firm responsible for the creation of Power Armor, laser-based weapons, and some of the research into the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus).</p>







<h3 id="h-5-general-atomics-international">5. General Atomics International</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>General Atomics International is responsible for a series of robots that are commonplace across the Fallout Universe. Before the Great War, General Atomics International created the Mister Handy, arguably one of the most recognisable robots from the Fallout series – everyone who has played the games has seen one. It also produced Mister Gutsy, Robobrain, and co-created Liberty Prime.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-robco-industries">6. RobCo Industries</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We couldn’t list Generic Atomics International and not mention RobCo Industries! This iconic Fallout brand was founded by none other than Robert Edwin House — that’s right, <strong>the </strong>Mr. House from Fallout: New Vegas. </p>



<p>As Fallout’s answer to Tony Stark, Mr. House’s corporation was responsible for the creation of a huge array of robots: Eyebot, Protectron, Sentry Bot, Securitron, Liberty Prime, and Assaultron. Not only that, but RobCo manufactured the Pip-Boy, one of the most instantly recognisable devices from the Fallout Universe!</p>







<h3 id="h-7-hubris-comics">7. Hubris Comics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Hubris Comics is another iconic Fallout brand that, even if you don’t know it, you’ve come into contact with it. In the Fallout Universe, Hubris Comics publishes a range of illustrated items that users can pick up to get buffs and bonuses – namely, the Grognak the Barbarian line of comic books. </p>



<p>From Fallout 3 to New Vegas and from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76, Hubris’ influence has been felt by millions of players in Fallout.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-poseidon-energy">8. Poseidon Energy</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Poseidon is an energy company, which almost immediately makes it an evil corporation in the Fallout Universe. As the world came grinding to a halt, it was iconic brands like this that squeezed every cent possible out of the citizens of the United States. </p>



<p>In Fallout, Poseidon boasted ownership of some memorable locations, like the Helios One plant from New Vegas and the Oil Rig that housed the Enclave. If that wasn’t enough, Poseidon also invented many of the franchise’s Plasma weapons. </p>



<h3 id="h-9-pulowski-preservation-services">9. Pulowski Preservation Services</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuclear protection on a budget! Have you ever seen one of the tall, cylindrical, blue devices scattered around Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76? These are the Pulowski Preservation Shelters, and they make up the backbone of a gigantic scam. </p>



<p>Upon the impending threat of nuclear annihilation, one person could buy their way into one of these street-mounted shelters, but the only issue was that they didn’t work. They’re full of skeletons of the foolish citizens who were eager to hide in them to escape the nuclear fire.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-red-rocket">10. Red Rocket</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Red Rocket is a corporation and one of the most iconic brands from Fallout, without any shadow of a doubt. It operated a network of gas stations across the United States of America in the Fallout Universe, and in the wake of the apocalypse, many of them became makeshift shelters and small settlements for survivors. </p>



<p>They’re instantly recognisable, almost always because of the large model rockets in a ‘launch pose’ on the rooftops of the gas stations littered around the wasteland.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-817-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-friday-september-5.1289484/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s almost the weekend, and it’s time for another invigorating round of NYT Connections. If you’re nursing a killer streak, you’ll want to keep that going with today’s puzzle, and fortunately, I’m here to help you. Below, I’ve outlined the best NYT Connections hints for today (#817), as well as the answers, if you want the fastest solution possible.</p>



<p>Being a bit of a Star Wars nerd, today’s NYT Connections hints excited me, but once again, it was a case of the puzzle throwing a curveball to subvert expectations. Read on to get the NYT Connections clues you need to resolve today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-september-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (September 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #817</p>



<ul>
<li>HAN</li>



<li>SOLO</li>



<li>FREE</li>



<li>ZING</li>



<li>RAM</li>



<li>KICK</li>



<li>STAG</li>



<li>BUCK</li>



<li>SINGLE</li>



<li>SONG</li>



<li>JACK</li>



<li>TANG</li>



<li>MING</li>



<li>PUNCH</li>



<li>BILLY</li>



<li>ZEST</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em>These words pack a sensory wallop—think of what gives a dish its lively edge or a personality its spark. You might find them in a food review or a boxing metaphor</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe someone flying solo—whether at a wedding, on a dating app, or just living that independent life. No plus-one required.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These names belong to male animals, often used colloquially or in farming circles. If you’ve ever met a goat named Billy or a rabbit named Jack, you’re on the right track.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are not just history test answers—they’re the ruling houses that shaped centuries of Chinese civilization. Think dynasties that built walls, wrote poetry, and changed the course of empires.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Being a bit of a history buff, I appreciated the nod we got to the <strong>obvious </strong>above. Admittedly, this was one of the easiest NYT Connections puzzles this week, and it didn’t take too long to figure it out.</p>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, September 5.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-september-5-817">NYT Connections Answers for Today, September 5 (#817)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em> </em>KICK, PUNCH, ZEST, ZING</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – FREE, SINGLE, SOLO, STAG</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BILLY, BUCK, JACK, RAM</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – HAN, MING, SONG, TANG</li>
</ul>



<p>And here’s the visual solution for today’s NYT Connections:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[2K Confirms It’s Making “A College Basketball Experience”]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/2k-confirms-its-making-a-college-basketball-experience/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2k-confirms-it%E2%80%99s-making-%E2%80%9Ca-college-basketball-experience%E2%80%9D.1289418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2K Sports is officially back in the college basketball video game market. After it was confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-walks-away-from-developing-college-basketball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports was backing out</a> of building a “college basketball experience”, 2K Sports released their own statement on Thursday night. </p>



<p><strong>“Yes, it’s true. We’re working on a college basketball experience that will feature more than 100 programs from across the country, from powerhouses to Cinderella stories,” </strong>2K <a href="https://x.com/2K/status/1963775457876406534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said via social media</a>. <strong>“Competition fuels quality at all levels, which is why our approach with college basketball ensures our partner schools, college athletes <em>and</em> our players all benefit.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“More good news – you won’t have to wait long to start seeing your favorite colleges show up in game. We’ve got big plans for 2027 and beyond, and even a few surprises coming in early 2026. We’ve proven the quality of the basketball experience we can deliver for years, and have every intention to bring that same level of quality to college hoops.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-how-college-basketball-2k-got-here">How College Basketball 2K Got Here</h2>



<p>It’s been a weird road to get to this point for college basketball and 2K. EA originally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-announces-return-of-college-basketball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had its proposal for an exclusive game</a> picked by the College Licensing Company (CLC) that would’ve included all Division 1 men’s and women’s college basketball programs. That game was planned to launch in 2028, but schools <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-game-might-be-in-trouble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were hesitant to move forward</a> with the exclusivity.</p>



<p>Reports then surfaced that 2K was making a stronger effort to get licensing. The company, specifically publisher Take-Two Interactive, shifted from plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-sports-wants-to-add-college-basketball-to-nba-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only having college teams as MyTeam DLC</a> in NBA 2K to having a full game. </p>



<p>2K already has an agreement in place with UCLA, and says that more were coming soon. Over the upcoming months and year-plus, it’ll be interesting to see what schools and conferences 2K reaches agreements with. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has previously reported that 2K sources felt a game could be released as early as 2027. Based on the statement from 2K, it appears that might actually be the case as of now. Recently, more sources have suggested that there is a plan to eventually include all Division 1 programs in a game should the first game go well. That, however, is subject to change due to it being so far in the future.</p>



<p>What do you think of a 2K college basketball game that doesn’t feature every college team?&nbsp;Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>A new Ghost of Yotei trailer shows off one of Atsu’s newest weapons, the brash odachi, in combat gameplay. </p>



<p>The highly anticipated sequel to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, Yotei looks to live up to what came before and more. Following a vengeful mercenary on the hunt for her family’s killers, the game has been rolling out new content every week. Now, a month from the October 2nd release date, we’ve got new footage of a new weapon in Atsu’s arsenal: the odachi.</p>



<h2 id="h-atsu-slices-and-dices-with-odachi-in-new-ghost-of-yotei-trailer">Atsu Slices and Dices with Odachi in New Ghost of Yotei Trailer</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei -  Ōdachi Gameplay | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8ivos7Bnjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8ivos7Bnjs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the trailer above</a>, we see protagonist Atsu unleash another weapon in her collection, the odachi. A longer version of the katana, the weapon’s length can shorten the distance between your blade and an enemy. While not as fast, it can deliver devastating blows to foes and thin a crowd should you be overwhelmed. </p>



<p>Weeks prior, we’ve seen footage of the kusarigama, yari, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-firearms-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firearms in action</a> in Ghost of Yotei. With the odachi trailer out, it leaves the dual swords, katana, and bow left. It does fit quite nicely with the timeline, ending right near the upcoming release date. As one of PlayStation’s biggest titles of 2025, fans won’t have to wait long to get their hands on it, especially if they are at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tokyo-game-show-2025-lineup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tokyo Game Show</a>. Still, given the many accolades Ghost of Tsushima received at launch, Yotei may live up to the Ghost moniker in the Game of the Year discussion.</p>



<p>Are you going to use the odachi in Ghost of Yotei? Looking forward to its October 2nd release? Let us know in the comments below and on the forums!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The upcoming Street Fighter film now has an official release date: October 2026.</p>



<p>Originally being distributed by Legendary, the live-action adaptation of the iconic Capcom fighting series is coming to theaters soon. In the past few months, the cast has slowly been revealed. With Warrior’s Andrew Koji and The Recruit’s Noah Centineo as leads Ryu and Ken, the ensemble is quite fitting of the franchise. From rapper 50 Cent as Balrog to wrestler Cody Rhodes as Guile, fans are excited to see it come to life. Fortunately, as filming continues, the movie now has a new distributor, as well as an official theater date.</p>



<h2 id="h-street-fighter-film-now-distributed-by-paramount-synopsis-revealed">Street Fighter Film Now Distributed by Paramount, Synopsis Revealed</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Street Fighter film now releasing Oct 16, 2026 under Paramount </p><p>Logline: “Set in 1993, estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Andrew Koji) and Ken Masters (Noah Centineo) are thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior… <a href="https://t.co/7bK7UEnkCY">pic.twitter.com/7bK7UEnkCY</a></p></div>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1963680725808390578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In an article from <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-plot-cast-1236361494/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Paramount Pictures is now distributing Street Fighter. The studio inked a deal with its previous distributor, Legendary, for three years. With the news, the studio revealed the official release date: October 16th, 2026. The film had started filming earlier last month, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-noah-centineo-ken-tease/">teases of looks</a> from several actors.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the first synopsis of the Street Fighter film is now out. The logline, shared by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-plot-cast-1236361494/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, is available below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Set in 1993, estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Andrew Koji) and Ken Masters (Noah Centineo) are thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior Tournament: a brutal clash of fists, fate, and fury. But behind this battle royale lies a deadly conspiracy that forces them to face off against each other and the demons of their past. And if they don’t, it’s GAME OVER!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, new cast members have been announced, filling out the roster. This includes Reacher’s Olivier Richters as Zangief, Cobra Kai’s Rayna Vallandingham as Juri, SNL’s Kyle Mooney as Joe, and Mortal Kombat’s Mel Jarnson as Cammy. </p>



<p>There’s a lot riding on the new adaptation of Street Fighter, to say the least. Previous Hollywood adaptations have been decent, despite some great casting like Raul Julia as M. Bison and Ming Na Wen as Chun-Li. Still, there’s a lot of potential with the series and, with the recent Hollywood successes of Minecraft and Fallout, perhaps Street Fighter will join them.</p>
