            <title><![CDATA[Can You Make Glass in Hytale? Hytale Windows, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-glass-make-windows/</link>
            <guid>1405921</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale is now available in early access, and, despite the similarities with Minecraft, there are some differences, including the process of making Windows and how to get Glass.</p>



<p>The Hypixel Studios title has plenty to discover, but for those who are used to playing Minecraft, it may be difficult to get those approaches out of their heads and learn the new mechanics.</p>



<p>This guide from Insider Gaming will make it easier, though, with a breakdown on Glass in Hytale and how to make Windows.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-make-glass-in-hytale">Can You Make Glass in Hytale?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Craft away. Screenshot bt</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Although you can create Glass objects in Hytale, you can’t create Glass blocks, or panes of Glass, like you can in Minecraft.</strong></p>



<p>The Minecraft process of gathering Sand and burning it in a furnace will result in Glass Bottles being created. While these are useful for creating items like Health Potions, it won’t give you an item you can use to fill in holes in the side of your base to allow natural light to pass through.</p>



<p>So, while Glass is in Hytale, the whole process works completely differently from Minecraft, but it’s actually much simpler.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-make-windows-in-hytale">How to Make Windows in Hytale</h2>



<p><strong>Windows in Hytale are created by using Stone block or Wood blocks and interacting with the Builder’s Workbench, which shows all the items that the selected block can be turned into.</strong></p>



<p>With a Stone  or Wood block, you can select everything from windows to doors, stairs to trapdoors, without worrying about placement across a crafting grid. Instead, it’s just the one resource you need, which means you can finalize the design of your base much quicker than you can in Minecraft.</p>



<p>The type of Windows you can create depends on the type of Stone or Wood inputted, and there are some big differences. Marble Cobblestone, for example, provide Light Temple Windows, while Softwood Planks provide Crude Windows, so it’s best to gather a variety of different materials and choose the design you like best, particularly as not every Window design even has Glass as part of it.</p>



<p>Not every type of Stone block can be used for Windows, however, as normal Cobblestone, Basalt Cobblestone, and Volcanic Cobblestone are among those that don’t offer a design for Windows when selected in the Builder’s Workbench.</p>
