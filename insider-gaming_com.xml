            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/madfinger-games/" id="2643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MADFINGER Games</a> continues to evolve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gray-zone-warfare/" id="1330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gray Zone Warfare</a> in a strong and sensible direction. The open-world tactical shooter has undergone more than a few changes in recent history, and it’s becoming increasingly impressive with each new drop.</p>



<p>Recently, the team made an update to the game’s identity on Steam, including a term in the product description that’s not seen too often in the tactical shooter space. Gray Zone Warfare, the sumptuous sandbox shooter, is now ‘PvE-first’.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-pve-first-mean-for-gray-zone-warfare">What Does PvE-First Mean for Gray Zone Warfare?</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, Gray Zone Warfare was described as an extraction shooter, with a twist. Players could run into and out of the game world, unbound by any kind of timer-based limitations, and explore the diverse, lush setting of Lamang at will. It bore classic trademarks of the extraction genre, but it was so much more than that.</p>



<p>That concept was recognized by MADFINGER <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-no-longer-extraction-shooter-label/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a pivot last year</a>, with the team officially dubbing Gray Zone Warfare a tactical MMOFPS. It was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re not heading back to base nearly as often. Tasks can be turned in from the field. Your time is spent moving from COP to COP, POI to POI. The world encourages staying out longer, discovering more, encountering more PvP—and staying immersed.</p>



<p>You’re not jumping in and out of isolated raids. You’re living in this world. It’s a tactical MMOFPS. It’s persistent. It’s dangerous. It’s accessible—whether you’re new or a seasoned vet.</p>



<p>It might look like an extraction shooter on the surface, but it’s something different. Something of its own. That’s what makes it special.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>However,</strong> things have changed again, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479810/Gray_Zone_Warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gray Zone Warfare</a> has a whole new identity:</p>



<h3 id="h-high-stakes-pve-first-open-world-tactical-shooter">High-Stakes PvE-First Open-World Tactical Shooter</h3>



<p>It’s a brilliant way to label everything the game offers in one sweep. It has the high-stakes mentality of an extraction shooter, the PvE-first focus that the developers are keen to flesh out, the open-world sandbox elements, and, above all else, it’s a <strong>tactical first-person shooter</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s borderline milsim, mixed in with survival mechanics.</p>



<p>The PvE-first element, as we’ve learned, is a concept that the studio’s CEO and Co-Founder, Marek Rabas, is keen to remain heavy on. There are some ‘amazing moments and stories’ to pull from the PvP world, and that’s not going anywhere in Gray Zone (and will be expanded on in due course), but the PvE push is now front and centre in this game.</p>



<p>In recent months, we’ve seen many more shooters lean more into the concept of PvE.</p>



<p>For instance, Escape from Tarkov is a couple of years deep into running a mirrored PvE platform that accommodates thousands of users. Elsewhere, ARC Raiders players never stop debating the potential for a PvE mode to surface in <strong>that </strong>extraction adventure title.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare <strong>perfectly </strong>suits a PvE operating model, and it does little to take away from the game’s inherent challenge and risk profile. There’s every opportunity for you to run into an opposing faction and get into a firefight, but much of that tension is now centered entirely around AI enemies.</p>



<p>It’s very worth pointing out that, since the beginning, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pve-in-gray-zone-warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gray Zone’s ‘Joint Operations’</a> mode has facilitated 100% PvE combat…</p>







<p>Do you think it’s a win for Gray Zone’s developers to be focusing on PvE? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Get ready to see what’s lined up for the next season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/elder-scrolls-online/" id="354">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. The team announced that the 2026 Season Direct presentation will be held on March 31 at 3:00 p.m. ET on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda-2/" id="3469">Bethesda</a>‘s Twitch channel.</p>



<p>The presentation will lay out the year ahead, providing a roadmap of content for 2026 in The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-history-of-the-elder-scrolls-online">History of The Elder Scrolls Online</h2>



<p>The Elder Scrolls Online has been active for over 12 years, first launching on PC in April 2014. It launched on current-generation consoles in 2021. In 2025, the developers discussed enabling cross-play across multiple platforms, noting they were working on technical changes to make it possible. After full comments here.</p>



<p>The game has actually been in development since 2007, nearly 20 years ago. As fans of the franchise continue to await Elder Scrolls 6, TES Online provides a steady experience. Speaking of the sixth Elder Scrolls game, don’t expect it anytime soon. However, we do know the game will be powered by Creation Engine 3, as Todd Howard recently shared.</p>











<p>Even though The Elder Scrolls 6 is a long way away, at least one Elder Scrolls game is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 very soon. </p>



<p>During a Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase earlier in the month, Bethesda confirmed Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered for Nintendo Switch 2 as part of its growing third-party lineup. That game will be coming out in 2026. Learn more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026/" id="174499">here</a>.</p>
