            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports has announcemed that it’s not going to release F1 26 next year. </p>



<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTSF1/status/1990813568325857352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it was revealed</a> that instead of releasing F1 2026 in 2026, EA Sports will release a paid expansion for F1 25. This expansion will represent <strong>“the 2026 FIA Formula One World Championship, including new cars, teams, and regulations.”</strong></p>







<p>The next game, then, is scheduled to release in 2027. EA says that the next game in franchise will be a “<strong>reimagined and more expansive EA Sports F1 game”</strong>. They said that the game will deliver a <strong>“deeply authentic and innovative Formula 1 experience.”</strong></p>



<p>Questions around the future of the F1 franchise at EA have been popping up ever since the launch of F1 25. That release was scheduled to be the last of the current contract, though there was an option to extend it for two years. </p>



<p>EA had initially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ea-sports-f1-series-continues-with-two-year-option-pick-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to Insider Gaming</a> that the option was picked up to keep the franchise going. However, just hours later, the company retracted that confirmation saying, <strong>“Apologies for the inconvenience, but we’ve been informed that the information we provided earlier today is inaccurate and we don’t have any information at this time.”</strong></p>



<p>Since then, it had been silent from EA and Formula 1 on the state of the series and F1 26. Until now, that is.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA and Formula 1 for added context on the decision to not release a game next year. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>







<p>What do you think of EA Sports releasing a paid update for F1 25 instead of F1 26 and waiting until 2027 to release the next game?
