<p>One of Nintendo’s anti-Palworld monster-capture patent applications has been rejected by the Japanese Patent Office as it “lacked an inventive step”.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have been battling PocketPair, the publisher of Palworld, in a patent infringement lawsuit for some time now. Most recently, we had heard a patent expert say that Nintendo is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-is-so-wrong-it-hurts-about-mods-not-counting-as-prior-art-says-patent-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“so wrong it hurts”</a> regarding mods not being counted as prior art. Now, prior art is the main reason why Nintendo’s patent application was rejected in Japan. </p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-anti-palworld-patent-rejected-due-to-prior-art-references-including-ark-monster-hunter-4-and-more">Nintendo’s Anti-Palworld Patent Rejected Due to Prior Art References Including ARK, Monster Hunter 4, and More</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a>, Nintendo’s rejected patent application, 2024-031879, was a subclaim of one of the anti-Palworld monster-capture patents and a parent of another. It was dismissed for lack of an inventive step, meaning it did not involve an innovative idea that was not an obvious combination of two or more pre-existing concepts. Several games were cited as prior art references. </p>



<p>The patent office determined, through a third-party submission of prior art, that this step existed before Nintendo’s December 2021 priority date, with games such as Studio Wildcard’s ARK, Capcom’s Monster Hunter 4, Pocketpair’s Craftopia, Kantai Collection, and Pokémon GO using it. However, the refusal was non-final, meaning Nintendo can either abandon this patent or file a new patent application with amended claims. </p>
