            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splinter Cell fans everywhere have been chomping at the bit for a new game in the series, but Ubisoft has left the franchise to stagnate for more than a decade. It’s getting to a point of desperation for some, especially with talk of the ‘Splinter Cell Remake’ floating around <strong>all the time</strong> with almost nothing concrete to back it up.</p>



<p>However, a recent announcement revealed that Sam Fisher is (kind of) back in an all-new way, emerging in the popular VR extraction shooter, Ghosts of Tabor.</p>







<h2 id="h-ghosts-of-tabor-x-splinter-cell-crossover">Ghosts of Tabor x Splinter Cell Crossover</h2>



<p>If you’ve ever wanted to experience the role of Sam Fisher from a VR-based perspective, now is your chance. In a new trailer uploaded by the Combat Waffle team, it was revealed that an official partnership with Ubisoft has brought Fisher’s iconic garb to the VR shooter.</p>



<p>The ‘Splinter Cell DLC’ allows players to <strong>become </strong>Sam Fisher, but elements like the gruff tones of Michael Ironside will be up to them to emulate.</p>



<p>Here’s what’s coming in the Ghosts of Tabor x Splinter Cell DLC:</p>



<ul>
<li>Karambit Melee Weapon</li>



<li>FN 57 Weapon Camo</li>



<li>MP7 Weapon Camo</li>



<li>Third Echelon NVGs</li>



<li>Third Echelon Tactical Kevlar Vest</li>



<li>Third Echelon Suit</li>
</ul>



<p>Why wait for a new game containing Sam Fisher to surface when you can dress up as him and go on a merry LARP in Ghosts of Tabor, which we once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghosts-of-tabor-tarkov-vr/">dubbed ‘Escape from Tarkov VR’</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the Splinter Cell DLC:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Ghosts of Tabor is available on Meta Quest, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957780/Ghosts_of_Tabor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC VR</a>, and PlayStation VR, and it’s widely considered one of the best shooters to occupy the VR ecosystem. It has been around for a couple of years, and the folks at Combat Waffle are constantly updating the title with fresh content and tweaks.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Farm A Fish monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Bait, Coins and much more.</p>



<p>Farm A Fish puts you in charge of your own underwater empire on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-universal-tower-defense-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>. Unlike typical fishing games where you simply catch and sell, this aquatic tycoon challenges you to build a thriving fish farming business from scratch. Starting with just a small pond and basic equipment, you’ll expand your operation by cultivating different fish species, each with their own requirements and profit margins. The goal is to build up your ponds, gather better gear and pets, and scale your fishing business to become the most successful fisher in the game.</p>







<p>Progression in Farm A Fish revolves around the game’s primary currency, Coins, which you earn from your fish ponds and spend on new pond expansions, worker upgrades, and special items. The value of your harvests depends on several factors including fish rarity (common to mythic), fish weight (heavier specimens fetch higher prices), and special mutations that can significantly increase a fish’s worth. Although Coins can be earned through regular gameplay by selling your catches and completing quests from NPCs, the fastest way to accelerate your progress is by redeeming promo codes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-active-farm-a-fish-codes">Active Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li>XMAS: 1x Christmas Bait</li>



<li>EARLY: 5x Food Scoop and 500x Coins</li>



<li>Wilco: 1x Wilco Cat and 1x Wilco Pond Skin</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-farm-a-fish-codes">Expired Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<p>There are no expired Farm A Fish Codes at the time of writing. All the released codes are still active and thus players will need to redeem them quickly before they expire.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-farm-a-fish-codes">How To Redeem Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Farm A Fish Codes Redemption Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like most Roblox games, redeeming codes in Farm A Fish is easy and rather simple. That being said, here are the steps for new players:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot Farm A Fish on Roblox</li>



<li>Then open the Store menu on the left side of the screen</li>



<li>Scroll down until you hit the Redeem codes section</li>



<li>Enter a working code in the text box</li>



<li>Click on Redeem button to claim your rewards</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-farm-a-fish-codes">How To Get More Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<p>Farm A Fish codes can typically be found through several official channels maintained by the game’s developer, Tetra Games. The most reliable source is the official Farm A Fish Discord server, where developers post new codes in the dedicated #game-updates channel whenever they release major updates or celebrate special events. This community hub is where you’ll often find codes first, sometimes even before they’re announced elsewhere.</p>







<p>Another great place to check is the official Tetra Games Roblox Group page, where the development team regularly shares news about the game, including promotional codes during milestones like reaching certain player counts or celebrating holidays. However, keeping track of all these sources can be time-consuming, especially since Farm A Fish codes don’t come with notifications when they expire. Therefore, we recommend bookmarking this guide in your browser, as it is regularly updated with the latest Farm A Fish codes and removes expired ones promptly to ensure you always have access to valid codes.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Endzone Strike monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including draws, ball skins and much more.</p>



<p>Endzone Strike fuses high-energy anime action with American football in a unique <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-pet-capture-adventure-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that’s taking the platform by storm. This isn’t your standard sports simulator – it’s a high-octane battle of special moves, character collection, and strategic team building. Players start with basic characters and limited abilities, then work their way up to fielding a squad of powerhouse athletes with flashy special attacks. Each match earns you Strike Points that serve as the game’s main currency. </p>







<p>These points are your ticket to recruiting new players through the gacha-style summoning system, upgrading existing team members, and purchasing equipment that boosts performance. While grinding matches steadily builds your team, the developers regularly release redemption codes on social media and Discord events that grant instant Strike Points, exclusive character skins, or limited-time power-ups.</p>

<p>Endzone Strike codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the developer’s social media accounts. This includes the No Skill Games Discord group, where the team often shares codes during game updates, milestones, and special events. New codes typically appear during significant game updates, when the community reaches milestones (like the recent “10KMEMBERS” code celebrating 10,000 Discord members), or as compensation when there are technical issues with the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Indie Game Awards took place on December 18, and, as many could assume, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-indie-game-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took home the awards</a> for Game of the Year and Debut Game. However, things have changed and The Indie Game Awards are making a big decision to strip the Clair Obscur and developer Sandfall Interactive of their awards over the use of gen AI in the game.</p>



<p>In an announcement made on Saturday afternoon, Six One Indie, the creators of the show, said that it’s removal comes after the discovery after voting was done, and the show was recorded.</p>







<p><strong>“The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself,”</strong> <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement reads</a>. <strong>“When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination.”</strong></p>



<p>Six One Indie ended by thanking the community for being patient and providing feedback on the situation.</p>



<p><strong>“The organizational team behind the ceremony is a small crew with big ambitions, and The Indie Game Awards can only grow with your help and support,”</strong> they said. <strong>“We already can’t wait for the 2026 ceremony!”</strong></p>







<p>With Clair Obscur’s disqualification, the awards will now go to the runner ups. That means the award for Debut Game goes to Sorry We’re Closed while Game of the Year now goes to Blue Prince.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>
