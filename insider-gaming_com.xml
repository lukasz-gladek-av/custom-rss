<p>It probably happens to you all the time. You’re sitting there immersed in a new video game, and then a new character is introduced, and you swear that their voice actor sounds familiar.

We’ll make life a little easier with the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth voice cast!</p>



<h2 id="h-main-voice-cast-for-final-fantasy-7-rebirth">Main Voice Cast for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</h2>



<p>The cast of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is quite large and varied, with a slew of main characters, supporting characters, and more than a few side characters you’ll interact with occasionally but not frequently. They’re all mostly memorable in some way, thanks in no small part to their highly talented voice actors!</p>

<p>A pattern of stickers spelling out the N-word on a Desert Eagle skin caught the attention of several viewers during a professional Counter-Strike 2 match broadcast. The CS2 player using the skin has addressed it, claiming that they didn’t realize what was being displayed.</p>



<p>While the player may not have noticed during the match, the CS2 community certainly did, and so did the tournament organizer.</p>



<hr>



<p>During an online match in the ESL Challenger League in Europe, 9Pandas player Vladislav “Krad” Kravchenko was spotted using a Desert Eagle with a pattern of stickers spelling out the N-word. The stickers are mirrored because Krad plays left-handed, but it’s still very clear what the original sticker placement was trying to do.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The sticker spelling resulted in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1i6zt5e/9_pandas_krad_had_a_deagle_with_the_n_word_in_an/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post</a> on the primary Counter-Strike subreddit, where many speculated that Krad received the skin recently in a trade, and wouldn’t know what was on it until getting into a game. On X, Krad <a href="https://x.com/Kradcs/status/1882033348199297031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided</a> his explanation, claiming he had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-buy-counter-strike-skins-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought the skin</a> less than a week ago and didn’t notice the word spelled out because he plays left-handed.</p>



<p>When someone buys a skin through Steam or another market, the listing itself doesn’t include the sticker pattern. However, Steam and most markets offer players the option of inspecting the weapon in-game before buying. Additionally, the in-menu weapon inspection screen is always right-handed, even if the player’s settings are left-preferred, so an inspection would clearly show the inappropriate pattern.</p>



<p>The ability for players to have custom control over where they apply stickers was added almost a year ago. Immediately, players used the new feature to <a href="https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/cs2-devs-arent-mad-theyre-just-disappointed-in-nsfw-player-sticker-crafts">apply various NSFW words and designs</a>. On January 22, 2025, Krad <a href="https://t.me/kradcsgo/1531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> via his Telegram account that he has received a two week ban from ESL because of the Deagle.</p>

<p>Developer Don’t Nod has announced that Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2 has been delayed by a month. The announcement came on Wednesday via the <a href="https://dont-nod.com/en/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s website</a>. </p>



<p>Tape 1, titled “Bloom”, is scheduled release on February 18th while Tape 2, “Rage”, is now set to launch on April 15 rather than March.</p>



<p>“We want to give the team the necessary time to refine the experience, address more bugs, and enhance the storytelling for a truly immersive continuation of the journey,” the studio said.</p>



<p>“We feel that this extra time is necessary to ensure we deliver the experience players and fans deserve. We are confident that this delay will allow us to provide you with a richer experience and we can’t wait for you to live the full journey of Swann, Nora, Autumn, and Kat.”</p>



<p>Despite the delay, Don’t Nod says that they have “surprises” up their sleeves in between the release of Tape 1 and Tape 2. What those surprises are, however, wasn’t hinted at in the announcement. </p>



<p>Upon release, Tape 2 will be a free downloadable update for Lost Records.</p>



<p>Last October, Don’t Nod announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod-likely-facing-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“reorganization project”</a>  in order to “safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem”. This project would would result in layoffs at the studio, though it’s unknown if that was part of the reason for the game’s delay.</p>



<p>When it does release, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
