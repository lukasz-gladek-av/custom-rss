<p>Star Citizen, from Cloud Imperium, is one of the most bizarre projects you’ll ever lay your eyes on. In 2012, Cloud Imperium kickstarted a crowdfunded project to bring Star Citizen to life, and within a couple of months, millions of dollars had been raised to support the development of this space-faring epic.</p>



<p>Today, the game still hasn’t been ‘released,’ and it still sits in alpha. Recently, the team at Cloud Imperium passed the <strong>$800 million mark </strong>on the crowdfunding (and sales) scale, moving ever closer to the almighty and ludicrous $1 billion mark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-burning-money">Burning Money</h2>



<p>In October 2024, our Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured a monumental exclusive report</a> from within Cloud Imperium, diving deep into the company’s culture and the decade-long development cycle of Star Citizen.</p>



<p>It came off the back of a new working mandate that forced employees to grind their asses off to hit deadlines for a time. The report delved into financial updates that suggested the hundreds of millions of dollars the company had raised had been poured into developing the title and that the financial outlook for the firm was ‘bleak’ at best.</p>



<p>Then came the layoffs.</p>



<p>We heard from those inside CIG that the creative processes internal to the company weren’t working and that even the minutest of details were taking <strong>days </strong>to be decided on because of poor creative control and micromanagement.</p>



<p>In January, CIG’s founder, Chris Roberts, stated that the team is ‘closer than ever’ to hitting that 1.0 release mark, but there are still no timelines or indicators to suggest when that will happen. Until then, players will keep pouring in their pledges, donations, subscriptions, and purchases, some of which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-legatus-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can sell for as much as $48,000</a>.</p>



<p>It’s possible to track the trajectory of <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Star Citizen’s financials</a> through the official site, where it’s revealed that, at the time of writing, $802,335,704 has been raised or earned by the project.</p>



<p>Have you ever invested any cash in Star Citizen, and are you jonesing for the 1.0 release to hit? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov%E2%80%99s-first-battle-pass-is-here-and-it-has-more-than-100-rewards-to-claim.1160115/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled the first battle pass in the Tarkov universe – Season 0. It’s available exclusively in Escape from Tarkov: Arena, the multiplayer, session-based spin-off that was released in December 2023. It’s a solid staging ground to gauge the responses of players before something similar could be introduced for the core extraction shooter, though.</p>



<p>The Season 0 Battle Pass has more than 100 unique rewards, ranging from custom tactical clothing to masks and from GP coins to supply crates for Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-the-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-free">Is the Tarkov Arena Battle Pass Free?</h2>



<p>That’s the question on the minds of Tarkov players worldwide, and <strong>yes</strong>, the Season 0 Battle Pass is completely free to access and grind.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that the 100+ tier battle pass will be progressable entirely through Escape from Tarkov: Arena, but there will be rewards that apply to both that game and the foundational extraction shooter title.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov: Arena - 0.3.0 BattlePass Season 0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQAYSNYVAvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>As soon as you start your path with the Season 0 Battle Pass, you’ll unlock exclusive tactical outfits available in <strong>both </strong>Escape from Tarkov: Arena <strong>and </strong>Escape from Tarkov, and even PvE players can take advantage of the new loot.</p>



<p>BSG <a href="https://arena.tarkov.com/news/patch-0300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has advised</a> that not <strong>everything </strong>will be available in PvE, as the synchronisation mechanics between EFT: Arena and PvE mode aren’t yet complete – Ref doesn’t exist in that vertical, for instance.</p>



<p>Players will have two months to grind through the Season 0 Battle Pass, but it has been suggested that the timeline might be extended, depending on feedback.</p>



<p>Also, everything you unlock in the battle pass, including ‘Battle Pass Currency’, will be persistent through Tarkov and Tarkov Arena’s regular wipes.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to grinding the Season 0 Battle Pass? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-players-not-owning-digital-games-double/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-players-not-owning-digital-games-in-the-crew-lawsuit.1160100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-players-not-owning-digital-games-double/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In November 2024, Ubisoft’s lawyers started contending with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-class-action-lawsuit-shutting-down-the-crew/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a class-action lawsuit</a> raised following the shutting down of The Crew, an MMO-based, live-service racing game, taking it offline for one and all. </p>



<p>The lawsuit alleged that Ubisoft had ‘duped’ players into believing they were buying a game with permanent ownership. Ubisoft retorted that they were only ever buying a ‘license to play’ the game. In the latest update in the case, Ubisoft’s legal team has doubled down on that concept, and the plaintiffs have fired back with amendments.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-not-unfettered-ownership">It’s Not ‘Unfettered Ownership’</h2>



<p>In a document dug up by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR6qVUri3YEl-Rm1i2hUkopLGiFMB0vcfSJN_2XvFyiSWDUJc6EDhA_0kDCXkw_aem_vnLG_QctHg-dUb7i1mTNHA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> (and <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/848030901/The-Crew-lawsuit-Ubisoft-response-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">helpfully transcribed</a>), it was revealed that Ubisoft’s tenacious legal team filed to have the case thrown out of the California court. The team claimed – or rather, reiterated – that <em>‘customers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license.’</em></p>



<p>Per the original claim from the plaintiffs:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Ubisoft Inc. allegedly misled&nbsp;purchasers of its video&nbsp;game <em>The Crew</em> into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownershiprights in the game, rather than a&nbsp;limited license to access the game.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The recent amendments to the class-action suit saw the claimants leaning on the law surrounding gift certification sales in California. The hope is that they can stress that they were ‘robbed’ of digital currency, as in California, gift cards aren’t allowed to expire – but any in-game credits players had when The Crew was shut down did just that: they disappeared.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Ubisoft’s Director of Subscriptions, Philippe Tremblay, went on record speaking about the transformation of gaming from a physical to a digital world. He suggested that players should <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-not-owning-games-comfortable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘get comfortable’ with not owning their games</a> and instead acquiring limited licenses to play them.</p>



<p>Gamers have never forgotten these comments, and even today, folks on social media platforms worldwide will jibe Ubisoft fans with comments about them ‘renting their games.’</p>



<p>With the latest amendments having been made to the class-action lawsuit, Ubisoft has been given a new window in which to respond. We’ll have the latest on this case by April 29, which is the deadline.</p>



<p>Do you think Ubisoft is right, or are you on the side of the plaintiffs in complaining that digital ownership should also be <strong>permanent </strong>ownership? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Many expected Marvel Rivals to siphon off a number of players away from Overwatch. Thanks to the latest report from NewZoo on the state of the gaming industry, we now know many jumped ship, and what percentage of the overall market Marvel Rivals its hands on.</p>



<h2 id="h-even-overwatch-classic-did-almost-nothing-to-stop-marvel-rivals">Even Overwatch Classic Did Almost Nothing to Stop Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>According to the latest<a href="https://resources.newzoo.com/hubfs/Free%20Reports/PC%20and%20Console%20Report/2025_Newzoo_The%20PC%20and%20Console%20Gaming%20Report.pdf?utm_campaign=3440460-2025%20PC%20%26%20console&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kVtouoRdXai43NTW21yCjxlIAy1Rm3YMFWNGEsQ6J0AgoSoYZEdaa2ExtnJN1BX5v7OZB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> gaming industry report from NewZoo</a>, 45% of the Overwatch 2 players who stopped playing in December 2024 played Marvel Rivals instead. After hitting a very high peak in daily active users when it launched in early access in October 2022, Overwatch 2’s numbers dipped over the next year and a half. After stagnating throughout 2024, the game’s numbers got even lower in December when Marvel Rivals launched. The Overwatch: Classic Event temporarily increased player engagement by 12%, but this was followed by a 26% decline that coincided with the Marvel Rivals launch.</p>



<p>Despite releasing in the last month of 2024 though, Marvel Rivals was one of the most played games of the year. It had the eighth highest share of total playtime on Steam in 2024, and was the third highest among 2024 releases, behind Helldivers 2 and Palworld. Amongst all the most played free-to-play 2024 releases on Steam, PS5, and Xbox, Marvel Rivals is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-hits-40-million-players-within-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the only game</a> that has not shut down or is more than 90% below its peak monthly average users (MAU).</p>



<p>Free-to-play game playtime reportedly grew in 2024, and Marvel Rivals was also a major part of that. Marvel Rivals was the second highest source of growth in free-to-play game playtime (amongst new releases) in 2024, just behind The First Descendant. It’s worth noting though that The First Descendant released several months before Marvel Rivals did, and according to current Steam player numbers, Marvel Rivals currently is drastically outpacing it.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals’ numbers on Steam have been slowly declining since launch, but a surge could occur <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-all-changes-and-updates-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in just a matter of days when Season 2 starts</a>. Will it finish 2025 as one of the most played games of the year?

<p>In addition, Microsoft boldly decided to remove console exclusivity and release the game on PlayStation 5. This follows a trend of other titles making the leap, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to PlayStation this spring, and rumors suggest that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War and Halo</a> could also be coming. For all the PlayStation users who initially missed out on Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle, this guide is for you. </p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the most widely appreciated games of 2025. It’s a phenomenal medieval RPG with a winding, adventurous story, and it’s packed to the brim with top-tier talent and wonderful, cinematic sequences. That’s what I alluded to in my full review for the game, at least.</p>



<p>I recently had the chance to catch up (again) with Tom McKay at the BAFTA Games Awards in London. We spent a few minutes talking about the success of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is one of the best-selling games of 2025 and will <strong>surely </strong>be up for many awards as the year unravels.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-expectations">‘Huge Expectations’</h2>



<p>I was the first person <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">to interview Tom McKay</a> about Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is something I’ll never stop boasting about. I hold the series very close to my heart, having poured hundreds of hours into both games and connecting eternally with the characters, particularly McKay’s Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<p>When I chatted with Tom at the BAFTA Games Awards, I was eager to gauge just how much this game had defied their expectations:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The studio had huge expectations based on the first game, a ton of effort went into the development of the second game, and they took their time – they put everything they had into it.</p>



<p>They were certainly proud of the product and knew that what they had was a good thing, but you can never predict how people will see that. Ultimately, it’s the players who are the most important reviewers of all.</p>



<p>The kind of energy and support and positivity that we’ve had from the fans has been incredible, and I don’t think any of us anticipated that, I certainly didn’t.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The fan base for Kingdom Come has exploded in recent months. It helps that the cast and crew have been immensely supportive of what they’ve produced. The actor behind the iconic Hans Capon, Luke Dale, has taken to streaming the game and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hans-capon-superstar-streamer-kingdom-come/">become an overnight sensation</a>, racking up thousands of viewers.</p>



<p>I asked McKay how things had changed since we caught up just after KCD2 was announced to the world.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It feels amazing – it’s <strong>like a sort of fever dream</strong>, really.</p>



<p>I think back to the very beginning of the first game, when I flew out the Prague and had what was essentially a final audition and I met the core creative team for the first time. That just feels like a world away, you know? </p>



<p>It is like a fever dream that we’re actually having this conversation about this game. However, in terms of what they’ve achieved and what they’ve made, Warhorse Studios, that doesn’t feel like a fever dream, because they’re so talented and so passionate, so on that level, it feels totally fitting. </p>



<p>In terms of that, I salute all of them. The reason I’m standing here is because of the work they’ve done.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">one hell of a roadmap ahead</a>, with three planned expansions yet to drop this year. Warhorse Studios is also releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode/">Hardcore Mode next week</a>, complete with a new lineup of perks.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of life left yet in KCD2.</p>

<p>In my review for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I noted that most of the game’s wildlife is pretty pointless. All across the world, animals roam free with no real purpose or control, and you can’t <strong>hunt them</strong> like you could in previous titles.</p>



<p>One thing I can’t complain about in the animal stakes is the sheer volume of cute kittens, puppy dogs, baby deer, and other adorable creatures scampering around Feudal Japan. I’ve just learned that (at least) one of those cuddly pets is based on a real cat that belongs to a Ubisoft developer.</p>

<p>When you work as a Production Manager on a game, one thing you’ll surely be able to do is immortalise your feline friend for all to see.</p>



<p>That’s what Nik Pantis did while working on Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Pantis revealed that his stark white kitty, Ghost, is immortalised in Assassin’s Creed Shadows as ‘Bakeneko,’ a one-of-a-kind supernatural yōkai or kaibyō – a <em>ghost cat</em>. </p>



<p>He shared an image of Ghost both in the real world and as the Bakeneko in Assassin’s Creed:</p>











<p>This isn’t the first time a legendary cat has found its way into an Assassin’s Creed game. In 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, a special cat belonging to a fan of the game surfaced – with a very interesting feature. The cat had a natural representation of the Assassin’s Creed logo across its face.</p>



<p>Sadly, the cat passed away before the game was released, but Ubisoft pulled some strings to immortalise a treasured companion.</p>



<p>I’m off to find me a Bakeneko.</p>

<p>I wasn’t very fortunate growing up when it came to gaming-based technology. I was always a generation behind, and I <strong>never </strong>got games when they were released – I’d wait to get them second-hand further down the line. When I caught up with Abubakar Salim at the BAFTA Games Awards, he echoed that with a similar sentiment – when he was young, it was one or two games a year, <strong>tops</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s partly why he posted a bold statement <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1907522479008203189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> when the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 console (and, by association, the games) was revealed a few days ago. He stressed that there was a good reason why he ‘fought’ to get Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the first game from his Surgent Studios, on the market with a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Check out the full video interview here before jumping in:</p>

<h2 id="h-why-make-it-harder">‘Why Make it Harder?’</h2>



<p>The price of the Nintendo Switch 2 shocked some fans when it was revealed last week – and the price of software left more than a few folks with slack jaws. It’s a world away from the Nintendo Switch and much more than you’d expect to pay for a console that is known far and wide as <strong>the </strong>family platform.</p>



<p>But don’t worry – Nintendo has advised that if you can’t afford the Switch 2, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cant-afford-a-nintendo-switch-2-buy-a-switch-1-nintendo-says/">just opt for the first console</a> that was released back in 2017.</p>



<p>Don’t even get me started about GTA 6 and the $100 base price tag…</p>



<p>As I caught up with Abubakar at the BAFTA Games Awards in London, we got onto the topic of his post on social media and took a trip down memory lane together:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I kind of look back to myself as a kid and what I was allowed to play, and you know, I had like my one or two games that I got a year, right? </p>



<p>I’m now in a position where I’m able to play more, but I think about the kids of today and what they’re able to play and what they have access to, and I think, you know, the reason why we made Zau $20 was because it was like, ‘What’s the price of pizza? What’s the price of something that you’ll get mates around and enjoy and have an experience with’, and that was essentially where that mentality was.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a phenomenal point, and it’s at the forefront of the minds of everyone trying to pre-order a Nintendo Switch 2 as I write this. We’ve already seen the scalpers selling their pre-orders on eBay for exorbitant sums, as if it wasn’t hard enough to get one already. </p>



<p>We then started discussing Nintendo’s position in the wider industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People kind of forget that accessibility also accounts to socio-economics – money, man. </p>



<p>We’re in a very tough time at the moment, so why make it harder and have that bar eventually so high? </p>



<p>Yeah, I was a bit upset about the price changes, because Nintendo is a family game, Nintendo is a family genre. It’s a family platform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Looking to the future and what we dubbed ‘the next generation’, Abubakar explained: “I know that there’s going to be a kid out there that’s going to be inspired to play games and do what I do.”</p>
