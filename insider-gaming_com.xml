<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows has surpassed Odyssey and Origins’ launch numbers, hitting a 2 million player milestone.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-2-million-players">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Has Surpassed 2 Million Players</h2>



<p>The official Assassin’s Creed account on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1903431554459644198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has just confirmed that Shadows has crossed the launch numbers of AC Origins and Odyssey, with 2 million players joining their latest adventure in Feudal Japan. The game managed to cross the 1 million players mark <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-crosses-1-million-players-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within the first day</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s decision to launch Shadows Day One on Steam seems to be going well, too, as the game has already beaten AC Origin’s all-time peak numbers and is now closing in on AC Odyssey. Shadows has hit an all-time peak of 59,941 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">today</a> (at the time of writing), and the number can go higher as it’s the weekend. This number beats Valhalla and Origns all-time peaks of 15,679 and 41,551 and is just a bit shy of beating Odyssey’s 62,069. However, it’s worth noting that none of the other AC games were Day One releases on Steam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was subject to several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays</a> before it was released on March 20. However, the added time has helped the developers provide the players with a more immersive and polished experience. It’ll be exciting to see how many more players the game attracts over time and whether it becomes the most-played Assassin’s Creed game yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows may have set a record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-endgame-credits-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for its endgame credits</a>. Also, the Japanese government is worried about ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imitation attacks</a>’ based on the game.

<p>Delta Force developers have revealed they are developing a new ‘solo mode’ for the game’s campaign, allowing players who prefer to play alone to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/delta-force-devs-adding-solo-mode-easier-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, Delta Force’s game design director Ricky Liao mentioned a ‘solo mode’ they will introduce soon for Black Hawk Down. The solo mode will be “a more approachable experience for players who prefer playing alone”. At the same time, the developers will maintain “the core tactical elements of the game” to provide a similar experience in the new game mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-delta-force-black-hawk-down-solo-mode">Delta Force Black Hawk Down Solo Mode</h2>



<p>The developers will provide different difficulty options for Delta Force Black Hawk Down’s upcoming solo mode, so players don’t need to face off against enemies created for co-op difficulty. However, the campaign will remain challenging no matter what, as the game “isn’t meant to be a fast-paced shooter”. The developers want “players to think critically, strategize, and collaborate effectively with teammates, creating a level of tension and realism that mirrors real military operations.“</p>



<p>Apart from the ‘solo mode,’ the developers also discussed adding balancing changes to make the game seem “more fair.” However, they confirmed that the game will not become easier as “the challenge is intentional.” The developers want players to approach this game tactically “and as a team.” For those wondering, Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down launched to ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mostly negative</a>’ reviews on Steam, as many felt it was too difficult.</p>



<p>In other news, Delta Force has issued <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-issues-thousands-of-10-year-bans-to-clamp-down-on-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,000s of 10-year bans</a> to clamp down on cheaters.

<p>Former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida recently discussed redesigning Crash Bandicoot for Japanese marketing because the character looked ‘scary’.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-was-crash-bandicoot-redesigned-for-japan">How Was Crash Bandicoot Redesigned for Japan?</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oved6qVecH8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kyle Bosman</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida-says-the-playstation-marketing-team-had-to-completely-redesign-crash-bandicoot-in-ps1-commercials-because-he-was-too-ugly-for-the-japanese-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), Yoshida discussed Crash Bandicoot’s marketing plans for Japan and the hurdles they had to overcome, such as the redesign. Yoshida explained that Crash Bandicoot initially had green eyes and very thick eyebrows, which was “a bit scary”, so the devs were asked to make his eyes brown “like Japanese people” and thin the eyebrows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoshida elaborated that Crash Bandicoot’s body had to be redesigned, too, as the character was “hairy on the surface,” which was “a bit scary” as it “looked like an animal.” Hence, they asked the Naughty Fog to create a plastic skin for Crash’s Japanese marketing materials, where the character would be “shiny”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The marketing plans for Crash Bandicoot in Japan included a 15-second advertisement where the game’s characters dance to a tune. Yoshida revealed that “Naughty Dog liked” their idea, adding that Crash starts dancing during the opening of Crash Bandicoot 3, and the idea for that came from Japanese marketers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a recent seminar at GDC, Cameron Williams, formerly of Rockstar Games, offered a walkthrough of the issues plaguing open-world games. Williams has since relocated, taking his talents to Absurd Ventures, the studio founded by Dan Houser, but he has previously worked on Grand Theft Auto 6 and Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>He stressed that large open worlds with too much content are leading to analysis paralysis and preventing players from wanting to actively explore. The worlds we’re experiencing these days are so expansive and the incentives for travelling vast distances and covering all the bases just aren’t enough anymore. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-impossible-task">‘An Impossible Task’</h2>



<p>In a panel discussion covered by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/players-dont-explore-former-grand-theft-auto-6-and-red-dead-online-designer-lays-out-the-perils-of-open-world-fatigue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> at GDC, Absurd Ventures’ Cameron Williams took a deep dive into one of the most talked-about issues with open-world games. In his words, they’re becoming too big and diverse, presenting players with so many options that they simply cannot choose what to do next.</p>



<p>This is something that the team at Absurd Ventures is actively trying to avoid.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players just don’t explore, right?</p>



<p>Whether they just simply aren’t compelled or your game has a huge time investment and it’s hard for players to pick up and put down, which is an increasing challenge, especially with the sort of evolving ecosystem of free-to-play and live service games that are kind of eating everyone’s time and attention.</p>



<p>They’re wondering, ‘Okay, how far away is the next thing? I really gotta run all the way across the map? And what’s my gain?</p>



<p>We want to avoid creating a possibility space so large that <strong>players simply just don’t know what to choose</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s something I covered in my recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">review of Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, which is a great game but suffers from the open-world fatigue that Williams is referring to. The objectives are far too spaced apart and the world is enormous, which makes it a chore to navigate, leaving players to rely on fast-travel mechanics far too often.</p>



<p>These games can be hellish for what Williams dubbed ‘beeliners’ – players who want to go from A to B with as little interference as possible. They’re the gamers who don’t have time to waste on side content and tertiary missions and want to explore a story and hang up their hat.</p>



<p>Do you think open-world games are becoming far too bloated for the average gamer to enjoy? Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

<p>Battlefield leaks are still flowing thick and fast from the latest round of testing sessions, and in the freshest drops, an all-new map has been revealed. It’s called Battery, and per the reports, it’s a dense urban map themed on Gibraltar, which was a location given away in early concept art for the game.</p>



<p>A series of gameplay clips from Battery have leaked on Reddit. They showcase the new map and some Conquest action – check out the links below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-new-norm">The New Norm</h2>



<p>Many have theorised that Electronic Arts <em><span>all</span>ows </em>these leaks to flow from the Battlefield Labs tests, as it’s effectively free publicity. The consensus so far has been that the next Battlefield game looks <strong>good</strong>, even at this alpha stage. It looks like a throwback to the peaks of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4</a>, which is great news for those more veteran of the series.</p>



<p>In the latest Battlefield leaks, we’re given a look at Battery, a packed urban map with tight streets and tall buildings. It’s the kind of map that fosters intense destruction, close-quarters combat, and kill boxes for vehicles, but it looks great at first blush.</p>



<p>The best look at Battery comes courtesy of user TooFlu2, who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jguiic/gameplay_from_the_new_battlefield_labs_map_and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">uploaded a two-minute clip</a> to the Battlefield subreddit.</p>



<p>In another post, user eggdrums115 uploaded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jgofni/first_overview_of_new_map_battery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a picture of Battery’s tac-map</a>, which shows you just how tight-knit the environment will be.</p>



<p>The more talked-about features pop up again in this gameplay snippet, such as players having the ability to pull downed teammates out of the line of fire. It’s also a showcase for the convention military mechanics that are set to feature in the next Battlefield game – gone are the futuristic gadgets, robot dogs, and wingsuits.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the next Battlefield game? Have the leaks filled you with hope that it will finally deliver when it’s ultimately released? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
