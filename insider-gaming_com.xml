<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valve</a> is going to have to defend itself in court for its pricing and commission practices. A class action lawsuit in the United Kingdom (UK) brought against the company is looking for roughly $900 million (£656 million) in damages.</p>



<p>First filed back in 2024 by Vicki Shotbolt, the lawsuit claims that Valve charges “excessive commission charges” that lead to <strong>“an unfair price which is then passed on to consumers”.</strong></p>







<p>The <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2026-01/16407724%20Vicki%20Shotbolt%20Class%20Representative%20Limited%20v%20Valve%20Corporation%20-%20Judgment%20%28CPO%20Application%29%20%2026%20Jan%202026.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lawsuit also alleges</a> that Valve forces platform party obligations <strong>“that prohibit publishers from selling products through other distribution channels on better terms than the same Products are available on Steam.”</strong> They say that this practice is likely to restrict competition. </p>



<h2 id="h-valve-argues-that-there-s-not-enough-evidence">Valve Argues That There’s Not Enough Evidence</h2>







<p>Valve’s defense claims that the group suing the company can’t establish proper claims regarding its commission pricing due to the fact that the suit doesn’t “consider the effect of Steam Keys”.</p>



<p><strong>“Without a credible plan for taking Steam Keys into account, the PCR cannot establish Steam’s actual effective commission charge, and without this, the PCR cannot establish whether the commission charge amounts to an unfair price,”</strong> Valve argues.</p>



<p>They also say that suing group <strong>“failed to show a plan to determine which Steam Partners actually paid these allegedly unfair prices.”</strong></p>







<p>Despite these arguments and others, the London Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that the case must move forward. As of publishing, Valve has not responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit.</p>



<p>The case was filed on behalf of up to 14 million users, including minors. Shotbolt’s attorneys say that the average loss ranges between $30-$60 (£22-£44) per person.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>High-level players seeking a greater challenge and impossible odds in ARC Raiders have a sadistic new mode to tackle—Solos vs Squads. It’s exactly as it sounds, and if you want to play the new game mode and see what it’s all about, read on for full guide details.</p>



<p>If you thought there was enough danger in ARC Raiders, think again. The January <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds Update</a> went overboard with a new Solos Vs Squads game mode. The nature of it has the community confused, though, so this should clear up any questions you have, fellow Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders">How To Play Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A simple toggle. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>After you’ve updated ARC Raiders to include the Headwinds Update, you should see a setting in the matchmaking box in the bottom corner saying ‘Solos vs. Squads,’ and this is the key to the difficult matchmaking you seek.</strong></p>



<p>Here are some quick steps to help you out:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up your copy of ARC Raiders.</li>



<li>Make sure the Headwinds Update is installed and ready to go.</li>



<li>Go to the main menu.</li>



<li>Select the matchmaking box in the bottom-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Highlight <strong>Solo vs. Squads</strong>.</li>



<li>Have it set to <strong>ON</strong>.</li>



<li>ARC Raiders will find a Solo Vs Squads match for you.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-what-level-do-you-need-to-be-to-play-solo-vs-squads-in-arc-raiders">What Level Do You Need To Be To Play Solo Vs Squads In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>You have to be at least Level 40 to queue up for Solo Vs Squads matchmaking in ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re Level 39, you’ll need to grind it out first. This isn’t a mode for newcomers or even relatively experienced players. Solo Vs Squads is a tough test with hardened players and veterans in mind. If you queue up, there’s a high likelihood you’ll be beaten and bested by macho squads keen to bully you. It’s a dangerous battlefield where humans are more dangerous than anarchic ARCs!</p>

<figure><figcaption>This might be a fairer fight. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking means you’ll set foot on the grounds above Sperenza, and you will run into full squads as a solo player in ARC.</strong></p>



<p>There really is no other way to put this: Solo Vs Sqauds is not for the faint of heart. Real people will potentially pose a far greater problem than AI. You need to be extra cautious, and if you get into a firefight, you need to be prepared, because it will be a tough skirmish.</p>



<p>There are reasons to put yourself through this, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-should-you-play-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders">Why Should You Play Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The Solo Vs Squads playlist allows you to earn more XP for kills and extracts while traversing ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>You don’t get extra-special rewards for this game mode; literally, the only incentive is more XP, and that’s it. This might put many of you off immediately, and it’s likely not supposed to be the new mode everyone gravitates toward.</p>



<p>But as Embark has said in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes-solo-vs-squads-bird-city-open-parties-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds patch notes</a>: “Solo vs Squads is a new matchmaking option for our experienced and highly skilled players who enjoy the PvP aspect of the game. Solo Raiders level 40 and above will get the “Solo vs Squad” toggle above matchmaking to join the Squads queue and tackle squads of Raiders head-on. When opting in, players will receive +20% bonus XP at the end of the round on both successful extract, and defeat.”</p>



<p>Are you a high enough level to play? Is the extra XP worth the risk with no real rewards on offer? Let the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> know if you intend to ride solo, or if you have other ARC Raiders conversations you want to have!</p>
