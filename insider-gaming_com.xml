<p>Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, has commented on Valve’s recently announced Steam Machine. Furthermore, it seems he’s on board with the idea, given Microsoft is a top seller there.</p>







<p>Just announced, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a> is Valve’s answer to the console market. With the device, you can bring your entire Steam library to your TV, complete with a controller. The news has received a lot of positive feedback, particularly from Steam fans, who can now play on the big screen without hassle. With a new console on the market, one would think it would be cause for competition. However, in Xbox’s case, it seems like it’s more welcoming than threatening, at least for Phil Spencer.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988674569717313578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet on X/Twitter</a>, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer commented on the announcement of the Steam Machine. His comment can be found below:</p>



<p>“<strong>Gaming moves forward when players and developers have more ways to play and create, especially across open platforms</strong>,” Phil Spencer <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988674569717313578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a>. “<strong>Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox’s vision from the start. As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere. Congrats on today’s launch.</strong>”</p>



<p>Phil mentions that Xbox games are a high seller on Steam, which is partially true. Games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-300-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Diablo 3 all rank among the best-selling titles on the platform. Seeing as Microsoft is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-addresses-rumors-surrounding-xbox-console-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planning another console</a> and its shift away from exclusivity, perhaps the next console could be similar to the Steam Machine. If so, it might be best for Xbox to keep a close eye on Valve’s new console. Either way, it is nice to see some camaraderie in the industry, especially with Valve being quite a threat to Xbox with the console now.</p>







<p>What do you think of Phil Spencer’s comments on the Steam Machine? Think Xbox will be doing a similar console? Will you be buying a Steam Machine in 2026?
