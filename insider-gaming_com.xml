<p>It makes sense for Activision and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 to capitalize on the Fallout Season 2 Amazon launch, and Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded will see the two massive franchises collide.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-score-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Season 2’s Rotten Tomatoes score is higher than Season 1</a>. The brand is hot stuff once again, and this comes hot off the heels of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Fallout updates</a>. So, why not bring Call of Duty and Fallout together to deliver an epic crossover in Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded?</p>



<p> That’s precisely what’s happening.</p>

<p>The official Call of Duty X channel announced the Fallout crossover and gave everyone a clear timeframe on when to expect it—Season 1 Reloaded.</p>







<p>Black Ops 7 carries on where previous CoD titles have left off by offering new seasonal updates every few weeks. Slapped in the middle of this is a ‘Reloaded’ update, offering new maps, modes, and guns, and sometimes special crossovers and events.</p>



<p>We know that Fallout has eyed up a primetime spot during this period, per the social media message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Okie dokie – stay focused, stay alive. @FalloutonPrime is coming to Call of Duty in Season 01 Reloaded.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There was a lot of talk before BLOPS 7 launched about the nature of unrealistic skins. It was revealed back in August that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-content-will-no-longer-carry-forward-into-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 content would not carry forward into Black Ops 7</a>. But Activision has never ruled out crossovers with brands.</p>



<p>Certain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-skin-collabs-were-cancelled-after-player-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 skin collabs were cancelled after player feedback</a>, but Treyarch senior director of production, Yale Miller, has previously stated that the game will have “Grounded” skins that “Make sense for Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>It’s not explicitly confirmed that the crossover includes Fallout skins, but it’s a logical assumption.</p>

<p>Is Fallout a natural fit for a Call of Duty crossover? Is Nuketown destined for a Fallout-themed variation?
