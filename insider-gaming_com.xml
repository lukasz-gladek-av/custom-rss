<p>An insider has provided players with details about the Resident Evil Requiem story, including the revelation that Grace’s mother is the woman monster. </p>



<p>The insider, Dusk Golem, has been on a roll lately, constantly providing players with details on everything Resident Evil. Recently, they revealed that Resident Evil Requiem gameplay details, which feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-last-of-us-combat-and-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Last of Us’ combat and vehicles</a>. Now, the same insider has provided players with story details for RE9. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-is-the-last-numbered-game">Resident Evil Requiem is the Last Numbered Game</h2>



<p>AestheticGamer, also known as Dusk Golem, has posted a series of posts on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955389794416201746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) regarding Resident Evil Requiem’s story. They first stated that Capcom will make Resident Evil Requiem the last numbered game, RE9 will not only be a conclusion chapter but also a new beginning for Resident Evil. Moreover, it will be the end of the timeline and the conclusion of “everything to do with Umbrella, Raccoon City, its legacy &amp; long history”. This move will enable them to implement significant changes to the franchise. </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem will also serve as the conclusion to everything that began with RE1, RE2, and RE0 (if players choose to include this game). The series will now introduce new characters, new types of horror stories, “without being tied down by the series history.” The team has faced several restrictions over the years, including tying all game elements to Umbrella, Raccoon City, and other locations. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>(1/4) Here is how it's been conveyed to me, &amp; I've been saying this for 4-5 years now actually, but I was updated on this as recent as a couple months ago.</p><p>Resident Evil 9 they plan to make the last numbered RE game. RE9 is a conclusion chapter, as well as new beginnings for RE. <a href="https://t.co/Bnbayi6Lvn">https://t.co/Bnbayi6Lvn</a></p></div>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955389794416201746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In the next series of <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955477988864299267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweets</a>, Dusk Golem revealed what he knows about Resident Evil Requiem’s plot. They recognize all the characters from the first trailer, which features the stalker monster, the hooded figure, and shadowy figures. They are also aware of the game’s framing device, the playable characters, and their roles in the game’s story, but not where their stories lead. The leaker also knows about the upcoming game’s central virus/infection, why they need Grace’s blood, and how everything ties to Umbrella. </p>



<h2 id="h-grace-s-mother-alyssa-is-the-giant-monster">Grace’s Mother, Alyssa, is the Giant Monster </h2>



<p>One significant detail about Resident Evil Requiem’s story that Dusk Golem <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955484464915812717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> is that the giant monster woman is, in fact, Grace’s mother, Alyssa. The leaker states that many will figure this detail out with the Gamescom reveal and preview embargo. Dusk Golem adds that this isn’t a spoiler, as Grace figures out who the monster is shortly after meeting them the first time. Grace is an FBI Technical Analyst and can recognise their own mother. However, the situation initially makes her reluctant to believe it, but she quickly comes to accept it. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-isn-t-a-pure-horror-game">Resident Evil Requiem Isn’t a ‘Pure Horror Game’ </h2>



<p>When asked about Capcom’s recent comments that stated Leon “is a bad match for horror”, the insider <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955646403105243178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a>, noting it’s a “good thing” that “Resident Evil Requiem isn’t a pure horror game”. Golem added that the SGF reveal, the game’s press release, and other details have shown that Resident Evil Requiem will be a mix of horror and “high-stakes cinematic action.”</p>



<p>Regardless, all details mentioned above do not come from an official source, so readers should treat them with caution. </p>



<p>In other news, the next Resident Evil remakes are expected to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrive in 2027/2028</a>.
