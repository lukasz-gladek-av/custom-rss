<p>2026 is a huge year for the Pokémon franchise, and the first of what could be many new titles arriving in the year ahead is right around the corner with the launch of Pokopia.</p>



<p>First revealed last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> certainly captured our attention during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" id="176556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview with the game</a>, and thrusts players into a world where humans have mysteriously vanished, leaving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> to fend for themselves.</p>



<p>If you can’t wait for the release of Pokopia, Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date for Pokopia and exactly when you can get your hands on the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-pokemon-pokopia-release">When Does Pokémon Pokopia Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New faces. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon Pokopia</strong> <strong>has an official release date of March 5, 2026, and the countdown to the release of the Pokémon</strong> <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-sim</a> game is rapidly ticking toward completion.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia gives fans a new way to explore the world of Pokémon and interact with their favourite characters, in a style that is similar to the Animal Crossing franchise and the Xbox 360 classic Viva Piñata.</p>



<p>The March 5 release has been set in stone since November, and further details about the game are expected to be shared in a Pokémon Presents showcase on February 27. However, a showcase on Pokémon Day is yet to be officially confirmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-pokemon-pokopia-start-times">What Are The Pokémon Pokopia Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia’s official release time is at 12 AM local time, but due to time zone differences, you may be able to play significantly earlier than that release.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia has a staggered release time, which theoretically means those in Oceania will be the first to play, but Nintendo Switch 2 settings can be tweaked to play when the doors open. However, it is a more complicated process than with Xbox Series X|S, for example.</p>



<p>The start times for Pokémon Pokopia are listed in the table below, along with the corresponding start time in Australia and its equivalents in major time zones worldwide. </p>



<p>If Pokopia isn’t accessible on the dot at these times, it shouldn’t be too much later, so keep an eye on social media for details.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Pokopia Start Time</th><th data-align="center">Australia Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">5 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwhich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. Today’s February 17, 2026, Quordle is the #1485 edition, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 18.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Thing</li>



<li>Person</li>



<li>Place</li>



<li>Animal</li>



<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept</li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-17-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 17, 2026</h2>
