<p>NetEase has announced that the Advanced Suit 2.0 is coming to Marvel Rivals to celebrate the PC launch of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. The company posted a reveal on Twitter earlier today, stating that the suit will be available for Spider-Man from January 30.</p>

<h2 id="h-friendly-neighbourhood-spider-man">Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter (X), NetEase wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Take the first look at Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (2023) in Marvel Rivals, the Advanced Suit 2.0 blends Otto Octavius’s science with Peter Parker’s genius. Crafted for the toughest battles, it symbolizes Spider-Man’s true grit as a hero.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the reveal image used to showcase the Advanced Suit 2.0 in Marvel Rivals:</p>

<p>Spider-Man 2 was released in 2023 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and while Insomniac neglected to follow up with any major expansions, the game has remained popular since. On January 30, the web-slinging hero title will land on PC via Steam.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has been a boon for NetEase since being released in December 2024. It has pulled in tens of millions of players and has become one of the best hero shooters to emerge in recent years. It’s challenging Overwatch in the genre and will be a thorn in the side of Valve’s Deadlock.</p>



<p>In Marvel Rivals, Spider-Man is one of the most challenging Duelists. He has a five-star difficulty rating and relies on unparalleled acrobatic abilities to dominate the playing field.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of Spider-Man 2, you’ll want to snag the Advanced Suit 2.0 when it appears in Marvel Rivals on January 30.</p>

<p>In a recent update posted on Steam, it was revealed that Fortune’s Run, a retro sci-fi indie shooter, will have all development activity put on hold for three years. This is because the sole developer, ‘Dizzie’, will be serving a 36-month prison sentence, which was handed down as a result of the dev living ‘a very different life’ before they started working on Fortune’s Run.</p>



<p>As of today, Fortune’s Run boasts a ‘Very Positive’ rating on Steam, where it has existed since September 2023.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-unclear-what-will-happen">‘It’s Unclear What Will Happen’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on Valve’s PC platform, Steam, the sole developer of Fortune’s Run explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been sentenced to prison for the next 3 years. It’s a long story, but I’ve lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn’t living very well. My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I’ve been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I’m going away next month. </p>



<p>It’s a shame, but it’s the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn’t going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The post went on to explain that Fortune’s Run ‘sold okay’ and that once Dizzie is released from prison, they’ll hopefully be back on their feet and will return to the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I’m never going to stop making games. I’d like to finish this one, but I don’t know what will happen. I’m going to do my best, because I love this game and I want to finish it. Seriously, I just want to finish it. Finish it already, Dizzie!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This news was followed up by a couple more posts explaining some updates and tweaks being made to the game – which will likely be the final changes Fortune’s Run will see for quite some time.</p>

<p>Activision has revealed its new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies map that will launch at the start of Season 2. The new map is called The Tomb, and will release for all Zombies players on January 28.</p>



<p>“After surviving the horrific events at Citadelle des Morts, Weaver, Grey, Carver, and Maya follow Gabriel Krafft’s final words to a nearby excavation site to secure the Sentinel Artifact,” the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-115-day-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post reads</a>. “Built on the remains of ancient burial grounds with suspected origins dating back to 2500 B.C.E., these catacombs went undisturbed for centuries until the early 1900s… and what lies beneath may run deeper than anyone ever imagined.”</p>



<p>Developer Treyarch says that The Tomb was designed to give players an experience similar to that of Liberty Falls. The map has “tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability”. There will also be Easter Eggs scattered throughout the map along with a “reimagined Wonder Weapon” that is inspired by the past.</p>



<p>“As a reminder, every Zombies map in&nbsp;Black Ops 6&nbsp;is an original location built from the ground-up for the mode… but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy a wink and a nod here and there,” they said. “On that note, we’re going for something a little more evocative with our Pack-a-Punch camos this time around – and what if we told you one of the most iconic SMGs in Zombies history was coming along for the ride?”</p>



<p>In addition to the new map, Zombies will be getting a number of updates with the launch of Season 2. Those updates include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Challenge Tracking &amp; Near Completion</li>



<li>Co-op Pausing</li>



<li>AFK Kick Loadout Recovery</li>



<li>Separate HUD presets for Zombies and Multiplayer.</li>
</ul>



<p>More details on The Tomb and what else is coming to Zombies will be revealed in the upcoming Season 2 reveal blog.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard hasn’t helped it grow Xbox Game Pass or the gaming business in general. According to a new report from The Information, the growth from the acquisition has yet to hit what Microsoft was hoping for when it made the $69 billion purchase.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Information claims</a> that Microsoft was hoping that the purchase would help convince more players to sign up to the service as well as push more studios to releasing their games on the subscription-based platform. Instead, their sources say say that “several leading game studios have resisted Microsoft’s pitch that they should put their titles on Game Pass in exchange for fees that Microsoft offers to pay to the gaming studios.”</p>



<p>Denny Fish, a portfolio manager who oversees funds including a reported $800 million of Microsoft stock, told the outlet, “[Activision] has been disappointing.”</p>



<p>Microsoft had targeted reaching 100 million subscribers by 2030. As of February 2024, there were 34 million subscribers, including those who became subscribers after Microsoft converted Xbox Live to Xbox Game Pass Core. Microsoft has failed to hit Game Pass growth targets in each of the last two years. That led to Game Pass’s growth being dropped as a metric that determined CEO Satya Nadella’s pay at Microsoft.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised its prices</a> while introducing a new tier—Game Pass Standard—that took away Day One releases from console subscribers unless they upgrade to Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<p>In addition, Microsoft expected more studios and publishers to rent Azure cloud servers for their games. It’s said that Activision is still using Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for its server rentals along with “primarily relying on its own servers for development”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft regarding the report. Should a response of any kind be received, it will be added to this story. Microsoft is scheduled to announce its Q2 earnings for FY2025 on January 29.</p>

<p>The next game led by former Blizzard Chief Creative Officer (CCO) Rob Pardo has officially been revealed. Pardo’s Bonfire Studios has announced Arkheron, a team-based PvP game “set in a dark and foreboding world”.</p>



<p>According to the studio, Arkheron will feature familiar “ideas and concepts”, but the game is “about creating something entirely new”. That being a dynamic, fast-paced PvP gameplay experience.</p>



<p>“There’s a simple truth at the heart of our development philosophy,” Pardo said via release. “If we don’t love our game, our players won’t either. We believe the best games are born from a genuine love of playing them, which is why we’ve poured years of passion into developing&nbsp;Arkheron, constantly iterating and refining it to deliver something truly unique and exciting. </p>



<p>“We’ve played the game daily as a team for years, and while we haven’t figured out yet exactly how to describe it, we often say ‘you have to play it to get it’. We’re eager to start sharing the fun we’ve found in&nbsp;Arkheron&nbsp;with a wider community soon, and we hope players will love it as much as we do.”</p>



<p>The game has been holding private playtests and will be opening it up to more players in the coming months. Signups <a href="https://bonfirestudios.com/playtest/index.html?rafid=FYK-22192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">are currently open</a> for those in North America with more regions opening later this year.</p>



<p>What are you hoping Bonfire Studios’ Arkheron entails, and are you going to sign up for the playtest? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Nikola “NiKo” Kovač has finally played <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/falcons-sign-niko/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his first official match with Team Falcons</a>, and the organization has to be pleased with the first result of this new CS2 lineup. Despite substantial financial backing, Falcons has struggled to break into the top of the Counter-Strike hierarchy in recent years, but the result today is a step in the right direction.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-niko-and-former-heroic-trio-shine-against-ence-at-blast-bounty">NiKo and Former Heroic Trio Shine against ENCE at BLAST Bounty</h2>



<p>Utilizing the <a href="https://blast.tv/article/blast-premier-2025-bounty-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAST event’s bounty system</a>, the lower-seeded ENCE opted to challenge Falcons. The ENCE core, led by four-time Major winner Lukas “gla1ve” Rossander, sought to take advantage of Falcons’ short time spent practising together. ENCE gambled on a Train pick, hoping that Falcons would be even less prepared on the newest CS2 map.</p>



<p>Train was a highly entertaining affair, as the unfamiliar map produced a messy but fun match of Counter-Strike. But the big match experience of NiKo and the entirety of the Falcons roster prevailed over ENCE. ENCE came up short in several rounds where they had a man advantage and were unable to hold onto a late 12-9 lead. It wasn’t NiKo who led the way for Falcons, but former Heroic member René “TeSeS” Madsen, who produced four multi-kill rounds in the final six rounds of regulation and overtime. Falcons claimed four straight rounds in OT to steal away Train, 16-12.</p>







<p>The series turned to Dust2, a strong map historically for several of Falcons’ players. Falcons started strong with five straight T-side rounds, though ENCE managed to fight their way back. NiKo stepped up the most in Falcons’ second half CT-side, but the team couldn’t stop ENCE from sending the second map to OT as well. However, TeSeS delivered for Falcons in the clutch again in OT, closing out a close series win for Falcons.</p>
