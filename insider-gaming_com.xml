<p>Ubisoft Redlynx, the developers of the Trails franchise, is set to lose up to 60 employees in the latest round of layoffs by parent company Ubisoft. </p>



<p>A statement posted on <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the studio’s website</a> says that Ubisoft is moving forward with a <strong>“restructuring proposal for RedLynx as part of the company’s global efforts to simplify, reduce costs, and ensure a stronger prioritization and efficiency across the company’s worldwide studio network.”</strong></p>



<p>Redlynx says that it will negotiate with studio staff before making a decision on the proposal, which focuses “primarily” on the administration and production teams. These negotiations with the staff are scheduled to start on October 30 and will end by the end of November.</p>



<p><strong>“If materialized, this proposal would result in the reduction of maximum 60 positions,” </strong>they say.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-ubisoft-proposal-for-redlynx">What Is The Ubisoft Proposal For Redlynx?</h2>



<p>As far as what this proposal entails, it was said that Redlynx would “refocus” from being a multi-platform developer to one that’s “specialized in small screens”. </p>



<p>“This would enable it to position itself for sustainable success and optimize its resources to best leverage the studio’s unique expertise—starting with two unannounced mobile projects the studio is leading,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>Ubisoft RedLynx managing director Celine Pasula added that, “We are confident that, with the proposed changes, RedLynx would continue to play a meaningful role in Ubisoft’s future—driving technical excellence on mobile devices, and strengthening Ubisoft’s cross and multi-platform capabilities on small screens to expand our audience reach.”</p>



<p>The news of layoffs at Ubisoft RedLynx comes alongside the announcement that another Ubisoft studio, Massive Entertainment, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-is-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having its own wave</a> of job terminations.</p>
