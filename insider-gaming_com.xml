<p>The latest details about Ghost of Yotei’s file size come through an <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1963912998235349367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) from the reputed PlayStation Game Size account.

<p>Ahead of the launch, the developers have been showcasing the many types of weapons players will be able to use in the upcoming title.
