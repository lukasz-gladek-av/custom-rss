<p>STALKER 2’s massive 1.0.1 patch is here and it’s set to address 650 issues in the post-apocalyptic epic from GSC Game World. The update is live now on Xbox and PC and it effectively eradicates some of the biggest issues from the game, including controller dead zone problems, mutant difficulty, and weapon durability.</p>



<p>This is the second update of this size since STALKER 2 was released, and it stands as a testament to GSC’s desire to finesse the game as much as possible to appease the community.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-s-1-0-1-patch-is-insane">STALKER 2’s 1.0.1 Patch is Insane</h2>



<p>The full patch notes can be found on Steam, but I’ll sum up some of the most exciting changes coming with the STALKER 2 1.0.1 patch.</p>



<p>First, weapon and armour durability has been tweaked, which means that things won’t break as quickly and when they do, it won’t cost so much to fix things. That means you won’t be paying 20,000 Coupons to fix a single assault rifle anymore.</p>



<p>Also, GSC has addressed the monetary rewards you get from ‘most’ missions, giving you a few more Coupons in your pocket to play with.</p>



<p>Mutants have been tweaked – especially on lower difficulty levels – to make them much more bearable, including the Burer and Bloodsucker, which have been giving players headaches since day one.</p>



<p>This will please Xbox players: GSC has fixed the issue with gamepad dead zones. This has been a niggling problem since the game was released on November 20, and it can finally be put to bed.</p>



<p>Amongst the 650 bug fixes sits changes to almost every aspect of the game, from combat sequences to cutscenes, and from audio elements to quests. GSC has been hard at work to fix problems with AI interactions, UI problems, and blockers that prevent players from progressing through certain missions.</p>



<p>If you were concerned that STALKER 2 launched in a terrible condition, updates like the 1.0.1 patch should be starting to change your mind. </p>



<p>I still maintain this is my Game of the Year.</p>

<p>The new Fortnite Chapter 6 launch trailer has revealed that Godzilla and bosses will be making their way to the Battle Royale.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Fortnite has yet to officially upload the trailer; however, <a href="https://x.com/Guille_GAG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data miners</a> have been able to find it within the game files.</p>



<p>The new gameplay trailer for Chapter 6 reveals new skins, bosses, and Godzilla, who seemingly walks around the map. It’s currently unclear if Godzilla is a boss or not within Chapter 6.</p>
