<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was released today, March 20, and it’s already climbed Steam’s all-time player peak charts to become third in series history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/not-even-1-day-after-release-assassins-creed-shadows-player-count-on-steam-already-has-valhalla-beat-and-now-its-coming-for-odyssey-and-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), Assassin’s Creed Shadows is off to a great start on Steam, achieving an all-time player peak of 41,412 on the first day (at the time of writing). To compare, Shadows has more than doubled AC Valhalla’s numbers, which peaked at 15,679 2.3 years ago. It is less than 150 players away from beating AC Origins’ peak, 41,551, which arrived 7.4 years ago. AC Odyssey still stands strong at the moment, peaking at 62,069 6.4 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding AC Shadows reviews on Steam, things seem to be going well for Ubisoft, with the platform categorising it as “Very Positive”. If you are interested in an in-depth review of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you can check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s review</a> of the title, where we described the game as “Great, But The Blade Still Needs Sharpening”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest instalment of Ubisoft’s popular series. For those unaware of the game, the new setting takes players to Feudal Japan, where they explore a fresh narrative set in a vast open world through the eyes of dual protagonists.</p>



<p>The new protagonists are Yasuke and Naoe, both featuring distinct playstyles. One is a stealthy Assassin, and the other is a legendary Samurai; players must master both characters to take down enemies with precision and power. The game also introduces a fully customisable hideout where you train your crew, craft/upgrade weapons, and interact with characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly 11 years after its release, Hideo Kojima has taken to X to express his feelings over the negative feedback that Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes received when it was released.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-legacy-video-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> is one of the finest auteurs of his generation across all mediums. His calculated approach to cinematic presentation and innovation has accompanied the director across his multi-decade career. Metal Gear Solid is arguably his crowning achievement, and many of the entries are some of the most heralded releases in the annals of gaming history.</p>



<p>One entry has proved divisive. Although it’s looked upon more favorably in hindsight, Ground Zeroes was the subject of much criticism when it first launched.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It’s still an incredible game. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes was considered a “Prologue to the new gameplay” of Metal Gear Solid Phantom Pain, and it was originally supposed to be part of The Phantom Pain. However, as <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kojima</a> puts it in his statement on X: “The PS4 was released and there were only a few titles out, so just GZ was released ahead of the others.”</p>



<p>Kojima and Konami opted to release it as a standalone piece of bite-sized action, and Ground Zeroes looked and played incredibly—thanks to the new and improved Fox Engine. But its brief runtime was an inescapable negative at the time. </p>



<p>Reflecting, Kojima has said: “Although the episodes were short, we threw in as many gameplay elements as possible. Although it is recognized now, 11 years later, there was online negativity at the time saying, “Selling a demo version at a low price?” and it received the lowest rating in the MGS series.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>Already 11 years ago😅

This was originally planned to demonstrate the FOX engine and the gameplay of an open world infiltration game. I thought of it as an episode connecting PW and MGSV TPP, to be a bridge for both generations (console and handheld). We were considering </span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s clear that Hideo Kojima is proud of the work, and it’s fair because Ground Zeroes was a great—if not compact—MGS experience. The original plan would happen sometime later as Metal Gear Solid V: Definitive Experience was released. It bundles Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain into one complete MGS package.</p>



<p>Kojima has moved on from MGS with Death Stranding. A successor—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a>—is due to release in 2025. Whereas the MGS series moves on without Kojima in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater</a>.</p>
