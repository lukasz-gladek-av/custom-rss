<p>Super Meat Boy 3D is just as frustrating, just as hair-pulling and soul-destroying, and just as fun as the original—maybe more. Super Meat Boy Forever shifted the focus from freedom and autonomy to auto-running, a move that proved divisive. Super Meat Boy 3D gives you back control and adds more dynamic gameplay, and I had a blast playing it at Gamescom 2025 in an early Super Meat Boy 3D preview.</p>



<p>Everything you play Super Meat Boy for is here: Trap-filled levels, instant restarts, and an embarrassingly high death counter. The foundation of the game remains the same, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-meatboy-3d-revealed-at-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Meat Boy 3D</a>‘s new perspective is a total shift. The game maintains a constant 45-degree side angle, and Sluggerfly and Team Meat have devised a new way to create chaos, which ironically puts things into perspective.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-deadly-good-time">A Deadly Good Time</h2>

<p>My experience of the original <a href="https://sluggerfly.com/smb3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Super Meat Boy</a> and other difficult platformers lulled me into a false sense of security early on when I played the demo. I completed the first two or three stages without dying, but I was bracing myself for the inevitable, brutal storm—which arrived very quickly.</p>



<p>More mechanics were introduced, more dangers were thrown at me, and the death count shot up quicker than a person out of bed with a delivery driver at the door. Like I said, it’s still Super Meat Boy. But the 3D element is fascinating and genuinely creates a whole new way to play the game. You can run around obstacles, and you need to be more precise than ever.</p>



<p>There’s also more happening on screen. Where the original would generally throw individual dangers at you, SMB 3D requires you to survey the area, see which traps are hidden, and plan ahead—all at the same time. You can face several dangers in one passage of time. The platforming itself remains as tight and intricate as ever, and levels require multiple playthroughs to beat (let alone master).</p>



<p>I describe the Super Meat Boy games as a constant learning curve. The difficulty is always scaling. The first few levels were an obvious indicator of this, but whenever I died, I wanted to start over straight away. The controls and setup—from what I played—are the same, and it’s largely a one-button game. The same input allows SMB to jump, wall jump, etc, but the Dash from Super Meat Boy Forever returns!</p>



<p>This simple maneuver gives you a buffer to clear long spaces or help you if you mistime a jump, but it’s also a crucial move required to string together sequences of jumps, falls, dashes (and even more deaths).</p>



<p>3D also brings the world to life in new ways. Aside from the on-screen action, I had fun checking out the extended scenery. It adds more character, quality, and polish to an addictive gameplay loop. Super Meat Boy 3D’s original identity is back, but refreshed in a simple yet effective way. It’s going to be an instant buy from me when it comes out, and I can’t wait to see what other traps and terrors the development team adds to the game before launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has had one of the first chances to get hands-on with the second installment in the Hell Let Loose series, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose has always been one of my go-to World War 2 games since it released in early access in 2019 following its successful Kickstarter campaign (which I backed!). Its huge scale, impressive visuals, and its high-stakes one-shot kill gameplay have made the game one of the most immersive World War 2 multiplayer games that I don’t think anyone has been able to match.</p>



<p>So when the publisher behind Hell Let Loose, Team 17, announced that there was going to be a new installment in the series, but this time set in Vietnam, I had to jump on the chance to get some hands-on.</p>



<h2 id="h-familiar-but-entirely-different">Familiar, But Entirely Different</h2>



<p>To start the match, I made my way to the action as a gunner in a helicopter, ready to rain down bullets on any Vietnamese fighters we came across. After a short one-minute flight over the rivers and the jungle, we landed at our objective on a swampy riverbank.</p>



<p>Almost instantly, enemy mortar fire started to rain down on our location as we made our way to our objective, which was a Vietnamese village already crawling with enemy soldiers. Bamboo bridges provided fast but risky navigation from building to building, and we were under attack from green tracer rounds, suppressing our position from the jungle tree line.</p>



<p>After a couple of minutes of taking down a few enemies, we secured the objective and made our way to the next one, which meant crossing a large river. For those familiar with Hell Let Loose, you know that this would often provide a challenge of trying to find an uncontested bridge or a canal boat pile-up to get across, but in Hell Let Loose Vietnam, we were able to swim across. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, our squad’s time was short-lived as we were all killed, but the moment made for one of those classic Hell Let Loose cinematic moments that never get old, as the treeline facing us was suppressed by an artillery strike. Sadly, it didn’t hit the enemy that lit up our squad with an AK-47, but hey, what can you do?</p>

<h2 id="h-massive-improvements-across-the-board">Massive Improvements Across The Board</h2>



<p>For those who adore Hell Let Loose, this game feels really familiar, with plenty of improvements across the board that I hope will bleed over into the original game. But importantly, the game feels refreshing in the grand scheme of things. The developers have managed to maintain that immersive feeling that Hell Let Loose is known for, all while making sure the game feels different enough that it warrants an entirely new title.</p>



<p>One of the biggest concerns I had when I heard about the series heading into Vietnam was the lack of enemy visibility, which sometimes is a problem in the first game. However, the improved lighting overhaul, coupled with the game’s upgrade from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5, has seemingly made a massive difference to the game’s overall colour palette. While you’re certainly going to be shot from weird places from time to time, those concerns are now firmly squashed. The audio has also made a tremendous difference in the game, enabling players to rely on both their ears and eyes to pinpoint enemy locations.</p>



<p>Another concern was around the game’s performance, too. Hell Let Loose has been notorious for not having the best performance on some of its maps; however, on the map that we played, I’m pleased to say that I had zero performance issues. Granted, the PC that I was playing on probably had top-of-the-line specs, but I was also keeping an eye on a developer’s screen during the playtest, who was playing on a laptop, where the FPS counter didn’t drop below 100. So, at face value from the test, it appears a lot of effort has been put into making sure the game is as stable as possible.</p>



<p>Overall, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam currently has a vague release date of 2026 for the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
