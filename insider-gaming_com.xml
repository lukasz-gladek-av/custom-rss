<p>EA Sports has announced the first title update for Madden 26, bringing along with it a number of fixes and changes to various of the game.</p>



<p>The biggest updates come in the form of fixes to a zone defense, including Cover 2 and Cover 3 concerns where players were falling back too deep, leaving areas of the field open. Also added to the game are three new international stadiums in Germany, Spain, and Ireland. </p>



<p>You can check out the full list of changes coming in the August Madden 26 Title Update below courtesy of <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-august-28-2025?utm_campaign=mad26_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_m26-title-update-x&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=85681&amp;ts=1756310856340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA Sports</a>.

<h2 id="h-august-madden-26-title-update-details">August Madden 26 Title Update Details</h2>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Gameplay</h3>



<ul>
<li>Cover 2 Tampa – The middle defender now gets deeper, maintaining better leverage position against deep threats, especially vs. 3×1 formations.</li>



<li>Cover 2 Hard Flats – Addressed an issue with Hard Flats where defenders were dropping too deep and too far inside before reacting to flat routes. Defenders now drop more accurately with their zone responsibilities, improving coverage consistency in the shallow flats.</li>



<li>Cover 3 Match: Logic improvements for Defenders when reacting to Slot WRs attempting to outleverage the defense on deep routes. This includes Buzz Mable and Zone Blitz 3 playcalls</li>



<li>Cover 6 &amp; Cover 4 Palms – Fixed an issue where Outside Quarters CBs in Cover 6 and Cover 4 Palms were oftentimes losing the press giving up easy touchdowns. We adjusted the CBs alignment so they will no longer attempt to press the WR.</li>



<li>Zone coverage defenders now drop back quicker when shading coverage ‘overtop’.</li>



<li>Fixed a post play animation defect where a defender would do “read steps” when standing in place after the whistle.</li>



<li>Addressed a visual issue around the previous play graphic obscuring the offensive play call formation.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-playbook">Playbook</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added a completely customized playbook in partnership with&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/KurtBenkert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kurt Benkert</a>&nbsp;called <strong>“Benkert’s Dimes”</strong> – you can find it in Play Now when selecting your playbook. </li>
</ul>



<h3>Presentation</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added 3 international stadiums to Play Now, Franchise, and Superstar:
<ul>
<li>Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany</li>



<li>Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid, Spain</li>



<li>Dublin Stadium in Ireland</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed crash and stability issues.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Franchise</h3>



<ul>
<li>Addressed our UI Transitions surrounding the Player Card. Reducing the transition time it takes to go into the Player Card.
<ul>
<li>Dev Notes: This current fix only addresses going into the Player Card. Our resolution for exiting out of the player card back to the Franchise Main Menu will be in our next TU.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Resolved an issue allowing commissioners to send multiple league invites simultaneously.</li>



<li>Addressed an issue that prevented Edge Players from adding Pass Rushing Traits</li>



<li>Addressed an issue during the Draft where the Draft Board was improperly transparent, showing through to the background.</li>
</ul>



<p>DEV NOTE:&nbsp;<em>Here’s some of the issues we’re aware of and working on a fix in a future Title Update:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Class Import Process incorrectly modifying Player Body Types, specifically Offensive Linemen.</em></li>



<li><em>Players on IR unable to be peeled off the IR list.</em></li>



<li><em>Nose Tackle archetypes displaying a different OVR in the front end.</em></li>
</ul>



<h3>Superstar Mode</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fumble rate chance has been decreased in Snow Games.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players would play in the wrong position.</li>



<li>Fixed a rare issue where players’ knees would be invisible during the NFL Combine.</li>



<li>Several stability fixes.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Ultimate Team</h3>



<ul>
<li>Play A Friend will now respect each individual users passing settings</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where rewards images failed to appear on some screens</li>



<li>Fixed multiple occasions where players were navigated to the wrong menu</li>



<li>Fixed a text issue where “Rank Down” appeared instead of “Rank Up”</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where progress in Ranked was not visually displaying</li>



<li>Fixed multiple occasions of overlapping text</li>



<li>Fixed an occasional crash when returning to lobbies</li>



<li>Items displayed during presentation did not always match their actual rarity</li>
</ul>



<h3>Audio</h3>

<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is now available to Xbox Insiders with Xbox Game Pass Core and Standard. The mode, which lets players stream and play their Xbox Game Pass games anywhere, has opened its doors for all Xbox Insiders. In addition, select PC titles can now be played.</p>



<p>Previously, only those subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate could make use of Xbox Cloud Gaming. While the movement is only for Xbox Insiders, it does look promising that it may go into effect in the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-cloud-gaming-and-select-pc-games-now-available-for-xbox-insiders-with-game-pass">Xbox Cloud Gaming and Select PC Games Now Available for Xbox Insiders with Game Pass</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/27/xbox-insiders-can-stream-and-play-in-new-ways-with-xbox-game-pass-starting-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post on Xbox Wire</a>, the Xbox Insider Team posted about the new addition to Xbox Cloud Streaming. The service allows players to access Xbox Game Pass wherever they want, like from their PC, browser, or even TV. In addition, you can stream games, letting you not have to download the game and get right into playing. All you have to do is sign in to Xbox.com or to Xbox Cloud Gaming on whatever device you use and play away.</p>



<p>Alongside the Xbox Cloud Streaming, select PC titles will now be available for Xbox Insiders to play, regardless of their Xbox Game Pass tier. In order to make sure you can play, you’ll have to download the Xbox PC app and sign into Xbox. From there, you’ll have a few titles to choose from. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that this is only for Xbox Insiders and has not been released to the public yet. To become an Xbox Insider, you’ll need to download the app on Xbox and/or PC and sign up. You’ll then get access to surveys, previews, and such and help test out new features and updates, like Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Xbox Cloud Gaming come to all of Xbox Game Pass? Have you tried it before? How do you like it? Let us know in the comments below and on the forums!</p>

<p>The PlayStation Plus free games for September 2025 have been announced, with the list including Stardew Valley and Psychonauts 2.</p>



<p>A trio of titles are included in the September offerings, all of which are playable from September 2, which also means there’s limited time remaining to add August’s titles to your library.</p>



<h2 id="h-free-playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-revealed">Free PlayStation Plus Monthly Games For September Revealed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Jump in. Image via ConcernedApe</figcaption></figure>



<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, three titles are available to download for free throughout September, which we’ve detailed here.</p>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<p>The beloved indie title lands on PlayStation Plus for September, with an adventure full of farming, mining, fishing, and even romance in the offing.</p>



<p>Still one of the most popular games on platforms like Steam, Stardew Valley continues to go from strength to strength, while developers are working hard on the next title, The Haunted Chocolatier. </p>



<p>Plucked straight into work after inheriting your grandfather’s farm, you start with basic tools and a few coins. From there, the world is truly your oyster.</p>



<h3 id="h-psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</h3>



<p>For those looking for a new platform-adventure game to keep you occupied in the wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong, look no further than Psychonauts 2.</p>



<p>With a variety of missions, a cinematic style, and customizable psychic powers, Psychonauts 2 puts players in control of Raz “on a journey through the minds of friends and foes on a quest to defeat a murderous psychic villain.”</p>



<h3 id="h-viewfinder">Viewfinder</h3>



<p>Any player wanting to test themselves with challenging puzzles can do exactly that with Viewfinder, where you use an instant camera’s viewfinder to bring photos, paintings, and sketches to life.</p>



<p>All three titles will be available from September 2, meaning there’s just a few days left to download August’s titles; Lies of P, Day Z, and My Hero One’s Justice 2.</p>



<p>Which of these titles are you planning to pick up and play next month? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/do-we-know-much-hollow-knight-silksong-will-cost-price-tracker.1282005/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s hype and status are bringing the game perilously close to that limbo state of an indie game and a AAA title. However, I think it’s still in the indie bracket, but Silksong’s price could reflect its years of development and content. Here’s the latest on its potential cost.</p>



<p>2025 has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong</a> go from the game on everyone’s wishlist for Nintendo Direct and State of Play showcases to being a literal wishlist item in preparation for its release. Team Cherry has worked diligently on one of the most anticipated indie sequels in history. It’s remained Steam’s most-wishlisted game for an eternity after all!</p>



<p>A bigger game and more content mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> probably won’t cost the same as its predecessor, though, so let’s see how much difference there might be.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-hollow-knight-silksong-s-price">Do we Know Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Price?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’ll be worth it, whatever it costs. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of August 27, Hollow Knight: Silksong does not have an official price tag on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, or PC storefronts.</strong></p>



<p>We’re so close to launch, but Silksong’s price tag is mysteriously absent. <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10005908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation</a>, for example, simply says “Announced” and “Add to Wishlist.” Unless something changes, there’s every chance we won’t find out the full price until the game’s long-awaited September 4 release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-hollow-knight-silksong-going-to-cost">How Much is Hollow Knight: Silksong Going to Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Based on estimates, predictions, and the size of the game and overall project compared to the original Hollow Knight, we think Silksong is going to cost in the region of $24.99 to $29.99.</strong></p>



<p>Let me be clear, there is nothing definitive to suggest this. But 2017’s Hollow Knight was $14.99 at launch. Silksong is expected to be much bigger than the original—hence <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why it took so long to release</a>. </p>



<p>More bosses, more enemies, and more content usually mean more money to pay. If Silksong is anywhere near the level of Hollow Knight, it’s going to be worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-price-tracker">Hollow Knight: Silksong Price Tracker</h2>



<p>We are monitoring Silksong’s socials, Discord, and other sources to try and find out Hollow Knight: Silksong’s final price tag. We encourage you to keep checking back with this article as we will eventually have the answer you (and us!) are seeking.</p>

<p>Square Enix is bringing the first part of the epic Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy to the Nintendo Switch 2. FF7 Intergrade arrives in 2025, and this is likely the first of two ports that make their way on Chocobo back to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>If you’ve been keeping up with the news, this announcement might not be that shocking. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-coming-to-switch-2-square-enix-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy Remake director Naoki Hamaguchi said the Nintendo Switch 2</a> “would have enough power to run the FINAL FANTASY VII remake series” back in May 2025. </p>



<p>It seems the Switch 2 can handle the JRPG after all.</p>

<p>The official Final Fantasy 7 <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account proudly announced Intergrade’s Switch 2 debut to the world on August 27.</p>



<p>“Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches this winter on Nintendo Switch 2, running at a stable 30 frames per second, offering smooth performance and crisp visuals,” a message said.</p>



<p>It didn’t specify <em>when </em>in Winter 2025 we could expect it. But it should mean many Christmas trees have a nice Final Fantasy 7 aura flowing off of them, like the Lifestream.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely the Switch 2 receives Final Fantasy 7 Intergrade and that’s it. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was a big hit, so I’d expect to see a port in the future. The third and final part should inevitably make its way over, too. </p>
