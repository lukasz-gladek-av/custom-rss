<p>Path of Exile 2 has six classes available, with another six coming as the game progresses. There will be 12 classes and 36 ascendancies in due time, making it a genuinely expansive game with countless hours of playtime available. But for now, you’re limited to a few starting classes. Here’s the thing, though. They rock! At least in our opinion. </p>



<p>So we decided to rank them all with a Path of Exile 2 class tier list for Early Access!</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-s-best-classes-ranked-this-is-totally-our-opinion">Path of Exile 2’s Best Classes Ranked (This is Totally Our Opinion!)</h2>



<p>First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way. Yes, you will have your own tier list, and we’d love to hear which classes you place in S-Tier in the comments below. Do you disagree with us? Let us know! We love discussing our favorite games, especially when you bring them to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>



<h3 id="h-s-tier-classes">S-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>The <strong>Mercenary </strong>is the big new class available in Path of Exile 2, and after playing through the entire campaign with one, I can attest to its strength. You can turn the crossbow into a close-quarters shotgun and lob grenades with reckless abandon. It’s a fun, powerful class capable of downing most bosses in the game.</p>



<p>Following that, we have the <strong>Witch </strong>with its powerful summons and the <strong>Monk </strong>with its creative abilities and fast, hard-hitting martial arts capable of making quick work of most enemies.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mercenary</strong></li>



<li><strong>Witch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Monk</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier-classes">A-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>You can solo the entirety of Path of Exile 2 with the <strong>Ranger</strong>, so long as you have the proper equipment. A powerful bow will take you far. As for the <strong>Sorceress</strong>, the right build and an occasional helping hand in defeating some of the more challenging bosses in the game, which you can ask for in the global chat, push both classes into A-Tier.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ranger</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sorceress</strong></li>
</ul>







<h3 id="h-b-tier-classes">B-Tier Classes</h3>



<p>From firsthand experience, the <strong>Warrior</strong> has the potential to be potent against mobs and ranged bosses, but it’s a slow class to start with. If you have the patience to stick with the brute force of a club-wielding monster, you’ll find a powerful class capable of tanking enemies, but one that excels with a group, like a Sorceress or Ranger.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>No matter when you dive into Path of Exile 2, chances are you want to know about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-become-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game going free-to-play</a>, right? Then, you can finally convince your friends to play!</p>

<p>The biggest Nintendo Switch games arriving in 2025 are sure to occupy your free time, and we’ve handpicked the best exclusives and some interesting third-party titles to look out for.</p>



<p>My Nintendo Switch hasn’t seen as much action in 2024—dare I say, it’s gathered a bit of dust. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-princess-peach-showtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Peach Showtime</a>, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-vs-donkey-kong-princess-peach-showtime-sold-over-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a> haven’t scratched the itch, and there seems to be a bigger emphasis on remakes and remasters. Talk of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> continues to intensify, and it feels like a necessary step to bring more impressive exclusives and power-sapping third-party games.</p>



<p>2025 is ignoring this notion for now though, because it has some juicy Nintendo Switch games lined up. Forgotten sequels and big franchise sequels are also lined up, so let’s take a look.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-games-coming-in-2025">Nintendo Switch Games Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>Nintendo Directs and other presentations are almost certain to deliver shock announcements. Expect surprises and shadow drops throughout 2025, but for now, these games we know are pretty much locked in for 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Darn those Space Pirates. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>A torrid development period stunted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4</a>‘s progress. With the success of Metroid Prime Remastered in the distance now, the Nintendo community is clamoring for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Its reintroduction and long-awaited gameplay debut in 2024 reminded everyone why it’s so hyped. Samus is back with her trusty weapons, battling more Metroids and Space Pirates, all to another funky soundtrack. This could be Nintendo’s biggest ace up its sleeve, so here’s hoping it meets its announced 2025 release window.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Pokémon is the gift that keeps giving. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is the follow-up to 2022’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and it seems to be an entirely new story. The island of Hokkaido is replaced by a more populated and livelier Lumiose City. A single trailer is all we have, and even though it’s quite vague—we’re interested. I love Arceus, and it’s mostly what I’m looking for in a modern Pokémon game. But its sometimes empty and barren world—and lack of Trainer battles—left a gaping hole. Here’s hoping Pokemon Legends: Z-A can deliver, and bring an improved performance compared to the technical mishaps of Scarlet and Violet.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Puzzle galore. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> makes many of our fun 2025 lists—because Donkey Kong is fun. So much so, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a simple remaster, adding new content, but keeping the authentic feel of the Wii original. You’re assured of platforming paradise with more than a hint of a challenge. We’re ready for its bongo beats and banana stylings and it’s one of the first major games to hit the Switch in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A whole world to see. Credit to Monolith Soft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Xenoblade Chronicles has been a tremendously successful franchise for Nintendo. So much so spin-offs have sprouted from the main franchise, and the Wiiu was treated to Xenoblade Chronicles X in 2015. Like Donkey Kong: Country Returns—and countless other Wii and WiiU games, Nintendo has wanted to bring X to the Switch and is finally doing so with Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. It’s an intense, JRPG encouraging you to explore its vast world, do important work for the BLADE organization, and fight waves of human enemies and titanic wild foes.</p>



<h3 id="h-civilization-7">Civilization 7</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What are you looking at? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not partial to Civ games—or strategy titles in general—but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7</a> is a massive third-party entry on this list, with the series <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-civilization-series-has-sold-33-million-copies-since-it-debuted-in-1991#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20there%20have%20been%2066%20versions%20of,were%20copies%20of%20Civilization%205%20plus%20the%20expansions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">estimated to have sold well over 30 million copies</a>. The traditional fare of world-building through different periods of human history is all here. You’re posed with events and decisions guaranteed to affect your world’s version of reality and history, and it’s important your thinking cap is on when deciding the fate of the human race!</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Another round of horror awaits. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Little Nightmares saga is not for the faint-hearted. It inspires a new type of unsettling horror that low-budget jumpscare titles can only dream of. Little Nightmares features a new story, fresh, poor unwitting children, and the acclaimed addition of co-op. The second character can be computer-controlled, or you can invite a friend along to lap up the terror with you. It’s an IP going from strength to strength, and I’m expecting bad dreams to abound as a direct result of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>

<p>I’m hopeful of a Nintendo Switch 2 announcement in 2025, and if it happens, what games do you want to see? A new 3D Mario game? The next Zelda? Let us know your gaming desires.</p>

<p>The Witch was always a fan-favorite in the first Path of Exile, and that didn’t change with the launch of its sequel. People still gravitate toward the Witch for several reasons, primarily because she has powerful summons. With the right combination of skills and abilities, you can roam a map as the powerful Witch, clearing mobs of enemies without lifting a finger. But first, it’s best to learn the best summons in Path of Exile 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-choose-these-top-summons-for-witch-in-path-of-exile-2">Choose These Top Summons for Witch in Path of Exile 2</h2>



<p>Playing as a Witch proves more entertaining than you’d initially imagine. I mean, Chaos magic is downright fun to use and often quite powerful, but you’ll spend more time playing catch-up after your minions slay the entire zone ahead of you instead of casting a powerful bolt of magic.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>You have a handful of choices while playing as Witch, namely:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Skeletal Sniper</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Arsonist</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Frost Mage</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zombies</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Warrior</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>These are in order from “best” to “worst” of the ones we recommend you use. Some may favor Skeletal Warriors above Zombies. The latter is a weak, time-limited unit that decays quickly, but you can spawn more quickly, nearly endlessly, to have a constant flow of minions dominating the battlefield. They’re an excellent tool that works similarly to a meat shield between your squishy Witch and the countless hard-hitting enemies across Wraeclast.</p>



<p>Skeletal Sniper is perhaps one of the most effective and useful summons available, as they deal ranged poison damage that bursts into a cloud of noxious fumes designed to deal area-of-effect damage and lock down mobs. For a similar effect, albeit less effective and with fire, Skeletal Arsonists come in second place.</p>



<p>However, keep in mind that Path of Exile 2 is currently in Early Access. Grinding Gear Games is still working on balancing and will likely change the effectiveness of many abilities before and after launch.</p>
