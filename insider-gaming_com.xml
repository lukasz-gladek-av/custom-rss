<p>Life continues to find a way with a new entry in the fan-favorite saga with Jurassic World Evolution 3, and we’ve got all the platform details for the title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Releasing October 21</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 makes big additions to the franchise in the form of baby dinosaurs and piece-by-piece construction, with mechanics that were initially seen in the Planet Coaster series and Planet Zoo.</p>



<p>With Jurassic World Evolution 3 roaring onto the scene, we’ve got everything you need to know about the title, including it’s availability on various platforms. </p>

<p><strong>No, Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not available on Xbox One or PlayStation 4, and is solely a current-gen exclusive title.</strong></p>



<p>This marks the first time in the franchise that the title has not been available on PS4 or Xbox One, though it is in line with other <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontier Developments</a> releases. Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster 2, for example, were not released on either platform.</p>



<p>Significant enhancements have been made since Jurassic World Evolution 2, with Planet Zoo’s console version and Planet Coaster 2 both releasing after the previous entry in the series.</p>



<p>Moving forward, it’s further evidence that Frontier Development games are unlikely to be available on last-gen consoles, with any new releases likely to be only PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S moving forward.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-jurassic-world-evolution-3-platforms-explained">All Jurassic World Evolution 3 Platforms, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is only available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, there are no last-gen releases for Jurassic World Evolution 3, nor is there any news on a launch on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. While the Switch 2 may have the capacity for the title on the console, there’s no indication that Evolution 3 will make the jump to Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p>There could be future platform releases later on, however. Planet Zoo was initially released as a PC exclusive in 2019, before being ported to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later. However, this seems unlikely this time around, unless a Switch 2 launch is on the cards.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6’s Campaign offers players an ‘Uninstall’ button once they have finished it. </p>



<p>EA’s highly sought-after FPS title, Battlefield 6, has finally been released, and it is already dominating the Steam charts, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing</a> Call of Duty’s all-time concurrent player count within a day of launch. Now, new details about the BF6’s campaign have been revealed, and it seems that this game mode provides players with an option to ‘uninstall’. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-campaign-can-be-easily-uninstalled-once-completed">Battlefield 6 Campaign Can be Easily Uninstalled Once Completed</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/battlefield-bf-battlefield-6-bf6-ea-electronic-arts-campaign-hdd-space-uninstall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer</a>, a post by BobNetworkUK on <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1977095756193710437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) reveals that the Battlefield 6 Campaign screen will replace the usual button with an uninstall button once the player has completed the game mode. The original poster stated that players can continue playing and completing challenges if they don’t want to uninstall the mode, as it still features mission select. Still, many players might be happy to be offered that option once this game mode has been completed. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regarding Battlefield 6’s campaign, we know it features nine missions spanning three continents: Africa, North America, and Europe. The game mode also lets players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-campaign-lets-players-command-a-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">command a full squad</a> at almost all times, with each member belonging to a different class. Moreover, the revive system works similarly to multiplayer: if a player has been downed, a squad member can revive them, and vice versa.</p>



<p>In other news, the developers have confirmed that Battlefield 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not feature generative AI</a>. Additionally, the open beta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-betas-smaller-maps-were-intentional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intentionally had smaller maps</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 ‘Global Game Quota Exceeded’ Error, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-global-game-quota-exceeded/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-%E2%80%98global-game-quota-exceeded%E2%80%99-error-explained.1323343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has roared onto the scene with an extremely successful launch, but plenty of players around the world are experiencing the ‘Global Game Quota Exceeded’ error.</p>



<p>Immediately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smashing past Call of Duty’s all-time concurrent player count on Steam</a>, Battlefield 6 is one of the most successful titles to have launched in 2025, and, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty of content planned</a> in future updates, there’s plenty of excitement for what is to come.</p>



<p>Errors and bugs can halt your progress, however, and we’ve got all the details on the ‘Global Game Quota Exceeded’ error if it is thwarting your play sessions.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-battlefield-6-global-game-quota-exceeded-error">What is The Battlefield 6 Global Game Quota Exceeded Error?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boots on the ground. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 ‘Global Game Quota Exceeded’</strong> <strong>error indicates that the servers on the Portal feature are currently full.</strong></p>



<p>EA’s Portal feature, first introduced in Battlefield 2042, hosts community-created experiences, but it appears the servers are significantly more limited than they are for EA’s own game modes like Conquest and Escalation.</p>



<p>This will be due to a smaller capacity, likely because EA anticipates there are fewer players wanting to play these modes. However, the Global Game Quota Exceeded error is a clear indication that there is a larger demand than the servers can account for.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-fix-for-the-battlefield-6-global-game-quota-exceeded-error">Is There a Fix For The Battlefield 6 Global Game Quota Exceeded Error?</h2>



<p><strong>No, there is currently no known fix to the Global Game Quota Exceeded error, and it’s unlikely to be anything that you can do on your end.</strong></p>



<p>This is because it is a server-side issue based on the fact that more players are trying to play modes through Battlefield Portal than the system can account for. As such, any solution will have to come directly from EA to increase the server capacity for Portal.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, EA has yet to comment on the issue, but it’s still very early days in Battlefield’s lifespan, so there’s plenty of time for server changes to be made.</p>



<p>It’s likely the server capacity will be increased at some point, however, considering more people are likely to explore Portal game modes the longer time progresses since release, with a desire to experience more varied content.</p>



<p>What is the best mode you have uncovered so far on Battlefield Portal? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
