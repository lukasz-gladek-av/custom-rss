<p>Avowed’s Game Director, Carrie Patel, has disclosed details on how companions interact with the player in the upcoming game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-more-interactivity-and-reactivity">“More Interactivity and Reactivity”</h2>



<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/after-starfields-strict-companions-im-glad-avoweds-crew-wont-be-backseat-driving-and-second-guessing-all-your-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Carrie Patel discussed how they wanted to provide “a little more interactivity and reactivity” to companions “based on the events and conversations and quests that you’re encountering in the game.” Patel added that they wanted companions “to have a little bit more to say” about their journey together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patel then goes on to talk about how engaging with companions is a significant part of RPGs, but finding the ‘balance’ is also crucial. They didn’t want Avowed’s companions to “feel like someone is backseat driving and second-guessing all your choices.” Patel also compared Avowed’s companions to Starfield’s, stating that they won’t have as extreme reactions when you do something ‘evil’ but will provide some form of pushback.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-s-companions-will-have-opt-in-engagement">Avowed’s Companions Will Have Opt-In Engagement</h2>



<p>Patel then talks about the opt-in engagement players can experience with companions in Avowed. The developers have “written a lot of content for these characters for their engagement in the story with one another, with the player.” However, it’s up to the players whether they want to explore this content. For example, when they return to the party camp, players “might hear their companion say a thing or two”, but they decide whether to have the conversation and “get to know their companion a bit better.”</p>
