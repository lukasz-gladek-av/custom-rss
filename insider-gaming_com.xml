<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally has an official release date. </p>



<p>After weeks and months of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-ally-x-release-date-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors and leaks</a>, it was officially confirmed on Wednesday that the Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally will launch on October 16. The announcement came during the official Xbox Gamescom stream.</p>



<p>What fans might be surprised to find out, however, was that only a release date was announced. What wasn’t confirmed was the price of the devices, at least at the time of publishing. Even in the <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1958159636370174153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official post on social media</a>, pricing wasn’t mentioned. </p>



<p>There are rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-and-asus-delay-xbox-ally-price-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">circulating on the floor in Cologne</a> regarding the price after it was leaked yet again that it will cost $549.99 for the Xbox Ally and $899.99 for the Xbox Ally X. However, it’s pure speculation at this time.</p>



<p>When official pricing information is announced, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft announcing the release date of the Xbox Ally but not the pricing? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>A new video showcasing the Resident Evil Requiem gameplay has surfaced online, featuring Grace Ashcroft. </p>



<p>Yesterday, players finally got a new look at Resident Evil Requiem’s gameplay at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gets-gameplay-trailer-at-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>; however, there was barely any action to be seen. Players have been waiting for some proper gameplay action since the first preview, and it has finally arrived online. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-showcases-grace-being-chased-by-a-monster">Resident Evil Requiem Gameplay Showcases Grace Being Chased by a Monster</h2>



<p>The new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay comes from a new X post (formerly Twitter) from <a href="https://x.com/famitsu/status/1958122126684434578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1958132494718669014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki_JPN</a>). The video starts with Grace being confronted and chased by a massive female monster. Grace is shown running and stumbling through different rooms and hallways as she searches for a way to hide from the frightening creature. Interestingly, the creature has the ability to suddenly appear in front of the player or even break through doors, keeping them on their toes at all times. Check out the full video below. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the latest Resident Evil Requiem gameplay, Grace seems to be in a panic mode, holding only a lighter to find her way through the dark and eerie hallways. The monster can also bite her if she gets too close to it. Later on, she is seen entering a well-lit room; however, the monster can’t follow her inside as the light seems to be reacting with its skin. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveals-details-about-the-stalker-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a> from earlier today informed us that the stalker monster is not well-suited to bright light, and it appears that entering well-lit areas is the only way to escape it. </p>



<p>Towards the end of the Resident Evil Requiem gameplay video, we see Grace enter a completely different room, where she climbs a table to get her hands on a toolbox. The toolbox includes a screwdriver, which is something the character was seemingly looking for. Moreover, the room is in complete disarray, with blood splattered all across the floor and walls, and some lockers turned upside down. </p>



<p>An earlier <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a> had stated that this woman monster is none other than Alyssa Ashcroft, Grace’s mother. Additionally, the next Resident Evil Remakes are reportedly going to be Code Veronica and Zero, and they are expected to arrive in&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2027/2028</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ww1-gallipoli-hands-on-preview-a-fantastic-next-installment-in-the-world-war-1-game-series.1275495/</guid>

<p>Insider Gaming has had one of the first hands-on opportunities to play BlackMill Games’ next World War 1 multiplayer shooter, WW1 Gallipoli.</p>



<p>I’ll be the first to admit that I was thrilled when I first heard that BlackMill Games was releasing a new WW1 game in its series, which already includes Verdun, Tannenberg, and Isonzo. At the time of writing, I have a good few hundred hours of playtime across all of those titles, and with WW1 Gallipoli set to release sometime in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, those hours of playtime will undoubtedly grow next year. Even more so now that I’ve had the chance to play the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-middle-eastern-combat">Middle Eastern Combat</h2>



<p>As the game’s name suggests, WW1 Gallipoli will focus on the Gallipoli campaign that was fought in Ottoman Turkey between April 1915 and January 1916. It marks the first time in the series that desert combat is featured in a fully-fledged fashion, with BlackMill Games once again continuing to maintain the accuracy it’s known for in its WW1 Game Series with authentic maps, weapons, uniforms, music, and more.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>During my limited time with the game, which, for full disclosure, was a pre-alpha build that the developers described as “very early in development”. However, apart from the usual bugs and glitches that you’d come to expect from a game in pre-alpha, I’m pleased to say that if you’re a fan of the series, you won’t be disappointed.</p>



<h2 id="h-squad-based-combat">Squad-Based Combat</h2>



<p>WW1 Gallipoli continues to build on the foundations laid by the series’ predecessors, all while maintaining accessibility for new players. Some of the bigger changes to the game are its class and squad system, which now sees additional roles added, including ‘Stretcher Bearer’, essentially a medic class, and an ammo class, the name of which I’ve forgotten. The developers tell me that this is to ensure more variety and give classes one specific weapon type. For example, in Isonzo, the Assault class had access to bolt-action rifles and submachine guns, whereas this time they don’t.</p>



<p>Another interesting change is a complete overhaul to the squad system, which now sees five squads of five players battle it out. Each Squad has a different assigned name and restrictions; for example, one squad might not have access to a sniper role, but have two stretcher-bearer roles, and another squad may focus on passive-combat. Another addition was a new downing system, which, if a non-lethal shot hits a player, will see them go ‘down’ rather than instant death. But whether or not players will actually revive others remains to be seen (I had a terrible experience in the recent Battlefield 6, please revive team mates!) </p>



<p>Overall, I think the changes to the squad and class system felt like a logical improvement – and while again, it was a pre-alpha build against bots, I can see the changes working out well. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-initial-thoughts">Final Initial Thoughts</h2>



<p>Although my time was limited and didn’t allow for the whole multiplayer experience the game offers (playing against bots can be fairly dull at times), BlackMill Games is clearly cooking up another classic with WW1 Gallipoli.</p>



<p>I’ll have more in-depth thoughts when I return from Gamescom with further details, but yeah, perhaps writing my initial thoughts surrounded by sweaty gamers isn’t ideal… But I needed to get <em><strong>SOMETHING</strong></em> up.</p>



<p>WW1 Gallipoli launches on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC in 2026.</p>
