<p>If you‚Äôre looking for your next fix of horror and hilarity, REPO might be what you need. The valuable-extraction title blends comedy and claustrophobic scares, and tackling it with more players is necessary if you want to sleep better.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lethal-company-coming-fortnite-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lethal Company</a> came along in late 2023 to stun the indie gaming community. It racked up a peak of nearly 250,000 players on Steam, and it still attracts thousands of players each month. Imitators have come and gone, trying to replicate its meteoric success, but REPO might be the one to crack the case.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs also an online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op game</a> where you need to ‚ÄúLocate valuable, fully physics-based objects and handle them with care,‚Äù according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and if you have a lot of friends, you might be pleased at how many people can join up and play REPO at any one time.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-repo-in-online-co-op">How Many People Can Play REPO in Online Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My face when the McDonald‚Äôs milkshake machine works. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Up to 6 players can team up and play REPO together in a party.</strong></p>



<p>This gives REPO a slight edge over Lethal Company‚Äôs four-player squads. It also means even more chaos and calamity can ensue. </p>



<p>One of the biggest differences about REPO is keeping the cargo safe. Dropping the valuables or bringing any harm to them will decrease their value. This reduces your earnings, and disappoints your creator greatly.</p>



<p>Given that you need to use voice chat to communicate with your allies and negotiate obstacles, enemies, and other ungodly hazards, having more teammates could go either way for your survival chances!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-repo-solo">Can You Play REPO Solo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play REPO solo, but if you‚Äôre not privy to the game‚Äôs contents, you‚Äôll understand why that‚Äôs a bad idea.</strong></p>



<p>Teamwork is <em>key </em>in REPO. Again, the more players with you, the faster you‚Äôll find loot, and the more decoys and human shields you have to take the brunt of enemy attacks‚Äîgrim, but true. Solo survival in REPO is extremely difficult, and even the game‚Äôs official description suggests you should: ‚Äú<strong>Use teamwork to make sure that the precious cargo will safely reach its destination</strong>.‚Äù</p>



<p>REPO may get tweaked to be more accommodating to solo players as time goes on. Conversely, REPO may get options to broaden the player pool for each lobby. We‚Äôll update this guide if developer semiwork makes such changes.</p>



<hr>



<p>Indie horror games are a popular genre on Steam. REPO is a breakout hit already in 2025, so let us know if you get the chance to play it and what you think.</p>

<p>We never thought it would return. But get ready, because Verdansk is coming to Warzone 2. Long-time fans are worried it won‚Äôt feature Superstore or other famous POIs, so we‚Äôre here today to answer any questions regarding its hotspots.</p>



<p>Call of Duty Warzone 2 is the successor to Warzone Caldera. It‚Äôs kept the CoD battle royale boat afloat for a couple of years now, but it‚Äôs taken some damage in recent times. Some have even labeled it as a sinking ship. Warzone‚Äôs lessening impact is getting so concerning that a potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone 3 is in danger</a>, as is the potential future of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-warzone-being-shut-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone shutting down</a> altogether.</p>



<p>Warzone was once arguably the battle royale powerhouse of the world. It needs a serious injection of players to kickstart the excitement again, and a fully-loaded Verdansk armed with classic POIs could be what it needs.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-confirmed-verdansk-poi-in-warzone-2">Every Confirmed Verdansk POI in Warzone 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It stores goods and campers. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warzone 2‚Äôs Verdansk map will feature most POIs from the original including Atlas Superstore, Storage Town, Prison, and many more.</strong></p>



<p>We learned a little while back we‚Äôre getting ‚Äú<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pretty Much the OG March 2020 Version</a>‚Äù of Verdansk. I couldn‚Äôt imagine Activision dropping a version of Verdansk no one wants, or even Verdansk ‚Äô84. So, get ready for what appears to be the complete, classic Verdansk experience.</p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/WZStatsGG/status/1895902878293692854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone Meta</a>, here‚Äôs every POI leaked so far, with more presumably to come:</p>



<ul>
<li>Atlas Superstore</li>



<li>Block 17</li>



<li>Block 23</li>



<li>Boneyard</li>



<li>Coast</li>



<li>Gora Bridge</li>



<li>Gora Tunnel</li>



<li>Gora Village</li>



<li>Grazna Bridge</li>



<li>Great Bridge</li>



<li>Jarvdinsk Spomenik</li>



<li>Karst Bridge</li>



<li>Krovnik Farmland</li>



<li>Lozoff Pass</li>



<li>Novi Grazna Hills</li>



<li>Prison</li>



<li>Storage Town</li>



<li>Styor Memorial</li>



<li>Zhokov Boneyard</li>
</ul>



<p>Some notable favorites are missing for the time being. Dam is absent, as is Airport and many others, but Verdansk is gigantic, so this is likely an incomplete inventory. We expect more details to leak ahead of its much-hyped return to Call of Duty and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-verdansk-returning-to-warzone">When is Verdansk Returning to Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Verdansk returns to Call of Duty courtesy of Warzone 2 Season 3 on April 3.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-officially-returning-to-call-of-duty-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk is returning to Call of Duty Warzone next month</a>. The official Call of Duty X account had a message for everyone on March 10: ‚ÄúAs we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone‚Äôs 5 Year Anniversary, it‚Äôs time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories. Verdansk returns to Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3.‚Äù</p>

<p>Whatever your thoughts on Verdansk or how it will be received, this is no doubt a special time for CoD Warzone users. Expect a huge influx of players looking to lap up the initial nostalgia.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-are-playing-warzone-right-now-player-count-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Warzone player count</a> drops off as the days and weeks pass.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege X‚Äôs changes to UI, map reworks, and new skins have appeared online due to a new leak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-leak-first-look-seasons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, new details about Rainbow Six Seige X have leaked ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase planned for March 13</a>. The leaks arrived from the Rainbow Six Leaks Discord server, giving players an idea of how the upcoming game could look. Moreover, these leaked images appear to be from an early game build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding UI, Siege X has added a new label for ‚ÄòOperation Prep Phase‚Äô at the right-hand corner of the screen. Players will also find additions of a ‚Äòbattle pass progression tracker‚Äô and a ‚Äòchallenge system‚Äô. Players should know that all these elements are subject to change with the game‚Äôs final build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following leaked image for Siege X provides players with a look at the type of skins we might see. The skin showcased is Valkyrie‚Äôs Paragon Elite skin, which also has a matching Black Eye camera skin. Lastly, Chalet and Border Maps appear revamped, and the leaked images show enhancements towards the lighting in these environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that none of the information revealed through the leaks has been confirmed officially by Ubisoft and is subject to change with the final game build. Players will receive more concrete information during the dedicated Siege X showcase on March 13.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Siege X might feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-will-feature-a-6v6-mode-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 6v6 mode</a>. Also, Rainbow Six Siege remains <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-rainbow-six-siege-top-esports-game-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a top esports title</a> after being in the market for a decade.
