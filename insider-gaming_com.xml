<p>Pre-orders for the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 are set to go live soon, but when can I pre-order?</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order date is a little complicated as we currently only have leaked information to relay on. It’s expected that Nintendo will officially announce their pre-order information during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-leaks-say-about-the-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">What The Leaks Say About The Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Order Date</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Best Buy Canada accidently leaked that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 are set to go live on April 2, 2025</a>, after the Direct. However, shortly after the information went live on their website and the news started to circulate online, Best Buy Canada promptly removed the information.</p>



<p>According to Insider Gaming sources, who provided internal information and emails from Best Buy USA, they state that the pre-order date for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 will be on April 9, 2025</a>, one week after the Direct.</p>



<p>So, if the leaked documents are to be believed, Best Buy Canada made some kind of mistake and just assumed that pre-orders would go live on the same day as the Direct.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-included-in-the-pre-order">What’s Included in the Pre-Order?</h2>



<p>At the moment, no official details have been given on the Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders, but according to the same leaked documents, it will contain a Switch 2 collectable coin.</p>



<p>Other information such as what SKU’s, games, and colours will be available for the Nintendo Switch 2 on launch have yet to be announced or leaked.</p>



<p>Will you be buying the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>It’s been almost a year-and-a-half since the first Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 trailer was released, exciting fans of the franchise around the world. Since that moment when a 2025 release was confirmed, however, it’s been silent from both Take-Two Interactive and developer Rockstar Games when it comes to any GTA 6 news. </p>



<p>Fans have gone to theorizing every possible clue they could about when the next bit of information or trailer will be released, but nothing has come yet. And now, thanks to a new interview with Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, the silence has been confirmed to be part of the plan.</p>



<p>Talking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Zelnick said that a reason for the lack of news is to “create enormous anticipation” for the game.</p>



<p>“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property,” the Take-Two CEO said. “We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.”</p>



<p>Zelnick said that there are competitors who reveal their release schedule “years in advance”. For Take-Two, Zelnick believes in doing heavier marketing as a release gets closer.</p>



<p>“We found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation,” Zelnick said. </p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Zelnick was asked about why wait so long—12+ years in the case of GTA 6—before releasing follow ups. He said that it’s intentional in order to “rest [their] intellectual property.”</p>



<p>“Some of our competitors come to market very regularly, maybe even annually with their titles,” he said. “We only annualize our sports entertainment titles.” </p>



<p>Regarding GTA 6, specifically, Zelnick added that Rockstar “seeks perfection in what they do and perfection is a pretty high bar.”</p>



<p>When do you think the next GTA 6 trailer or any news will be released? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1787/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[20 New Concept Arts of Battlefield 6 Leak Online]]></title>

<p>20 new concept art images for Battlefield 6 have leaked online following a slew of people datamining the game.</p>



<p>The concept arts where uploaded to the 1|BF telegram channel and made their way to the Battlefield Reddit. You can see all of the images below:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As pointed out by many of the users in the comments, the concept arts give off a very “gritty” vibe, something that players believe Battlefield 2042 failed to capture.</p>



<p>It appears that the leaks originated from datamining the game from the Battlefield Labs playtests, which started earlier this month for the first time.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/">Images and videos of the next Battlefield game</a> have also been uploaded on masse and EA has been trying to DMCA the content as fast as possible. However, if you look on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield reddit</a> or if you’re in a discord server, you’re almost certainly guaranteed to still find them. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 (or whatever its called) is scheduled to release between April 1st 2025 – March 31st 2026, with most company’s waiting on the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/if-gta-6-delayed-tank-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 to make a decision on when to release</a>.</p>



<p>In February 2024, Insider Gaming exclusively reported that the next Battlefield game is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to have a free-to-play Battle Royale component</a> in development by Ripple Effect. At the time of writing, EA is yet to make an announcement, but Insider Gaming understands that its still the plan to release.</p>



<p>According to sources, EA has “learned their lesson” when it comes to such an experience and the company wants to replicate the success of Call of Duty and Warzone, which proved to be tremendously successful. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/images-from-respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-have-leaked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-bit-reactor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s official unveiling at the upcoming Star Wars Celebration in April</a>, images from the the turn-based tactics game from Respawn Entertainment and Bit Reactor have appeared online. The XCOM influences are abundant, which is unsurprising given <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/bitreactor-has-a-star-wars-tactical-strategy-game-in-the-works-15-xcom-veterans-on-its-team-and-an-ambitious-vision-for-the-future-of-the-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the number of XCOM veterans</a> at Bit Reactor.</p>







<p>The images were first <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-leaked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered by gaming news outlet MP1st,</a> who found the images within a Bit Reactor artist’s portfolio. The gameplay shown is reportedly dated to mid-2023, when the game went by the internal code name Bruno.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The screenshots show gameplay very reminiscent of the tactical, turn-based squad combat genre that XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2 revitalized in the 2010s. In this kind of game, the player controls a squad of characters in turn-based combat, where each character has a limited number of actions and moves they can make. Even the iconic Mario franchise dipped its toes into the turn-based tactics genre with Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope.</p>



<p>The images of gameplay show the player controlling a Mandalorian character and targeting a Republic clone trooper, with a “95% hit chance” window above the enemy trooper. The window at the bottom of the screen shows a number of other combat actions the player could take, including the use of a thermal detonator (the Star Wars equivalent of a powerful grenade). Another images shows players using an ability taken straight from XCOM: overwatch. When a player activates overwatch on their turn, they wait for an enemy to move into their line of sight and fire automatically. An animated image also shows a makeshift headquarters, where the player can interact with an Armory, Holotable, Special Ops, or Black Market.</p>



<p>Respawn has been collaborating with Bit Reactor on the Star Wars tactical game project. The developers of the critically acclaimed Jedi series were previously working on a Star Wars shooter about a Mandalorian bounty hunter, before that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project was canceled in February 2024</a>. </p>
