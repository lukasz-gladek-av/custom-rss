<p>Rockstar Games says it didn’t fire employees for attempting to form a union. Rather, the studio behind Grand Theft Auto 6 says that staff let go were done so for leaking company information.</p>



<p>In a new report from Bloomberg’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjM4NDU1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyOTg5MzU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUEwS0JHUFdDTDgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.PipR6t4x9M3EqRs9jXeXrZNn3d-RZBZhXyh8pTYZhFs&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier</a>, the employees were giving out company secrets in a forum with non-Rockstar staff. This led to more than 30 people losing their jobs.</p>



<p><strong>“Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,”</strong> a Rockstar spokesperson told Schreier. <strong>“This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-was-the-union-s-response">What Was The Union’s Response?</h2>



<p>It just so happens, however, that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everyone who was let go</a> also took park in a private union chat on Discord. The only people outside of Rockstar involved in the chat, they say, were labor organizers.</p>



<p>The president of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain, Alex Marshall, said that Rockstar was simply <strong>“afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to&nbsp;GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive for comment on the situation. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. In the meantime, Take-Two Interactive is preparing for its latest quarterly earnings report on November 6.</p>

<p>The popular Roblox game Grow a Garden is becoming a film from Story Kitchen. Even more so, the original developers are playing a big part in its production.</p>



<p>As part of the massively popular Roblox game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-square-enix-boss-calls-roblox-grow-a-garden-somewhat-evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grow a Garden</a> is an idle multiplayer farming simulator. Players would buy and plant many types of crops and see their garden grow, hence the game. Despite the simple concept, it reached insane player counts in 2025, even beating out Fortnite. There’s clearly demand for more Grow a Garden and, now, it’ll be met on the big screen.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusive article from Deadline</a>, the outlet confirmed that <strong>Roblox’s Grow a Garden is being adapted into a film. </strong>The movie is being produced by Story Kitchen, a well-known name in the adaptation landscape. Furthermore, <strong>the original creators</strong> will join the project to help with its development, acting as producers. A statement from Story Kitchen co-founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Michael Lawrence Goldberg is available on Deadline, saying,</p>



<p>“<strong><em>Grow a Garden</em>&nbsp;is exactly the kind of imaginative, heartfelt world we love to adapt</strong>,” said the duo in the statement, “<strong>an uplifting story-world rooted in play, creativity, and community</strong>.”</p>



<p>Plot details and release information is not available at this time. However, a brief description of the film <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is available on Deadline</a>. The film, currently in early development, will maintain the whimsical spirit of Grow a Garden and focus on nurturing and friendship. Given the simple concept, there’s a lot of room to experiment and craft something. Story Kitchen is producing almost a dozen game adaptations like Shinobi, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-getting-a-movie-in-case-you-missed-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, Split Fiction, and Tomb Raider. Hopefully, the fruits of its labor will result in something, well, fruitful.</p>
