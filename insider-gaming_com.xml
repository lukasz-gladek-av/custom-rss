            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans may have to pump the breaks on the EA Sports College Basketball game. Just days after EA Sports’ Vice President of Business Development Sean O’Brien said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-is-up-for-the-challenge-of-bringing-back-college-basketball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA was “up for the challenge”</a> on building a game, a new report suggests that the game has hit a snag.</p>



<p>Sports Business Journal (SBJ) reports that schools are <strong>“weighing with rival video game developer 2K Sports for a separate product.”</strong> </p>



<p><a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/08/28/sources-ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-talks-hit-snag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to the report</a>, one of the big issues involves EA Sports’ proposal including an exclusivity license. EA’s College Basketball game was planned to be the only “action simulation” college basketball game, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-ceo-college-basketball-include-all-350-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involve all Division 1</a> men’s and women’s programs.</p>



<p>Though talks remain <strong>“active and fluid”</strong>, there is the potential that EA Sports walks away from the game altogether if it can’t retain the exclusive license. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming had been working on a similar story ahead of SBJ’s report dropping, and <strong>can corroborate that 2K has continued</strong> to become a serious contender for the rights to college basketball. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/report-2k-sports-plans-college-basketball-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported in the past,</a> 2K Sports believes that it would be able to turn around a stand alone game quicker than EA due to its already-built engine used for the NBA 2K franchise. </p>



<p>Those who spoke under the condition of anonymity believe that, if 2K wanted to and a deal was reached with schools, a game could come by 2027, at the earliest. </p>



<p>Said one source on Thursday, <strong>“Once EA put out the announcement, it lit a fire to increase the push and try and get something done.”</strong></p>



<p>Originally, 2K’s proposal to the College Licensing Company called for a non-exclusive license that would see College Basketball be added to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-sports-wants-to-add-college-basketball-to-nba-2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA 2K in the form of DLC</a>. This DLC, per the proposal, would start with limited teams before expanding each year before a potential full college basketball game should it reach certain milestones. </p>



<p>This stand alone game would likely not include every Division 1 program, and instead focus on larger schools, with “more than 100 men’s and women’s teams that would all receive ‘fair market value’ as well for their NIL”.</p>



<p>2K’s interest in a college basketball game, along with EA’s, <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1869824116339159465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was first reported</a> in December 2024.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA and 2K for comment on the latest report surrounding the future of College Basketball games. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>
