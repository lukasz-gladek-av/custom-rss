The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-steam-how-to-buy-price/</link>
            <guid>1412041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam is the go-to for most PC gamers. It has almost every game in existence, but some are conspicuously absent, and questions have been asked about Arknights: Endfield. That query will be quashed with a definitive answer, and you’ll also get insight into the game’s price and where to buy it.</p>



<p>Whether you have a gaming laptop or a class PC rig with enough RGB to light up a dark basement, Steam is traditionally the place everyone goes to buy PC games. The odd game deviates from this model. Let’s check if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a> follows in the footsteps of other games—like Hytale—by not launching on Steam right away.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-arknights-endfield-on-steam">Can You Buy Arknights: Endfield On Steam?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ember’s happy, but PC gamers won’t be. Credit to Hypergryph</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>For some reason, Arknights: Endfield is not available to purchase through Steam and needs to be bought via different means on PC.</strong></p>



<p>The closest thing you’ll find to Arknights: Endfield on Steam is the rudimentary-looking, fan-made ‘Ark: Release.’ You’ll find nothing about Endfield on Steam, nor any traces related to it.</p>



<p>If you want to buy Arknights: Endfield, you need to be whisked away elsewhere.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-buy-arknight-endfield-on-pc">How To Buy Arknight: Endfield On PC</h2>



<p><strong>You can download and buy Arknights: Endfield through the Windows App and the Epic Games Store on PC.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has covered the purchase process extensively in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-preload-guide-file-sizes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield Pre-Download guide</a>. However, it really is as simple as going to the applicable storefronts, purchasing it, downloading the game’s launcher, and installing the game, ready to play.</p>



<p>It remains unclear if a Steam version will ever become available. If it does, this guide’s content will be updated to reflect the new information.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-arknights-endfield-price-explained">How Much Is Arknights: Endfield? Price Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Arknights: Endfield is a free-to-play action-adventure game, which means you can tie up those purse strings and keep your wallet shut, ready to splurge on future games.</strong></p>



<p>There might be some confusion over the game’s cost if you check out the PS5 store listing, for example. Make no mistake, Arknights: Endfield is F2P. But you can buy a special edition for $9.99 or £7.99, and it comes with the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Basic HH Permit ×5.</li>



<li>T-Creds ×50000.</li>



<li>Intermediate Combat Record ×10.</li>



<li>Arms Inspector ×10.</li>



<li>Fortifying Infusion ×10.</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a free-to-play title, but there’s a huge emphasis on its gacha elements and microtransactions. If you get sucked into Arknights: Endfield, it could be a worryingly expensive rabbit hole you get yourself stuck in.</p>



<p>For a game of this size and substance, it’s a good package. Although it’s totally understandable if you think this should be F2P. Let IG know your thoughts on the game, its price, and more through the free-to-join and ever-growing <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re looking for a new gacha-RPG, then Arknights: Enfield might be for you. But we all know gaming is better with friends, so there’s one question on everyone’s mind—does <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-preload-guide-file-sizes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a> have multiplayer?</p>



<p>The game will expand the Arknights universe, which was founded with the original Arknights back in May 2019. Instead of the former tower-defence gameplay, you can expect a fusion between combat and factory-building. </p>







<p>If that’s enough to get you to jump into Arknights: Endfield, then Insider Gaming can let you know whether you can expect multiplayer or co-op during your time on Talos-II.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-arknights-endfield-have-multiplayer">Does Arknights: Endfield Have Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One of the many characters. Image by Hypergryph.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Arknights: Endfield does feature multiplayer features, but not in the traditional sense. </strong></p>



<p>You won’t find yourself stumbling across other players in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-platforms-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a>, as it’s primarily a single-player experience. However, there are some nifty multiplayer features that you can engage in with your friends, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Visiting a friend’s reception room</li>



<li>Seeing someone’s team composition</li>



<li>Sharing Blueprints and Facilities</li>



<li>Helping friends with their OMV Dijiang</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-does-arknights-endfield-have-co-op">Does Arknights: Endfield Have Co-op?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Arknights: Endfield does not have co-op, but there is a chance it could be added at a later date.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, you’ll have to stick it out alone in Arknights: Endfield, as there won’t be any co-op at launch. That means you won’t be able to join a friend’s world, but there’s a chance that could change in the future.</p>







<p>Most games of a similar genre tend to have some form of co-op, such as Genshin Impact. Considering over 35 million people have signed up to play, it’d be a real missed opportunity if Hypergryph don’t add co-op in the future. As things stand, though, it remains a pipe dream.</p>

<p>The release of Crimson Desert is coming fast. On Wednesday morning, developer Pearl Abyss announced that the game has officially gone gold.</p>



<p>The “gone gold” announcement comes nearly two months before the game’s planned March 19 release date. </p>







<p><strong>“We’re thrilled to announce that Crimson Desert has gone gold,”</strong> they said on <a href="https://x.com/crimsondesert_/status/2013974920120987867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>. <strong>“On behalf of the team at Pearl Abyss, thank you to our fans around the world for your support and for reaching this milestone with us. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Stay tuned for more news, and see you in Pywel on March 19!” </strong></p>



<p>With the game going gold, that means, apart from something catastrophic, the game will hit its planned release date. Crimson Desert will be available for $69.99. A Deluxe Edition is also available for $79.99. The Deluxe Edition of the game comes with a Kairos Plate Set, a Balgran Shield, and Exclaire Horse Tack Set. </p>







<p>When it launches in March, Crimson Desert will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p>

<p>A Portuguese retailer has posted the Switch 2 release date for Borderlands 4, suggesting the game will launch on the platform on February 27, 2026. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed indefinitely</a> back in September 2025 as the developers needed additional time to work on the game. Since then, we have yet to receive a new release date from the developers, but it might be arriving soon if the Portuguese listing is indeed true. </p>

<p>The Borderlands 4 Switch 2 listing has appeared on the Portuguese website, <a href="https://www.gamingreplay.com/pt/pre-reservas-nintendo-switch-2/32061-borderlands-4-game-key-card-switch-2-5026555072694.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming Replay</a>. The listing states that the release date is set for February 27, 2026, and that it will be a Game Key Card priced at €69.99. Interested buyers in the region can already pre-order the Switch 2 version on the website. </p>



<p>Back in November 2025, the Take Two CEO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-sales-results-softer-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the launch sales numbers for Borderlands 4 were&nbsp;“a little softer” than they would’ve liked, but expects it to do well “in the fullness of time”. Hopefully, the Switch 2 launch can help increase these numbers significantly. </p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is the fourth instalment of the highly popular looter shooter series, which features billions of weapons, a variety of enemies, and exciting co-op gameplay. The latest instalment takes players to a brand-new planet called Kairos, which features 4 fresh Vault Hunters.
