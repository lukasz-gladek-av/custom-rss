<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 you the reigns to various characters throughout the Campaign. However, one character stands out above the rest—Case. We’re here to give you a rundown of what happened to Case, and clear up any confusion.</p>



<p>Many Call of Duty games have taken the liberty of making multiple, integral characters playable through the Campaign. I still remember switching between CoD 4’s Sgt. Paul Jackson and the legendary Sergeant ‘Soap’ McTavish, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> doesn’t quite reach this extent, one mission moves you around a lot.</p>



<p>Case is our main character for the majority of BLOPS 6 though, and his story unfolds shockingly throughout the main story missions. Once you’re done with distractions such as solving the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-safe-code-and-complete-every-safehouse-puzzle-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Safehouse Puzzles</a>, you eventually come to the end of the Campaign, and the resolution is a subjective one.</p>



<p><strong>*Spoiler Warning: The end of Black Ops 6 is about to be discussed, so be warned.*</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-does-case-die-in-black-ops-6">Does Case Die in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The end moments are chaotic. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve done some digging, and no one seems to know for sure if Case really did die at the climax of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign—nor has Activision, Treyarch, or Raven Software confirmed this.</p>



<p>I know this isn’t the answer you hoped for, but it does mean if you like Case, and want more of his involvement, I reckon there’s a good chance he’s still alive and kicking. To recap, the conclusion of Black Ops 6 sees Pantheon forces invade the Rook in a bid to wipe out the team and rescue the good-turned-bad Harrow.</p>



<p>Case thwarts Harrow’s escape effort, resulting in the helicopter crashing into the water near the Rook safehouse. With water slowly consumingthe vehicle, Case and Harrow fight. After a sample of The Cradle breaks and infects Case, our hero kills Harrow, and the water and surrounding environment seems to get the better of Case—as the screen fades to black.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-case-alive-in-black-ops-6">Is Case alive in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>This isn’t official, but <strong>I believe Case is still somehow alive in Black Ops 6</strong>—I could be proven wrong though.</p>



<p>I can’t think of many instances in CoD games where a major death isn’t given some kind of on-screen attention or an off-screen mention. We either see the character in question die, or their death is mentioned in a post-credits cutscene, or in a commemoration to the individual’s life and legacy.</p>



<p>Black Ops Cold War carried on its story through seasonal multiplayer content; so I think we either see Case return at some point in the next year, or he could end up being the main villain in the next Black Ops installment. If it happens, you owe me a Pepsi Max.</p>

<p>Techland has revealed what’s next on Dying Light 2’s expansive roadmap – a special, limited-time event called ‘Halloween Run’. This event will be delivered alongside update 1.19, and it broadens the Tower Raid mechanic, adds special spooky characters, and introduces new rewards and shop items, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Players dedicated to the game will be able to purchase two new bundles – Cursed Pirate and Count Skull, both of which are bursting with cosmetics that you can don to celebrate Halloween.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-get-spooky">Get Spooky</h2>



<p>From October 30 to November 20, Dying Light 2 players can participate in an extended Halloween event that’s open to even the newest players just starting their adventure in Villedor.</p>



<p>Each week, Techland will add new features and activities to Dying Light 2, just to keep things fresh. This content injection introduces a terrifying Tower Raid loop, new bounties themed on Halloween, and more cosmetics and new rewards than you can shake a pumpkin (?) at.</p>



<p>Players taking part in the Tower Raid can pick from four unique classes, each of which has traits specific to that character. It boosts the replayability factor of Halloween Run, which is great for players hungry to grind. </p>



<p>With Patch 1.19, the Techland team has also introduced a new control scheme that makes controlling firearms much more satisfying and intuitive. That’s along with the typical quality-of-life improvements and community-led changes that you’d expect with an update like this.</p>



<p>In the patch notes, Techland confirmed that some of the most niggling issues in Dying Light 2 have been addressed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Co-op spawning in Tower Raid</li>



<li>Broken quests and soft lock issues</li>



<li>Improved physics for certain heavy skills</li>



<li>Tweaked filter presets</li>



<li>Replaced missing dialogue and subtitles in some quests</li>
</ul>



<p>Are you looking forward to sinking your teeth into Dying Light 2’s Halloween Run update? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to use a weapon in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> that is easy to control and has enough bullets to go on a killing spree, then you must choose the XMG. It’s an LMG and here are the best attachments, Perks, and Equipment you can use along with it to make a solid loadout.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-xmg-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-xmg">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-xmg">Best Secondary for XMG</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-xmg-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock XMG</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-xmg-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the XMG any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-xmg-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-xmg-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best XMG loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Ranger Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Infiltrator Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>Unlike other weapons where five attachments are more than enough, I recommend using eight attachments for the XMG – thanks to the Gunfighter Perk. </p>



<p>Start with the <strong>Kepler Microflex</strong> as it’s clean enough to land your headshots accurately. The <strong>Suppressor</strong> suppresses the gun sound and also hides you from the mini-map.</p>



<p>The <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> will greatly increase the damage range and bullet velocity of the XMG thereby improving the weapon’s firepower. The <strong>Ranger Foregrip</strong> will slightly increase Sprinting Movement Speed and Horizontal Recoil Control.</p>



<p>Yes, the <strong>Fast Mag II</strong> will significantly reduce the ammo capacity of the magazine but in return, you are getting quicker reloads, better ADS, and Sprint to Fire Speeds. The <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> comes in handy with a further improved Aim Down Sight speed.</p>



<p>Combine that with the <strong>Infiltrator Stock</strong> and your Aim Walking Movement Speed will also increase significantly while using the XMG. Lastly, <strong>Recoil Springs</strong> will be the cherry on top as it slightly improves both horizontal and vertical recoil of the LMG. </p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-xmg">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for XMG</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>Combining <strong>Gung-Ho, Assassin, and Double Time</strong> will activate the <strong>Enforcer</strong> Specialty as it grants a temporary buff to movement speed and health regeneration rate – a combination that goes well with the XMG</p>



<p>For the Wildcard, use <strong>Gunfighter</strong> as it will enable you to use eight attachments on your XMG. The sacrifice you’re making here is letting go of the fourth Perk slot (Perk Greed helps you achieve that) but it’s worth it.</p>



<p><strong>Semtex</strong> and <strong>Stim Shot</strong> should be your go-to Equipment choices here for quick damage and health recovery. Lastly, keep the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> and place them wisely for cheeky free kills.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-xmg">Best Secondary for XMG</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the XMG are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-xmg-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock XMG in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the XMG by reaching <strong>player level 13</strong> in Black Ops 6. This should be fairly easy as it won’t take a lot of time to unlock the weapon and you can start leveling it up early in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-xmg-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the XMG any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Despite the XMG being a heavy weapon, you get a very fast TTK from it. On top of that, controlling the weapon is easy due to its low recoil, allowing you to easily spray down enemies at long ranges.</p>



<p>The only downsides of this weapon are its slow mobility and ADS speeds but the attachments I’ve recommended above should get that sorted.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-xmg-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the XMG in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If the XMG is too much for you, then the best alternatives are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS VAL</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a>. These two weapons are two of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-assault-rifles-in-black-ops-6-ranked-best-ar-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Assault Rifles in BO6</a> as they are ruling the meta right now, offering fast TTK similar to the LMG.</p>
