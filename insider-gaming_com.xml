            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-productions-celebrating-10th-anniversary-with-%E2%80%98future-projects%E2%80%99-glimpse.1285674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kojima Productions has announced an upcoming showcase poised to celebrate the company’s tenth anniversary. The ‘Beyond the Strand’ event will offer a ‘glimpse into future projects’ and pay tribute to everything the studio has accomplished thus far.</p>



<p>Beyond the Strand will be both a digital and in-person event, with the live portion taking place at TOHO Cinemas in Roppongi Hills, Japan. </p>



<h2 id="h-ten-years-of-kojima-productions">Ten Years of Kojima Productions</h2>



<p>Hideo Kojima will host the Beyond the Strand event in Japan on September 23, and the showcase is set to feature a hefty assortment of special guest appearances. It’s easy to predict who will show up, and I’m willing to bet hard cash that Norman Reedus will appear.</p>



<p>Kojima Productions <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/kjp10th_beyond_the_strand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">unveiled the event</a> earlier today, revealing that tickets for Beyond the Strand will go on sale from tomorrow, September 2.</p>



<p>In the most recent Hideo Kojima space, the iconic game creator revealed that he’s effectively <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working ‘all by himself’</a> on Physint, the tactical espionage game set to be a spiritual successor to Metal Gear Solid.</p>



<p>Before that, he stressed in a somewhat bizarre way during an interview that, while making games, he has learned many ways in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-learned-many-ways-kill-people-bags-studios/">which to kill people</a>. It was his opinion that more developers need to understand these elements of development if they want to make better games.</p>



<p> Looking forward to Beyond the Strand, it’s easy to see a heavy focus on OD, one of Hideo Kojima’s next big games. There might even be talk of an expansion for Death Stranding 2. As for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-written-concept-death-stranding-3-wont-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 3</a>, the man himself recently admitted that it might not be him who makes the game, if it does ever surface.</p>



<p>What do you want to see at Beyond the Strand? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/repo%E2%80%99s-next-major-update-features-lots-of-disgusting-new-monsters.1285668/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Semiwork is hard at work on the next big REPO update. The indie sensation horror game retains a healthy player base, and loyal gamers are going to have their passion and playtime rewarded with many new monsters, likely to require your toilet to be on standby.</p>



<p>While not quite as lively as it was in its early weeks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/repo-is-the-best-selling-steam-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> remains very popular. Over 20,000 people are still logging in each month, and the game’s peak hovers around the 40-45K mark. Semiwork understands this, which is why a new update is in development.</p>



<h2 id="h-repo-receiving-more-monsters-in-big-october-30-update">REPO Receiving More Monsters In Big October 30 Update</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Yeah, I’d have that face too. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p>A fun new video was released on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@semiwork" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">semiwork</a> YouTube channel on August 29. It’s titled “REVEALING THE NEXT R.E.P.O. UPDATE,” and it did exactly what it promised.</p>



<p>“The next update will be all monsters,” we are told by the narrator. Now, only one of the new creatures was revealed as semiwork wants to keep the remaining designs a secret.</p>



<p>But a special spotlight is given to one of the new monsters. It’s described by the host as an “innocent goblin-looking thing” and looks small in stature, but horrific in design.</p>



<p>It has two large tusks alongside its set of teeth, a long tongue, a large protruding nose sticking out the top of its head, and, while I can’t see any eyes, I have a feeling they could be on its body.</p>



<p>REPO’s ‘The Monster Update’ drops on October 30—just in time for Halloween—and comes with new gameplay features, and much more.</p>



<figure><p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-co-op-split-screen-is-technically-feasible-says-ceo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-co-op-split-screen-is-%E2%80%9Ctechnically-feasible-%E2%80%9D-says-ceo.1285641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2’s CEO has stated that the split-screen co-op feature is technically possible and is on the developers’ list of features to investigate.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 is experiencing its best time since launch, with the game releasing for a brand new platform, the Xbox Series consoles, and hitting its highest concurrent player count on Steam since April 2024. Moreover, the game has also received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-warbond-release-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legendary HALO ODST Warbond</a> recently.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-devs-have-co-op-splitscreen-on-their-to-investigate-list">Helldivers 2 Devs Have Co-Op Splitscreen on their ‘To Investigate’ List</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-split-screen-co-op-ceo-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, a player recently asked about Helldivers 2 getting split-screen support on the game’s official Discord. The CEO of Arrowhead Studios, Shams Jorjani, responded, stating that co-op split-screen for Helldivers 2 is “technically feasible”, but isn’t sure whether this is a feature players really want. However, the feature has been placed on their “to investigate” list, so there’s a chance we may hear something about it, but players shouldn’t get their hopes too high.</p>



<p>Since the advent of online co-op, offline split-screen co-op has begun to disappear from games, with almost no recent games offering this feature anymore. Split-screen co-op could be a great addition for Helldivers 2, but it all depends on the execution. However, as it is a PvE title, a local co-op option might be something players might be genuinely interested in. Regardless, we will have to wait and see if Arrowhead takes action.</p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2 devs thought Fortnite’s new season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-new-season-feels-like-we-have-helldivers-at-home-arrowhead-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">felt like</a> “we have Helldivers at home”. What are your thoughts on Helldivers 2 receiving split-screen co-op? Is that a feature you might be interested in? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>James Bond fans, get ready. On September 3, IO Interactive is offering a brand new look at 007 First Light with a special PlayStation State of Play. </p>



<p>Announced by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/01/state-of-play-presents-007-first-light-gameplay-deep-dive-on-september-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yann Roskell</a>, IO Interactive’s senior global communication manager, the upcoming State of Play will showcase over 30 minutes of gameplay. Specifically, fans will get to see a playthrough of the first mission as an MI6 recruit.</p>



<p>“The action includes everything from high-speed car chases to on-foot stealth sequences and shootouts,” Roskell said.</p>



<p>The 007 First Light State of Play begins <strong>Wednesday, September 3 at 2pm ET, 11am PT, and 7pm BST</strong>. The event will air on PlayStation’s YouTube and Twitch channels.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the showcase when it airs.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lego-pokemon-prices-have-possibly-leaked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-pok%C3%A9mon-date-prices-have-possibly-leaked-and-include-649-99-set-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1285593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The idea of LEGO Pokémon prices allegedly being expensive is as shocking as being unable to catch Mewtwo first go with a Poké Ball—it’s not. A new leak claims to have gotten wind of the first LEGO Pokémon date and prices, and while not official, it seems there will be at least one monstrous set.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-mario-kart-spiny-shell-set-promo-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a> acquiring the right to use the Pokémon license is a win for all. MEGA has done a great job with its range of products over the years—my house proudly displays a giant Gyarados, Eevee, and a Poke Ball! But it’s certainly exciting to see what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Pokémon</a> is in the works.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-pokemon-reportedly-arrives-in-2026-and-will-be-expensive">LEGO Pokémon Reportedly Arrives in 2026 And Will Be Expensive</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Welcome changes. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the popular and reliable <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LegoLeak</a> subreddit, the new LEGO Pokémon sets are releasing on March 1, 2026.</p>



<p>Three sets have been outed: 72151, 72152, and 72153. The first one reportedly has 587 pieces and will cost $59.99. The second set contains 2050 pieces and costs $199.99. The third and final set (72153) apparently features a whopping 6838 pieces and will set you back $649.99.</p>



<p>Again, this is a rumored leak, so take this information at face value for what it is. The fun part is now speculating what the sets could be. LEGO tends to have different versions of the same theme. The Millennium Falcon, for example, has three variations, and the main difference between them is size and price.</p>



<p>The three models mentioned in the leak could be Pikachu, but getting progressively bigger and more expensive. Either way, I can’t wait to see what LEGO Pokémon sets are in development.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Which LEGO Pokémon sets are you keen to see? Who’s your favorite Pokémon? I am desperate for a Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar set, personally. Let me know what you hope to see through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Approximately 40 minutes of Star Wars Outlaws gameplay, running on the Nintendo Switch 2, has leaked online.</p>



<p>The gameplay was uploaded by the YouTuber mataleao, who has managed to get the game early on the Switch 2 ahead of its September 4, 2025, release date. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As pointed out by some users in the YouTube comments, the gameplay appears surprisingly good, with some users noting that it even looks and seems to run better than Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>“This runs amazing. It’s not 60fps and 1080p but it looks really smooth. The people complaining are just holding these ports to extremely high standards” says YouTube user Selfbaptized. “Looks way better than I anticipated,” says another user.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-run-poorly">Does Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 Run Poorly?</h2>



<p>According to some media outlets, though, who were given the opportunity to play the game on the Switch 2 at PAX West 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-reportedly-performed-poorly-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws didn’t have great performance</a>. According to those in attendance, the game’s framerate dropped below 30 FPS on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>Media outlets were apparently not allowed to record gameplay, with those getting hands-on saying that the game was “king of rough”. </p>



<p>Whether the game runs well or not remains to be seen, but the 40 minutes of Star Wars Outlaws gameplay uploaded to YouTube do look like it runs rather well.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cancelled-star-wars-outlaws-sequel-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws sequel</a>, which Insider Gaming understands was in the very early stages of development, was canceled due to the game not meeting internal expectations. </p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set to launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 on September 4, 2025. Will you be giving it a play? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>
