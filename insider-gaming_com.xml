<p>Delta Force is laying down the law as an FPS not to be messed with, and its controller support keeps cropping up in combat. Mouse and keyboard players need not worry, but let’s see if Delta Force has a controller as a trusted ally.</p>



<p>The gaming market is never short of shooters—third-person, first-person, or otherwise. Black Ops 6 and Warzone remain popular despite dwindling numbers, Marvel Rivals is dominating the hero shooter genre, and Fortnite has infinite lives. Gray Zone Warfare was an example of an indie shooter trying to break out and match the extraction success of Escape From Tarkov—but Delta Force is a force in its own right.</p>



<p>The first-person shooter title has received new fans courtesy of its free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hawk Down Campaign DLC</a>. We’ll clear up any confusion about controller support for Team Jade’s shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-delta-force-have-controller-support">Does Delta Force Have Controller Support?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Trickier than it needs to be. Credit to Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Delta Force officially doesn’t have controller support on PC yet, meaning you either have to use keyboard and mouse or unsupported controller support.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, Delta Force doesn’t let you use a controller right now. If you want to use a controller with Delta Force, you need to enable <strong>Steam Input</strong>. This allows you to connect a controller, but the controls might be a bit funky and unstable. You might experience input issues you wouldn’t have with proper native support.</p>



<p>For now, you’re better off using a keyboard and mouse. This might not be forever though as updates have been provided concerning controller support.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-controller-support-coming-to-delta-force">When is Controller Support Coming to Delta Force?</h2>



<p><strong>The developer has confirmed controller support is coming to Delta Force in Q1 2025.</strong></p>



<p>On Dec. 5, 2024, a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2507950/discussions/0/4638240954399129918/?ctp=2#c4638240954399140782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam General Discussion thread for Delta Force</a> discussed the topic of “No controller support?” User Philx.v posed this question about Delta Force. The question wasn’t left for the community to discuss amongst itself though.</p>



<p>A Team Jade dev commented on the query: “Thank you for playing Delta Force! We’re working on adding controller support and are aiming to introduce this feature to the game by Q1 2025.” It’s looking likely that <strong>March 2025</strong> will see the addition of controller support, but this is subject to change.</p>



<p>It was rumored the support would coincide with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-console-release-window-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console launch of Delta Force</a>. However, the Delta Force console release date—as of writing—has been postponed. But it is coming, so keep those dual analog sticks warm while you wait.</p>

<p>According to a new leak, Pokemon TCG Pocket will feature a new Ranked Battles mode in March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Pokemon TCG Pocket’s Ranked Battles mode news comes from popular leaker <a href="https://x.com/eb576dcfe/status/1894572652054155489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pyoro</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1894588040359625000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CentroLeaks</a>). Besides the mode releasing in March 2025, the leaker didn’t provide any more information. However, Pokemon Presents is all set to be hosted tomorrow, February 27, and players might hear more information about the new Ranked Battles mode and details about other Pokemon games then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Pokemon TCG Pocket receives a Ranked Battles mode, it will become the third battle game mode, after Versus and Solo. The developers could implement a rank system reminiscent of other online competitive titles with its reward tree. At the same time, the game would need competitive changes which balance gameplay. However, it is all just speculation at this point, and we will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another TCG Pocket leak arrived today through CentroLeaks. This leak shed light on the upcoming booster pack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-triumphant-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a>, featuring an Arceus Ex card. The leaked pack will reportedly be released this week; learn more about it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket card listings were recently&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-are-being-listed-on-ebay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted on eBay</a>. Also, the game recently gave away&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-gifting-players-free-trade-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free trade tokens</a>&nbsp;after the community’s feedback on the restriction of the feature. What are your thoughts on Pokemon TCG Pocket’s Triumphant Light booster pack?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has adjusted pricing for Escape from Tarkov in LATAM regions to ‘balance things out’. To celebrate the new pricing structure, the team has published a small gift bundle that all users can take advantage of. It includes a full kit – a weapon, plate vest, headset, ammunition, and so on.</p>



<p>The downside is it’s only redeemable in PvP, so PvE players have once again missed out on this limited-time promotion.</p>



<hr>

From there, click on ‘Activate Promo Code’ and enter the following:</p>



<ul>

<p>It includes:</p>



<ul>

<li>Takedown BP</li>



<li>STRIKE Helmet</li>



<li>Banshee Rig</li>



<li>ComTac IV Headset</li>

<li>100 x M856A1</li>



<li>Propital Injector</li>



<li>Condor Glasses</li>



<li>EXPS3 Optic</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though. Battlestate Games is running a Twitch Drops campaign from February 26 – March 1 for Escape from Tarkov, and from March 1 – March 3 for Tarkov Arena. </p>



<p>On social media, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>LATAM regional pricing for Escape from Tarkov and Tarkov Arena is now in place! Prices for all digital products have been adjusted to match regional rates, enhancing the local accessibility of our games.</p>



<p>To celebrate the LATAM regional pricing, use the promo code in the launcher to receive in-game rewards: TARKOVLATAM.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Battlestate Games continues to evolve Escape from Tarkov, which was first released almost ten years ago (in beta). This year, big things are on the horizon, and the game moves ever closer to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">the fabled 1.0 version</a> that’ll be classed as a full graduation.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Tarkov or have you dropped off until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">the next wipe</a> arrives? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
