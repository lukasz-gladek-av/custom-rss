            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been five years since the PS5 was released, and here are the statistics it has accumulated during this time frame. </p>



<p>There is still a long way to go before we see the next generation of PlayStation consoles, the PS6, which is reportedly set to arrive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime in 2027</a>. As we await the next generation of PlayStation consoles, let’s take a look back at what the PlayStation 5 has accomplished since its release. </p>







<h2 id="h-from-2020-to-2025-here-s-how-the-ps5-has-grown-over-the-past-five-years">From 2020 to 2025, Here’s How the PS5 Has Grown Over the Past Five Years</h2>







<figure></figure>



<p>Starting in 2020, the console was released with a high-speed SSD, immersive 3D Audio, and the DualSense wireless controller. It also debuted features like Share Screen, which allows players to watch friends’ gameplay in real-time. The feature was used more than&nbsp;1.6 billion&nbsp;times, totaling over&nbsp;900 million hours of usage. Regarding accessibility, the console has expanded from 11 features at launch to 20 by 2025. </p>







<figure></figure>



<p>The following year, we saw innovation towards Share Play, with cross-gen share-play allowing PS5 players with PS Plus to virtually ‘pass the controller’ to friends using PS4. The feature has been used over 700 million times since launch. M.2 SSD storage expansion was introduced for players to grow their libraries further. </p>



<p>PS5 Game Captures received the ability to be shared through the PS App, resulting in 5.6 billion captures uploaded and over 1 billion voice chat sessions conducted through the app. The Midnight Black and Cosmic Red colour variations for the DualSense were also released in 2021. </p>



<h3 id="h-2022-vrr-new-ps-plus-tiers-and-more-colors">2022 – VRR, New PS Plus Tiers, and More Colors</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Then the next year, PlayStation 5 received variable refresh rate or VRR, which helped enhance visual performance by minimizing visual artifacts for smoother, crisper gameplay. 96% of players with VRR-compatible monitors use this feature regularly. We also saw PlayStation Plus being turned into a three-tier service: Essential, Extra, and Premium/Deluxe. “The total gameplay hours for Game Catalog and Classic Catalog have also increased – cumulatively hitting&nbsp;14 billion hours.”</p>



<p>Three more galaxy-inspired color variations were introduced for the DualSense in 2022: Nova Pink, Starlight Blue, and Galactic Purple.</p>



<h3 id="h-2023-playstation-vr2-playstation-portal-dualsense-edge-and-more">2023 – PlayStation VR2, PlayStation Portal, DualSense Edge, and More</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>2023 was the year of accessories; we first saw the release of the PSVR2, which featured eye tracking, headset feedback, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers through the PSVR2 Sense Controllers. Discord voice chat has been introduced to the PS5, with more than 1 billion voice chat sessions taking place on the platform, averaging 105 minutes per session.</p>



<p>Then, the next device, PlayStation Portal, was introduced to redefine their remote play features, with the device accounting for over 50%&nbsp;of all PS5 Remote Play sessions. Innovation was also introduced to the controller space with the high-performance, ultra-customizable DualSense Edge and the Access Controller, designed to make games more accessible. </p>



<p>Cloud streaming for PS5 games also introduced new options for PlayStation Plus Premium members to stream supported PS5 digital games from the Game Catalog, Game Trials, and purchases made on the PS Store directly on their PS5 console. Lastly, a whole line of audio products was released with planar magnetic drivers, PlayStation Link technology, and lightning-fast, lossless audio connection. </p>







<h3 id="h-2024-community-game-help-welcome-hub-and-ps5-pro">2024 –  Community Game Help, Welcome Hub, and PS5 Pro</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>2024 was the year when Community Game Help was introduced, allowing players to share gameplay hint videos generated by opt-in contributors. The Welcome Hub was also added this year to bring a personalized PS5 home screen space with customizable widgets and backgrounds. Lastly, the mid-gen update, PS5 Pro, and the PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection were also released that year. </p>



<h3 id="h-2025-here-s-where-everything-adds-up">2025 – Here’s Where Everything Adds Up</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>2025 marks the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/12/five-years-of-play-the-evolution-of-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">5th Anniversary</a> of the PS5, and it has racked up some huge numbers in this time span. The console has sold over 84 million units globally, and if players “lined up every PS5 ever sold, together they’d stretch over&nbsp;28,600 kilometers”. Moreover, over 7,500 PS5 games have been published by more than 4,000 creators. </p>



<p>The top 3 multiplayer games on the PS5, based on playtime, are Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto V, and Call of Duty Modern Warfare II. The top 3 single-player games on PS5 are Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, God of War Ragnarök, and Hogwarts Legacy. Combined, players have acquired over 40 billion Trophies and 110 million Platinum Trophies. Last but not least by any means, across the five years, PS5 players have&nbsp;logged a total of 100 billion hours of gameplay.</p>



<p>In other news, a PS5 &amp; PC cross-buy option has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-ps5-pc-cross-buy-option-has-been-discovered-verified/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered and verified</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Announces The Steam Frame VR Headset]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The rumors were true after all. Valve has announced the Steam Frame VR headset, it’s first headset since the Valve Index was released in 2019. </p>



<p>The Steam Frame is scheduled to release in early 2026. Unfortunately, no firm date nor pricing has been made public just yet.</p>







<p>Rumors and reports around the Steam Frame have been around for some time, but they really began to pick up steam in September when a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-new-vr-headset-might-have-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trademark filing discovered</a> the likely name of the device. Then, in October, it was reported that the headset had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valves-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entered mass production</a> while files on Steam were updated that signaled a release was imminent.</p>



<p>The Steam Frame features the ability to play both VR and non-VR games. Valve’s biggest claim is that the device “is a PC” that allows you to install your own apps, browse the web, and more. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Steam Frame Layout via Valve</figcaption></figure>



<p>With it being a PC, the Steam Frame will allow players to play stand-alone without the need to be connected to a computer. It features a 4nm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 CPU and up to 1TB of on-board storage with additional storage available via a microSD slot.</p>

<p>Valve is back in the “console” business. The Washington-based company has officially announced its next-gen Steam Machine to the world.</p>



<p>The Steam Machine is scheduled to launch in early 2026, though no firm date nor pricing has been confirmed.</p>

<p>In addition to being designed for Steam, Valve says that users will be able to install their own operating system and apps on the device. They also say that it “enough horsepower” to stream to your Steam Deck, Steam Link, or even your new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-the-steam-frame-vr-headset/">Steam Frame VR Headset</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar is facing legal troubles due to recent firings, with the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) taking matters into their own hands. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the GTA 6 developer recently fired employees for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giving out company secrets</a>. The fired workers then arranged a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-workers-protest-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protest</a> outside Take-Two’s London office with IWGB, claiming they were fired “in a blatant act of union busting”. Now, IWGB has issued a legal claim against Rockstar for the recent firings. </p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-due-to-alleged-union-busting">Rockstar Hit With Legal Claim Due to Alleged Union Busting</h2>



<p>In a legal statement shared with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the IWGB reveals that they are representing employees who Rockstar Games recently fired. IWGB believes that they were dismissed in circumstances that “amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity.” The statement adds that despite IGWB attempting to meet Rockstar and “resolve the matter through negotiation”, the latter has refused to meet and “persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful.”</p>



<p>Therefore, IWGB has “issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants.” The president of IWGB, Alex Marshall, added that they are confident that this is a case of “plain and simple union busting” and they will “mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers.” </p>



<p>The statement added that “Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law.” Marshall concluded, stating that “this case stands as a warning to any employer in the games industry and beyond who thinks they are able to act with impunity against organised workers – we will not be intimidated.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-arc-raiders-map-open-breaking-new-ground/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-arc-raiders-map-will-open-after-%E2%80%98breaking-new-ground%E2%80%99-community-event.1351510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has lifted the lid a little further on the North Line update, which kicks off tomorrow. Over the next few days, players will be challenged with a new Community Event, called ‘Breaking New Ground’. In this event, the Raiders will need to contribute crafting materials to collectively fuel the push into the new map, Stella Montis.</p>



<p>The faster the Raiders complete the challenge, the sooner the new map will be unlocked, Embark Studios has confirmed.</p>







<h2 id="h-breaking-new-ground-comes-to-arc-raiders-tomorrow">Breaking New Ground Comes to ARC Raiders Tomorrow</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has a new community event that effectively kickstarts the North Line update, dropping tomorrow on all platforms. This update will see the game’s first new map arrive in Stella Montis, a cold and sterile facility dug deep into the mountains above all the other maps.</p>



<p>The update also ushers in two new ARC enemies, the Matriarch and the Shredder. It has been said that the Matriarch makes the Queen look friendly, and the Shredder poses a challenge in tight environments.</p>



<p>For Breaking New Ground, players need to contribute the following to the collective effort:</p>



<ul>
<li>Metal Parts</li>



<li>Fabric</li>



<li>Chemicals</li>



<li>Rubber Parts</li>



<li>Plastic Parts</li>
</ul>



<p>This event also introduces Merits, a new currency type that ‘will fuel the next phase of progression’. Once the tunnel leading to Stella Montis has been opened up, Staking Our Claim, a new progression path, will open.</p>







<p>Embark Studios has also confirmed that new gameplay items and weapons are being added to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/arc-raiders-loaded-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> with the North Line update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New legendary weapon</li>



<li>Three new mines</li>



<li>Two new grenades</li>
</ul>
