<p>In November, Fallout 4 will celebrate its tenth anniversary, having been released way back in 2015. As the best-selling game in the series (provided you don’t count the tens of millions of players passing through Fallout 76), it’s well placed to receive an Anniversary Edition. As we all know, Bethesda Game Studios loves any reason to re-release an old game.</p>



<p>However, the current-gen update introduced last year and already a busy slate at Bethesda Game Studios might have nipped any chance of Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition surfacing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-boston">Back to Boston</h2>



<p>Fallout 4 was released by Bethesda Game Studios on November 10, 2025, which means we’re mere months away from the game’s tenth anniversary. It’s one heck of a milestone, and as it’s still one of the most popular games in the series, particularly amongst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-is-getting-a-paid-mods-system-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the modding community</a>, could we see it get a little more love this year from Bethesda?</p>



<p>Fans are hopeful that <strong>something </strong>will drop to celebrate the game’s milestone, but let’s be honest, it’ll probably be some kind of crossover bundle or event released in Fallout 76, which is where Bethesda’s sole focus sits right now for the post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>In 2017, Fallout 4 received a Game of the Year Edition, bundled with every one of the game’s stellar expansions and smaller pieces of downloadable content. Last year, shortly after the award-winning Fallout TV show debuted, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fix-fallout-4-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 current-gen upgrade</a> was released, adding more content to the game and bringing it up to spec.</p>



<p>That’s enough to assume that there <strong>won’t </strong>be a re-release of Fallout 4, as it’s safe to say that there’s no appetite for anyone to purchase the game <strong>again </strong>unless there is a strong incentive to do so.</p>



<p>As a die-hard Fallout fan, I’d buy it just to own it. In any case, it’s the kind of thing that might launch on the Game Pass service, just like Oblivion Remastered did, which scrubs away <strong>even more </strong>sales (unless they rely heavily on other platforms).</p>



<p>They’re busy, similar products already exist, and there’s probably no real appetite for it. I think November will come and go without anything more than a fancy graphic released by Bethesda Game Studios to celebrate the milestone.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about potentially getting a Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98horizon-copy%E2%80%99-makes-several-changes-post-sony-lawsuit.1265883/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Post the copyright infringement lawsuit from Sony, Tencent and Polaris Quest has made several changes to the alleged Horizon copy’s Steam page. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Tencent revealed Light of Motiram last year, which bears a striking resemblance to Sony PlayStation’s popular series, Horizon. Last month, Sony Interactive Entertainment filed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-copying-the-horizon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit</a> against Tencent for alleged copyright and trademark infringement, citing similarities between their products. </p>



<h2 id="h-horizon-clone-s-steam-page-gets-new-description-key-art-and-more">Horizon Clone’s Steam Page Gets New Description, Key Art and More</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamePost</a>, Light of Motiram’s Steam page now features a revised description, a new promotional image, different and reduced screenshots, and a release window. </p>



<h4 id="h-new-description">New Description</h4>



<p>The old description spoke about several elements that were known in the Horizon universe, including “colossal machines” and “mechanimals”. The new description has removed these words and mentions of an advanced technology. Now, it mentions “overcoming the challenges of survival” and carving a place for yourself in this “unforgiving land”. </p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Old:</strong> “In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with mechanimals.“</p>



<p><strong>New:</strong> “Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land.“</p>
</blockquote>



<h4 id="h-key-art-changed">Key Art Changed</h4>



<p>The previous key art for the Light of Moitram featured a woman who resembled someone that players would know very well from the Horizon series, Aloy. The red-haired girl was seen looking over a world filled with creatures similar to those in the popular PlayStation series. Now, the woman has been replaced by two robotic creatures, one that looks like a penguin and the other like a dog. </p>



<h4 id="h-new-gameplay-screenshots">New Gameplay Screenshots</h4>



<p>Many of the screenshots that made Light of Motiram appear more like a Horizon clone have been removed. Some new screenshots have been added, which feature the game’s open world instead. All imagery of the robots that looked similar to the ones in PlayStation’s Horizon series was removed. </p>

<h4 id="h-release-window-added">Release Window Added</h4>



<p>Light of Motiram now has a release window, the Steam page states that the game is now scheduled to release in Q4 2027. </p>



<p>In the lawsuit, Sony has alleged that Tencent has created a “slavish clone” of Horizon with Light of Motiram, which copies elements such as gameplay, story themes, and artistic elements, among others. Sony also stated that Tencent had approached them to collaborate on a new Horizon game. </p>



<p>In other news, PlayStation’s Horizon franchise <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstations-horizon-franchise-has-sold-38-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 38 million copies</a>. What are your thoughts on the changes Tencent made to Light of Motiram?
