<p>The Call of Duty League’s first Minor is taking place as we speak, with every pro team coming together to compete for a $20,000 one-shot prize. In the opening round, the first losses were dealt, and as swiftly as they entered, Vegas Falcons, Miami Heretics, LAG M8, and Vancouver Surge were all eliminated from the running.</p>



<p>In a shocking finish, LAG M8 were reverse-swept by Minnesota Rokkr, suffering a huge blow that left LAG sitting on a donut for the season so far – not a single game won.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-expectations-tapered">Expectations Tapered</h2>



<p>LAG M8 has had a rough season thus far. The team, which is made up of three former world champion players and a talented newcomer, has failed to secure a single win against any other CDL squad. In most cases, the team has fallen just a few steps shy of landing a win, but that trend has continued into the Minor.</p>



<p>In the opening fixture for the CDL Major I, LAG M8 went 2 – 0 up after two close finishes, but Rokkr turned things around during the Control with a 3 – 0 result. From there, LAG imploded, getting steamrolled by Rokkr in the second Hardpoint and final S&amp;D round.</p>



<p>The team was understandably muted on social media following the loss:</p>











<p>Elsewhere, the Vegas Falcons were also eliminated from the tournament without winning a single map. It was a tall order, with the team facing off against OpTic Texas in the first round, and despite a valiant effort, the Vegas Falcons were roughly booted from the running.</p>



<p>Sadly, the Falcons boast one of the worst records in CDL history at this point, sitting on a win/loss record of 0 – 5 and a game-win percentage of just 14.2%. OpTic Texas is white hot right now, so you can’t really blame Vegas for the loss.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-round">The Next Round</h2>



<p>As we move into the next round, four enormous matches have been lined up:</p>



<ul>
<li>Royal Ravens vs. Cloud 9 NY</li>



<li>Boston Breach vs. OpTic Texas</li>



<li>LA Thieves vs. Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Toronto Ultra vs. Minnesota Rokkr</li>
</ul>



<p>The likes of the Ravens, Boston, LAT, and Ultra all earned a bye ahead of the tournament thanks to their performance in the first round of qualifiers. They’re the undoubted power players of the tournament thus far, with the Royal Ravens leading the pack on a perfect record with a 75% game-win record. </p>



<p>LAT and Ultra follow close behind with identical records of 4- 0 and a 70.5% win percentage.</p>



<p>The tournament is warming up, but it won’t last for long. On Sunday evening, the victor will be crowned and they’ll be $20,000 richer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-deliverance-before-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, bringing a deeply realistic open-world RPG experience to players everywhere. It’s one of the most highly anticipated games of 2025, featuring a widely branching and immersive story that might leave newcomers feeling confused about what’s going on.</p>



<p>With that being said, I’ve pieced together a guide to tackle the topic: ‘Do you need to play Kingdom Come Deliverance first?’ The first game came out in 2018, and the second game is a direct follow-on from that title.</p>



<p>But do you need to play Kingdom Come Deliverance before 2? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-a-sequel">Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 a Sequel?</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a direct sequel to the first game, which was released in 2018. The events of the second game start very soon after the ending of the first title, with the player assuming control of the same protagonist in roughly the same game world.</p>



<p>That means that you might be feeling wary about going into such an expansive story with no idea of what happened in the first title.</p>



<p>Is it worth playing Kingdom Come Deliverance before KCD2, though?</p>



<p>Not necessarily.</p>



<p>In the game’s opening sequences, you’re given a step-by-step introduction to the universe, and Warhorse Studios, the game’s developer, has done a wonderful job of letting you know what happened in the first game while making it seem like a natural walkthrough.</p>



<p>You’ll learn about – or have the option to <strong>choose </strong>– what happened in the first game. Many themes pull across from KCD into KCDII, but if you’re completely new to the series and want to get started with the second game, you won’t feel like a fish out of water.</p>



<p>By itself, KCDII is a perfectly enjoyable game that can be appreciated by anyone who hasn’t played the first title. There are many flashback sequences and conversations that help you piece together the main character’s story before Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-kingdom-come-deliverance-story-real">Is The Kingdom Come Deliverance Story Real?</h2>



<p>Most of the events that unfold in Kingdom Come Deliverance (and the sequel) are true-to-life. The historical figures are mostly real, and the setting is a like-for-like replica of real-world locations. The era has been represented perfectly by Warhorse Studios, which employed scores of experts to make sure everything was as accurate and authentic as possible.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s highly likely Henry of Skalitz <strong>wasn’t</strong> a real person. He’s a fictional rendition created to explore this wonderful world at a turbulent time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-have-photomode-answered.1079760/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-have-photomode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, and previews are running wild. It’s scoring high in the early impressions – including mine. This open-world RPG from Warhorse Studios is a direct continuation of the 2018 epic, both of which are steeped in history and authenticity.</p>



<p>In this snapshot game guide, I’m answering one key question: ‘Does Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 have photomode?’</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-there-photomode-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Is There Photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 does have photomode</strong>, but it’s a relatively unassuming, toned-down inclusion.</p>



<p>When you activate photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll be presented with a freecam that you can move around, but that’s about it. There are no options to zoom, tilt, or alter the field of view, and there is no function that allows you to apply filters, or to edit the image in any way.</p>



<p>It’s simple, but it’s <strong>there</strong>.</p>



<p>The first Kingdom Come game, released in 2018, did <strong>not </strong>have a photomode, so users found it awkward to capture shots of the game’s environment. If you played on PC, there was a command to remove the UI, which was the best you could get.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has gone one step ahead of that in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 by including a basic photomode.</p>



<p>That’s not to say that this is where it ends for the feature, though. The team may enhance the photomode once the game has been released in full on February 4, adding poses, facial expressions, a time of day scroller, and frames. It’s likely not high on the list of pre-release priorities, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-photomode-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How to Use Photomode in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</h2>



<p>If you’re playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 with a controller, simply click both L3 and R3 together to open up the photomode menu.</p>



<p>If you’re playing the game with a keyboard, you need to tap F1 to open the photomode screen, but that can, of course, be rebound at your will.</p>



<p>That’s all there is to it – owing to the simplicity of the feature, there’s not much else to say.</p>
