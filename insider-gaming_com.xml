<p>SEGA recently filed for a new trademark for Shadow the Hedgehog, sparking widespread speculation in the community. </p>



<p>Shadow the Hedgehog is one of the most popular characters from the franchise, and SEGA could be well on its way to using the character again in a new title. The last game featuring Shadow was Sonic x Shadow Generations, which sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-already-surpass-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1 million copies</a> on launch day. </p>



<h2 id="h-a-new-shadow-the-hedgehog-trademark-has-been-filed">A New Shadow the Hedgehog Trademark Has Been Filed</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://sonic-city.net/2025/10/08/sega-files-new-trademark-for-shadow-the-hedgehog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SonicCity</a>, SEGA filed a new Shadow the Hedgehog trademark in September, which players can see in Japan’s public trademark <a href="https://chizai-watch.com/t/2025112443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">repositories</a>. The trademark is for clothing, toys, education, and more. However, further down in the filing, players will find home video game consoles and more. There is no official confirmation of a new Shadow the Hedgehog game, but many players have begun speculating that it could be a remake. </p>



<p>While we wait for some official announcement to arrive from SEGA, players can check out the latest multiplayer racing title from the series, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. It is a new title that features races across land, sea, air, and space, where players can use Travel Rings to transport themselves into new dimensions. The game features 24 tracks, and players can warp to 15 CrossWorlds with Travel Rings. It also featured 45 unique original vehicles, 70 different gadgets, and&nbsp;23 iconic Sonic characters at launch, one of which is Shadow the Hedgehog. </p>



<p>In other news, earlier this year, SEGA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-accidentally-makes-sales-data-public-for-11-major-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accidentally</a> made sales data for 11 major games public.

<p>Battlefield 6’s destruction technology has received praise from all players, and it seems that dropping previous-gen consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, was key in reaching that standard. </p>



<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 have elaborated on the destruction tech used in the game several times ahead of release. The title utilizes tactical destruction, which brings “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-elaborate-on-tactical-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unparalleled levels of freedom</a>” to the game, and was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-took-huge-inspiration-from-bad-company-2s-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inspired</a> by <span>the&nbsp;intimate destruction</span> experience in Bad Company 2. Now, the developers have explained what it takes to achieve this level of destruction in BF6. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-magic-trick-behind-battlefield-6-s-destruction-is-dropping-previous-gen-consoles">The ‘Magic Trick’ Behind Battlefield 6’s Destruction is Dropping Previous-Gen Consoles</h2>



<p><span>During a new interview with Battlefield 6’s technical director, Christian Buhl,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-dev-says-its-destruction-tech-is-so-delicious-for-one-simple-reason-the-only-magic-trick-is-that-were-not-on-the-ps4-or-xbox-one-any-more/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a>&nbsp;asked what the secret sauce was behind the game’s destruction system.</span> Buhl revealed that “Maybe the only magic trick is that we’re not on the PS4 or Xbox One anymore.” This enabled developers to work with increased memory and CPU speed, which in turn improved overall performance. As the developers weren’t trying to optimize the “game to run on a PS4, for example.”</p>



<p>However, there was still a lot of work done towards Battlefield 6’s destruction after dropping previous-gen consoles. Buhl spoke about “testing destruction” and the different areas that need to be optimised. The technical director also talked about the Frostbite engine, which was built for Battlefield, and destruction, and “those pieces are core parts of the engine.” The developer concluded, stating,”&nbsp;I don’t think there was any magic bullet. It was just a lot of testing, a lot of iteration, a lot of work.”</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-and-multiplayer-has-the-same-destruction-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale and multiplayer</a> have the same destruction system. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-players-dont-give-a-damn-about-new-portal-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 12% of BF6 players</a> give a damn about the new Portal mode.
