<p>PlayStation surely wants a massive 2026 as the PS5 generation starts to wind down, and the key to the PS5 being a success is having another long list of incredible PlayStation games launching in 2025. Insider Gaming has picked out the biggest and best PlayStation games.</p>



<p>PS5’s exclusive games are becoming even fewer and farther between as we get scarily close to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS6</a> era. It’s not helped by the fact that the age-old ‘exclusive’ is dying as the world’s biggest gaming brands are intent on making the most money possible, and this requires a game to launch on all major platforms. Still, Sony has some bona fide PlayStation weapons up its luxurious 2026-tailored sleeves.</p>







<p>If you’re looking to fill your gaming calendar with the hottest exclusives and releases, this article has everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-ps5-exclusives-coming-in-2026">Biggest PS5 Exclusives Coming In 2026</h2>



<p>One entry on this list stands out as being a bit ‘sus,’ but for the most part, these are the biggest PS5 games coming out for PlayStation in 2026. Obviously, between Summer Game Fest, Sony State of Play showcases, and special announcements, we could always see more PS5 exclusives revealed throughout the year. Stay tuned for more.</p>



<h3 id="h-saros">Saros</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Housemarque</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s always a good day when Hosuemarque is working on a new game. It’s the company that literally never misses, and is responsible for legendary PlayStation games such as Super Stardust, Resogun, and 2021’s incredible Returnal. From Dead Nation to Alienation and Nex Machina, the developer only deals in premium, polished packages.</p>







<p>Saros is a spiritual successor to Returnal and looks like an evolution in every aspect. From the bright and beaming balls and bullets boomed at you by elusive foes in true bullet-hell fashion, to the incredible attention to detail in the visuals and sound design. It’s hard to see Saros being anything but a system-selling, Game of the Year contender come the end of 2026.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you thought Insomniac was going to hold back on Wolverine’s violence, then you can tuck your adamantium tail between your legs and go and find something a bit more casual. Wolverine is Logan in his most primal and animalistic form. Insomniac kept a cloak over him for quite a while after the initial reveal, but now we’ve seen that this beast has claws.</p>



<p>The combat-centric action that the studio has mastered with the Marvel’s Spider-Man series plays a part here. But expect a deeper, darker, and more disturbing array of moves for the massacre-making mutant. It’s destined for 2026 and will likely be Sony’s <em>big </em>exclusive of the year.</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>Team Ninja took a brief hiatus from Nioh to work on new IPs: Wo Long Fallen Dynasty and Rise of the Ronin. It also resurrected long-time fan favorite Ninja Gaiden, with the fourth mainline release in 2025. Now, it’s time for another dose of Soulslike samurai action with Nioh 3. </p>



<p>While FromSoftware rightfully gets the credit and acclaim for its Souls games, the Nioh games are incredibly deep, which is to be expected from the sick geniuses at Team Ninja. Nioh 3 is a slight outlier here as it’s technically releasing on PC as well as PS5, but not Xbox or Nintendo, so it can be given a pass.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-biggest-2025-ps5-games">Biggest 2025 PS5 Games</h2>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>This could easily be the shortest entry of any on this list. What else needs to be said about Grand Theft Auto 6? Depending on how you count Tetris, GTA 5 is the second or third best-selling game in history. GTA 6 is expected to go one better, and it’s probably the biggest and most important video game that will ever be made.</p>



<p>Who knows, it could be the final GTA game. Considering how long it takes Rockstar to make new games now, and with a Red Dead Redemption 3, or another new or revived IP hovering around, who knows how long it’ll be until a potential GTA 7—if ever.</p>



<p>This is <em>the </em>game of 2026…unless it’s delayed AGAIN.</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Capcom’s Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the franchise. You return to a bombed-out Raccoon City, following its devastation at the hands of a planned missile strike at the end of Resident Evil 3. Grace Ashcroft (daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft) is the unfortunate character in the hot seat this time around—although the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon Keneddy rumors</a> are growing.</p>



<p>You’ll be chased by another Tyrant-like monster, and there will be a big emphasis on running and survival. This should be music to the ears of you old-school Resident Evil fans. You can’t go wrong with a new Resi game, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-shown-exclusively-in-japan-reveals-new-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Requiem gameplay</a> shows that a real biohazard awaits you.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-007-first-light">007 First Light</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels weird to see IO Interactive’s name attached to something not Hitman-related. The Danish studio has been given the unenviable task of offering the world a new portrayal of James Bond and has a fully fledged license to thrill. The story focuses on Bond’s formative years as an agent, meaning we’re getting to see the youngest, most unpolished, and easily inexperienced version of the world’s most coveted and acclaimed secret agent.</p>



<p>Gameplay footage suggests that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-lights-combat-and-physicality-is-inspired-by-the-daniel-craig-era-of-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">007 First Light</a> won’t be a complete departure from Hitman, and there are clearly some nuances and stylish licks politely borrowed for good measure.</p>



<figure><p>

<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to 343 Industries</figcaption></figure>



<p>The day Forza Horizon 5 became available on PlayStation 5 was a very strange one; it felt like a noticeable shift in the industry. Gears of War: Reloaded plunged us further into the rabbit hole of incredulity, and now Halo is coming to PlayStation 5—the console wars are <em>officially </em>over.</p>



<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved marks the near-25-year franchise’s first appearance on a PlayStation console. It’s only the campaign, but for lifelong Sony fans (such as myself), this is a chance to start from the ground up. PS5 owners can see what the fuss is all about and see why Xbox dominated the shooter scene for years.</p>

<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-iv-black-flag-remake">Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has been reporting on the long-rumored Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake for years. While early AC games—such as Assassin’s Creed 2—get a lot of love, there’s something undeniably special (daresay perfect) about Black Flag. Ubisoft has done its best to conceal details and go as far as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatening to sue an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag actor over a Remake slip-up</a>.</p>



<p>As per our exclusive story, we believe the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is set to launch before March 31</a>. Once it happens (not if), then it will be one of the biggest games of 2025, and one you need to own on PS5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Player Count Doubts Debated as ARC Raiders Hits Huge Numbers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-arc-raiders-player-count-debate/</link>
            <guid>1395364</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There’s a new player-count-related debate spreading like wildfire throughout the gaming space, and it concerns the success of ARC Raiders compared to the relative failure of Battlefield 6. In recent days, fans of both titles have been actively engaging in a debate to determine why one is soaring while the other can’t seem to do anything right.</p>



<p>This stems from Steam player counts (where else?), which paint a telling tale. Two months after release, ARC Raiders has managed to retain 91% of its peak player count on Steam, while Battlefield 6 has witnessed an 85% <strong>plummeting drop</strong> in the numbers.</p>



<p>Where do you stand on the debate?</p>







<h2 id="h-steam-isn-t-the-ultimate-litmus-test-for-gaming-numbers">Steam Isn’t the Ultimate Litmus Test for Gaming Numbers</h2>



<p>Too many people are still reliant on Steam’s figures for the picture of health for a game, but extrapolation is king. It could be considered woefully unfair to use <strong>a single platform </strong>to determine the overall health of a game like Battlefield 6, given that on PC, that’s arguably not even the most popular launcher for the game.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter much, as the debate rages, and Steam data is all we have to go on when it comes to facts and figures.</p>



<p>In the most recent news, it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/12/31/arc-raiders-has-kept-91-of-its-playerbase-battlefield-6-has-lost-85/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> that drew attention to the numbers, pointing out that ARC Raiders has retained 91% of its player base after two months. On the other hand, Battlefield 6, which was released in proximity to Embark Studios’ new extraction shooter, has plummeted by more than 85%.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a fractured debate for many reasons.</p>



<p>First, the live-service model for ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 is quite different. The former operates on delivering new missions, progression paths, unlocks, boss characters, maps, and events, which represent much more <strong>meat </strong>than what Battlefield offers. EA’s new first-person shooter is focused more on new maps, modes, and battle pass bundles than anything else.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders, being an extraction shooter, has a ‘reset loop’ that ensures players can come back every few weeks and restart their playthrough, which isn’t a thing in Battlefield 6, a typical multiplayer shooter. There’s point two in the argument against this debate.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders also represents something new and exciting in the gaming space: a truly accessible extraction shooter. At the same time, Battlefield 6 is just a first-person shooter with a boots-on-the-ground military setting, and they’re a dime a dozen. Folks came, saw, enjoyed the game, and departed for greener pastures when things started going south.</p>



<p>That’s <strong>the third point</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The <strong>fourth point </strong>against the argument is that ARC Raiders has simply been doing things better where Battlefield 6 is failing. In recent weeks, some of the new maps, modes, and bundles released in the Battlefield 6 space have left players disappointed, and controversies have surfaced regarding gen-AI art that have gone unexplained by Electronic Arts.</p>



<p>It’s simple, really. While Battlefield has a peak of 747,440 on Steam, it’s mostly comprised of players edging with curiosity into a game that marked a potential resurgence for a failing franchise. They dipped their toes in the water, and many of them decided to ultimately move on.</p>



<p>Conversely, ARC Raiders operates on a concept that many hadn’t ever experienced before it dropped. They’ve tried it, liked what’s on offer, and more have decided to hang around. It also helps that you can invest in ARC Raiders for as little as $30, and everything after that point, bar cosmetics, is free.</p>



<p>So, it’s safe to say we can cap this debate and move on. It’s a non-starter, apples and oranges, chalk and cheese, and something barely worth addressing.</p>







<p>Do you think there’s a deeper theme to discuss here, or is it pointless comparing two drastically different games like this? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Shroud Predicts ARC Raiders Will Be ‘Bigger Than Fortnite’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-arc-raiders-fortnite-hot-take/</link>
            <guid>1395358</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a statement that some have dubbed a hot take, popular streamer and former esports pro, Shroud, has suggested that ARC Raiders is <strong>bigger </strong>than Fortnite. He suggested that, going forward, Embark Studios’ extraction shooter will be <strong>bigger than </strong>the likes of Fortnite, VALORANT, and Apex Legends, prompting many to doubt his knowledge of ball.</p>



<p>Shroud has found plenty of success streaming ARC Raiders since the game dropped on October 30, but this latest comment is a tricky one, and it has fans debating how serious the content creator was.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-arc-raiders-be-bigger-than-fortnite">Will ARC Raiders Be Bigger Than Fortnite?</h2>



<p>During <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/2006425120722792795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent stream</a>, Shroud plainly stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game is definitely the biggest game since Fortnite for sure. The only other game I can think of along the way is maybe like VALORANT and Apex. But I think this game is bigger than both those games and will be bigger as time goes on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was a hot take, and it has since been met with some ridicule, even from fans of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The extraction adventure title, which was released by Embark Studios on October 30, has proven to be one of the biggest hits of 2025. It’s one of the most popular extraction games ever made, and two months after release, it is effortlessly retaining enormous player counts across all platforms where other, similar games have faltered and fallen.</p>



<p>To say it’s bigger than Fortnite is a stretch, though. It’s no big secret that Fortnite is the most successful live-service shooter of all time, and the most popular battle royale title ever created. It has peaked at more than 40 million concurrent players, while ARC Raiders has managed a peak concurrent user count of 481,000 on Steam. </p>



<p>Embark Studios remains committed to expanding and evolving ARC Raiders and has already pushed out some engaging events and updates since the game dropped. Before ARC Raiders dropped, Embark Studios pledged <strong>years </strong>of support, and it’s easy to see that happening given what we already know about the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/harada-tekken-dead-veteran-dev-final-message/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Katsuhiro Harada has bid farewell to more than thirty years of working under the Bandai Namco banner, moving on from Tekken after decades of developing the series. In a new social media post, Harada ushered in 2026 by stressing that he’s ‘no longer a developer/creator of the TEKKEN series’.</p>



<p>At the start of December 2025, Harada and the Bandai Namco team shared the news that the legendary developer would be parting ways with the firm after 31 years.</p>







<h2 id="h-katsuhiro-harada-has-moved-on">Katsuhiro Harada Has Moved On</h2>



<p>In a new post on social media, Katsuhiro Harada shared the following message:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’m no longer a developer / creator of the TEKKEN series.</p><p>Harada_TEKKEN is completely dead.</p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/2006390358859809229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The iconic developer was quick to update his bio, writing, ‘Former Game Director and Chief Producer of action and fighting games.’</p>



<p>On December 8, Harada shared the revelation with fans worldwide that he would be stepping down from his tenured spot at Bandai Namco:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans shared their sentiments in the comments under Harada’s post. One drew comparisons to the series that Harada was pivotal in creating, saying, ‘Heihachi ‘died’ like 4 times. Kazuya came back from a volcano. We know how this works in the Tekken universe. See you in the next patch notes, boss.’</p>



<p>Others offered more simple, heartfelt messages: ‘We will always think of you, Harada-san, thank you for everything.’</p>



<p>Harada worked in production and direction roles on the Tekken series since Tekken 3 debuted in 1997, and was a driving force in the space ever since. He’s set to appear one last time in the Tekken space at some upcoming esports events, but then the world afterwards is his oyster.</p>

<p>I haven’t seen you since last year! It’s 2026, and it’s time to keep moving forward with stacks of NYT Connections hints, solutions, and tips. If you’ve burst into 2026 with a desire to keep your NYT Connections streak running, I’m here to help you achieve that resolution. Below, you’ll find the solutions for today’s puzzle.</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments below what your resolutions are for 2026 and how you plan to hold yourself to them!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #935:</p>



<ul>
<li>SHUCK</li>



<li>SCOTCH</li>



<li>HEAD</li>



<li>RAT</li>



<li>CURSE</li>



<li>SKIN</li>



<li>NUT</li>



<li>FLY</li>



<li>HOUND</li>



<li>FINGERS</li>



<li>SPELL</li>



<li>SHELL</li>



<li>CHARM</li>



<li>BUFF</li>



<li>PEEL</li>



<li>HEX</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about the small, concentrated forms of supernatural influence — the kind of mystical actions that show up in fairy tales, fantasy novels, or folklore.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Imagine you’re prepping food in a kitchen — or working with anything that has a natural outer layer</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are the words you attach to someone who is REALLY into a topic — the kind of person who knows every detail, every fact, every obscure bit of trivia.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Picture the word “butter” followed by another word to form a familiar phrase or compound.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 1:</p>
