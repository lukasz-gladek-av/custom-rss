<p>After hearing Take-Two CEO’s recent comments on supporting “legacy titles”, GTA Online may have a chance at survival even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two’s CEO, was recently asked why players should keep investing in GTA Online in 2025 when an improved and enhanced version could arrive with GTA 6. Zelnick didn’t mention GTA Online or an online version of GTA 6 specifically; however, his answer provides some hope to the massive community.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Zelnick stated that his statements are theoretic, as he can’t mention a particular project (GTA 6 Online) “when an announcement hasn’t been made.” However, he added that Take-Two is known for its support properties if the community is still involved with the games.</p><p>&nbsp;As an example, he explained that 2K released NBA 2K Online in China in 2012, and soon after, a new version called NBA 2K Online 2 was released in China in 2017. However, even after the latest version arrived, the company didn’t sunset the first online game, and they are both still available in the market. The CEO concluded, stating, “We’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>GTA Online is one of the most popular multiplayer games, bringing in over 150,000 players daily on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/271590/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam alone</a>. The online version of GTA 5 has been available for more than 10 years now, and players have gathered a considerable amount of wealth and assets in the game by investing a lot of time and sometimes a lot of real-world money. Take-Two and Rockstar have earned a lot through GTA Online, and with a community so big, there might be a chance that the game survives even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the GTA 6 publisher is ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-publisher-is-not-worried-about-the-game-influencing-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not worried</a>’ about the game influencing violence in the real world. Also, Take-Two’s CEO recently spoke about GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not coming to PC at launch</a>.
