<p>Call of Duty: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> is bringing a plethora of new content to the game, from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-maelstorm-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapons</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-details-on-new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-maps-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a> to a huge overhaul for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> and an exciting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a>.</p>



<p>On top of all that, Zombies fans will be excited to hear that a new map is also on the way – Citadelle des Morts. For those eager to find out more about the new BO6 Zombies map, here’s everything you need to know, including its release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-new-bo6-zombies-map-have-a-release-date">Does the new BO6 Zombies map have a release date?</h2>



<p>Citadelle des Morts will arrive in the <strong>mid-season update for Black Ops 6 Season 1</strong>. As the new season arrived on November 14, and seasons tend to last around 8 weeks, we expect the Season 1 Reloaded update to arrive on <strong>Thursday, December 12, 2024</strong>.</p>



<p>Take this with a pinch of salt, as this is just speculation and not an official release date. Once Treyarch confirm the date for the mid-season update, we’ll be sure to let you know exactly when the new Zombies map will be arriving.</p>

<h2 id="h-citadelle-des-morts-map-details">Citadelle des Morts map details</h2>



<p>Citadelle des Morts (Citadel of the Dead) is a <strong>round-based Black Ops 6 Zombies map that’s located in Europe</strong>, specifically the Principality of Avalon. It’s an <strong>abandoned medieval castle</strong> that is host to ghoulish horrors and hidden secrets. We don’t know many details, but from the teaser image, we expect the map to be fairly big.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, players will take control of the BO6 Zombies crew, <strong>Weaver, Maya, Carver, and Grey, directly after the events of Terminus</strong>.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time players have fought waves of the undead in a castle, as Black Ops 3 brought Der Eisendrache. Hopefully, Citadelle des Morts can live up to the setting, as Der Eisendrache is one of the most beloved maps of all time.</p>



<p>The new map also arrives alongside a new Perk, Wonder Weapon, Gobblegums, Augments, and enemy types.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that it’s testing a new matchmaking system as a major quality-of-life improvement in Escape from Tarkov – and EFT: Arena. This testing is taking place on the ETS server, which is an early-access test environment restricted to a specific user base.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been made clear when these changes will hit the wider audience, but they sound solid at first blush.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-much-needed-changes">Much Needed Changes</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s matchmaking system has long been a thorn in the side of gamers worldwide. For instance, around an Escape from Tarkov wipe, which is the bi-annual global reset event, queues to get into a match can be dragged out monumentally, often hitting ten, fifteen, or more minutes to raid.</p>



<p>Many users have dealt with random disconnects and glitches during the matchmaking process over the years. One issue that surfaced this year was a problem with ‘Scav raids’, with players hitting never-ending loading screens during the matchmaking process.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1856691016960454986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on social media</a>, Battlestate Games revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The main goal of the new system is to reduce the raid search time in Escape from Tarkov and matchmaking in EFT:Arena, as well as to reduce the number of errors and disconnects during matchmaking.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Beyond matchmaking, another concern for users is the amount of time it takes to load the map and loot pools and to connect with other players before finally entering a raid. This is one of the reasons why so many people moved to Escape from Tarkov’s PvE ecosystem, as loading into a PvE raid can take as little as 20 or 30 seconds all-in.</p>

<p>Since 2022, PlayStation fans have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of a Horizon multiplayer game – and LEGO Horizon isn’t about to fill that gap anytime soon. It was claimed in September that Horizon’s multiplayer project is the next Guerrilla Games deliverable, <strong>not </strong>a ‘Horizon 3’.</p>



<p>Per a recent job listing, it looks as though the team will be preparing to release this live-service Horizon title in at least some form next year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-the-wild">Into the Wild</h2>



<p>It has been at least two years since the first reports of ‘Horizon Online’ surfaced. Since then, almost nothing has been divulged by either Guerrilla Games or insiders close to the project. In March 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer-game-has-not-been-canceled-by-playstation/">Jason Schreier suggested</a> that the game hadn’t been shelved amid a restructuring effort at PlayStation, and in September, he outright claimed that Guerrilla’s next game is this multiplayer title.</p>



<p>In January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer-leak/">leaks revealed</a> alpha footage from a multiplayer-based Horizon title, along with a little key concept art. This content revealed a unique direction for the game, which many claimed ‘looked like Fortnite’.</p>



<p>Eagle-eyed users recently <a href="https://x.com/Jorraptor/status/1856757437006827810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dug up a job listing</a> for a ‘Release QA Intern’ at Guerrilla Games.</p>



<p>In this listing, it’s mentioned that the successful candidate will be working on an ‘online project’ and that they’ll need to be available in ‘the first half of 2025’. In the listing’s description, it’s stated that they’ll help ‘to ensure the game is prepared for launch’.</p>



<p>If we assume that the QA period takes a fair bit of time to complete, we could be looking at a release window – or at least an early access window – of H2 2025. We almost know that this is a live-service multiplayer title, and it’s not uncommon that they’re released in an ‘unfinished’ or beta state.</p>

<p>Embracer Group continues the restructuring efforts that have unravelled over the last year or two, divesting Easybrain to Miniclip for a consideration of $1.2 billion. Per a press release, the ‘transaction has a strong strategic and financial rationale’.</p>



<p>Easybrain has been developing mobile apps for almost a decade, and since 2016, the developer has seen more than 1.5 billion downloads across its portfolio. Miniclip, on the other hand, is a mobile publisher founded more than 20 years ago.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-changes">Making Changes</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-divests-easybrain-to-miniclip-for-a-consideration-of-usd-1-2-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> published today by Embracer Group, it was revealed that the firm is divesting Easybrain to Miniclip for a tidy sum of £$1.2 billion.</p>



<p>In a statement, Lars Wingefors, the CEO of Embracer, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>This transaction transforms Embracer’s financial position and puts us in a stronger position to drive value. Easybrain has been an important part of the Embracer family for over three years, contributing to strong value creation during this time. As Easybrain’s market is transforming, Miniclip is the right strategic buyer to enable the company to stay at the forefront of the ad-driven mobile game industry.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Saad Choudri, the CEO of Miniclip, echoed that sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We are delighted to welcome Easybrain to Miniclip. We have long admired Easybrain’s ability to build loyal and engaged puzzle game communities. The addition of evergreen franchises like Sudoku.com further reinforces our vision to engage a broad audience of players.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Easybrain’s CEO spoke of the future of the brand and starting a new chapter that will allow them to ‘deliver even more enriching experiences for players’. It’s expected that the transaction will close in the early months of 2025, with Miniclip securing the Easybrain label on a cash and debt-free basis.</p>
