<p>Fans waiting for crossplay in Rematch will have to wait a bit longer. With Rematch patch 3 set to release on Thursday, September 4, developer Sloclap has announced that they had to delay its launch in order to investigate a new issue that appeared.</p>



<p>The third major patch for Rematch was originally planned for September 3 but was delayed to September 4 at the last minute to fix two bugs that were found during final testing. With the new date set, another major issue was found causing yet another delay.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-rematch-patch-3-be-released">When Will Rematch Patch 3 Be Released?</h2>



<p>In a message on the game’s official Discord, Sloclap said that during final testing, <strong>“a significant number of testers were stuck in matchmaking, unable to cancel or restart the process”</strong> when crossplay was enabled in Rematch. This issue, they said, has led to the decision to delay the update again due to crossplay being <strong>“at the core of this update”</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>“We know this is very disappointing news and we share your frustration,” </strong>Sloclap said. <strong>“Our recent track record with patch stability hasn’t been up to standards, and we don’t want to release a patch that will introduce new issues.”</strong></p>



<p>They continued: <strong>“Our focus right now is on resolving this matchmaking issue as quickly as possible. At the same time, we’re actively working on improving our production pipeline so that future updates are delivered with the quality and reliability you deserve – and more importantly, we will refrain from announcing release dates until we are absolutely certain that we can deliver the updates on time.”</strong></p>



<p>As of publishing, no new date has been set for Rematch Patch 3. When that is announced, it will be posted here on Insider Gaming.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally up and running and is available to buy and download from the PlayStation Store!</p>



<p>The release of Hollow Knight: Silksong is a glorious day, but not if you’re a PS5 gamer. Whereas every other available platform got the launch of Silksong bang on the projected start time, PlayStation 5 users have been left out in the cold, wondering why they can’t download Silksong.</p>



<p>I’m a PS5 player, and I can’t download <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. I waited as patiently as all of you for the launch date and time. Once the hour struck, I dove onto the PS Store to buy and download the game—that’s a lie, I was on and tried <em>before </em>this, but still. PlayStation 5 players have been unable to pre-purchase and download Silksong, ready for its inevitable launch.</p>



<p>This didn’t seem too bad, as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-file-sizes-playstation-xbox-switch-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong file sizes</a> suggest it’s not the heftiest game to download. However, the community can’t download Silksong on PS5, so let’s dive into the latest.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-can-t-i-buy-hollow-knight-silksong">Why Can’t I Buy Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We just want to play. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Neither PlayStation nor Team Cherry has explained why PS5 is the only storefront where you can’t purchase Hollow Knight: Silksong right now, and the best guess is due to an error on the store or the server being backed up with customers.</strong></p>



<p>Let me be clear, I’m doing some digging and trying to find out why this is happening as we speak. There hasn’t been a single word from PlayStation or the developer about any miscommunication regarding Silksong’s launch on PS5. However, the fact remains that no one can buy and download Silksong on PS5.</p>



<p>There’s also a chance this could be due to the influx of traffic with hundreds of thousands of players presumably trying to buy the anticipated indie game—myself included.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-hollow-knight-silksong-will-work-on-ps5">Do We Know When Hollow Knight: Silksong Will Work On PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>There seems to be no workaround for Hollow Knight: Silksong not working on PS5<strong> at the moment, </strong>and it’s up in the air as to when it will be available to buy on PS5.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Consider this guide a live page you should keep refreshing,</strong> as I’m monitoring the situation intensely. You can take my word for it, as I also want to download Silksong. So keep checking back. Fingers crossed we get an update from <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a> or PlayStation, or the store page suddenly works.</p>
