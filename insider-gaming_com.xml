<p>In true Prince of Persia fashion, The Rogue Prince of Persia is coming out on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S…today! The roguelike platformer, crafted by the team behind Dead Cells’ DLC, Evil Empire, is now available for fans to play. Even more so, Xbox Game Pass subscribers can get the game at no additional cost.</p>



<p>The Prince of Persia series has had a storied history in the gaming scene. From the original 1989 PC version to 2003’s The Sands of Time, the Prince has been around for quite a while. As fans await the remake of The Sands of Time, two new titles, 2023’s The Lost Prince and the then-early-access The Rogue Prince of Persia, have delighted players. Now, more people than ever can experience the title on all platforms (outside of Switch and Switch 2).</p>

<p>The launch trailer, available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdJJbvwrAsI">above</a>, showcases some fun gameplay and its surprise shadow drop release. As mentioned before, The Rogue Prince of Persia is available now for purchase on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S. The Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 version won’t be available until later this year, with no official date given as of writing. The game costs $29.99 on PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S and $24.99 on PC. </p>



<p>In the style of Dead Cells and Hades, The Rogue Prince of Persia is a roguelike that, when you die, you respawn at the beginning. However, each run is different, and new discoveries, like skills and perks, can be added to your Prince. Its 2D artstyle and colorful sceneries feel quite reminiscent of the originals, which longtime fans will appreciate. The game was well-received by players when it hit Early Access last year. If you haven’t played it yet, you now have a few more reasons to, thanks to the shadow drop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Unknown Worlds, the studio behind the Subnautica franchise, has filed a lawsuit against three of its former leaders, accusing them of abandoning the company, misappropriating confidential data, and scheming to rush Subnautica 2 to market in order to secure a massive payout.</p>



<p>The suit, which was <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/904055347/Unknown-Worlds-Entertainment-v-Cleveland-McGuire-and-Gill-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=tUP1182XR5apSqla4qJM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filed on August 15</a>, targets studio co-founders <strong>Charlie Cleveland</strong> and <strong>Adam “Max” McGuire</strong>, along with former CEO <strong>Ted Gill</strong>, all of whom were fired on July 1, 2025. According to the complaint, the trio <strong>“largely abandoned”</strong> their duties as Subnautica 2’s creative and technical leads while simultaneously downloading tens of thousands of company files in the days before their termination.</p>



<p>The dispute traces back to Krafton’s 2021 acquisition of Unknown Worlds for <strong>$500 million</strong>, with an additional <strong>$250 million earnout</strong> tied to the successful development and release of Subnautica 2. Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill, described at the time as essential to the franchise’s future, stood to collect roughly 90% of that earnout.</p>



<p>Instead of staying engaged, Unknown Worlds claims Cleveland shifted to filmmaking, McGuire focused on his passion project Moonbreaker, and Gill allowed the studio to drift without oversight. Development of Subnautica 2 slipped years behind schedule, with Krafton reviews describing the 2025 builds as “unready” and lacking core gameplay.</p>



<p>By 2025, with the earnout deadline approaching, the lawsuit says that the three executives pressed Krafton to release Subnautica 2 in an unfinished state, despite internal and external feedback that the game could damage the franchise. When Krafton refused, they allegedly threatened to <strong>self-publish the game</strong> to capture revenue for the earnout window.</p>



<p>Unknown Worlds also accuses the trio of <strong>taking company secrets on their way out the door</strong>. Between the start of June and July 1, 2025, McGuire allegedly downloaded nearly 100,000 files, Cleveland about 72,000, and Gill exported his entire company email account. The studio says the three refused to return their devices or confirm what information they retained, and even threatened to delete all of the files entirely.</p>



<p>Unknown Worlds is seeking <strong>injunctions, the return of confidential data, and monetary damages</strong> for the delays, brand harm, and breach of duty it says the defendants caused. It also wants to prevent any further use or disclosure of its files.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill—through Fortis Advisors, which represents former shareholders—have filed their own suit against Krafton, seeking to be reinstated and to force payment of the earnout. That case is headed for an expedited trial in November.</p>



<p>Fan reaction to the firings has largely sided with the company. On Reddit, one user summed up the prevailing mood: “This is defending the game, not the execs. Because those three were literally not involved in it in any way.”</p>



<p>In a lawsuit filed on August 15, Unknown Worlds is suing co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, along with former CEO Ted Gill for “abandoning” their roles at the studio after the acquisition by Krafton.</p>



<p>This lawsuit is in addition to the others <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-doubles-down-former-subnautica-2-executives-abandoned-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involving Krafton</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-subnautica-2-leadership-suing-krafton-after-firing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the former leadership</a>. As of publishing, none of the accused parties (McGuire, Cleveland, or Gill) have publicly responded to the lawsuit.</p>
