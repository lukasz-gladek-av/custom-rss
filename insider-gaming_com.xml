<p>Triumphant Light is the second-ever mini-set in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Every card is new, each one is hotter than a Charmander’s tail, and secret missions and rewards await if you can collect specific ones.</p>



<p>Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket consistently ushers new sets into the mobile title. We’ve had a healthy mix of main sets and mini-sets, each one trying to outdo the last. The meta keeps changing, features keep being added—hello <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ranked-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-period-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Battles</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-trade-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a>—and Pokémon&nbsp;Pocket keeps growing.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-officially-announced-ranked-battles-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a> triumphantly landed in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket on February 28. It has an extensive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-triumphant-light-card-list-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">card list</a> to tick off, but it also has many secret missions and rewards.</p>

<p>There are four secret missions in total to complete. Each Triumphant Light secret mission requires you to collect certain cards from the mini-set. Many of them are Full Arts and Rares, meaning it could take time to collect every single one.</p>



<p>You might be able to trade to get the harder-to-obtain cards, but until then, you need to hope luck is on your side.</p>

<p>Do you think Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket needs to give us different ways to earn the rarest cards? Or is it better being a complete lottery about what you can pull from packs? Let us know if you have any ideas.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-1-3-million-concurrent-players-on-steam-in-12-hours.1121844/</guid>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has already hit 1.3 million concurrent players on Steam in just 12 hours after its release.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game is currently in the number one seller spot, despite having a ‘Mixed’ review rating from 9000+ reviews.</p>



<p>The concurrent player player count currently places Monster Hunter Wilds in seventh place, with sixth and fifth place (Dota 2 and Lost Ark) only within an additional 30,000 players. </p>



<p>Traditionally, Friday game releases usually see a bigger concurrent growth number on the weekend, so it’s currently unclear on where the game will finish with its player count.</p>



<p>As mentioned, the games release hasn’t been without its problems though, with many players complain of poor performance issues and a lack of opimisation.</p>



<p>“This game is absolutely amazing – but has the worst optimisation I’ve ever seen,” said one Steam user.</p>



<p>He continued, “I understand that new games are becoming more demanding and people are expected to upgrade, but this is absurd. I’m aware this isn’t the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point.”</p>



<p>Another user said, “How does a game manage to run perfectly fine in the Open Beta AND I receive an Excellent rating score on the benchmark but the actual product that costs ACTUAL MONEY runs like absolute sludge. I have legit never encountered a game that wasn’t at worst playable. I have never seen a game run this poorly while still looking this bad.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> has since <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1895397927557980292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to the complaints on X (formerly Twitter), with suggestions on how to improve performance. </p>



<p>“Hunters! If you’re experiencing any initial issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam, please try updating your graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode, and then readjust your settings,” they said.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has released an all-new update in Escape from Tarkov. The core of this update is that it <strong>finally </strong>gets rid of snowy weather and brings back a spring atmosphere. It’s that time of year when the ice underfoot has thawed and the trees are in bloom, which is great news for anyone tired of snowblindness or crunchy footsteps.</p>



<p>The team at BSG has also made several major updates to the game’s AI engine and mechanics, which have been an instant hit with players worldwide.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about this relatively major Escape from Tarkov update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-springtime-has-arrived">Springtime Has Arrived</h2>



<p>Now that the world is no longer white in Escape from Tarkov, you can hide in bushes and wear dark clothing once again. The removal of snow and the arrival of spring weather is great, even if it means it’ll be raining a little more in your raids.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov fans around the world are rejoicing at some of the newest AI-based changes in the game, though.</p>



<p>For this popular extraction shooter, the AI intelligence, mechanics, and tactics are all sticking points that can often mess with the community to no end. We’ve seen ‘aimbot’ enemies, bizarre health pool changes, dimwitted patrol paths, and audio issues all tied to AI NPCs over the years.</p>



<p>This latest Tarkov patch makes a <strong>phenomenal number </strong>of changes to the game’s AI.</p>



<p>For instance:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enemy detection has been overhauled and is dependent on distance, view angle, weather, stance, and aggravation levels. If you’re prone in fog and not in the enemy’s line of sight, you’ll be detected incredibly slowly compared to if you were running in the open</li>



<li>Vegetation now impacts the enemy’s vision – except Zryachiy, Birdeye, and the BTR because they’re just on another level. If you hide in a bush, <strong>you’re hidden</strong>.</li>



<li>Enemies will now relay information about an enemy <strong>only to those close to them</strong>. If the bot isn’t in a group, it can only shout to a maximum of 50 meters.</li>



<li>Only Raiders, Rogues, and Bosses will use suppressive fire mechanics. If a common AI enemy can’t see you, they won’t shoot you, which means no more wallbang deaths.</li>



<li>When an AI enemy is hit, it’ll suffer a considerable accuracy drop.</li>



<li>If a common AI enemy detects you at long range, they won’t immediately engage, but instead, they’ll deploy a ‘waiting tactic’ until you fire first.</li>
</ul>



<p>The general spawn rates, positions, and pathing systems for AI enemies have all been addressed. This means that one player won’t be able to trigger too many bot spawns, which will come in handy in PvE and getting swarmed by endless streams of Scavs.</p>



<p>Finally, AI enemies won’t move closely together or occupy the same areas of cover, which means less colliding and piling, which should also reduce stress on resources.</p>



<p>The full list of AI changes can be <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/334?utm_source=x_post&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=winter_drops_24-25&amp;utm_term=link_1&amp;utm_content=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found on escapefromtarkov.com</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, Battlestate Games has patched up some of the most irritating issues in Escape from Tarkov with this latest patch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Headshots are no longer deafening</li>



<li>The ‘arm/thorax damage issue’ has been resolved</li>



<li>Bots can no longer pass through closed doors</li>



<li>Error 228 has now been fixed</li>



<li>Transitions in PvE will no longer take you into a PvP game – thanks, BSG</li>
</ul>
