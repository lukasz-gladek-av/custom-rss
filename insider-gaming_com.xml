<p>The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have suffered a massive leak, with datamined information revealing details about the Gen 10 games, seemingly called Pokémon Wind and Pokémon Waves. </p>



<p>With just a few days left for the release of Pokémon Legends Z-A, the upcoming game has already suffered from a massive leak, with its Pokedex surfacing online in its entirety. However, the leaks haven’t stopped there, as the new datamined information mentions the Gen 10 Pokémon Game, Wind and Waves. Players should know that the leaked documents are from 2021, so everything is subject to change. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-and-waves-will-infinity-as-the-theme">Pokémon Wind and Waves Will ‘Infinity’ As the Theme</h2>



<p>Thanks to a reputable source, CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977756558495731892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), several new details from the Pokémon Leak are surfacing online, including details about the Gen 10 title. The first thing is the name, which will be Pokémon Wind and Pokémon Waves. The upcoming game’s theme is Infinity and will be directed by Shigeru Ohmori, who is known for his work on games like Sun and Moon, Sword and Shield, and the Latest Scarlet and Violet. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="de" dir="ltr"><p>Pokémon Gen 10: </p><p>Pokémon Wind and Pokémon Waves<br>Theme: Infinity<br>Directed by Shigeru Ohmori</p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977756558495731892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The datamined information also states that the game’s original setting is Indonesia and Southeast Asia, contrary to previous information that pointed to Greece. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Longevity shouldn’t be an issue in Battlefield 6 as the FPS has hundreds of challenges. From guns to general combat, there’s so much for you to do and keep on top of. It’s made slightly difficult when a few Battlefield 6 challenges don’t track, though, so let’s find out everything we know about why this is happening.</p>



<p>You’re not short of content and things to do in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-reasons-you-should-buy-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>. Between its Mastery Camos and Challenges, you’ve got stuff to keep you going until Battlefield 9 (slight hyperbole) at this point. At launch, BF 6 faced Challenge issues with the community complaining about certain objectives not tracking.</p>



<p>If this applies to you, we’ve got the latest from EA on the cause and potential fixes.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-challenges-not-tracking-issues-explained">Battlefield 6 Challenges Not Tracking Issues, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So many spinning plates mean some must fall. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>EA’s Community Manager has said: “Battlefield 6 is a live game, and some issues are expected at release.” This is the explanation for any challenges incorrectly tracking in Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not the deepest explanation ever, unfortunately, but it makes sense. You can do alpha and beta tests, as well as general open betas, all you want, but the fact is that mistakes can slip through the cracks with a game of this size, offering as much content as it does. </p>



<p>Expect them to be fixed when the devs get a chance.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-battlefield-6-challenges-are-not-tracking">Which Battlefield 6 Challenges Are Not Tracking?</h2>



<p><strong>Resupplying teammates and using Supply Crates are some examples of Challenges not tracking and working as they should in BF 6.</strong></p>



<p>As of October 13, these are the challenges currently not tracking properly in Battlefield 6, according to <a href="https://forums.ea.com/blog/battlefield-game-info-hub-en/info-battlefield-6---known-issues-1-0-1-0/12728456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA’s Community Manager</a> EA_Leeuw:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Challenges: “Resupply teammates with the Supply Pouch” is not tracking progress.</li>



<li>Challenges: The Progress bar for “Repair Vehicles” does not update when repairs are made.</li>



<li>Challenges: “Use Vehicle Supply Crate” does not progress even after completing the action.</li>



<li>Challenges: The Weapon Expert Unit Challenge is not tracking correctly. The description says you must “Get a kill with each type of weapon in a match,” but the actual requirement is to get 15 longshot kills in a single match.</li>



<li>Assignments: Helicopters are incorrectly counted as Ground Vehicles in the “Land Vehicle Expert“ assignment.</li>



<li>Assignments: Helicopters are not counted properly in Vehicle Challenge 1.”</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s every chance that as Challenges are fixed, more become broken: It’s the glorious roundabout of online FPS gaming. We’ve seen it for years with Call of Duty, and we fear that you Battlefield 6 players won’t have everything your own way. So keep your eyes peeled for more updates and patches for the Challenges not tracking.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-battlefield-6-challenges-be-fixed">When Will Battlefield 6 Challenges Be Fixed?</h2>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 Challenges will be updated and fixed in “future updates.”</strong></p>



<p>This information also comes from EA’s Community Manager. The only thing we can do is wait for more updates and patch notes. They will tell us what is being fixed, and checking the <a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Comms</a> page is another way to see what the devs are working on.</p>



<p>Get down into the comments below and let us know if you’ve found any other Challenges that aren’t tracking, unrelated to the ones mentioned above. Also, head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a> if there are more Battlefield 6 problems causing you a tank-sized headache.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light%E2%80%99s-combat-and-physicality-is-inspired-by-the-daniel-craig-era-of-movies.1323568/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light’s developers have said that the game’s combat and physicality are inspired by Daniel Craig’s era of Bond movies. </p>



<p>It seems that Daniel Craig and his Bond movies have been a major inspiration for IO Interative’s upcoming origin story, 007 First Light. The developers had previously stated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-used-daniel-craigs-likeness-for-first-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actor’s head was placed on Agent 47’s body</a> for the first demo. Now, the developers have revealed that the game’s other aspects are inspired by the movies this actor appeared in. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-draws-inspiration-from-casino-royale-s-style-of-movement">007 First Light Draws Inspiration from Casino Royale’s Style of Movement</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.edge-magazine-subscription.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Edge Magazine</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/007-first-light-studio-didnt-want-to-create-this-superman-from-day-one-with-its-fresh-faced-james-bond-its-not-very-relatable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Creative Director Hakan Abrak spoke about drawing inspiration from Daniel Craig’s era for 007 First Light. Abrak first stated that it isn’t “one-to-one exactly,” as the dev team is trying to make the game “feel original.” However, the team found it essential that the character is constantly “moving, dynamic and acrobatic, almost like the parkour at the start of Casino Royale.”</p>



<p>While talking about drawing inspiration from these movies, Abrak also spoke about not creating “this superman from day one” where the character is already “on top of the world, and he’s hardened and seasoned, and he’s had his heartbreaks and now he’s hidden behind this iron armor.” The developers feel it won’t be “interesting” to players and provided an example of 1962’s Dr. No, which features Bond already as this super agent, which is “not very relatable”. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gemma-chan-announced-for-007-first-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemma Chan has been confirmed</a> among the cast for 007 First Light. Additionally, the developers have insisted that the upcoming title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isnt-a-hitman-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t a Hitman “reskin</a>“. What are your thoughts on 007 First Light’s combat and physicality drawing inspiration from Daniel Craig’s era of movies?
