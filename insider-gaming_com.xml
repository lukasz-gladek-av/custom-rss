<p>The Valley of Memory’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-mirage-valley-of-memory-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy List</a> was revealed a few days ago, providing a complete list of trophies and achievements players can target. Now, Title Update 1.1.0 is going live for AC Mirage, introducing the new free DLC and a substantial update. The update’s size according to platforms is as follows: PlayStation 5 – 22.6GB, PlayStation 4 – 16.6GB, Xbox Series X/S – 32.39GB, Xbox One – 10.11GB, PC – 28.15GB. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-assassin-s-creed-mirage-title-update-1-1-0-valley-of-mirage-dlc">What’s New in Assassin’s Creed Mirage Title Update 1.1.0 Valley of Mirage DLC</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-free-content">New Free Content</h3>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage Valley of Memory DLC comes as a free update for all players, taking them on a new adventure with Basim. Basim has heard something about his long-lost father still being alive, and chasing these rumours, he has reached the new region, AlUla, “a land of secrets, ancient ruins, and vibrant oases. Players will have to complete the “Head of the Snake” mission to access this content. New game players have the option to skip ahead in the story directly through the main menu. </p>



<p>The region of AlUla will feature hours of content that players can explore, including new and returning world activities, family-friendly side activities, world events, work contracts, and brand-new additions. Some of these additions have been named, including Stolen Goods and Oud Melodies, the first mission asks you to stal maps from robbers and the second has players collect musical scenes through parkour sequences. </p>



<h3 id="h-gameplay-improvements">Gameplay Improvements</h3>



<p>As mentioned above, players will observe some significant gameplay improvements in Assassin’s Creed Mirage after title update 1.1.0. Firstly, the free jump option has been included, allowing players to jump manually by pressing a button. Side and back ejects can now be performed even when Basim has no clear area to land on or has a handhold. The “Free” mode can be toggled on/off, and “Safe” mode can be used if you prefer safe and sound landings for Basim. </p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Mirage Valley of Memory DLC update will also introduce replayable missions, known as Animus Sequences. These missions will present new challenges that can be completed for rewards, including Animus Mods. These mods are essential auto-refills for your tools and resources, which can only be used in this mode or New Game+. </p>



<p>Two new difficulties have also been added: Hardened Assassin, which comes between Assassin (Normal) and Master Assassin (Hard). Ultra Hardened is the new hardest difficulty, and there is also a new Custom Difficulty preset for a more tailored experience. The DLC also adds a tier 3 tool upgrade, with Throwing Knives becoming explosive, Smoke Bomb becoming corrosive and disolving dead enemies, Blow Darts piercing through heavily armored enemies, Noiskmakes putting enemies to sleep in the impact zone, and Traps can make enemies attack their fellow guards. </p>



<p>There are additional improvements, additions, which you can check out in the full patch notes below: </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hypixel Studios is back, and they have brought an old friend along with it. On Monday, founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced that they had reacquired the rights to sandbox game Hytale from Riot Games.</p>



<p>The news comes roughly five months since it was announced that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being shut down</a>.</p>







<p><strong>“We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired Hytale from Riot Games,”</strong> <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Collins-Laflamme said</a>. <strong>“While it didn’t make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what’s best for players, and that’s for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.”</strong></p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme said that the studio has hired <strong>“more than 30 developers who know this game inside and out, with additional returns in the coming days.”</strong></p>



<p>He says that the team is going to go back to the original version of what Hytale was supposed to be. It was added that the studio is fully independent and committed to funding Hytale <strong>“for the next 10 years”.</strong></p>







<p>As far as what’s next, an Early Access release and pricing will be announced <strong>“in the coming days”.</strong> It’ll be available first on Windows with a Mac and Linux release possible and other platforms later on. Regarding content, the Early Access version of Hytale will include a Creative Mode, Exploration Mode, and Modding capabilities. What won’t be available are minigames and an Adventure Mode. Both of those will come later on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Arrowhead Games Studio’s CEO recently commented on a possible Switch 2 port for Helldivers 2, stating ‘We’ll see’. </p>



<p>It is no secret that Helldivers 2’s port to Xbox has <span>significantly helped the game, with the developers revealing that the new platform has&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank">increased</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sales and engagement</a> for the PC and PS5 versions of the game. So that sets a precedent for Helldivers 2 to be released on another platform, but the developers haven’t officially confirmed anything yet. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-on-switch-2-could-be-a-possibility">Helldivers 2 on Switch 2 Could be a Possibility?  </h2>



<p>The comments on Helldivers 2 coming to Switch 2 came through the latest episode of the Game Business Show on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyVTlQR__ZU&amp;t=558s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (via <a href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-switch-2-port-ceo-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Rant</a>), where Christopher Dring interviewed Shams Jorjani, Arrowhead CEO. During this interview, Dring jokingly spoke about waiting for a ‘Switch 2 version’ for the game, to which Jorjan responded, stating, “We’ll see, we’ll see. That’s again, above my pay grade by a couple of tiers.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We already know that the Xbox port worked wonders for the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-sold-more-on-xbox-than-playstation-in-the-first-six-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling more on the new platform</a> than PlayStation in the first six days. However, will Helldivers 2 be able to find a similar kind of success on Switch 2, that is not yet known. At the same time, the developers are currently hard at work to optimise the game, working not only to address several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-comment-on-installation-size-and-load-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performance issues</a> but also to decrease the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-comment-on-installation-size-and-load-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">install size and improve load times</a>. </p>
