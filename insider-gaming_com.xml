<p>Activision has announced that moving forward, it will no longer have back-to-back releases of Call of Duty’s subfranchises like Modern Warfare and Black Ops.</p>



<p>The news came as part of a new update from Activision, which acknowledged that the franchise has recently failed to meet some players’ expectations. The admission comes following what has been described to Insider Gaming from sources as a “rough launch” for Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>“We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward,” the blog post read.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-call-of-duty-stop-being-annual">Will Call of Duty Stop Being Annual?</h2>



<p>Despite Activision’s admission and realisation that Call of Duty has failed to meet some players’ expectations, they have pretty much said that annual releases will continue moving forward, which will provide fans with an “absolutely unique experience each and every year.”</p>



<p>It’s said that those plans will not be shared today but will be “when the time is right.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> concludes with the following message,</p>



<p>“To&nbsp;be clear, the future of Call of Duty is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams. We have been building the next era of Call of Duty, and it will deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward. We look forward to welcoming you in, listening to you, and moving forward together.&nbsp;“</p>



<p>What do you think of Activision’s admission? Do you think Call of Duty should stop doing annual releases altogether? </p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Current Plans for Divinity: Original Sin 3, Larian Says]]></title>

            <guid>1377748</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Divinity series has been the talk of the town lately after it was uncovered that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mysterious statue for The Game Awards</a> could be related to the 23-year-old franchise. One such hope from fans is that the announcement, should it be true, is that Divinity: Original Sin 3 is on the way.</p>



<p>If you’re one of those fans hoping for that, you may want to sit down.</p>







<p>While answering fan questions on social media, Laraian Studio’s head of publishing Michael Douse poured some sand on that fire—yes, sand is good to put out small fires. </p>



<p>In a response to <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one fan asking</a>, “Divinity Original Sin 3 when???”, Douse said there are no current plans for the game. However, he didn’t say there weren’t any plans for Divinity as a whole.</p>



<p><strong>“There aren’t currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game, but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will,”</strong> he said. </p>







<p>While the new announcement may not be for Divinity: Original Sin 3, there remains plenty of smoke that Divinity will have a major presence at Thursday’s The Game Awards. Maybe even a new game titled something completely different, but in the series.</p>



<p>One rumor also <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">making the rounds</a> is that Larian is set to announce Divinity: Original Sin 2 – Definitive Edition for PlayStation 5 and, possibly, Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Whether that’s the only announcement or something even bigger is planned, it feels like fans of Larian Studios will have something to talk about soon enough. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Alien Star In Talks to Star in Prime Video’s Tomb Raider]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-prime-video-amazon-sigourney-weaver-report/</link>
            <guid>1377745</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, Sigourney Weaver may be in talks to star in Prime Video’s Tomb Raider series. The Oscar-nominated actress, if confirmed, would join Game of Thrones’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-tomb-raider-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner</a>, who’s set to play protagonist Lara Croft.</p>



<p>Starting in 1996, the Tomb Raider series has become a gaming icon, spawning multiple games, a reboot, and much more. It’s had three live-action films starring Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander. While a sequel to the 2018 film was cancelled, a new live-action adaptation of the iconic Tomb Raider series was announced by Prime Video <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-live-action-show-coming-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year</a>. With Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge as creator, writer, and executive producer, the show has set its sights on finally bringing the series to Hollywood successfully. Fortunately, if the latest casting is any indication, it could reach those lofty heights.</p>







<h2 id="h-sigourney-weaver-in-talks-for-prime-video-s-tomb-raider-series-starring-sophie-turner">Sigourney Weaver In Talks for Prime Video’s Tomb Raider Series Starring Sophie Turner</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/tomb-raider-tv-series-sigourney-weaver-1236636519/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a report from Deadline</a>, actress <strong>Sigourney Weaver</strong>, known for her work in Alien and Avatar, <strong>is in talks to star in Prime Video’s Tomb Raider</strong>. It’s not known if the Oscar-nominated actress will take the undisclosed role, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. If true, she would join Sophie Turner and All-American: Homecoming’s Martin Bobb-Semple, who was added last week.</p>



<p>If confirmed, Sigourney Weaver would be a major steal for the series. The actress has starred in multiple blockbusters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alien-isolation-2-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aliens</a>, Ghostbusters, Galaxy Quest, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-season-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar</a>. She has been nominated for three Academy Awards, two for Best Actress (Aliens and Gorillas in the Mist) and one for Best Supporting Actress (Working Girl). Furthermore, she is appearing in Avatar: Fire and Ash and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu in major roles.</p>



<p>Given how popular the Tomb Raider franchise is (and the already stacked cast and crew), it’s not a surprise to see Sigourney come on board. The future of the series is an exciting one, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fans will find out more</a> on December 11th at The Game Awards. Filming for the show is starting in February 2026, so more information may be revealed prior to starting. Until then, it’s certainly a good time to be a Tomb Raider fan.</p>
