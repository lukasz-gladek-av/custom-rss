<p>Sandfall Interactive has revealed how much it cost to develop and release Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In a new profile piece for the New York Times, the developer of one of 2025’s biggest hits talked about the game’s development, the approach to creating the game, and more.</p>



<p>As part of that talk, Sandfall claims that Clair Obscur was built for less than $10 million.</p>







<p>In order to achieve that goal, the studio chose to not have the game be a true open-world title. They say that they decided to use other classic role-playing game (RPG) design choices such as having battles take place in specific “arenas” rather than out in the overworld and having the map be a “miniature version of the explorable realm”. </p>



<p>Since its launch in April, Clair Obscur has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. It’s also been up for numerous awards, including Game of the Year from shows like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/golden-joystick-awards-2025-all-award-winners/">Golden Joystick Awards</a>—which it won—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>. </p>







<p>What do you think of the budget for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 being less than $10 million? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down below and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Rockstar Games is busy readying everyone for the arrival of GTA 6, but continues to work on GTA Online in the background, going as far as dropping a new gameplay feature to enrich the raucous online game further.</p>



<p>Each day feels longer than the last in the wait for Grand Theft Auto 6. Rockstar Games is busy developing and polishing one of the most anticipated games of all time. This doesn’t mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-players-can-get-free-500000-through-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a> is kicked to the curb, though, and if you look carefully enough, you might see the game has WORKED OUT something new for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-online-adds-gyms-amp-working-out">GTA Online Adds Gyms &amp; Working Out</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strong move. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ability to work out and visit gyms in GTA Online has been discovered ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-reveal-trailer-is-already-two-years-old/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>‘s full launch.</p>







<p>GTA Online has continued to receive updates and improvements over the years, but this feels like quite a meaningful update so far into the game’s lifecycle.</p>



<p>As shown by <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown"></a><a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTA 6 Countdown</a>, you can work on your Bench Press, stretch out on some yoga mats, do some curls, and other gym-related curricular activities. Always remember: Swole is the goal!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>YouTube creator NikTek has gone as far as speculating that this could be Rockstar Games testing out the incorporation of gym features for GTA 6. It’s not like this would be the first time we’ve ever seen these mechanics in a GTA game, as San Andreas famously used life-sim features such as hunger, weight gain, strength, and other biological attributes to influence your gameplay.<a href="https://x.com/NikTek"></a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What do you think Rockstar’s intentions with this addition are? Is it simply a fun new feature for GTA Online, or is it obvious foreshadowing for GTA 6?

<p>The PC Ram pricing problem continues to get worse for consumers. What was once one of the cheaper parts when building a custom PC, buying RAM has gotten to the point where it’s more expensive than buying even a brand-new graphics card for some.</p>



<p>A few weeks back, Insider Gaming reported on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-prices-have-soared-by-up-to-250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fact that RAM prices have risen</a> by up to 250%. Well, fast forward to mid-December, and those prices now look “affordable”. There have been increases in PC RAM prices by, on average, another 25% since November 26. Some have even gone up by another 50% or more if you were looking at picking up a 64GB pack. </p>







<p>That means modern day graphics cards like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series and AMD Radeon RX 9000 series are becoming cheaper in comparison. Need specific examples? A new ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5070 is available for $549.99 while a ASRock Radeon RX 9070 XT can be had for $599.99. Even an RTX 5070 Ti, which costs an average of $749.99, is cheaper than some 64GB packs, like the Corsair Vengeance. </p>



<p>Below you’ll find a comparison of prices from November 1 to November 26 to December 11. All of them have continued to rise, with reports suggesting that it’s not going to slow down. It’s even gotten to the point that traditional budget-friendly brands are being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/micron-shutting-down-its-consumer-crucial-ram-and-ssd-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completely shuttered</a> in order to focus on the needs of the big AI companies that are causing the problems. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>PC Memory</th><th>Nov. 1 Price</th><th>Nov. 26 Price</th><th>Dec. 11 Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>16GB Kingston Fury</td><td>$62.99</td><td>$149.99</td><td>$241.02</td></tr><tr><td>32GB T-Force</td><td>$96.99</td><td>$339.99</td><td>$429.99</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$97.99</td><td>$269.99</td><td>$349.99</td></tr><tr><td>32GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$104.99</td><td>$279.99</td><td>$439.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB Corsair Vengeance</td><td>$239.99</td><td>$839.99</td><td>$899.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Trident Z5 NEO</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$629.99</td><td>$719.99</td></tr><tr><td>64GB G.Skill Flare X5</td><td>$204.99</td><td>$569.99</td><td>$669.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out to multiple manufacturers to discuss what consumers can do and if they are going to do anything to make sure they still have options when building a PC. As of publishing, however, no company has given answers.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is a beloved game after being on the market for a little more than six weeks. It’s an all-new extraction adventure title from Embark Studios, and it’s proving to be a true disruptor to the genre. Recently, NVIDIA kickstarted a promotional event that allows certain players to unlock an exclusive ARC Raiders backpack, and it has proven to be a little too popular.</p>



<p>If you try to redeem the ARC Raiders NVIDIA backpack right now, you’ll be met with network errors and server issues.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-nvidia-arc-raiders-backpack-is-sought-after">The NVIDIA ARC Raiders Backpack is Sought-After</h2>



<p>There are a few caveats to claiming the ARC Raiders NVIDIA backpack, the most critical of which is that you need to be a PC gamer with an NVIDIA GPU. This is because it needs to link to the NVIDIA App and the GeForce Rewards program.</p>



<p>We’ve got a full guide explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/get-free-arc-raiders-nvidia-backpack/">how to get the ARC Raiders backpack</a> from NVIDIA.</p>



<p>The listing went live at 6 AM PT, and what must be thousands of ARC Raiders fans were waiting to receive it, so much so that the NVIDIA site stopped working:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is a testament to the power of ARC Raiders, which is one of the most popular and successful games of 2025 after just a few weeks on the market.</p>



<p>To be honest, customization in ARC Raiders could be a little better. It’s limited right now, and that’s fine, because it’s a live-service game and Embark Studios is adding more content as they flesh out the holistic offering. But that’s why deals like this NVIDIA ARC Raiders backpack are so special – because people want <strong>more</strong> ways to outfit their character.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you managed to secure one of the NVIDIA backpacks in ARC Raiders.</p>
