<p>For any fan of gaming, a great title becomes even better when it’s subjected to fantastic post-launch content – and that tends to come in the form of top-shelf DLC. This could be anything from a few missions to an entire sub-campaign some ten or fifteen hours in length. In this list, we’re taking a look at the best DLCs ever released, deciding once and for all what the greatest game expansions are. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-dlcs-ever">Best DLCs Ever</h2>



<p>Here’s our representation of the best DLCs ever released in gaming – let us know in the comments if you agree with this breakdown. </p>



<h3 id="h-1-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring">1. Shadow of the Erdtree (Elden Ring)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was such a phenomenal release that it became a candidate for <strong>Game of the Year</strong> at 2024’s edition of The Game Awards. This stellar piece of DLC brought millions of players back into the fold, all ready to fight notoriously difficult bosses in a brand-new section of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-blood-and-wine-the-witcher-3">2. Blood and Wine (The Witcher 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Blood and Wine was effectively a ‘send-off’ for The Witcher 3, taking place long after the main story was completed (chronologically) and serving as a ‘retirement’ of sorts for our hero, Geralt of Rivia. There’s a fourth-wall break at the end of the expansion that is worthy of a chef’s kiss – one of the best DLCs ever, indeed.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-point-lookout-fallout-3">3. Point Lookout (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Point Lookout is one of the creepiest Fallout DLCs ever, plunging players into a foggy, mutant-infested backwoods county and leaving them to fend for themselves. It was one of the largest expansions Bethesda Game Studios had released at the time, boasting a wide, open map and hours of extra content for the best Fallout game ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-left-behind-last-of-us">4. Left Behind (Last of Us)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left Behind was a poignant, emotional expansion to an already heart-wrenching game. It told the backstory of Ellie and explored the journey she took before becoming bitten and discovering she was immune to the Cordyceps infection in The Last of Us. It was a perfect prequel that offered a few solid hours of gameplay.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-burial-at-sea-bioshock-infinite">5. Burial at Sea (BioShock Infinite)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>BioShock Infinite was released back in 2012 and at the time of writing is the last game in the series. It was a phenomenal and beautiful game that was perfectly expanded upon in Burial at Sea, a two-part DLC that spans BioShock’s in-game ‘multiverse’. It takes players back to Rapture, the instantly recognisable location from BioShock and BioShock 2.</p>







<h3 id="h-6-dragonborn-skyrim">6. Dragonborn (Skyrim)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dragonborn was a massive piece of DLC that took players from the province of Skyrim to Solstheim to face off against an ancient dragon priest with a thirst for power. In this expansion, players travel through the likes of Apocrypha, learn new and powerful abilities, and explore a sizeable and dangerous map. </p>



<h3 id="h-7-nuka-world-fallout-4">7. Nuka-World (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s another Fallout DLC, but honestly, Bethesda Game Studios did such a phenomenal job expanding these games that it deserves another spot on this list of the best DLCs ever. At the end of Fallout 4’s lifecycle, BGS released Nuka-World, an expansion that serves as a perfect endgame, ultimately giving players one last opportunity to make a grand choice to impact their ‘status’ in the game for the final time. </p>







<h3 id="h-8-freedom-cry-aciv-black-flag">8. Freedom Cry (ACIV: Black Flag)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Freedom Cry ultimately arrived on the scene as a standalone expansion, telling the story of Adéwalé, the strong and memorable supporting character from 2013’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. It’s one of the most impressive stories in Assassin’s Creed history, with players assuming the role of this former slave turned pirate turned assassin in an adventure that lasts a good few hours. </p>



<h3 id="h-9-phantom-liberty-cyberpunk-2077">9. Phantom Liberty (Cyberpunk 2077)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Phantom Liberty quite literally changed the face of Cyberpunk 2077, going hand-in-hand with an update so large it was dubbed ‘Cyberpunk 2.0’. Phantom Liberty was a star-studded expansion that introduced an entirely new area of Night City and took players through a story so emotional that it broke hearts worldwide when it wrapped up.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-undead-nightmare-red-dead-redemption">10. Undead Nightmare (Red Dead Redemption)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Undead Nightmare is legendary, and these days, fans of the Red Dead Redemption franchise are wondering why Rockstar Games hasn’t released a new version for RDR2. Released in 2010, Undead Nightmare saw players revisit John Marston, gunslinger extraordinaire, as he attempts to survive a brutal and terrifying zombie outbreak. It was a brilliant expansion that boasted its unique multiplayer modes. </p>

<p>Starfield is a great game, but sometimes, using one of the title’s best commands or cheats can make it a more enjoyable experience. If you’re playing on PC, you can lean on <strong>hundreds </strong>of commands and codes to alter your game – sometimes with hilarious results., In this guide, I’m breaking down the best Starfield cheats and commands, just for you.</p>



<p>I’ll also teach you a trick that’ll allow you to unlock Starfield cheats on Xbox.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-starfield-cheats">How to Use Starfield Cheats</h2>



<p>Call them commands, call them cheats, it doesn’t matter – they’re basically the same thing. On PC, it’s seriously easy to use Starfield commands, and it all begins with tapping the key that sits alongside the ‘1’ on the top left of your keyboard, just beneath the ESC key. It might be a tilde or it could be a ‘grave’ symbol, but whatever it is, it’ll produce the same result.</p>



<p>Once you’ve hit the right key, your on-screen console will pop up and you’ll be able to just type in the Starfield cheats you want to enable, hitting enter and applying them at will. For most of these Starfield commands, you’ll be able to type the same thing into the console again to disable them but bear in mind that any save with cheats applied will be locked out of achievements. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-starfield-commands">Best Starfield Commands</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are hundreds of Starfield cheats, but we’ve broken down what we think are the best ones to use.</p>



<ul>
<li>tgm (Enable godmode)</li>



<li>tdetect (NPCs won’t detect you)</li>



<li>tcl (Noclip – fly through walls)</li>



<li>kah (Kill all hostiles in the area)</li>



<li>resurrect (Resurrect targeted NPC)</li>



<li>unlock (Unlock targeted door or container)</li>



<li>showmenu sleepwaitmenu (Sleep or wait without having to have a bed or seat)</li>



<li>saq (Trigger all quests in the menu – can crash your game)</li>



<li>caq (Complete all quests – will almost certainly crash your game)</li>



<li>SetTestPlanetAndBiome (Creates a ‘test planet’ and biome for testing)</li>



<li>additem (Item ID) (Value) (Add items using a code and value – see below)</li>



<li>player.addperk (perk ID) (Add perks at will)</li>



<li>psb (Unlock all available ‘powers’)</li>



<li>tfc (Toggle free-cam to fly around the map with a camera)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-starfield-commands-item-codes">Starfield Commands – Item Codes</h3>



<p>Here are the best Starfield item codes you’ll need.</p>



<ul>
<li>Credits: 0000000F</li>



<li>Digipicks (Lockpicks): 0000000A</li>



<li>Ship Parts (Repair Ships): 0003FB19</li>



<li>Med Pack: 0000ABF9</li>



<li>Trauma Pack: 0029A847</li>



<li>Regulator (Pistol): 0002CB5F</li>



<li>Coachman (Shotgun): 0026D96B</li>



<li>Magpulse (Rifle): 23606</li>



<li>MagSniper (Sniper): 0002EB45</li>



<li>Sidestar (Pistol): 0026D95D</li>



<li>Old Earth Hunting Rifle (Sniper): 0021BBCD</li>



<li>Peacemaker Spacesuit: 0013F97D</li>



<li>Reactive Experimental Nishina Helmet: 65926</li>



<li>.27 Ammo: 002B559C</li>



<li>Caseless Shotgun Ammo: 002B4AFB</li>



<li>6.5mm Ammo: 002B5590</li>



<li>7.77mm Ammo: 0004AD3E</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-starfield-cheats-on-xbox">How to Use Starfield Cheats on Xbox</h2>



<p>If you want to use Starfield cheats and commands on Xbox, you’ll need to have a PC – that’s the caveat at play. As Starfield is ‘Play Anywhere’, you can access your saves across the two different platforms. That means you can open Starfield on PC, enable the cheats, then boot up your save on Xbox, and the commands and cheats will still be applied. </p>



<p>Again, this will still disable achievements and can result in a corrupted save or crashed game. </p>

<p>PlayStation Plus is about to get a little thinner for Extra and Premium subscribers. As first spotted by <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-to-lose-11-game-in-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TwitstedVoxel</a> and confirmed by Insider Gaming, 11 games will be leaving the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog in January.</p>



<p>Of the bigger names leaving the service is Resident Evil 2 Remake, Life is Strange, and Life is Strange: Before The Storm. You can check out the full list of games leaving below.</p>
