<p>Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters DLC will release next week, in March 2026. </p>



<p>Team Ninja’s latest mainline entry to the Ninja Gaiden franchise was released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-world-record-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in October 2025</a> and has been faring quite well since release. Now, the developers have finally provided an update on how they plan to expand the experience with a brand-new DLC for the game. </p>

<figure></figure>



<p>A new post by Team Ninja on <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/2026688643667214432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) confirms the release date of the new The Two Masters DLC for Ninja Gaiden 4, and it arrives on March 4, 2026. The new DLC will add three new chapters, weapons, enemies, and the Abyssal Road challenge mode. Learn more about the new additions below. </p>



<p>The story expansion for Ninja Gaiden 4 will see Yakumo and Ryu’s battle against fiends continue, as the two characters battle against even deadlier enemies, challenging bosses, and new trials. The new weapons will also help expand Yakumo and Ryu’s combat styles. Yakumo will receive the “Solitaire” scythe, which is great for crowd control, and Ryu’s will get “Jakotsumon” serpent gauntlets, which are useful for fast, close-quarters combat.</p>



<p>Abyssal Road in the Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters DLC is an endurance-style mode where players face 100 unique combat encounters. These encounters include enemies from both the base game and the DLC, and introduce the new Special Blood Essence and Frenzied enemy mechanics, which dynamically alter battle conditions.</p>



<p>The DLC will also arrive with “a wide range of quality-of-life improvements, balance adjustments, and bug fixes, including combat responsiveness improvements, new weapon set customization options, and fixes across multiple chapters to ensure a smoother experience throughout the campaign.” Players with Deluxe Edition or Deluxe upgrade will get the DLC for free, and others can buy it for $14.99 on March 4. </p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Hexe’s creative director will be leaving Ubisoft, with the new Head of Content taking his place. </p>



<p>Vantage Studio recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassin-creed-franchise-announces-new-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new leadership</a> for the Assassin’s Creed franchise, with a trio tasked with taking the brand forward. The new roles included Head of the Assassin’s Creed Brand, Head of Content, and Head of Production Excellence, with the Head of Content serving as the new creative director on Hexe. </p>







<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-hexe-development-will-continue-with-new-creative-director">Assassin’s Creed Hexe Development Will Continue With New Creative Director </h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-hexe-director-clint-hocking-has-left-ubisoft-as-part-of-franchise-upheaval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> report, a spokesperson revealed that Assassin’s Creed Hexe’s creative director, Clint Hocking, will be leaving Ubisoft. The spokesperson also revealed that development on the title will continue “with a seasoned team” and the experience will be “something distinctive within the Assassin’s Creed franchise.” More information will be shared by the studio “in the future.”</p>



<p>The report states that there is a new creative director for Assassin’s Creed Hexe: Jean Guesdon, the new Head of Content for the franchise. Guesdon is an experienced creative director, having served in that role on both Assassin’s Creed: Origins and Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. </p>



<p>Most recently, we were informed that Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-hires-veteran-writer-christopher-grilli/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hired its lead scriptwriter</a>, who has worked on the scripts for Origins, Valhalla, and Mirage. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what is known about the game</a> is that it will be more like an old-school Assassin’s Creed game, with you playing as a female protagonist named Elsa, set in Central Europe during the 16th-century Holy Roman Empire. </p>
