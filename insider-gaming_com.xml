<p>Black Ops 7 is fighting to stay relevant as the worldwide reveal approaches. On August 19, during the Opening Night Live showcase, Activision’s studios will unveil Black Ops 7 beyond what they’ve already shown, hopefully contending for their slice of the FPS pie and wrangling attention away from Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>In a series of new leaks that have emerged on social media, prominent Call of Duty insider TheGhostofHope has revealed a slew of information about the upcoming shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-maps-are-coming-back-in-black-ops-7">What Maps Are Coming Back in Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p>According to TheGhostofHope, Black Ops 7 will launch with three remastered maps pulled from 2012’s Black Ops II:</p>



<ul>
<li>Raid</li>



<li>Express</li>



<li>Hijacked</li>
</ul>



<p>The post containing the remastered maps tidbit came after a claim that Specialist abilities will return for Black Ops 7. This mechanic hasn’t been seen since Black Ops 4, and it simply allows players to pick from characters or classes that have a unique ability. As GhostofHope puts it, this could be ‘active camo, grapple hook, and more.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Thanks to the Black Ops 7 title reveal at the Xbox Game Showcase in June, we already knew that active camo is a thing in this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>GhostofHope went on to explain that Black Ops 7’s larger-than-life multiplayer mode, which will be akin to the recent outings of ‘Ground War’ is apparently ‘<strong>trash</strong>‘. They also mentioned that a wingsuit appears in this mode, given that it will unfold over much larger maps than those seen in traditional multiplayer playlists.</p>



<p>What do you think of these latest Black Ops 7 leaks? Are you excited about remastered maps and perhaps want more? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta returns tomorrow for another fun-filled weekend of destructive action, and fans are <strong>excited</strong>. The hiatus between the first and second weekend of the open beta was to allow Electronic Arts to make a few tweaks, and in a new blog post, the team revealed some of those adjustments.</p>



<p>Most importantly, players will be able to lean on a ‘Custom Search’ feature with the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 playlist. It’s not exactly a server browser, but it’s one step closer.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-battlefield-6-beta-get-a-server-browser">Will The Battlefield 6 Beta Get a Server Browser?</h2>



<p>We won’t see a server browser appear during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, but we are getting Custom Search.</p>



<p>This new feature was unveiled by Electronic Arts in a new blog post, and it promises to change how you search for matches. With Custom Search, you can select specific maps and modes that you want to play, such as Conquest on Siege of Ciaro, and the matchmaking algorithm will throw you into that very match (if it’s available).</p>



<p>You’ll be able to use Custom Search across Open Weapon mode playlists during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Week 2 window, giving you the ultimate freedom to explore.</p>



<p>The inclusion of a server browser mechanic in Battlefield 6 is one of the most requested deliverables from the community, and it hasn’t gone unnoticed by Electronic Arts’ teams. Recently, DICE was asking users on social media <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-server-browser-dice-asks-what-important/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>why </strong>a server browser is so important</a> to them.</p>

<p>An insider has provided players with details about the Resident Evil Requiem story, including the revelation that Grace’s mother is the woman monster. </p>



<p>The insider, Dusk Golem, has been on a roll lately, constantly providing players with details on everything Resident Evil. Recently, they revealed that Resident Evil Requiem gameplay details, which feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-last-of-us-combat-and-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Last of Us’ combat and vehicles</a>. Now, the same insider has provided players with story details for RE9. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-is-the-last-numbered-game">Resident Evil Requiem is the Last Numbered Game</h2>



<p>AestheticGamer, also known as Dusk Golem, has posted a series of posts on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955389794416201746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) regarding Resident Evil Requiem’s story. They first stated that Capcom will make Resident Evil Requiem the last numbered game, RE9 will not only be a conclusion chapter but also a new beginning for Resident Evil. Moreover, it will be the end of the timeline and the conclusion of “everything to do with Umbrella, Raccoon City, its legacy &amp; long history”. This move will enable them to implement significant changes to the franchise. </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem will also serve as the conclusion to everything that began with RE1, RE2, and RE0 (if players choose to include this game). The series will now introduce new characters, new types of horror stories, “without being tied down by the series history.” The team has faced several restrictions over the years, including tying all game elements to Umbrella, Raccoon City, and other locations. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>(1/4) Here is how it's been conveyed to me, &amp; I've been saying this for 4-5 years now actually, but I was updated on this as recent as a couple months ago.</p><p>Resident Evil 9 they plan to make the last numbered RE game. RE9 is a conclusion chapter, as well as new beginnings for RE. <a href="https://t.co/Bnbayi6Lvn">https://t.co/Bnbayi6Lvn</a></p></div>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955389794416201746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In the next series of <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955477988864299267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweets</a>, Dusk Golem revealed what he knows about Resident Evil Requiem’s plot. They recognize all the characters from the first trailer, which features the stalker monster, the hooded figure, and shadowy figures. They are also aware of the game’s framing device, the playable characters, and their roles in the game’s story, but not where their stories lead. The leaker also knows about the upcoming game’s central virus/infection, why they need Grace’s blood, and how everything ties to Umbrella. </p>



<h2 id="h-grace-s-mother-alyssa-is-the-giant-monster">Grace’s Mother, Alyssa, is the Giant Monster </h2>



<p>One significant detail about Resident Evil Requiem’s story that Dusk Golem <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955484464915812717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> is that the giant monster woman is, in fact, Grace’s mother, Alyssa. The leaker states that many will figure this detail out with the Gamescom reveal and preview embargo. Dusk Golem adds that this isn’t a spoiler, as Grace figures out who the monster is shortly after meeting them the first time. Grace is an FBI Technical Analyst and can recognise their own mother. However, the situation initially makes her reluctant to believe it, but she quickly comes to accept it. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-isn-t-a-pure-horror-game">Resident Evil Requiem Isn’t a ‘Pure Horror Game’ </h2>



<p>When asked about Capcom’s recent comments that stated Leon “is a bad match for horror”, the insider <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955646403105243178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a>, noting it’s a “good thing” that “Resident Evil Requiem isn’t a pure horror game”. Golem added that the SGF reveal, the game’s press release, and other details have shown that Resident Evil Requiem will be a mix of horror and “high-stakes cinematic action.”</p>



<p>Regardless, all details mentioned above do not come from an official source, so readers should treat them with caution. </p>



<p>In other news, the next Resident Evil remakes are expected to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrive in 2027/2028</a>. Also, Resident Evil Requiem will receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new gameplay</a> at Gamescom Opening Night Live.
