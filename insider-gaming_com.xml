<p>Deck Nine Games, the developers of Life is Stange: Double Exposure as well as other Life is Strange games, have announced that it is laying off more staff. It’s the second time this year Deck Nine has held layoffs.</p>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/DeckNineGames/status/1865138496601575468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> late Friday afternoon, CEO Mark Lyons said he was “sad to share” the latest developments happening at the Colorado-based studio.</p>







<p>“Today, we are sad to share the news that we must say goodbye to some of our talented team members,” he said. “This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing. We are extremely grateful to every individual who has dedicated their hard work, passion and commitment to making transformative entertainment with us.”</p>



<p>He continued: “To those of you leaving the studio due to these changes, thank you for sharing your talents with us. We are proud of what we were able to accomplish together and we are committed to supporting you in this transition in any way we can. To the community, we ask for your support and understanding during this difficult time.”</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a>&nbsp;lost across 175+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000.

<p>Nadia Amine, a streamer with a fairly bad reputation, was booted from a Delta Force ‘streamer showdown’ following an investigation into some allegations made against her. </p>



<p>On social media, Team Jade announced that Nadia would be one of many streamers invited to take part in a special event. When users started mentioning her ‘history’ with cheats – most notably in Call of Duty: Warzone – Team Jade said it would ‘investigate further’…</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-booted">Booted</h2>



<p>Team Jade ultimately removed Nadia from the Delta Force streamer event. The team scrubbed her from the line-up of content creators without so much as a single word on social media. This came after Team Jade posted a reply to the allegations of past cheating:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to our community for bringing this matter to our attnetion – we are now investigating further.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1865148372459647135/photo/2">Jake Lucky on Twitter</a> for the receipts</em></p>



<p>Team Jade has since deleted that post – but nothing can truly disappear from the internet, right?</p>



<p>By way of a response, Nadia launched into a rant against Team Jade, and she too came with her own receipts on the post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These guys are so unprofessional. They made a tweet about investigating me, their talent, becuase people believe everything they see and spread lies about me. They deleted their tweet, I asked for a public apology, they told me to wait and are checking with the publisher.</p>



<p>I told them I’m going to go public with me leaving, and then they told me again to wait so they can ‘coordinate with their team’. But then, they go public with me not being a talent anymore first, which then makes me look guilty.</p>



<p>After they are the ones who told me to hold off on going public. What kind of f***ing business is this?!!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nadia has admittedly flip-flopped on the cheating bit for the longest time. She rose to notoriety on Call of Duty: Warzone while riding that wave, and even went as far as to make tongue-in-cheek references to being a cheater on social media and streams.</p>



<p>Ultimately, nothing has been definitively proven, even if sleuth gamers have taken to TikTok and other video-sharing platforms to reveal frame-by-frame playbacks of Nadia’s clips.</p>
