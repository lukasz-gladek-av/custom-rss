<p>Snaking has been a huge issue in the Call of Duty League for a good year or two. It’s a mechanic that’s so easily abused, and for many of today’s competitors, it’s a muscle memory or reflex action that can leave them berated by their peers. During the CDL Minor I tournament that’s unfolding right now, C9’s ‘Sib’ blatantly snaked, and other pro players called that action out.</p>



<p>On social media, LAT’s Ghosty revealed he’d started a vote for Cloud 9 NY to be <strong>blacklisted </strong>from pro scrims for one week because of Sib’s snaking on Hacienda during a round of Hardpoint.</p>

<h2 id="h-uphold-the-law">Uphold the Law</h2>



<p>To give credit to Sib, he’s not trying to avoid the branding he’s received from Ghosty on social media. By way of a response to what Ghosty said, Sib held his hands up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nah yeah im hearing you. No justifying me on the lambo</p>



<p>But like Daniel how long is this “precedent” really lasting?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He’s referring to this moment:</p>

<p>Bizarrely, Sib requested that Ghosty keeps ‘the same energy all year’, explaining that players don’t care about GAs ‘come tournament time’, and that by COD Champs, ‘nobody says anything’. Ghosty came back with an authoritative tone:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Can’t disagree about champs with it being the last event but I just want to set precedent for this since we always let shit slide in prior seasons- We’re discussing it in chat but it WILL NOT be one week as that’s not similar to last years punishments</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Other pro players like Royal Ravens’ Gwinn came onto the thread. He asked jokingly if Ghosty is ‘officially GA commish’, which could be a spot that sorely needs filling.</p>



<p>TJHaly, who was a ‘victim’ of Sib’s snaking, said <a href="https://x.com/GGBreakingPoint/status/1878259655790760423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a post-match interview</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think I just needed to snake a bit more on that map to get some more kills or something. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think snaking is still a legitimate concern in Call of Duty esports, or should it be discredited as just another mechanic? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>New reports suggest that Hellblade 2 and Gears of War will be making their way to the PlayStation 5 later this year.</p>



<p>That’s according to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/the-game-im-most-excited-for-in-2025-is-already-discounted-before-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WindowsCentral</a>‘s Jez Corden, who corroborated yesterday’s rumors that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> would be making their way to other platforms.</p>



<p>In the new report, Corden states that Hellblade 2, Age of Mythology, and potentially Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition are all also slated for PlayStation 5 later this year.</p>



<p>Corden also points out that most of Xbox’s upcoming games slate will primarily be timed exclusive games for Xbox and PC, which is a direction I think most of us in the industry expected Microsoft to go eventually.</p>



<p>As for when all of these games will be announced to be coming to other platforms, it remains to be seen, but seeing those slated for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acknowledges-recent-nintendo-switch-2-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> would be welcomed announcements whenever Nintendo decides to hold its next Nintendo Direct. The games going to PlayStation may be announced during some “third-party” conference, possibly around the time of Summer Games Fest in June, if those releases are in the latter half of the year.</p>



<p>From the original rumors, NateTheHate also suggested that Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, both PlayStation 5 console exclusives, will come to the Xbox platform soon.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft changing its gaming strategy to release its exclusive games on other platforms? Do you think Microsoft runs the risk of alienating its hardware?
