<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 goes live on Tuesday, meaning that there’s a large update for all players to download in order to get back in the game.</p>



<p>While many have been able to download the large update with no issue, there have been many others reporting issues with getting the latest content.</p>



<p>First mentioned by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1996629708621148440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, users are reporting that they are stuck in an “update available” loop. It’s not all platforms, but one that’s known to have an issue is Battle.net</p>



<p><strong>“The game is updated, but I can’t get in [because] this is the [message] I keep getting, Battlenet,”</strong> one user <a href="https://x.com/NightwolfLotus/status/1996629997608665298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/BzrKIzumi/status/1996629331385422272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Said another</a>, “<strong>Already downloaded the update yet I cannot get passed this [Black Ops 7 start screen. I’ve restarted [Battle.net] and nothing.”</strong><a href="https://x.com/BzrKIzumi/status/1996629331385422272"></a></p>



<p>As of writing, Activision nor developers Treyarch and Raven Software have made any sort of public comment on the issue. Should one come, it will be added to this story. </p>
