<p>It’s a common trend in multiplayer games to have numerous currencies, and Highguard appears to be no different. As soon as you load into the game, you’ll see a selection of small symbols at the top right of your screen, indicating how much of each currency you own. </p>



<p>The thing is, when you’re loading into a new game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> for the first time, the whole experience can be overwhelming, and the last thing you want to figure out is which currencies can be spent where, let alone how to earn them!</p>







<p>Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has you covered, as in this guide, you’ll find out everything you need to know about Highguard’s various currencies. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-currencies-are-in-highguard">How Many Currencies Are In Highguard?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There are already plenty of bundles in the store. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are three currencies in Highguard, and each one has its own unique purpose. </strong></p>



<p>The currencies in question are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Highguard Gold</li>



<li>Warden Credits</li>



<li>Vigil Tokens</li>
</ul>



<p>As is often the case, these currencies have their own rules: each one can only be spent in certain ways, they cannot be interchanged between one another, and they’re all earned in their own unique way. </p>



<p>But don’t worry, there’s no need for confusion, as Insider Gaming have broken down each currency for your convenience.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-gold-explained">Highguard Gold, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The bundles don’t come cheap. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard Gold is the premium currency of Highguard. It is used to purchase War Chests and Store Cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The main way to earn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-launch-day-content-maps-content-weapons-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> Gold is through direct in-game microtransactions, with the prices shown above in GBP. As things stand, there are no other ways to earn the currency.</p>



<p>It’d be great to see it available through other means in the future, either via War Chests or perhaps even Ranked rewards, as plenty of other live-service games offer their premium currency as in-game rewards. Until then, though, if you see something you fancy in the store, you’re going to need to pull out the wallet.</p>



<h2 id="h-warden-credits-explained">Warden Credits, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Some simple cosmetics are on offer. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warden Credits are used to purchase cosmetics from the Trading Post, an in-game store that rotates its stock weekly.</strong></p>



<p>The Trading Post is similar to the Store, except it offers a smaller variety of cosmetics that can be earned without the need for microtransactions. That’s because Warden Credits can be earned in-game, either by completing challenges or simply playing games.</p>







<p>However, if you’re managing to accrue a lot of them, be warned, as Warden Credits are capped at 10,000. Once you hit this upper limit, you’ll stop storing them in the bank, so be sure to spend them!</p>



<h2 id="h-vigil-tokens-explained">Vigil Tokens, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Similar to a battle pass. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Finally, there’s Vigil Tokens. These are used to purchase items in War Chests, which are packed with various cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The primary way to earn these Vigil Tokens is simply by playing matches. The more you play, the more you’ll earn, so it’s a great incentive to reward regular players with some high-tier cosmetic items.</p>



<p>Similar to the Warden Credits, though, there’s an upper limit to how many you can hold onto. 3,000 is the maximum amount of Vigil Tokens you can have at one time, so once again, be sure to spend them when you get them!</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.

<p>Highguard is finally here, and after a long month of waiting and speculating, we finally know what the game is about. Not only do we know how the game plays, but we also know what it’s launching with, and it’s a whole lot of content. </p>



<p>For live-service games like Highguard intends to be, it’s important to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep content pouring in</a>. However, if there isn’t enough to start with, then players won’t have anything to get hooked to.</p>







<p>It doesn’t seem like Highguard will have that issue, as there’s a wealth of content to explore at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-wardens-amp-mounts-available-for-highguard-launch">All Wardens &amp; Mounts Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who is your pick? Image by Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are eight Wardens to choose from, each with their own abilities and skills, as well as three different Mounts. More are scheduled to come with future content updates.</strong></p>



<p>It looks like there’s a nice variety of Wardens to choose from in Highguard, with five playstyles seemingly catered for with their classes. There are three Assault and two Defensive Wardens, making them the most common class at launch.</p>



<p>The eight Wardens available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Warden Name</th><th data-align="center">Warden Class</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Redmane</td><td data-align="center">Destruction</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Condor</td><td data-align="center">Recon</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Atticus</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kai</td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mara </td><td data-align="center">Support</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Una </td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Scarlet</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Slade</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The three Mounts available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Horse</li>



<li>Panther</li>



<li>Bear</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-maps-amp-bases-available-for-highguard-launch">All Maps &amp; Bases Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Explore before the sword falls. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five maps to play at launch for Highguard, with a roster of six Bases to select from each match.</strong></p>



<p>Wildlight Entertainment describe the Maps and Bases very distinctly. The Maps are more open-world environments full of loot and gear to collect, whilst the Bases are smaller, typical FPS-style areas that offer more close-quarters combat. It looks set to offer diverse gameplay scenarios, and it’s notably different from other titles in the genre.</p>







<p>Here’s all five Maps available at launch in Highguard: </p>



<ul>
<li>Dustline</li>



<li>Kingdom</li>



<li>Rivermark</li>



<li>Summit</li>



<li>Vesper City</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-weapons-available-for-highguard-launch">All Weapons Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A solid selection. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ten Primary Weapons are available at launch in Highguard, with three Raid Weapons up for selection too—and don’t forget your Melee Axe!</strong></p>



<p>That makes a total of 14 weapons in Highguard, with plenty more bound to arrive across the year. It’s a simple but healthy selection that should hopefully see balancing not become an issue so early in the game’s lifecycle. </p>



<p>Here’s all 14 weapons available at launch in Highguard:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Weapon Name</th><th data-align="center">Weapon Type</th><th data-align="center">Weapon Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Corsair</td><td data-align="center">SMG</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kraken</td><td data-align="center">Pump-Action Shotgun</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Paladin</td><td data-align="center">Full-Auto Shotgun</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Viper</td><td data-align="center">SMG</td><td data-align="center">Close Quarter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vanguard</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Big Rig</td><td data-align="center">LMG</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Dynasty</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Saber Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Burst Rifle</td><td data-align="center">Mid-Range</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Longhorn</td><td data-align="center">Revolver</td><td data-align="center">Marksman</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Ranger</td><td data-align="center">Bolt-Action Sniper</td><td data-align="center">Marksman</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Blast Hammer</td><td data-align="center">Sledgehammer</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Zipline</td><td data-align="center">Utility</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rocket Launcher</td><td data-align="center">Rocket Launcher</td><td data-align="center">Raid</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Axe</td><td data-align="center">Axe</td><td data-align="center">Melee</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Developer Wildlight Entertainment went big with a year-long 2026 roadmap for Highguard. It features information on each episode and what to expect from every batch of new content: Each includes a new Warden and much more.</p>



<p>The time for talking is over as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> is out now. Geoff Keighley bigged it up as the second coming of Apex Legends and Titanfall, and it’s not bad at all. If you think Highguard’s base-raiding action is something that’ll keep you gripped for a while, then you need the full 2026 roadmap hub bookmarked for the good times ahead.</p>

<p>Highguard Episode 1 is the launch-day content. You obviously need content to get a game going, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-is-finally-getting-a-gameplay-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay showcase</a> revealed the shooter’s first Wardens, maps, guns, and the rest of the glitz and glamour for opening day:</p>

<p>The biggest addition in Episode 4’s content (featuring the tropical months of the year!) is a new Limited-Time Mode. There aren’t many mentions of LTMs in the 2026 roadmap, so it’ll be interesting to see what the new mode is:</p>

<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-6-2026-roadmap-content-october-to-november">Highguard Episode 6 2026 Roadmap Content—October to November</h2>



<p>We’re getting the word, ‘Surprise.’ Given that it falls during Episode 6 and the Halloween season, it’s reasonable to assume the community is getting special spooky surprises, events, and costume tie-ins. Will Highguard do crossovers? We’ll have to see, check out the haul:</p>

<p>Rounding off Highguard’s first year is a rather sparse Episode 7, but more details are sure to be revealed closer to the time. A Winter-themed event and content are expected, and it carries on the tradition of a new Warden every Episode:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>Surprise</li>



<li>New Mods</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s always an element of unpredictability with a new live-service game. Highguard looks the part, but it remains to be seen if it can maintain its player base.

<p>Triple H is on the cover of the Deluxe Edition of WWE 2K26.</p>



<p>2K Games announced on Twitter that Paul “Triple H” Levesque would be featured on the cover of the Deluxe Edition, dubbed the “King of Kings Edition,” for the upcoming WWE 2K26 game. </p>



<p>A two-time WWE Hall of Famer, Triple H has appeared in every WWE video game since his debut in WWF In Your House, the 1996 title released for the original PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC.</p>



<p>Over the years, he has also been a frequent cover star, starting with WWF Attitude in 1999. Iconic games such as WWE SmackDown: Shut Your Mouth, WWE Day of Reckoning, and WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 also feature “The Game” on the cover art. However, this cover is historic for the “King of Kings” because it marks the first time he has been featured solo.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-this-is-not-the-only-cover-of-wwe-2k26-featuring-triple-h">This Is Not the Only Cover of WWE 2K26 Featuring Triple H</h2>



<p>As announced on January 23, WWE 2K26 will also have a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Attitude Era edition</a>. The cover art for that edition features many WWE legends from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Triple H was also on the cover. He was featured in the trailer alongside Shawn Michaels, Chyna, and the other members of D-Generation X.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE also announced a Monday Night War Edition of WWE 2K26. </a>Triple H appears on the cover, representing WWE alongside Steve Austin, Undertaker, The Rock, Chyna, and Kurt Angle. He also appeared in the trailer for this edition, which focuses largely on the promotional rivalry between WWE and WCW that dominated the late ’90s and catapulted wrestling to a new level of popularity and success.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-will-bring-back-classic-match-types-familiar-to-longtime-triple-h-fans">WWE 2K26 Will Bring Back Classic Match Types Familiar to Longtime Triple H Fans</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As first reported by Insider Gaming,</a> WWE 2K26 is expanding its gameplay offerings with four new playable match types. The game introduces the Dumpster Match for the first time while bringing back the Inferno Match, I Quit Match, and 3 Stages of Hell. Triple H has a history of competing in all three returning gimmick matches. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Island</a> will make its return this year, featuring a completely new storyline.</p>







<p>As of now, 2K Games has not announced any specific DLC coming to this year’s game. However, on January 24, WWE confirmed that the Monday Night War Edition will provide access to the most content.</p>



<p>Pre-orders begin on January 30. However, there’s currently no set release date or price point. Recent WWE 2K games have released in March. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Receives “Mostly Negative” Reviews On Steam After Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-receives-mostly-negative-reviews/</link>
            <guid>1416694</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/highguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> is out now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and at least one segment of the gaming community has already left their impressions on the game. Within an hour of its release, Highguard has received “mostly negative” reviews on Steam from players.</p>



<p>From reported performance issues to players saying they’ve been booted from the game, there seems to be a number of concerns from players. </p>







<p><strong>“Barely had 60 fps on a 5070 Ti &amp; 14700K,”</strong> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said one user</a>.</p>



<p>Another added that they <strong>“logged in immediately and got kicked out of the game.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>That said, while some of the concerns appear to be valid, there are many simply joining in on the belief of many that this will be a “Concord 2” situation. For what it’s worth, Concord peaked at just 697 players on Steam while Highguard has reached <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 100,000 concurrent players</a> as of writing. </p>



<p>And while the reviews are mostly negative in the early stages, there are plenty of positive reviews from players. </p>



<p><strong>“The biggest takeaway after the first few matches is that the rules are really different,” </strong>one review reads. <strong>“This isn’t just a Temu Concord or [Overwatch]. The build-up, flag, and siege phases give the match a clear rhythm, and once you get used to it, it’s way more fun than pure aim duels.”</strong></p>



<p>Another user said that nothing in the game felt <strong>“messy”</strong> despite the mixing of <strong>“a lot of gameplays”.</strong></p>
