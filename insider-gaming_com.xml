<p>In Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, you have the next CoD game, but also the continuation of the Black Ops saga. It allows Treyarch to flex its muscles once more, and if you can’t wait to play Black Ops 7, knowing its launch times is the perfect weapon.</p>



<p>Between a plethora of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> content, Black Ops 7’s fascinating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-details-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endgame</a> content, and the usual year-long multiplayer madness, you’ve got a lot to keep you busy in BLOPS 7. The title neatly wraps up this mini-chapter in Call of Duty history, which can lead to a nice break for Treyarch as it works on its next entry.</p>



<p>For now, let’s enjoy Black Ops 7 and find out its launch times.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-7-live">When Is Black Ops 7 Live?</h2>

<p><strong>Black Ops 7 first goes live at 9:00 PM PST on November 13.</strong></p>



<p>Whereas November 14 is considered the default release date for Black Ops 7, a small handful of areas technically get access on November 13—lucky you!</p>



<p>We know many of the launch times for key regions around the world. To make this easier, here’s a complete list showing you each highlighted region and what time and date Black Ops 7 is available there.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Timezone</th><th data-align="center">Black Ops 7 Launch Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">PST</td><td data-align="center">9:00 PM-November 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CST</td><td data-align="center">11:00 PM-November 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">EST</td><td data-align="center">12:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">BRT</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GMT</td><td data-align="center">5:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CET</td><td data-align="center">6:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">SAST</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GST</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">KST</td><td data-align="center">2:00 PM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">JST</td><td data-align="center">2:00 PM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AEDT</td><td data-align="center">4:00 PM-November 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-ops-7-early">Can You Play Black Ops 7 Early?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, there is no early access for the Campaign, Zombies, or Multiplayer this year in Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>There’s not much to add. There was initial speculation that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-zombies-release-early-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Campaign and Zombies were set to release four days early.</a> However, while Activision didn’t address the speculation directly, the company covered the rumor by stating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-have-early-access-activision-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 doesn’t have early access</a>—breaking all of our hearts in the process.</p>



<p>Still, there are only a few days to go now. As long as you have your referenced timezone on hand, you should know when the new Call of Duty goes live in your digital storefront. Furthermore, for more help on this, we also have an in-depth <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 preload guide</a>, showing you how to set this up and enable you to play the second Black Ops 7 drops!</p>



<p>It also covers the game’s excessive file sizes across all formats. We hope this and our other CoD guides are answering your biggest questions about the latest CoD release.

<p>Activision is getting ready to launch Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on November 14. With that preparation comes an update to the Call of Duty app on various platforms, and one platform needing the update is PlayStation 5 (PS5).</p>



<p>The Call of Duty HQ app on PS5 requires around 100GB to install. This update includes Multiplayer and Zombies while a separate Campaign pack is needed for that section of the game. And while that should be it to get ready to playing Black Ops 7, if you still want to play either Black Ops 6 or Warzone, you’re going to have to do more after the updating the HQ app.</p>



<p>After the new update, you’re going to be <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1987931198442643822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">required to reinstall</a> both the Black Ops 6 and Warzone packs if you want to keep playing those games and their modes. It’s an extra step and more time to play the games that were already previously installed. And, because the app update is mandatory for everyone, there’s seemingly no way around it on PS5.</p>



<p>Are you going to reinstall Warzone or Black Ops 6 to keep playing on your PS5 after the Call of Duty app update, or are you just going to wait now for Black Ops 7?
