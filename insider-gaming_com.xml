<p>NBA 2K26 launches on August 29 for those who purchase the Superstar or Leave No Doubt Edition of the game, and 2K Sports has given players its first look at what to expect from the game’s MyCareer mode.</p>



<p>In a new trailer for the mode released on Wednesday, NBA 2K26’s career mode is dubbed “Out of Bounds”. In the mode, players start as a hopeful playing in Vermont who then has to make various decisions to achieve the dream of making it to the NBA.</p>



<p>The trailer, which is narrated by Spike Lee—who also lends his voice to the mode throughout—, focuses more on the story and the cinematics than the actual games or how it integrates into The City.</p>



<p>You can check out the trailer for yourself below. More details on NBA 2K26’s MyCareer are expected to be revealed in the coming days ahead of the game’s launch.</p>



<p>NBA 2K26 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-reveal-schedule-released-starting-with-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be available</a> on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch 1 &amp; 2, and PC. Those looking for Gen 9 features of the game can get it on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>

<p>Sony has announced that it is raising the price of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) in the United States.</p>



<p>Starting on August 21, the price of the base PS5 will rise to $549.99, the PS5 Digital Edition will jump to $499.99, and the PS5 Pro will cost $749.99. All increases are $50 from their previous prices.</p>



<p><strong>“Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment,” </strong><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony said</a>. <strong>“As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.”</strong></p>



<p>Sony’s move follows price increases of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-to-increase-ps5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platform in different regions</a> already. It also follows the decisions <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-the-price-for-all-xbox-series-consoles-accessories-and-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-to-raise-switch-prices-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo to raise</a> the price of their hardware in recent months. </p>



<p><strong>“The recommended retail prices for PlayStation 5 accessories remain unchanged, and we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets,” </strong>Sony added.</p>

<p>The Valve Fremont, which is the long-rumored console running SteamOS, has appeared on popular benchmarking platform Geekbench. The appearance comes as rumors of Valve’s return to Steam consoles continue to swirl.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13390426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geekbench listings</a>, the Valve Fremont features a six core/12 thread processor running at 3.2 GHz base frequency. The device tested also has 8GB of DDR5 memory. </p>



<p>It should be noted, however, that just because it appears on Geekbench, it doesn’t mean the specs are 100% locked in. There could be various changes between when the testing appears and when something becomes official or is released. One example is that on the benchmark, it mentions running Windows 11 Pro. The final device would likely have the SteamOS Linux-based operating system.</p>

<h2 id="h-a-long-time-coming">A Long Time Coming?</h2>



<p>Rumors of a new Steam console from Valve have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been circulating for months</a>, known Valve insider Brad Lynch has talked about the device for a while, and added some more context after it showed up on Geekbench.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1958024995273068544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to Lynch</a>, Valve Fremont is a “TV focused PC box/console running SteamOS” that “has [a] dedicated HDMI port.” He addes that it’s a semi-custom CPU based on Hawk Point 2 with the integrated GPU removed. </p>



<p>Lastly, speaking of the GPU, it has a dedicated AMD RX 7600 that will all fit in a custom Valve case.</p>



<p>When it launches, the Valve Fremont is expected, according to Lynch, to release alongside the new “Ibex” controller, “Deckard” VR headset, and it’s “Roy” controllers.</p>



<p>Valve has yet to confirm the existence of the Fremont console. But with official benchmarks appearing online, it could be only a matter of time before things become official.</p>
