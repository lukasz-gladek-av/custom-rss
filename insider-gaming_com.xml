<p>Resident Evil Requiem’s producer has recently stated that we will see “some characters from the past series come in.”</p>



<p>Capcom’s next big title is Resident Evil Requiem, and they are going all in with the title. Recently, the developers revealed that they expect the upcoming title to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell better</a> than Resident Evil Village, and that its development began ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-says-resident-evil-requiem-development-started-way-before-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">way before</a>‘ Village. Now, we have been informed that Requiem’s returning characters and some additional details about the stalker enemy were revealed. </p>

<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Well Played</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-over-expect-or-hype-it-resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-teases-but-wont-say-who" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Resident Evil Requiem’s producer, Masato Kumazawa, was asked whether the title will have returning characters from Outbreak, as Grace is the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft. Kumazawa replied, stating that yes, “there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don’t over-expect or hype it.” They can’t promise anything right now, and the only thing that can be said is that “there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game.”</p>



<p>Regarding the stalker enemy, Masato Kumazawa revealed that it will be just a small part of the game, and that they have learned from the past how to balance the system. The producer added that the game is new, and the focus is more on how they can scare the player in many different ways. The developers are “trying to cover a whole lot of scenarios to make sure the players can get scared and experience the horror.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytales-modding-strategy-makes-it-easier-for-players-to-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hytale%E2%80%99s-modding-strategy-makes-it-easier-for-players-to-access.1360564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The modding strategy for Hytale has been outlined by Hypixel Studios, and it will be easier for everyone to access servers with mods enabled.</p>



<p>Hytale is back on the agenda after being scrapped by Riot Games earlier this year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hypixel Studios’ original founders re-purchasing the rights to the game</a> and all development, and a playable experience is right around the corner, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date for early access set to be shared next week</a>.</p>



<p>Modding will be core to the Hytale experience, unsurprisingly given that Hypixel began as a Minecraft mod, and details have been shared that will make it easy for players to enjoy modded content.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-modding-will-be-server-side">Hytale Modding Will Be Server-Side</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to offer. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed blog post</a> about modding in Hytale, it was announced that all modding in the game is “based on the host of the server or host of the game,” and that players should be able to join any modded server “without downloading external mods or juggling client packs.”</p>



<p>Players will be able to download mods directly for customisation in single-player servers, and, crucially, Hytale is not planning to support any client mods, restricting the need for additional downloads further.</p>



<p>The modding ambitions for Hytale are huge and will be open access, with Blocks, Items, NPCs, World Generation, UIs, systems, and behaviors “all driven by data and code that you can influence.”</p>



<p>However, it’s also detailed that modders will experience limitations when early access goes live due to the current stage of development, and Hypixel Studios has made no secret of the fact it will be a long process for full release, and early access players and modders will encounter issues.</p>



<p>Modders have been told there will be “limitations due to missing editing capabilities,” that “certain aspects of client behaviour are not yet exposed,” and “moddering maturity is wildly uneven.” Additionally, some tools and systems are described as “rough, inconsistent, or painful to work with.”</p>



<p>Hypixel Studios will not hide valuable features from modders, however, and, “if something is useful,” they will “try to make it available and iterate it.” Modders and players throughout early access are urged to hold Hypixel Studios “responsible,” with a commitment to “being transparent and telling you the truth.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The early access release date for Hytale will be announced by the end of next week, Hypixel Studios has revealed, with anticipation for the title continuing to rise.</p>



<p>Hytale was scrapped by Riot Games but has been revived by the original founders of the title, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchase announced earlier this month</a>, and it’s unlikely to be long until players get their hands on the game.</p>



<p>While the official 1.0 release is likely to be a ways off, early access could be right around the corner, and an official announcement on the release date is coming next week.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-early-access-announcement-next-week">Hytale Early Access Announcement Next Week</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big news imminent. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme continued a slew of news updates regarding Hytale by confirming that plans for the early access release date will be revealed before the end of next week.</p>



<p>It’s set to be a week full of info, as the post states that Hytale will be tested across different hardware “to determine the minimum specs,” with major crashes being fixed, launcher tests, and finishing up the legal work to prepare the game for early access.</p>



<p>The post states that a “precise release date” will be announced next week, with a follow up post confirming this is for the early access release, and not for the full version.</p>



<p>Anticipation for Hytale is high, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-coming-soonand-shows-off-16-minutes-of-minecraft-like-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">16-minute gameplay video</a> attracting over one million views in a matter of days, and the long wait for a playable version of the game to be available is coming to an end.</p>



<p>Development for Hytale began in 2015, with Riot Games purchasing Hypixel Studios five years later in 2020. However, Riot cancelled the title in June this year, but the game has been saved by the original developer, and players are set to be a major part of ongoing development.</p>
