            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X (and Ally) have just been released, and they’re turning heads on account of a) their processing power and capabilities, and b) their eye-watering price tags. The Xbox Ally X will break the bank at $1,000, which is a huge hurdle for adoption. In a recent interview, Xbox’s president revealed that Microsoft didn’t have any guidance when it comes to pricing.</p>



<p>It was stated that the Xbox Ally X at $1,000 and the Xbox Ally at $599 came straight from the head honchos and market analysts at ASUS, and neither Xbox nor Microsoft had a say in the price tag.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-is-why-the-xbox-ally-x-is-so-expensive">This is Why The Xbox Ally X is So Expensive</h2>



<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a phenomenal piece of equipment, offering cutting-edge handheld capabilities on a device that’s comfort redefined. It has a great battery life, neat cooling solutions, room for expansion, and a splash of RGB, all packaged alongside tactile buttons, a high-quality and durable screen, and punchy speakers.</p>



<p>That was all summed up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our review</a>, anyway.</p>



<p>What the Xbox Ally X also has is a $1,000 price tag, which is enough to put off first-time buyers. In a recent interview <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Variety</a>, Sarah Bond, the President of Xbox, confirmed that Microsoft had no input whne it came to pricing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware. That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the staggering price point, Bond revealed that the Xbox Store sold out ‘really quickly’ and suggested that the value that’s being given to gamers for the price is more than worthwhile.</p>



<p>But she has to say that, right?</p>



<p>Bond used the current line of Xbox marketing spiel to further promote the Xbox Ally X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It should be something you can have with you anywhere. You should be able to play any game you want with anyone you want on any device.</p>



<p>We want to make sure that people have a choice.</p>



<p>We want to make sure there’s an option for the power players who want the latest innovations, that want to push the edge of what’s possible, the most demanding players. And then, if someone is looking for PC gaming on the go, they’re a casual gamer, they’re a gaming enthusiast, then there’s Xbox Allys for them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think the pricing point for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is fair, or are you waiting for a price cut before you make that investment? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>This year has been an incredible year for gaming. From highly anticipated sequels like Hades 2 and Hollow Knight: Silksong to surprising hits like Blue Prince and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, 2025 proved to be one of the better years for games at every level in recent memory. But if 2025 was great, a quick look at upcoming games suggests that next year might be even better. These are the most anticipated games for 2026.</p>



<p>With this list, only games that are first release and available on multiple platforms are eligible. That means games currently in early access, but planned to launch in 2026, don’t count. Also, if you’re looking for the most anticipated exclusives for consoles like the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and Nintendo Switch 2, those will be posted separately. </p>



<p>As of now, all of these games below are currently scheduled for a release next year. </p>
