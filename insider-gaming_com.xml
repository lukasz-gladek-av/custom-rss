            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics.1046652/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the immense success of Diablo IV and the upcoming Path of Exile 2, both of which heavily feature microtransactions, primarily in the form of cosmetic skins, the ARPG genre, while flourishing, is bogged down by loot boxes, pay-to-win mechanics and in-game stores. It’s left many fans of the genre worrying about upcoming titles, such as Titan Quest 2. According to developer Grimlore Games, we have nothing to worry about. Titan Quest 2 isn’t pay-to-win and features no loot boxes!</p>



<p>On the topic of loot boxes and pay-to-win mechanics in the mythology-focused ARPG, developer Grimlore Games said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With Titan Quest 2, we intend to take a bit of a different approach than with most projects before. We want to involve the community in a typical Steam Early Access manner. Our reasoning: we want Titan Quest 2 to stand its own ground within the ARPG genre and we are convinced that there is only one way to pull it off: swarm intelligence.</p>



<p>When the first Titan Quest originally released in 2006, it was the alternative to Diablo 2 and not many others in the ARPG genre. In 2024, the situation looks a little different. Apart from the still ongoing Diablo franchise, there are numerous other contestants out there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But with such stiff competition and a desire to earn back its investment, Grimlore Games certainly has its work cut out for it in developing, releasing, and improving upon Titan Quest 2 over time. As such, the team made the community four promises:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We do despise this with a passion. There will never ever be any monetization mechanic in the game, urging you to spend money on any gameplay-related item to give anybody an advantage.</p>



<p>You can play the way you want to play the game. When we launch into early access in the winter of 2025, we will however not yet have online multiplayer (four-player co-op) implemented. This will be among the first two updates once we launch into Steam Early Access.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’re a long-time fan of the ARPG genre, chances are you probably played the original game back in the day. Well, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist its sequel on Steam right now</a>!</p>



<p>While it won’t be available at launch, Titan Quest 2 will feature co-op sometime after its Early Access release. You have plenty of time to find a co-op partner or two to grind levels with. You could even check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> for like-minded players!</p>



<hr>



<p>It took a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/titan-quest-2-17-years-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staggering 17 years for Titan Quest 2 to be announced</a>, but the iconic ARPG is finally within our grasp. You just have to wait until late 2025, sadly!</p>

<p>Worlds Untold, a NetEase-backed studio founded by former Mass Effect producer Mac Walters, is “pausing operations” just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-adds-new-studio-led-by-mass-effect-veteran/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a year after being founded</a>.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, Walters said the studio is looking for a new partner and that halting operations was a “very difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life,” Walters said. “This was not a decision we made lightly—it’s been a deeply personal journey, and we’re all so proud of everything this team has built together.”</p>



<p>Worlds Untold had been working on a “AAA action-adventure game” since it was founded. However, NetEase recently decided to pull funding due to “current market conditions”.</p>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, a NetEase spokesperson said discontinuing funding was an “incredibly difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“This choice was not made lightly, as we have been consistently inspired by the team, their unwavering dedication and the bold vision behind their project,” the spokesperson said. “Although current market conditions have required us to reassess and prioritise our opportunities, we are actively collaborating with the studio to explore potential next steps and provide support during this transition.</p>



<p>“While this chapter comes to a close, our commitment to a strong global presence remains unwavering, and we are excited about the promising projects underway at our other studios. We thank Worlds Untold for their remarkable contributions and wish them every success in the future.”</p>



<p>Walters added that all of the studio’s staff are able and looking for work elsewhere. He said that while the studio is “pausing for now”, it’s not the end of the line for Worlds Untold and their plans.</p>



<p>“[There’s] more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right,” he said.</p>

<p>It seems Hunt: Showdown is following in the footsteps of titles like Dead by Daylight and Call of Duty, with big-name collaborations with other franchises and musical artists. As it were, this one makes a little sense. It turns out that Post Malone is a massive fan of Hunt: Showdown, having spent over 400 hours playing the horror-based extraction shooter while on tour. As such, Crytek partnered with the rapper-turned-country-singer for a collaboration known as Post Malone’s Murder Circus—the game’s most significant event to date!</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-post-malone-s-murder-circus-event">What is Post Malone’s Murder Circus Event?</h2>



<p>Hunt: Showdown’s first major event with a celebrity, Post Malone’s Murder Circus, transports players into the same nightmare universe as the rest of the extraction shooter, albeit with a twist. You’re thrust into a murderous traveling circus, transformed by an artifact known as the HelioStone. The former Ringmaster, the Deposed King, played by Post Malone, enters the fray.</p>



<p>The event features a new monster, Ursa Mortis, an orphaned bear cub with a deformed body and endless hunger. It stalks the Circus in search of prey to consume. Along with the terrifying creature, the map itself is unique, awe-inspiring, and downright dreadful in equal measure. And yes, you’ll encounter horrific clown enemies.</p>



<h2 id="h-yeah-post-malone-is-a-huge-fan-of-hunt-showdown">Yeah, Post Malone is a Huge Fan of Hunt: Showdown</h2>



<p>Talking about the game, Post said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re either hundred percent in or you’re done. I could either rock this dude and send him off, or I’m totally naked…. Every game I’m shaking, like this is awesome. Whenever you pull it off, I feel like I’m the best player in the entire world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And on bringing Post Malone into the project, Game Director Scott Lussier said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re thrilled to have had the opportunity to collaborate with such a passionate and high-profile Hunt fan such as Post Malone. Hunt: Showdown 1896 has always been about creating immersive, high-stakes gameplay. And with Post Malone’s Murder Circus, we’re bringing a new level of intensity and dark entertainment to the Hunt universe.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896’s Post Malone Murder Circus will launch shortly on PC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-on-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
