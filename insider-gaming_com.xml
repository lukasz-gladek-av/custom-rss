<p>Lords of the Fallen 2 is already being eagerly awaited by the community. Today (17), new information about the sequel was revealed by Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, the game’s publisher.</p>



<p>According to Marek, the game has already entered the full production phase with more than 200 developers working on it. </p>



<div><article><p><span>The next game under </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LordsoftheFallen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LordsoftheFallen</a><span> has been already under full production for a good part of this year. As of now we have over 200 people full time working on that, both internal team and codev partners.</span></p></article></div>



<p>According to the CEO, the internal forecast is for the game to be released sometime in 2026. The marketing campaign will begin sometime next year. </p>



<p>Hexworks has delivered a very competent Souls-like game that has revitalized the franchise. Surprisingly, as well as making a new game, the studio still manages to find time to support the first game by releasing patches frequently. </p>



<p>The reboot was praised for its unusual realm-crossing mechanics that impacted exploration and direct campaign progression.</p>

<p>Exodus, a new AAA sci-fi RPG from Archetype Entertainment, has been given an electrifying gameplay trailer.</p>



<p>Called “The Traveler’s Creed”, the material shows story scenes, some of the locations we’ll be visiting, breathtaking scenery and, of course, lots of explosions. The game’s budget seems to be quite generous, after all, even a trailer featuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exodus-starring-matthew-mcconaughey-gets-new-cinematic-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew McConaughey</a> has been released.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In one part of the trailer, we can see a gigantic bear wearing space armor. Crazy, right? The protagonist will also be able to use a grappling hook to move around the environment faster.</p>



<p>Comparisons with Mass Effect are and will be inevitable, after all, part of the Exodus team are veterans who worked on the BioWare franchise. And, well, judging by this initial trailer, fans of Shepard are going to be very happy with Exodus.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, no release date has been announced. The synopsis reads as follows:</p>



<p>“<em>Join the Travelers, as they sacrifice their lives to travel through the Centauri Universe on a dangerous mission to save an isolated Awakened civilization from enslavement by Celestials. Our service – our sacrifice – discovers worlds, seeds hope, breaks empires</em>.”</p>

<p>One of the most <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-is-the-obnoxious-game-we-needed-it-to-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">random yet enjoyable games</a> to release in 2024 has a new update. Developer Dee Dee Creations has released a new update for Squirrel With A Gun.</p>



<p>The new Ratatoskr Update sees a new boss, a new platforming level dubbed the “Super Platforming Challenge”, and new styles to find. </p>



<p>“A new rival has arrived and joins forces with Mother &amp; Father to destroy the neighborhood,” the update description reads. “The fight against Ratatoskr is quite unlike the vehicle-based bosses you’ve faced before. The mythical squirrel moves fast, has a variety of ranged and melee attacks, and is a considerably smaller target! Fortunately, you will be granted a special SMG with a magazine of infinite bullets for the occasion.”</p>



<p>The Ratatoskr Update is just the second — the first added Photo Mode to the game — of at least six planned free updates for the game. The next update is an outfit variety pack in February followed by a new Gravity Gun in March. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squirrel-with-a-gun-post-launch-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rest of the updates</a> are scheduled to come by August 2025.</p>

<p>In our review of the game, we called Squirrel With A Gun “the exact type of obnoxious game it needed to be” with its mix of platforming, puzzles, and fun cutscenes. The game is available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket launched Mythical Island and new Themed Collections to give players fresh objectives and rewards to chase. Each collection is different, and there aren’t too many to worry about. We’ve provided this handy guide telling you all about Mythical Island’s Themed Collections and what you need to do.</p>



<p>Themed Collections are another of Pokémon TCG Pocket’s many features. They are passive challenges rewarding you with amazing goodies, allowing you to open packs faster—a win-win! Genetic Apex has a set of Themed Collections, and Pokémon TCG Pocket’s first mini-set—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a>—has its own.</p>



<p>I’ve made this nice and easy by letting you know how many Mythical Island collections there are to complete, as well as the rewards for doing each.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Open packs, and get rewards. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Mythical Island expansion has 13 Themed Collections for you to complete.</strong></p>



<p>These are an entirely new set of Themed Collections from Genetic Apex or any other set in <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>. As usual, they require you to <strong>open booster packs</strong>—in this case, for Mythical Island—and collecting certain cards goes a long way to completing Themed Collections.</p>



<p>The reality is, you can’t manufacture the cards you pull for now. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Picks</a> provide an extra chance to get a card you might need, and it remains to be seen if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a> makes this task easier.</p>



<h2 id="h-mythical-island-themed-collection-rewards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Mythical Island Themed Collection Rewards in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The Mythical Island Theme Collection challenges require you to collect a certain amount of cards exclusively from the mini-set deck. One challenge, in particular, is going to take some time to complete though, so let’s take a look.</p>

<h2 id="h-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-details">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Update Details</h2>



<h3>General</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where users Game Slot may be reported as being damaged, or may appear to be completely missing, when no actual problem had occurred.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Gameplay</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where player may be unable to equip Indy’s whip.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where a player may end up with Indy’s camera permanently equipped.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Graphics</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fix to prevent “Double vision” getting stuck on screen when Indy has almost drowned. To players who have already encountered this issue, repeating the near-drown should clear the issue.</li>



<li>Some further improvements to reduce “stutter” from duplicated frames during cutscenes.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Missions and quests – Please note this section contains some small spoilers</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where Gina may not approach the secret entrance to the Vatican Treasure Chamber, blocking the mission from progressing.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where Gina may go to pick the lock to the exit from the Vatican Treasure Chamber as soon as you enter the room, meaning you may miss some very important story developments.</li>



<li>Fixed a big hole in the floor collision around the edge of the wall around the Ziggurat in Sukhothai that the player could fall through.</li>
</ul>



<h3>PC Specific fixes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where Nvidia DLSS may cause performance problems when enabled.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where Nvidia Frame Generation wasn’t activated properly if HDR is in use.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where Nvidia Low Latency Mode could cause performance problems when used with Frame Generation.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where global illumination may be completely disabled when playing with below minimum VRAM graphics cards.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where Lighting may be over bright in interior spaces if Path Tracing (Full Ray Tracing) is set to Medium or High Quality.</li>
