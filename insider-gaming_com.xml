<p>The Farm 51 has just released the playable demo for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone. This post-apocalyptic-like, open-world game plunges players into the heart of Chornobyl, throwing them head over heels into a multiversal, ambitious survival RPG. It’s not a far cry from the first game, which was released in 2018, but the demo reveals a few flaws that need ironing out.</p>



<p>I picked up a preview copy of Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone a few days ago and was able to complete the playable demo in around 80 minutes. It’s a great glimpse behind the curtain, and it sets up some solid expectations for the full game, which will be released on March 6.</p>



<p>Check out my preview below to learn about my major gripes with Chernobylite 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-looks-great-doesn-t-play-well">Looks Great, Doesn’t Play Well</h2>



<p>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone looks fantastic on the surface. The character models and animations are scarily good, and the open-world environment of the Exclusion Zone is authentic and feels great to look at. The enemy models are pretty much the same as the last game and look intimidating enough, and there are enough small details scattered around to make the world feel populated.</p>



<p>With all that being said, exploring Chernobylite 2 – even in the limited demo – doesn’t feel too sharp. It’s not the best experience and the new model that requires you to switch between a first- and third-person perspective to explore and fight is pretty jarring. I’d rather have it locked to a first-person perspective, just like the first game. </p>



<p>Combat is a little janky, and the first boss you encounter (a mini one, at least) presents a cumbersome, clunky battle that feels uninspired at best. There are a few classes to choose from, or you can pick a combination of multiple class types and use a mix of ranged, melee, and elemental attacks.</p>



<p>As I played the Chernobylite 2 demo, I found that no fight scenes felt satisfying or entertaining. I was just tapping buttons and awkwardly dropping targets.</p>



<h2 id="h-potentially-overcomplicated">Potentially Overcomplicated</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chernobylite-2-early-access-release-date/">Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone</a> is a survival RPG of sorts. There are branching skill paths that players must traverse, and at the heart of the game sits the typical tropes that accompany that genre – base-building, crafting, upgrades, and looting. The UI is simple enough, but the density and depth of the menus and the sheer amount on display can feel a little overwhelming.</p>



<p>Within the first hour of the demo, you’re introduced to the game’s major mechanics, but that’s just a scratch on the surface of this game. Before long, I was plunged into a base defence sequence, taught how to manage and maintain a full-fledged doomsday bunker, and instructed how to harness the power of radiation, turning it into fearsome fire and ice attacks.</p>



<p>That all sounds a little scattered, right?</p>



<p> I loved the first Chernobylite game, and admittedly it was just as complex, but it felt like more of a slow burner. It’s my impression that you’re thrown into the deep end in Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone quite quickly.</p>



<h2 id="h-flaws-uncovered">Flaws Uncovered</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another thing I have an issue with is the voice acting in the game. The main character has the sound of a middle-aged man from Yorkshire, and it doesn’t suit the model one bit. Everyone seems to have an accent that doesn’t suit them, and I’m not sure to what extent these voice actors are real people…</p>



<p>I found various spelling errors and grammatical blips in the game’s UI and text-based segments, and I had a few visual glitches here and there as I explored the demo. One thing I didn’t like was the heavy motion blur and frame rate issues that I experienced. And I’m playing Chernobylite 2 on a <strong>very </strong>high-end PC, so that shouldn’t happen.</p>



<p>I was less than encouraged to learn that the Chernobylite 2 demo had been pushed live early because the team at The Farm 51 had experienced unresolvable technical issues with Steam. I hope that’s not a case of ‘start as you mean to go on’ and that further issues won’t surface down the line.</p>



<p>I feel it’s worth stressing that The Farm 51 is a small studio that has crowdfunded to finance much of the development of Chernobylite 2. It’s not fair to criticise the game without pointing that out.</p>



<p>Chernobylite 2 could be something special, if only because I’m a massive fan of post-apocalyptic games. I love titles like Fallout <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-patch-fixes-bugs-and-overhauls/">and STALKER 2</a>, and Chernobylite (2018) wowed me through and through. I’m willing to settle into the game and give it a solid run to produce a full review shortly, but right now, I’m approaching the full release with guarded expectations and a tentative attitude.</p>

<p>Recently, eagle-eyed gamers spotted a listing on the Xbox Store for Tides of Annihilation, the new hack-n-slash title revealed by Eclipse Glow Games at the State of Play showcase. This ambitious, post-apocalyptic title turned heads for its representation of a tantalising combination between Stellar Blade and Elden Ring.</p>



<p>The listing on the Xbox Store surfaced without warning and even had a price point associated with it – a modest sum of $22.49. However, gamers trying to purchase the game were met with something of a digital stonewall.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-yet">Not Yet</h2>



<p>Tides of Annihilation isn’t out yet – and presently, nobody knows when it will be released. When it <strong>does drop </strong>it’ll be on Xbox Series, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3li4itlcsfx2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Wario64 shared an image of the Xbox Store, showing that Tides of Annihilation had seemingly been released and had a price point of just $22.49. This encouraged gamers to try purchasing the game, but they were met with nothing but a stonewall and a 300 MB ‘placeholder’ file. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the transactions were carried out as expected, which means players were charged the $22.49 that they paid for the file.</p>



<p>It could have been that someone at Xbox was very excited about the prospect of Tides of Annihilation and pressed a button a little too early.</p>



<p>Here’s the most recent extended gameplay trailer for Tides of Annihilation, just to loop you in and set your expectations:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Tides of Annihilation is a mystical, post-apocalyptic title set in a torn rendition of London. The game’s protagonist, Gwendolyn, has an ethereal connection to spectral knights of Arthurian mythology and uses their powers to battle monumental and enormous boss characters.</p>



<p>I recently caught up with Eclipse Glow Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-interview-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to ask them about</a> some of the core elements of Tides of Annihilation.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to stun gamers worldwide since debuting in December 2024. This free-to-play hero shooter has pulled in tens of millions of fans, dominating the charts and attracting all kinds of top-tier content creators and pro players. Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-host-400000-global-invitational-tournament/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a $400,000 esports tournament</a> is already planned to take place.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Marvel Rivals’ developer, NetEase, offered up a tidbit of information regarding the future of the game, looking specifically at a PvE mode. This is one of the most talked-about topics in the community, but what’s the chance it’ll be added?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-yet">Not Yet</h2>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-says-theres-currently-no-plan-for-a-pve-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, NetEase’s producer, Weicong Wu, spoke about PvE mode for Marvel Rivals. It’s a feature that many players have requested, either to seek a lesser challenge or to potentially sharpen their skills for when they fight real players.</p>



<p>Here’s what Wu said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For now we don’t have any kind of a PvE plan, but our development team is continuously experimenting with new game play modes. So if we found that a new specific game mode is entertaining enough, fun enough, we would of course bring it to our audience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>NetEase is aware of the demand, of course. Wu explained, ‘We believe there are some of our audience that would like the PvE mode.’ For now, the team at NetEase is ‘continuously experimenting’ with ways to please everyone and one proposed solution is a ‘lighter mode’ instead of a full-blown PvE experience.</p>



<p>It was revealed in the same interview, which took place at DICE in Las Vegas, that the developer is ‘open’ to bringing Marvel Rivals to Nintendo Switch 2, which would be a boon for the platform.</p>

<p>Team BDS is the first organisation to qualify for the grand final at the Six Invitational 2025, which will unravel tomorrow in Boston. Following a solid run through the upper bracket, Team BDS has found a spot in yet another pole position and remains the favourite to win the event and claim the $1 million prize.</p>



<p>To get there, Team BDS had to throw the likes of Unwanted and FURIA into the lower bracket. Both of these teams now stand a chance of squaring up against Team BDS once again to deliver an age-old tale of revenge, but FaZe Clan could also surface in the grand final.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-long-left">Not Long Left</h2>



<p>Today, two matches will play out, the first being a clash between Unwanted and FaZe Clan. From there, the winner will play FURIA for a spot in the grand final. One of these three teams will face off against a dominant Team BDS, which finds itself in a grand final for the fourth time <strong>this season</strong>.</p>



<p>Last year, Team BDS secured the top spot at the inaugural Esports World Cup, earning a prestigious place in the gaming history books.</p>



<p>Team BDS has enjoyed a solid streak through the Six Invitational, which is one of the biggest and most valuable esports tournaments in the world. The squad topped the charts in the group stage, and as the team steamed through the playoffs bracket, it forced Unwanted, Spacestation, and FURIA into the elimination bracket after earning a bye thanks to group seeding.</p>



<p>This could be Team BDS’ first Six Invitational Win. Currently, every team in the running except FaZe Clan has never seen a grand final at the Six Invitational. Here’s a spread of the past winners of the Six Invitational:</p>



<ul>
<li>2017 – Elevate &amp; Continuum</li>



<li>2018 – PENTA</li>



<li>2019 – G2 Esports</li>



<li>2020 – Spacestation</li>



<li>2021 – Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>2022 – TSM</li>



<li>2023 – G2 Esports</li>



<li>2024 – w7m Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you think Team BDS can break through the grand final and lift the hammer in Boston? Right now, the team is <strong>guaranteed to win </strong>at least $450,000. Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gray Zone Warfare Devs Are Testing The Most Requested Features]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-devs-testing-features/</link>

<p>Gray Zone Warfare’s developer, MADFINGER Games, continues to innovate and expand Gray Zone Warfare, one of 2024’s most impressive shooters. In April 2024, Gray Zone Warfare emerged to a positive reception, presenting a tactical shooter experience bursting with realism and intensity. It has since sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 1.5 million units</a>.</p>



<p>Recently, the team at MADFINGER revealed the next lineup of improvements and changes coming to Gray Zone Warfare. The first port of call for these changes is the game’s test server, but if all goes well, they’ll be deployed across the full game soon enough.</p>



<hr>







<p>Gray Zone Warfare is being pieced together with the community in mind, and stacks of feedback have been taken on board and actively considered by the developer. Last year, I was fortunate enough to catch up with MADFINGER’s CEO to ask him about the state of play for Gray Zone and the extraction shooter market in general.</p>



<p>While Gray Zone isn’t <strong>strictly </strong>an extraction shooter, it does have mechanics that align it quite nicely with the genre.</p>



<p>Here’s what MADFINGER is testing in the latest test server patch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Introduction of a ‘repair feature’</li>



<li>Easier progression to max vendor level</li>



<li>Better disconnect protection</li>



<li>Better item and body behaviour and physics</li>
</ul>



<p>The first feature on that list is the most widely requested note in the Gray Zone Warfare community. When implemented, it’ll allow users to patch up their equipment instead of paying a costly price to replace items. As you can expect, items can be repaired, but each successive repair will degrade the overall max quality rating of that item.</p>



<p>MADFINGER’s intent to strengthen disconnect protection in the game is also a nice inclusion. Many modern shooters feature this mechanic, and it means that if you disconnect while playing, you’ll load back up with the option to continue where you left off.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare has a solid development pipeline lined up, and the passion evident in MADFINGER is a wondrous thing. Have you given Gray Zone a try? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
