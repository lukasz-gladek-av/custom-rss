<p>Early details for Pok√©mon TCG Pocket‚Äôs Set A2A expansion have started to trickle through. Not much is known about the anticipated next set, but Set A2A is reportedly a new mini-set to break up the pack-opening grind of Space-Time Smackdown and Set 3.</p>



<p>Pok√©mon TCG Pocket is not holding back when releasing new sets and promo cards. Genetic Apex launched first, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-mythical-island-themed-collection-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a> and it only took three months for the next big-time set in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space-Time Smackdown</a>. Tons of cards are available in packs with players desperate to catch ‚Äôem all.</p>



<p>Potential first details on Pok√©mon TCG Pocket Set A2A are already sifting through, so let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs happening.</p>

<p><strong>Pok√©mon TCG Pocket Set A2A is set to release on February 28, according to leaks</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes from renowned and trusted Pok√©mon leaker <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@CentroLeaks</a> who has already leaked and gotten most of these insider tidbits correct since Pok√©mon TCG Pocket launched on Oct. 30, 2024.</p>



<p>They posted to <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1885731258719748246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> on February 1 about upcoming content for the free-to-play mobile title: ‚Äú<strong>The next themed booster pack (A2a) releases on February 28th.</strong>‚Äù This might come as a surprise to players as Space-Time Smackdown was only released on January 30‚Äîgiving players less than a month to focus solely on Set 2.</p>



<p>However, there‚Äôs a big reason why this leak could be correct, and why Set A2A could be so soon‚Äî<strong>Pok√©mon Day is February 27</strong>. </p>



<p>Set A2A would coincide nicely with the annual celebration of all things Pok√©mon. We take all this information with a pinch of salt for now, as we have to where leaks are concerned. But @CentroLeaks is usually spot-on about its information. This means you haven‚Äôt got all that long until the next mini-set drops. You might need to start saving Pack Hourglasses sooner rather than later!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a">What To Expect From Pok√©mon TCG Pocket Set A2A</h2>



<p><strong>Pok√©mon TCG Pocket Set A2A is potentially a themed booster pack, and the ‚ÄúA‚Äù after its number suggests it‚Äôs another mini-set in the same vein as Mythical Island.</strong></p>



<p>If true, it‚Äôs likely to have around <strong>80-100 new cards</strong> or so. Mythical Island introduced 86 new cards to Pok√©mon TCG Pocket, but because of how bunched-up releases are, it could be even fewer this time. We‚Äôll have to wait and see what Creatures Inc. and DeNA have planned.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-console-ps-xbox-rival-rumours/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-is-building-a-%E2%80%98steam-console%E2%80%99-to-rival-ps5-and-xbox-rumour-claims.1099386/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-console-ps-xbox-rival-rumours/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Late last year, rumours surfaced regarding a developing Steam-based console being built by Valve. It was claimed that the device was being designed alongside new iterations of the Steam Controller and a fresh VR headset. On social media, tech insiders were mulling over proposed specs for a Steam console, but of course, the claims were <strong>not </strong>addressed by Valve.</p>



<p>Today, fresh rumours have hit the airwaves, with eXtas1s commenting on social media (and uploading a video) about the ‚Äòvery spicy‚Äô claim that the rumoured Steam console will compete with PS5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-competition">More Competition</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://xcancel.com/eXtas1stv/status/1886541769833398343?t=_-orVAMq3NTYowaQr-QYbQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, eXtas1s wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>New Steam console?</p>



<p>Very spicy with Valve, it already seems that a new Steam console is coming that competes against PS5 and Xbox in the future.</p>



<p>Thanks to HandleDeck, we have learned that Valve works closely with AMD and its RDNA 4 technologies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a follow-up video, eXtas1s expanded on the rumour ‚Äì but I don‚Äôt speak Spanish, so perhaps you‚Äôll have better luck breaking this down:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EX-CEO de PLAYSTATION ATACA: &quot;XBOX = SEGA&quot; üò® FORZA √âXITO en PS5 ü§Ø REVIEW Kingdom Come Deliverance 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8f3D79aoro8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Valve has had plenty of success with the Steam Deck, which is considered one of the best handheld gaming devices on the market, but would the tech titan see the same results with a home console? It would be welcome competition, but it could skew the existing market.</p>



<p>For instance, it could prevent PlayStation from launching further ‚Äòexclusives‚Äô on PC, as anyone with a Steam console could play them there as opposed to buying a PlayStation console to get that traditional home gaming experience.</p>



<p>It could also be another flop, just like the Steam Machines that Valve tried to launch several years ago.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs important to stress that these rumours are to be taken with a pinch of salt until Valve confirms what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes. The cards are being played very close to the chest of this gaming giant, so we‚Äôll have to see what happens in due course.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-comments-midnight-society/</link>

<p>Dr Disrespect still hasn‚Äôt clawed his way back into the good graces of gamers worldwide and probably never will. Regardless, he‚Äôs still trying to retain some semblance of a streaming career across <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-relocation-rumble-youtube-stream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rumble</a> and YouTube, and recently, he secured monetisation again on YouTube several months after losing it in the face of ‚Äòminor messaging‚Äô allegations.</p>



<p>During a recent live stream, Guy ‚ÄòDr Disrespect‚Äô Beahm levelled some accusations at Midnight Society, the studio that he fronted until last June when things turned awry for him. In his words, ‚ÄòI can say all this s*** now.‚Äô</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-get-me-started-with-that-guy">‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Get Me Started With That Guy‚Äô</h2>



<p>Last summer, Dr Disrespect found himself embroiled in (another) controversy, this one concerning events that occurred in 2017. It was alleged that the supersized streamer had used Twitch‚Äôs ‚ÄòWhisper‚Äô mechanic to inappropriately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-ban/">message a minor</a>, which the creator copped to shortly after ‚Äì in a way.</p>



<p>That prompted him to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-loses-followers-allegations/">lose tens of thousands of followers</a>, be dropped by sponsors, and get cut out by fellow streamers.</p>



<p>Fast-forward several months, and Midnight Society, the studio that Dr Disrespect was a prolific part of until the allegations surfaced, is closing down. For a couple of years, Dr Disrespect provided a massive marketing pull, getting players around the world to invest in ‚ÄòDEADROP‚Äô, an NFT-backed extraction shooter that will now never see the light of day.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Dr Disrespect went in against Midnight Society:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was handled extremely poorly by leadership.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs unfortunate.</p>



<p>That tweet that weekend, it should have never gone out. It was never approved by me. They say, ‚Äòafter fully investigating‚Äô, whatever ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt investigate nothing.</p>



<p>I can say all this s*** now.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Then, the creator fired shots at Robert Bowling, the former Call of Duty dev who co-founded Midnight Society:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me f***ing started with that guy.</p>



<p>Don‚Äôt get me started with that guy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, data showed that while Dr Disrespect‚Äôs airtime has gone up, his viewership and peak counts are dropping rapidly, suggesting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/">there‚Äôs no comeback in store</a> for the disgraced creator.</p>
