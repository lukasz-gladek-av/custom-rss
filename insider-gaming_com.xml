<p>Steam could be getting ready to reveal the first details of its new VR headset. According to known Valve insider Brad Lynch, the company could be ready to announce its new device, expected to be called the Steam Frame, sometime this week.</p>



<p>He’s even been told a specific day to keep an eye on.</p>



<p><strong>“I’m just going to flat out say it,”</strong> Lynch said in his Discord. <strong>“I was told by a few sources, across a few weeks, to keep an eye out for this week. More specifically on Wednesday.”</strong></p>



<p>He added that it <strong>“doesn’t seem to be out of the question”</strong> for Valve to announce the device. Lynch says that he feels the company will <strong>“need a week or two to explain the device to people before opening orders anyway.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Valve for comment on these claims.</p>



<p>Rumors and reports about the new Steam VR headset have been out for months. Earlier this year, it was claimed that the plan was for Valve to release the headset <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-vr-headset-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the end of 2025</a> with a price of $1,200. In September, the likely name for the device was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-new-vr-headset-might-have-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered via a trademark filing</a> and datamining. Finally, in early October, it was reported that the Steam Frame had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valves-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entered mass production</a> with initial production plans to call for 400,000-600,000 units. </p>



<p>Of the mass production claims, Lynch said that the SteamVR Beta included Deckard, the device’s codename, DV1 and DV2 models. He said that <strong>“DV units are the final stages before the model (PV) that consumers will buy.”</strong></p>



<p>The Steam Frame is expected to launch alongside the new “Roy” controllers for the device as well. But that’s not all. Steam is reportedly working on a new Steam Controller 2 and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new SteamOS console</a> of some sort.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Sony State of Play Announced For November 2025]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re getting toward the end of 2025, but there’s still time for one final Sony State of Play showcase in November. The special Japan and Asia edition of the presentation features special looks at upcoming games where development is localized to those areas. </p>



<p>The September edition of State of Play was a biggie. We got an exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolverine gameplay trailer</a>, new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saros footage</a>, and much more. You’d be forgiven for thinking this was it for Sony’s State of Play events this year. However, PlayStation has one more event in the pipeline.</p>

<p>The State of Play Japan &amp; Asia broadcast takes place on November 11 (or November 12 in Japan), starting at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET / 11 PM CEST, or 7 AM JST.</p>



<p>An official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony blog</a> had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This Tuesday, we’re bringing you a special episode of State of Play running for more than 40 minutes, focusing on games created in Japan and across Asia, alongside a few other exciting updates.</p>



<p>From beloved series to distinctive indie creations, the show, hosted by voice actor Yuki Kaji, will be packed with great games, interviews, and new looks at anticipated titles.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly, it will be 40 minutes long—so it’s not short!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[9 New Gamemodes Are in Development for Battlefield 6’s Post-Launch Content]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-9-new-gamemodes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/9-new-gamemodes-are-in-development-for-battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-post-launch-content.1348564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has found that at least 9 new gamemodes for Battlefield 6 are at various stages of development for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-amazon-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>‘s post-launch content.</p>



<p>Last month, we revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-more-game-modes-could-be-coming-to-battlefield-6-datamine-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six game modes were in development for Battlefield 6</a>; since the release of the game’s first season, more have been added to the game’s files. Two of the gamemodes that we previously reported on, Sabotage and Strikepoint have already been confirmed to be coming to the game, which leaves Raid, Payload, Squad Shootout, and Tank Hunt remaining for the original six.</p>



<h2 id="h-five-new-battlefield-6-gamemodes">Five New Battlefield 6 Gamemodes</h2>



<p>Yet, within the game files, Insider Gaming has also discovered five new gamemodes which are labelled at ‘Prototypes’ and are seemingly very early in development.</p>



<p>These gamemodes are: Convoy, Fantastic Four, Gunmaster, Touchdown, and Tug of War. The strings of the files are as follows:</p>



<p>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/Convoy/Setup/MUT_Convoy Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/FantasticFour/Setup/MUT_FantasticFour Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/Gunmaster/Setup/MUT_GunMaster Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/Touchdown/Presentation/GM_Touchdown_Presentation Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/TugOfWar/Mode/MUT_TugOfWar</p>



<p>As mentioned in Insider Gaming’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous coverage on Naval Combat</a>, “Glacier” is the codename for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>While some of these gamemodes may just be internal codenames, Gunmaster in particular is almost certainly a ‘Gun Game’ like gamemode where the players’ weapons change per kill. Traditionally, the player has to cycle through 20 different weapons and needs to knife and kill an enemy for the final kill in order to be victorious. </p>



<p>Tug of War likely refers to a Breakthrough-esuq gamemode, possible where players need to capture flags to progress through the map. If a flag is captured, the next flag will push the enemy team back, but can be retaken to continue the “tug of war” for victory.</p>



<p>As for what the other gamemodes could be is anyone’s guess, and we’d love to hear what you think they could be on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Where Are The Bosses in Fortnite x The Simpsons? How to Find Boss Locations, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-boss-locations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-are-the-bosses-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-how-to-find-boss-locations-explained.1348540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite bosses are a feature that players have become well-versed with other the years, though The Simpsons mini-season shakes things up and makes them harder to locate.</p>



<p>The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite made a big change to bosses, which don’t have fixed spawn locations and only appear on your map when you are near them, making it harder to track them down when completing quests or on the hunt for loot.</p>



<p>For all the details on how to track down each of the bosses available in Fortnite during The Simpsons mini-season, check out our guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-witch-marge-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Witch Marge in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Haunting. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Witch Marge spawns randomly during The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, though she is most commonly found in the Springfield Town Center POI.</strong></p>



<p>In this area, Witch Marge can be encountered in the woods between Springfield Town Square and Kamp Krusty, though she can also appear in the POI itself, and these aren’t the only locations where she can be found.</p>



<p>You should also check out the area south of Evergreen Terrace and hunt in the Springfield Slurpworks POI, both of which are areas where Mitch Marge also spawns regularly.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-evil-homer-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Evil Homer in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<p><strong>Evil Homer does not have a fixed spawn during The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, but, like Witch Marge, is often found in the Springfield Town Square POI near </strong>the courthouse<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>However, it’s not guaranteed he will spawn there, and you should check out other areas too if you’re on the hunt for him. Personally, I’ve found the east of Evergreen Terrace by Springfield Gorge to be a location where Evil Homer is often lurking.</p>



<p>Finally, the fields around Cletus’ Corn Hole are a common haunting ground for Evil Homer, so you should check this area too.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-krusty-the-clown-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Krusty the Clown in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<p><strong>Like other bosses in The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, Krusty the Clown does not have a fixed spawn location. However, he can commonly be encountered at the Springfield Slurpworks.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for any boss to take down, Springfield Town Square is an ideal landing spot, as all three bosses can often be found here, but there are other areas to check for Krusty, too.</p>



<p>Like Evil Homer, Cletus’ Corn Hole is a good hunting spot for Krusty, along with the small island found east of Donut District—although this location is quite out of the way off the beaten track.</p>
