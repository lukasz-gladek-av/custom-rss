<p>Bloober Team has announced that Cronos: The New Dawn will get a new difficulty option called Temporal Diver Mode in 2026.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is a survival-horror third-person shooter released by Bloober Team this September. The title features a spectacular narrative blended with challenging gameplay, which has been well received by players. However, some have complained about it being too difficult for casual players. Now, the developers are introducing a new, easier difficulty mode to open the title for more players. </p>

<p>Bloober Team posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2BVRu26Fug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new video</a> on their official YouTube channel, announcing the arrival of the Temporal Diver Mode difficulty option for Cronos: The New Dawn. The video shows a cinematic in which the Bloober Team HQ receives calls to lower the difficulty or introduce an easy mode for players because it can be too challenging for non-hardcore gamers, or players who wish to experience just the story. </p>



<p>The video ends with the developers addressing the players directly, stating that “Cronos: The New Dawn was a game developed to challenge the players.” However, they have heard the community’s feedback and acknowledged that some would like to explore the story at their own pace. Hence, they are working to create a new difficulty option called Temporal Diver Mode and plan to release it in early 2026. </p>
