</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-goblin-mk2-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Goblin Mk2 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Ranger Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Suppressor</strong> will come in handy to hide your position in the minimap, and of course, suppress the gunfire sounds of the AR. The <strong>Ranger Foregrip</strong> will improve the weapon’s accuracy and mobility by enhancing the horizontal recoil control and sprinting movement speed.</p>



<p>Attach the <strong>Extended Mag I</strong> and you will have a few extra bullets in the magazines that will be useful in shooting down some more enemies. The <strong>Commando Grip</strong> will significantly improve the aiming and sprint-to-fire speeds, enhancing the weapon’s handling.</p>



<p>Lastly, attach the <strong>Recoil Springs</strong> mod for some more improvements in horizontal and vertical recoil control.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-goblin-mk2">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Goblin Mk2</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>For Assault Rifle loadouts, <strong>Enforcer</strong> is the best specialty you can use and it’s no different for the Goblin Mk2. Equip Gung-Ho, Assassin, and Double Time to activate Enforcer and enjoy temporary buffs in movement speeds and health regeneration rates.</p>



<p>Once you unlock <strong>Perk Greed</strong>, keep Dexterity in the fourth Perk slot. This will ensure you face less weapon sway while sprinting, jumping, and sliding your way through enemies.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-goblin-mk2">Best Secondary for Goblin Mk2</h2>



<p>Use the fully automatic pistol, <strong>Grekhova</strong>, as a secondary weapon with the Goblin Mk2.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-goblin-mk2-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Goblin Mk2 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You need to reach <strong>player level 46</strong> to unlock the Tsarkov 7.62 in BO6.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-goblin-mk2-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the Goblin Mk2 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the Goblin Mk2 offers great TTK and mobility but fails to be among the meta weapons in BO6 because of its slow fire rate.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-goblin-mk2-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the Goblin Mk2 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The best alternatives to the Goblin Mk2 in BO6 are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS Val</a>. Both of these Assault Rifles are dominating the meta right now, thanks to their insane TTK, fire rates, and mobility.</p>

<p>100 Thieves made an interesting business move today regarding its franchise spot in the LCS (League Championship Series). The popular esports organization announced it has officially sold its franchise spot while transitioning to a Guest Partner. </p>



<p>What does all of this mean, though?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-100-thieves-transitions-to-guest-partner-in-lcs-after-selling-franchise-spot">100 Thieves Transitions to Guest Partner in LCS After Selling Franchise Spot </h2>



<p>100 Thieves has been a part of the LCS for some time now, being one of the biggest organizations with a franchise spot. However, as the company makes new strategic plans for its investments, it would seem like being franchised by LCS is not in its future anymore. </p>



<p>However, 100 Thieves will still be involved with the league. </p>



<p>“Riot has made the strategic decision to buy back the slot and we have been presented with a unique opportunity to transition as a provisional Guest Partner for the 2025 season,” said 100 Thieves on Twitter.</p>

<p>So, what does this mean?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-100-thieves-to-become-a-guest-partner-in-lcs">100 Thieves to Become a Guest Partner in LCS</h2>



<p>It is no secret that League of Legends esports was the birthing place for 100 Thieves’s esports program. Hearing them exit the franchise may come as a shock, but it does not mean the team is done competitively with the game.</p>



<p>The team has made it to four of the seven championships ever hosted in the LCS, cementing them as one of the best teams in the league. Now, with its exit from the franchise, 100 Thieves is officially a Guest Partner.</p>



<p>This means that the team will still have a slot in the LCS (now known as the LTA); they will just not be investing in the league like before. </p>



<p>However, this asks many questions regarding the team’s financial status. While 100 Thieves may be one of the biggest esports organizations in the world, having to sell its franchise spot in one of the biggest esports only leads to the belief that the team is struggling financially.</p>



<p>Sure, they are a Guest Partner for 2025, but what about 2026? Will the 100 Thieves League of Legends team even exist at that point?</p>

<p>Call of Duty players are already chomping at the bit, as they can’t wait for Ranked Play in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a>. Unfortunately, the competitive mode hasn’t been available at launch, but Treyarch have confirmed that the game will have it. That said, its absence and the recent trend in previous CoD titles to introduce the mode late has left the community wondering when it will arrive.</p>



<p>Here’s everything we know about when Ranked Play is coming to Black Ops 6.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-black-ops-6-ranked-play-release-date">Black Ops 6 Ranked Play release date</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-does-ranked-play-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ranked Play work in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-what-modes-are-in-black-ops-6-ranked-play">What modes are in Black Ops 6 Ranked Play?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-will-black-ops-6-have-ranked-play-rewards">Will Black Ops 6 have Ranked Play rewards?</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-ranked-play-release-date">Black Ops 6 Ranked Play release date</h2>



<p>Ranked Play will arrive in Black Ops 6 on<strong> November 14, 2024</strong>, which is also when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/">Season 1</a> begins. As soon as the first season update lands for Black Ops 6, players will be able to dive in and start their competitive journey, where they’ll be progressing through ranks and playing against similarly skilled enemies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-ranked-play-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ranked Play work in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.treyarch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Treyarch</a> will likely follow the same format as previous Ranked Play modes, with teams of 4 battling it out on a pool of carefully selected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/">maps and modes</a>. Players will have to build their loadout, working around restricted weapons, Perks, and Equipment in the Gunsmith. </p>



<p>The restrictions and rules are based on the Call of Duty League (CDL), the esports scene for the iconic FPS franchise. Players will climb <strong>Skill Divisions</strong>, which could be the same ones found in MW3, Bronze to Iridescent. As you win games, you gain Ranked Points that move you up these divisions, while if you lose the opposite happens.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-modes-are-in-black-ops-6-ranked-play">What modes are in Black Ops 6 Ranked Play?</h2>



<p>We expect Black Ops 6 to have <strong>Hardpoint, Control, and Search and Destroy</strong>, but Treyarch are yet to confirm the modes. This is based on the modes that were available in MW3’s Ranked Play, which we expect to be similar to BO6’s.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-ops-6-have-ranked-play-rewards">Will Black Ops 6 have Ranked Play rewards?</h2>



<p>We haven’t got much information regarding Black Ops 6’s Ranked Play just yet, but <strong>we assume that the mode will come with a reward system</strong>. Players will likely receive various rewards based on the Skill Division that they reach, the higher up the ladder they climb, the better the rewards. </p>



<p>If the rewards are similar to previous iterations of Ranked Play, you can expect to earn Calling Cards, Emblems, Weapon Skins, and more.</p>
