<p>We’ve witnessed a lot of turmoil surrounding the development of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, with delays and controversy marring the title before its release. Well, as it turns out, there may be a reason why the upcoming AC game is so controversial. It appears Assassin’s Creed Shadows is going to be the first game for a number of game developers at Ubisoft. While it’s common practice to bring in new talent regularly and keep the old-timers on their toes, it would seem much of the team behind Shadows is completely green behind the ears.</p>



<p>In an appearance at the External Development Summit 2024 (XDS24), Assassin’s Creed Executive Producer Marc-Alexis Côté said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the things that I’ve noticed since the pandemic is that we have a lot of juniors in our teams. Probably half the team that’s building Assassin’s Creed is building a game for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the video below is set to begin approximately where Marc-Alexis Côté spoke about the game’s development, you can watch the full keynote from XDS24 here:</p>

<p>A terminally ill fan of the Borderlands series was given the opportunity to play Borderlands 4 after his plea reached developer Gearbox.</p>



<p>Caleb McAlpine, a Borderlands fan with Stage 4 terminal cancer, was flown out with a friend to Gearbox Software in order to experience the upcoming game. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1h01zdn/just_an_update_thank_you_everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Reddit</a>, McAlpine spoke about his experience at the studio. </p>



<p>After meeting the developers and CEO Randy Pitchford to playing an early build of Borderlands 4, he wanted to express his thanks to everyone who helped make this dream a reality. </p>



<p>“We got to play what they have for Borderlands 4 so far and it was amazing,” McAlpine said. “I don’t know if I will be around when the game Comes out but I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of your love and support and for helping in making this happen. It truly was an amazing experience and it was just awesome.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-announced-at-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch sometime</a> in 2025 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. More details about the game will be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>McApline’s latest prognosis as of October was that he had less than two years if chemotherapy slowed the progression of the cancer. </p>



<p>We wish Caleb all the best in his current fight. </p>

<p>Forza Horizon 5 was all set to launch on PlayStation 5 (PS5), but the game’s release on the console was ultimately delayed. That’s according to a new claim by known leaker eXtas1s.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1861854891389432228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, they said that the release was delayed over the summer, but made sure to clarify that it wasn’t cancelled. It was then said that the belief is that the game would be a success on PS5 and that it’s still in the plans. </p>



<p>“It will arrive,” they said via translation. “I don’t know when, but it will arrive.”</p>

<p>As far as why Forza Horizon 5’s release on PS5 was delayed, that wasn’t revealed by eXtas1s.</p>



<p>Over the past year, Xbox has made more of an effort to bring its exclusive games to other platforms, including the PS5. Earlier this year, the company released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-pentiment-are-first-xbox-games-coming-to-other-consoles-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment</a> on the system. It was also revealed over the summer that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, another Xbox console exclusive, would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make its way to PS5 in 2025</a>. Current reports <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest an April 2025</a> release date for the game.</p>



<p>As with any rumors, please take them with a grain of salt until a release is officially announced or </p>
