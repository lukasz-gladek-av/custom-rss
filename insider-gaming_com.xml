            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the company <strong>wants to put its games “on every platform”</strong>. Just recently, Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of Combat Evolved, is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heading to PlayStation consoles</a> at launch, a first for the series.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-possibly-considering-gears-of-war-playstation-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> made the jump to PlayStation 5, as will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025</a>. Many Xbox exclusives have slowly been heading to different consoles. Now, it seems this is the start of many, maybe even ending the exclusivity fans have come to respect forever.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-wants-its-games-to-be-everywhere-says-ceo-satya-nadella">Microsoft Wants Its Games To Be Everywhere, Says CEO Satya Nadella</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The consoles wars are now over. What does that mean for Microsoft's gaming business model?</p><p>"We just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere; consoles, PC, mobile, cloud, or TV." – <a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@satyanadella</a> <a href="https://t.co/AOGf3mj0Kf">pic.twitter.com/AOGf3mj0Kf</a></p></div>— TBPN (@tbpn) <a href="https://twitter.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The news comes from <a href="https://x.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TBPN</a>, as the group chatted with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about the company’s new partnership with OpenAI. The CEO talks a bit about Xbox and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/white-house-uses-ai-donald-trump-master-chief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘end’ of the console wars</a>. In the clip, <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1983255817785597980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">transcribed by GameFile’s Stephen Totilo</a>, Nadella states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Remember, the biggest gaming business is the Windows business,” says Nadella to TBPN. “To us, gaming on Windows, and of course Steam – has built a massive marketplace on top of it and done a very successful job of it.&nbsp;So to us, the way we are thinking about gaming is; let’s first of all, now we are the largest publisher, after the Activision [deal] so therefore we want to be a fantastic publisher, similar approach to what we did with Office. <strong>We’re going to be everywhere, in every platform</strong>. We want to make sure, whether it’s consoles, whether it’s the PC, whether it’s mobile, whether it’s cloud gaming – or the TV; <strong>we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not too surprising to see Microsoft and Xbox shed the exclusivity factor. Many games, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sales-drop-about-90-in-japan/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, sold less than stellar due to sticking to one console. While it’s franchises, especially Halo, never seemed to have that problem, it may lead to more sales. Still, the recent shift, plus <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-is-outpacing-ps4-while-xbox-series-trails-xbox-one-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lackluster sales of Xbox Series X|S</a>, do ring out a touch off for the once-influential company. Whether it’s next console, rumored for a 2027 release, is going to include big changes is unclear.</p>



<p>What do you think of Satya Nadella’s comment on bringing Xbox games everywhere? Is it too ambitious? Too risky? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-twitch-hit-by-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Amazon layoffs</a>, <strong>New World is stopping development</strong> and ending with Season 10 and the recent Nighthaven update. The news comes after more than 14,000 were let go from Amazon and its affiliates like Twitch. </p>



<p>Released in 2021 on PC and in 2024 for consoles, New World, also known as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-aeternum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World Aeternum</a>, is an MMORPG from Amazon Games. It was revealed as one of three titles announced to be in development for Amazon. New World was the only one to succeed, despite abandoning its original free-to-play entry. Unfortunately, the game’s journey will stop here, unfortunately ending development and future updates.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-world-ending-with-season-10-after-amazon-layoffs-servers-shutting-down-after-2026">New World Ending with Season 10 After Amazon Layoffs, Servers Shutting Down After 2026</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a statement from <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the New World team</a> on the official website, development on the game has ended. The recent Season 10 and Nighthaven update, which launched earlier this month, are the final updates. <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In the blog</a>, the team states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we’ve reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates. The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for&nbsp;<em>New World</em>&nbsp;on PC and consoles. It is only after much consideration that we’ve reached this decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Both the Nighthaven and Rise of the Angry Earth updates are now free for fans on PC and Aeternum will remain on PS+ Premium and Extra for the time being. <strong>Servers for New World will remain open through 2026</strong>, with more information regarding the game’s future to be revealed at a later date. </p>



<p>While not stated in the blog, the team was hit with multiple firings due to today’s massive-scale Amazon layoff. A report from Bloomberg, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-twitch-hit-by-layoffs/">which we wrote on</a>, said that Amazon’s game studios were hit hard. Specifically, the layoffs were felt hardest for teams developing MMOs, like Amazon Game Studios. Sadly, this will likely be the first of many bad news stories surrounding the topic, as the studios were working on multiple new titles that are now in jeopardy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We received a welcome treat with the launch of Battlefield 6’s REDSEC content, as it included a new DLC trophy list specifically for battle royale and Gauntlet content. Insider Gaming has the full list for you to check out, and for something so short, it’s deceptively grindy.</p>



<p>Once we got wind of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-trophy-list-all-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 trophy list</a>, we’d have been forgiven for thinking this would be the extent of BF 6’s trophies. Alas, we were wrong, and we’re glad to say we were. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REDSEC battle royale</a> content was introduced with Season 1, and so with it came the awesome new Gauntlet mode.</p>



<p>Gauntlet and traditional BR make up the fabric of the new Battlefield 6 trophies and achievements, so let’s check them out.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-6-redsec-dlc-trophies-amp-achievements">All Battlefield 6 REDSEC DLC Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>

<p>The extra Battlefield 6 DLC REDSEC trophy list is like a 3ft powerlifter—Small in stature, but doing a lot of heavy lifting. There aren’t many trophies and achievements here, but they will take you a long time to achieve.</p>



<p>Here’s the complete list of DLC REDSEC trophies for Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">May the Odds Forever Be in Your Favor</td><td data-align="center">Play 74 matches in any version of Battle Royale.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Here’s Your Birthday Present</td><td data-align="center">Deploy 42 call-ins.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Collector</td><td data-align="center">Loot 10 Superior or Custom items.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stone Cold</td><td data-align="center">Stun enemies 316 times in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rise from Your Grave</td><td data-align="center">Revive teammates 1988 times in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Army of Two</td><td data-align="center">Win 7 matches in Battle Royale: Duos.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Never-Ending Game</td><td data-align="center">Play 125 rounds of Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Everybody Fights, Nobody Quits</td><td data-align="center">Win a Battle Royale match as a full squad with total squad survival.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mission Accepted</td><td data-align="center">Complete 214 missions in any version of Battle Royale.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Dog of War</td><td data-align="center">College 9 dog tags in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mozambique Hotel</td><td data-align="center">Ping a Shotgun in Battle Royale.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-battlefield-6-redsec-dlc">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies In Battlefield 6 REDSEC DLC?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s a small helping of 11 extra PlayStation Trophies and 11 Xbox Achievements to explore, discover, and obtain in Battlefield 6’s optional REDSEC DLC list.</strong></p>



<p>Quite often, when we do these lists, we have to give Xbox owners the bad news that PS users get an additional trophy. This isn’t the case this time around! DLC trophy lists don’t carry a Platinum, so it’s a level playing field for once.</p>



<p>If you are on PS5, it’s broken down into 10 Bronze Trophies and 1 Silver Trophy. Happy hunting, soldiers.</p>



<p>Let us know what you think of the extra list. Should more live-service games add more trophies and achievements as DLC lists?
