<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set to release on PlayStation 5 (PS5) on April 17, and with it comes enhancements for the game on the PS5 Pro.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Bethesda went into details on what players with the high-end console will get when they load up the game.</p>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will have native 4K resolution on the system along with advanced ray tracing features. The goal of the optimizations, per Bethesda, is to ensure players ‚Äúachieve higher and more consistent frame rates‚Äù.</p>



<p>‚ÄúPlaying Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at a native 4K resolution really is the best way to appreciate the level of detail the team at MachineGames has poured into every corner of the world,‚Äù production director John Jennings said via the post. ‚ÄúYou could spend hours just walking around the different environments admiring every little thing, from each artifact in Marshall College‚Äôs impressive collection to the verdant beauty of Sukhothai‚Äôs jungles.‚Äù</p>



<h2 id="h-other-ps5-features-for-indiana-jones">Other PS5 Features For Indiana Jones</h2>



<p>Aside from the PS5 Pro enhancements, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 will utilize the DualSense controller‚Äôs haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. The controller‚Äôs light bar will also give players visual feedback into Indy‚Äôs current status.</p>



<p>‚ÄúFor example, when you enter combat, the LED light around the touchpad will turn yellow, or pulse yellow if the NPCs are searching for you,‚Äù Bethesda‚Äôs Anne Lewis writes. ‚ÄúIf your health gets low, the light will pulse red until you heal up. Using a consumable to restore health like food or a bandage will turn the light green for a few seconds.‚Äù</p>



<p>Other features on the console include SSD optimization, 60 frames per second, 3D audio, HD rumble, and more.</p>

<p>Over 2 million citizens have explored Atomfall‚Äôs dangerous biomes, foraging for meat, drinking beer, and bonking druids on the head with cricket bats. The RPG is shaping up to be one of Rebellion‚Äôs greatest achievements‚Äîif not the greatest‚Äîand the developer has a ton of fun facts about the two million Atomfall players who‚Äôve played the game.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-rebellion-most-successful-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall is Rebellion‚Äôs most successful launch ever</a>. This is a remarkable stat when you consider the company is probably best known for Sniper Elite. Nevertheless, the attempt to make a British-based RPG set around a nuclear disaster has paid dividends. </p>



<p>Players have spent the first few weeks exploring the land and raising hell. Once you‚Äôve raised enough hell, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-skethermoor-radio-tower-in-atomfall-keycard-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlocked Radio Towers</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-upgrade-weapons-in-atomfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgraded enough weapons</a>, you need to kick back with a pasty and some tea.</p>



<h2 id="h-rebellion-reveals-incredible-atomfall-launch-stats">Rebellion Reveals Incredible Atomfall Launch Stats</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This guy has probably been killed many times over. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Citizens of Wyndham (that tannoy announcement lives rent-free in my head) have been having their fill. According to an <a href="https://x.com/AtomfallGame/status/1910679392696611192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">April 11 Rebellion post</a>, over <strong>2 million players have set foot in alternate-history Cumbria</strong>.</p>



<p>During their time, they‚Äôve found nearly <strong>13 million Caches</strong> using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-metal-detector-in-atomfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Detector</a>, <strong>killed six million enemies with classic Cricket Bat</strong>, ordered over a <strong>quarter of a million pints of beer</strong>, and scoffed <strong>14 million tins of meat</strong>‚Äîand counting.</p>



<div><article><p><span>üì¢ CITIZENS OF WYNDHAM,
You‚Äôve all been working so hard in our community, we‚Äôve pinned up some interesting facts about your contribution, flourishing under PROTOCOL ‚öõÔ∏è </span></p></article></div>



<p>With Atomfall being free on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-atomfall-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a>, these player numbers seem certain to rise. We gave the RPG a glowing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-review-rebellion-curveball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming review</a>, and I honestly hope Rebellion decides to venture down a future path not necessarily filled with Sniper Rifle glare and Nazis.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps-plus-prices-rising-some-regions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps-plus-prices-are-rising-in-some-regions.1161816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps-plus-prices-rising-some-regions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The price of PlayStation Plus will increase in dozens of countries. As of the writing of this text, the increase in subscription value will be applied in South American countries, such as Brazil, as well as in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/ps-plus-price-hikes-strike-even-more-countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oceania</a> and certain Asian countries, including Malaysia, China, Singapore, and Thailand.</p>



<p>In South America, this increase has generated outrage on social media. It marks the second increase in subscription value in less than two years. PlayStation issued a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/20250410-psplus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vague justification</a>, claiming that all PS Plus tiers have become more expensive due to ‚Äúglobal market conditions.‚Äù</p>



<p>Analyzing the new prices, it seems that PlayStation‚Äôs goal is to align subscription prices with those in the United States. The 12-month PlayStation Plus Extra, for example, is sold for $99.99.</p>



<p>Existing users in <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/br/aumento-preco-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brazil</a></strong> will now pay R$546.90 (a 12% increase), which is equivalent to $92.67. This price globalization movement disregards macroeconomic factors such as disparities in purchasing power and the differing levels of inflation in various countries.</p>



<p>Overall, the increases ranged from 8% to 21% among the different subscription tiers. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the quality of the games added to the catalog has indeed improved in recent months. Notable inclusions include High On Life, Robocop: Rogue City, and the announcement of <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-playstation-plus-game-catalog-games-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a></strong> yesterday. Additionally, two games were released Day One on the service: Blue Prince, the indie hit of the moment, and Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage.</p>



<p>Currently, no information has been released about a possible PS Plus price increase in North America.</p>
