<p>What’s Marvel Rivals Esports going to look like is a question that every player has been asking, and the game director of the hero shooter has just revealed their approach towards the competitive aspect of the title. &nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, Marvel Rivals game director Guangyun Chen was asked about Netease’s esports aspirations for the game. Chen responded that Marvel Rivals esports is something they have been thinking about “on a broader scale, looking at the picture as a whole.” Their approach aims to cater to both competitive and casual players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chen added that the team hopes their competitive modes or tournaments can “coexist” with their quick-play mode. The developers have observed several games managing healthy competitive and quick-play environments simultaneously. They will use references from these titles to help “both player pools thrive.” The director didn’t reveal any upcoming esports tournaments for Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Apart from their competitive plans for Marvel Rivals, the director also spoke about new additions to the roster during this interview. Players can expect new heroes to be added every three months; <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here are more details</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals have figured out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-bots-are-being-sniffed-out-by-invisible-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to locate bots</a> with the help of Invisible Woman’s ability. Also, five more heroes are reportedly arriving for the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-professor-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including X-Men’s Professor X</a>.

<p>Marvel Rivals fans won’t have to wait too long to see the game’s roster of heroes expand moving forward. In a new interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, game director Guangyun Chen gave an update on developer NetEase’s plans for new characters in the game.</p>



<p>Chen says that everything will revolve around the game’s seasons. A season in Marvel Rivals will last three months, but will be broken into two halves. During that time, players will get a new hero every half season. That means one hero every month-and-a-half for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>“We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community,” Chen said while adding that, in addition to new heroes, each season will include seasonal stories and new maps.</p>



<p>As far as which heroes will be added and when, Chen says that it’ll be “guided by the overall gameplay experience or theme that we want to create for each season.”</p>







<p>“So it’ll revolve around the season and right now, at post-launch, we have eight Vanguards and seven Strategists at launch,” he said. “The team believes that it gives the players a solid variety for tactical match-ups or team composition. Having more Duelists at the moment will definitely enhance the Duelist experience, letting players dive a little bit deeper into that aspect.”</p>



<p>Lastly, Chen thanked the community for feedback on heroes and say that the feedback will be used in making decisions on when to release certain heroes as well.</p>



<p>“[We] want to make sure that everyone feels heard and excited,” he said.</p>
