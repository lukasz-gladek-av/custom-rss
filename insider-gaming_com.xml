<p>Capcom is looking to reward loyal Monster Hunter Wilds players by offering tempting in-game goodies such as Lifepowder and Silver Eggs in return for linking their Capcom ID. </p>



<p>Aptly, there are a ton of wild gaming promotions left, right, and center. You only have to look at Call of Duty giving out rewards like there’s no tomorrow for crossovers with Mountain Dew, Dominos, Little Caesers, and much more every year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mcdonalds-promotion-happy-meals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pocket offered goodies for buying Happy Meals</a> too. But Capcom has a much simpler ask of its Monster Hunter Wilds players who’ve helped make the game the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-become-the-fastest-selling-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling in Capcom history</a>.</p>



<p>Link your Capcom ID—or register for one if you haven’t already—and your in-game journey can become even more fruitful.</p>

<p>No matter how many hours you’ve put into Monster Hunter Wilds, free bonuses are always welcome. <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1902676875337465962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom says on X</a>: “Got a CAPCOM ID account? Linking it to the platform you play Monster Hunter Wilds on will <strong>unlock an item pack for you in-game</strong> that’s stocked with useful items!”</p>



<p>But what are these free items you ask? I’ll tell you:</p>



<ul>
<li>Armor Sphere × 10</li>



<li>Demon Powder × 5</li>



<li>Hardshell Powder × 5</li>



<li>Herbal Powder × 5</li>



<li>Lifepowder × 10</li>



<li>Mega Potion × 30</li>



<li>Silver Egg × 1</li>



<li>Well-done Steak × 10</li>
</ul>



<p>They all come as part of a juicy item pack you can claim in Monster Hunter Wilds. If you’ve never registered a Capcom ID before, the <a href="https://cid.capcom.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">registration process</a> is very simple. <strong>The items can be claimed in-game from the Support Desk.</strong></p>



<div><article><p><span>Got a CAPCOM ID account? Linking it to the platform you play Monster Hunter Wilds on will unlock an item pack for you in-game that’s stocked with useful items!

<p>Cheating and hacking continue to be rampant across first-person online shooters. Delta Force is another that keeps being attacked, but if you are found guilty of cheating here, expect to face extreme consequences in the form of 10-year bans, and more. </p>



<p>There seems to be cheaters everywhere you look in gaming. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cheaters-with-lifetime-bans-will-receive-a-second-chance-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite is known for handing out lifetime bans</a>—although the shooter is looking to give players reprieve—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-rules-rainbow-six-siege-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege has gone after cheaters</a>, and Call of Duty has infamously had problems with hackers over the years. </p>



<p>It’s a neverending problem, but one Delta Force is keeping on top of. Its latest cheat report indicates it’s stopped 20,000 cheaters in one week alone.</p>

<p>A March 20 post on the <a href="https://x.com/DeltaForce_Game/status/1902666885906469042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Delta Force X page</a> makes for interesting reading. “Our G.T.I. Security team are working around the clock to kick cheaters out of the game,” it says. It also mentions five types of bans Delta Force is handing out, including the hefty fine of a “10-year ban.”</p>



<p>The total number of cheaters targeted by Delta Force this week is <strong>20,024</strong>. Below, you can see the exact figures for each type of ban.</p>



<ul>
<li>10-Year Bans—<strong>1,446</strong></li>



<li>DMA Bans—<strong>365</strong></li>



<li>Devices Blocked—<strong>694</strong></li>



<li>Cheat Attempts Stopped—<strong>13,475</strong></li>



<li>Players Forced Offline—<strong>4,044</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/detail.html?father_content_id=80169c48a4720a450cab07aa9781d08ca521&amp;content_id=80169c48a4720a450cab07aa9781d08ca521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delta Force website</a> provides a more in-depth look at the bans and actions geared toward cheaters. The report doubles down that “We adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards anyone found to be in violation of our game rules,” and also provides the beginning and ends of banned usernames.</p>



<p>It’s great to see Delta Force taking the cheater issue so seriously. It’s a game on the up after the frosty reception to the Black Hawk Down Campaign DLC which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players deemed to be “too difficult.”</a></p>
