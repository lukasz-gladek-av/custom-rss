<p>GTA 6’s parent company has stated they are “not worried” about the game influencing violent behaviour in the real world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Violence in video games has been a controversial subject in the industry for years, with the GTA series often being the poster boy for such campaigns. The popular series will receive a brand new instalment this fall, with Rockstar finally releasing GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year</a>. Many wonder if new allegations related to violence will pop up again, but Take-Two’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, doesn’t seem to be worried about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/10/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-take-two-interactive-chairman-and-ceo-strauss-zelnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/gta-6-publisher-claps-back-against-tv-media-inciting-disproven-violent-video-game-rhetoric/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Video Gamer</a>), Zelnick was asked whether he had concerns about GTA 6’s violence impacting the real world. He responded that he was “not worried.” Zelnick added, “To be clear: entertainment doesn’t create behaviour; entertainment reflects behaviour.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CEO explained that entertainment allows people to express and engage with feelings as it tells stories. “The notion [that] entertainment creates behaviour has been tested and disproved over and over again.” Therefore, he isn’t concerned about GTA 6 influencing people to commit violence against others in the real world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zelnick also discussed TV shows and movies with “very realistic-looking” violence, which doesn’t influence wrong behaviour; hence, he’s “not worried about photorealistic video games” inciting such behaviour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Take-Two’s CEO recently spoke about GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping sell more consoles</a>. Also, the parent company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-stock-hits-all-time-high-after-gta-6-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stocks rose to an all-time high</a> when they reconfirmed the fall 2025 release window. Do you think GTA 6 will influence violent behaviour in the real world?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>More layoffs are happening at Unity. According to a post on its forums by Shanee Nishry, Unity has let go the team working on Unity Behavior along with other staff.</p>



<p>In her post, <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/an-update-on-behavior/1598451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nishry says</a> that the entire was included in the latest round of layoffs with support ending immediately. </p>



<p>“Thank you for your love and support for our project,” Nishry said. “Unfortunately we were told today that our team is included in the latest round of layoffs and we will not be able to support you any longer.</p>



<p>“I’ve reached out to leadership to ask if they can open source the project, but there is no guarantee.”</p>



<p>Nishry, who has been with Unity for five years, closed saying she wished Behavior could’ve been brought to the finish line. For those unaware, Behavior <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.behavior@1.0/manual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was a tool in development</a> for “authoring behaviors used to control non-player characters (NPCs) or objects.”</p>



<p>As far as other teams including in the layoffs, they seem to spread across the company with another senior software developer, Coline Turquin, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294738324894691329/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirming that she was</a> also “part of the recent layoffs”. Other employees have also taken to social media to reveal that they were let go by the company.</p>



<p>As of writing, Unity has yet to make an official statement on the layoffs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Unity for comment and clarification regarding how many people were let go in this latest wave. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. In 2024, the company let <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-laying-off-25-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go roughly 1,800 people</a>. Those layoffs cost Unity <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-cost-unity-205-million-to-make-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around $205 million</a>.</p>

<p>Number one ranked chess player and five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen is reportedly close to joining esports organization Team Liquid. The signing of the consensus best chess player in the world would align with the upcoming debut of chess at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<h2 id="h-magnus-carlsen-in-advanced-negotiations-with-liquid">Magnus Carlsen in “Advanced Negotiations” with Liquid</h2>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/en/articles/sources-magnus-carlsen-in-advanced-negotiations-with-team-liquid/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> from Sheep Esports reporter Alejandro “anonimotum” Gomis, Magnus Carlsen is likely to sign a deal with Liquid. Gomis notes in their report that with chess debuting at the Esports World Cup in 2025, Liquid is likely seeking to expand its winnings potential. In the inaugural EWC in 2024, Liquid finished second in the club championship race behind Falcons, taking home $4 million in addition to the prizes won from individual competitions.</p>



<p>To even those only slightly familiar with chess, Carlsen is known as one of the greatest players of all-time, if not the greatest. He’s held the International Chess Federation’s number one ranking since July 2011. He became the first player to hold the Chess, Rapid, and Blitz world championships at the same time in 2014, and then accomplished that feat again two more times. Carlsen most recently made the news after withdrawing from the Rapid and Blitz world championships, after being warned and fined for wearing jeans. He did end up competing in the Blitz tournament after the dress code was loosened, but again sparked controversy after successfully proposing to share the championship after a deadlocked tie with Ian Nepomniachtchi.</p>



<p>Chess isn’t the only game making its debut at the Esports World Cup in the event’s second year. Just yesterday, the EWC announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-esports-world-cup-riot-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT would join</a> Riot Games titles League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-2025-games/">at the 2025 tournament</a>.</p>



<p>Is this the biggest name outside of esports to sign with an organization? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
