<p>A new leak has revealed that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach will have a collectors edition costing $229.99.</p>



<p>That’s according to reliable dataminer <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, who reports that the game is gearing up for an announcement later today.</p>



<p>It’s theorised that the announcement could come during Kojima’s appearance at SXSW 2025, where Kojima Productions is set to host a panel. </p>



<p>If the pre-orders are not announced during the panel, then it’s almost certain that an announcement will be made later this month, as billbil-kun obtains his datamined information from the backend of websites and stores, meaning that the information has recently been uploaded to the backend and thus, ready for an announcement.</p>



<p>According to the leak, the game will have two different physical editions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Edition : 79.99 euros / 69.99 US dollars / 69.99 pounds sterling</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Collector’s&nbsp;Edition : $229.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>As pointed out in the leak, the contents of the editions are currently unclear, but at a hefty $229.99 price tag for the collectors edition, it’s likely to contain some kind of statue. The original Death Stranding collectors edition featured a Baby BB Pod Replica.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2 was officially revealed at the Game Awards in 2022 and is set to launch on the PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

<p>In Fallout 76, one of the peskiest things you’ll need to do is complete daily and weekly challenges. They might be to kill three Snallygasters or drink five Nuka Cola Cranberry beverages. It might be as trivial as picking up a handful of scrap items or something as challenging as laying waste to a horde of Deathclaws.</p>



<p>In this ultimate guide to Fallout 76 challenge locations, I’ll help you find everything you need to complete these challenges. As the challenges expand over time, so too will this guide, so be sure to bookmark it to keep coming back for more.</p>



<p>In no particular order, let’s start cracking through where to find these deliverables for Fallout 76 daily challenges.</p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-find-snallygasters-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Snallygasters in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>If you’re tasked with killing Snallygasters in Fallout 76 for a daily challenge, you’ll want to head to the nastier areas of the map, typically where you’ll find swamps, toxic pools, and other environmental hazards.</p>



<p>The best place to find a Snallygaster in Fallout 76 (or three) is the Flooded Trainyard.</p>



<p>If you head to the Flooded Trainyard in Fallout 76, you’ll be greeted by as many as half a dozen Snallygasters, ripe for the taking.</p>



<p>But where is the Flooded Trainyard?</p>



<p>Well, you’ll need to head out to the Cranberry Bog to find it:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The next best Snallygaster location in Fallout 76 is near Hemlock Holes in the Toxic Valley at the top of the map.  If you head south from Hemlock Holes, you’ll find Snallygasters and even a Grafton Monster.</p>



<p>Hemlock Holes can be found here:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-gulpers-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Gulpers in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It can be quite tough to track down a decent Gulper location in Fallout 76, but it’s not impossible. If you want to find Gulpers for a Fallout 76 daily challenge, you’ll need to head into The Mire and track through the dark and dingy forest.</p>



<p>The best place to find Gulpers in Fallout 76 is at the Gulper Lagoon – the clue is in the name, you see.</p>



<p>Here’s the top spot for Gulpers for daily challenges:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Alternatively, you could wait around for Moonshine Jamboree to pop. That event is positively bursting with Gulpers, so you’ll complete this daily challenge to kill Gulpers in no time at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-teapots-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Teapots in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It might seem bizarre, but Fallout 76’s daily challenge structure can include a request to find teapots for no reason whatsoever. It’s one of the trickier daily challenges as it requires you to find something small in a <strong>very </strong>large map, and ground loot can often seem randomised.</p>



<p>Fear not – it’s not all that difficult to find a teapot in Fallout 76, and if you need multiple, you can try server hopping to see if more teapots pop up.</p>



<p>To secure the best teapot locations in Fallout 76, you’ll want to check out the Palace of the Winding Path. At this location, you’ll find more than a dozen teapots scattered around.</p>



<p>This is where you’ll find teapots in Fallout 76 with ease:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find teapots at the Palace of the Winding Path, you can try elsewhere. The next best location for teapots in Fallout 76 is Helvetia, the small town near Vault 76. Here, you’ll find half a dozen (or more) teapots lurking around:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-mirelurk-eggs-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Mirelurk Eggs in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Forget the Mirelurks themselves, some Fallout 76 daily challenges want you to find <strong>Mirelurk Eggs</strong>. As you can imagine, you’ll almost always find the two together, so it could be a case of killing two birds with one stone.</p>



<p>It’s easy to find the best Fallout 76 Mirelurk Egg locations, though.</p>



<p>If you head to Quarry X3 in the Cranberry Bog, you’ll find dozens of Mirelurk Eggs. Be warned, though – you’ll have to tussle with Mirelurks and even a Mirelurk Queen if you’re unlucky:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The next best location for Mirelurk Eggs in Fallout 76 is around the Ohio River Adventures site. If you explore the riverbanks around this location, you’ll find Mirelurk Eggs everywhere:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-rabbits-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Rabbits in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It’s tough to find Rabbits in Fallout 76 because they’re so small and they blend in well with the environment, but with a keen eye (and perhaps VATS), you’ll be able to find a few for your daily challenges.</p>



<p>The best location for Rabbits in Fallout 76 is near the Whitespring Bunker. Here, you’ll need to explore the area, but you should manage to find Rabbits easily and tick off some Fallout 76 daily challenges:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find any Rabbits near the Whitespring Bunker, you can try checking the Twin Lakes location in the Savage Divide. This is the next best location for Rabbits in Fallout 76:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-a-bobblehead-in-fallout-76">Where to Find a Bobblehead in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Every Fallout fan knows about the Vault-Tec Bobbleheads. They’re everywhere throughout the series, and they come with some seriously helpful character upgrades.</p>



<p>In Fallout 76, Bobbleheads tend to spawn in static locations, which means they’ll always be there whenever you jump onto a new server – unless someone has grabbed one first.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best Bobblehead locations in Fallout 76:</p>



<p><strong>On top of the mansion at Clancy Manor:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>In Camden Park, near the Minor Miner Zone Sign or on top of the Widowmaker rollercoaster</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>In Morgantown Airport, sitting in a quarantine tent and in the laboratory hanger near the airstrip</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>There are hundreds of Bobblehead locations in Fallout 76, but these are some of the most reliable. Let me know in the comments where you go to find Bobbleheads in Fallout 76.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-magazines-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Magazines in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Like Bobbleheads, Magazine locations in Fallout 76 are static, and you’ll find consistent spawns everywhere. Unfortunately, Fallout 76 Magazines are also in high demand all the time, so you’ll need to have luck on your side <strong>or </strong>have access to a private server to find one.</p>



<p>There are some top Magazine locations in Fallout 76 that you can try checking before you’ve even walked too far from Vault 76, which is nice.</p>



<p><strong>Check the south cabin and the treehouse in the Alpine River Cabins:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Check the main reception counter, the kitchens, and the bunk beds in Bolton Greens:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Check the airplane seats, the kitchen platform, and the cockpit of the plane at Horizon’s Rest:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>All of these locations yield multiple Magazines in Fallout 76, so you should be able to find at least one or two to resolve these daily challenges.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-wood-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Wood in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It’s a relatively mundane thing to track down, but many daily challenges in Fallout 76 revolve around finding building materials. In this challenge, you’ll be tasked with finding Wood locations in Fallout 76. It might seem easy, but it’s not – you can’t just go cutting down trees, after all.</p>



<p>The best location to find Wood in Fallout 76 is at the Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp. This location can be found in the Savage Divide close to the Sons of Dane Compound, and it’s bursting with Wood for daily challenges in Fallout 76:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-soap-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Soap in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Finding Soap in Fallout 76 is important, as keeping clean in the harsh, post-apocalyptic wasteland is something all explorers should be doing. Perhaps not, but that doesn’t stop the Fallout 76 daily challenges circuit from tasking you with finding stacks of Soap in the game.</p>



<p>It’s a little tougher to find Soap as it’s not guaranteed to spawn in many places. However, I’ve tracked down the best locations for Soap in Fallout 76, so you don’t have to.</p>



<p>The easiest location for Soap in Fallout 76 is at the Whitespring Resort. Here, you can access the Whitespring Mall, and from there, you’ll track down the Whitespring Spa. In the Spa, you’ll find up to <strong>seven </strong>Soap at one time:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find any at the Whitespring Resort, you can find Soap in Fallout 76 by heading to Darling Sister’s Lab – just don’t ask me what they were doing with this much soap:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here, you’ll find <strong>seven </strong>Soap just sitting in a wheelbarrow.</p>
