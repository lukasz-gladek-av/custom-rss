<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has opened up all manner of possibilities for gamers and Nintendo itself. With Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 being one of 2025’s biggest and best games, it would only be fitting if the Switch 2 could welcome the GOTY contender onto the console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-teases-new-content-and-other-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> could already be 2025’s Game of the Year. That’s how revered and successful it is. It’s the highest-rated release this year, and a wider reach could introduce even more players to its unreal world. While it’s anything but official, a new quote from its developer suggests all hope isn’t lost.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/sandfall-interactive-esta-explorando-lanzar-clair-obscur-expedition-33-en-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintenderos</a> has reported that Sandfall Interactive isn’t ruling out bringing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to the Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>



<p>“We have some possibilities that we will explore, but at the moment we cannot confirm anything,” was the company’s official response when prompted by Nintederos on a Switch 2 port.</p>



<p>Reports are circulating that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many developers are struggling to get Switch 2 dev kits</a>. This understandably holds back many games and is likely to delay a ton of future third-party ports to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With Sandfall not ruling out a Clair Obscur Switch 2 crossover, this could be the reason why an announcement is taking so long. We’ll keep you updated on the situation and developments on a future Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>Will you buy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 if it arrives on Nintendo’s new hardware? Or are you busy and impatiently waiting for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-franchise-sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-hints-that-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-was-unfinished/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-hints-that-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-was-%E2%80%98unfinished%E2%80%99.1287243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is likely going to go down as Hideo Kojima’s final-ever MGS title. The director has since moved on to create Kojima Productions, but an interesting social media post from him seemingly reaffirms a long-standing theory.</p>



<p>The Phantom Pain is still an unbelievable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid</a> game. Its open nature and complete freedom and flexibility to complete MGS missions in all-new ways were another evolutionary step forward for the series. If you’ve played it, though, you’ll know the game’s final official moments are abrupt and, dare I say, unfinished?</p>







<figure><figcaption>We nearly had it all. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-written-concept-death-stranding-3-wont-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> has been quick to distance himself from his former work in recent times—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he won’t play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. After all, why wouldn’t he? <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-tops-uk-physical-sales-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a> is another acclaimed piece of media, and Kojima is busy working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojimas-od-is-reportedly-safe-from-recent-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OD</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physint</a>.</p>



<p>But a September 3 post from Kojima seems to highlight and double down on the notion that Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain was incomplete when it was released. Kojima natively posted an article by <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/metal-gear-solid-v-phantom-pain-hideo-kojima-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a> to his X account: “10 Years Later, Hideo Kojima’s Unfinished Masterpiece Is Still Influencing Games Today.”</p>



<p>This is likely Kojima hinting at the theory that a whole chapter was missing at the end of The Phantom Pain. Kojima and Konami infamously fell out toward the end of The Phantom Pain’s development, and necessary missions and storytelling ended up on the cutting-room floor.</p>



<p>The Phantom Pain’s original Collector’s Edition notoriously featured concept art and footage of the unfinished episode, which supposedly wrapped up the game’s story. To this day, The Phantom Pain is considered an incomplete and unfinished game, which is unfortunate, as it’s probably the last piece of Kojima-created MGS content we’ll ever get.</p>







<p>Do you still enjoy The Phantom Pain even with its missing content? Are you still hoping and praying that Kojima makes another MGS title one day? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-being-beaten-to-the-steam-launch-punch-by-its-number-one-rival.1287201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam later this year, but in a new announcement, it was confirmed that it’s being beaten to the punch by its number-one competitor, Arena Breakout: Infinite. In a post on Steam, the Arena Breakout team confirmed that on September 15, ABI will hit Steam, delivering a free-to-play extraction experience to many expectant fans.</p>



<p>This does mean that those interested in extraction shooters have a couple of months to try out Arena Breakout: Infinite before Escape from Tarkov hits Steam at some point this year, after the game’s 1.0 release on November 15.</p>



<h2 id="h-arena-breakout-infinite-heads-to-steam">Arena Breakout: Infinite Heads to Steam</h2>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite has been playable for quite some time, but fans have had to use a proprietary launcher offered by MoreFun, the game’s developer. With ABI coming to Steam on September 15, one of the most popular and free extraction shooters is set to hit an entirely new audience.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Arena Breakout: Infinite is in eighth place on the Steam wishlists chart, sitting just behind ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 but ahead of Dying Light: The Beast and ARK 2.</p>



<p>It has more than <strong>two million wishlist spots</strong>. Escape from Tarkov’s Steam page isn’t yet live, so it has <strong>zero</strong>.</p>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite has managed to keep a core audience pleased over the last year or so, with MoreFun rolling out constant updates, including new maps, modes, weapons, and various collaborations. In July, the studio pushed out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinites-cyberpunk-2077-crossover-introduces-new-events-weapon-skins-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Cyberpunk 2077 crossover</a> that few people saw coming.</p>



<p>I sat down with MoreFun Studios at Gamescom 2024 to learn about some critical aspects of the game. I was interested in their rationale around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-offline-mode-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having no ‘offline mode’</a>, and learned more about their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-facul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revolutionary AI NPCs</a> that could understand live voice commands.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073620/view/496079294980687187?l=english&amp;curator_clanid=3693985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Steam</a>, MoreFun promoted the game with every ounce of pulling power possible, flexing everything available in the game when it hits full release on the platform in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>It might have been seen as a carbon copy for a while, and even came under fire from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-arena-plagiarism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlestate Games for alleged plagiarism</a>, but Arena Breakout: Infinite has managed to hold its own over the last year or so. It looks superb on the surface, has plenty of meat on the bones, and despite some sketchy microtransactions, is <strong>free to play</strong>, and that’s a huge advantage.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Arena Breakout: Infinite on Steam when it drops on September 15? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
