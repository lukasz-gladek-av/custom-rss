<p>The voice cast for Sniper Elite Resistance isn’t massive, but one voice sticks out above the rest, and that’s Harry Hawker. His name has drawn attention and it’s time to reveal who has lent their talents to the 2025 Sniper Elite protagonist.</p>



<p>I covered a lot of juicy details in my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance review</a>. It was a fair assessment of a series I’m quite fond of, and one I will continue to play. I’ve predominantly been accustomed to the presence of Karl Fairburne over the years, but it’s the part-time persona of Harry Hawker who takes the lead in Sniper Elite Resistance.</p>



<p>His performance is headline-grabbing, and it’s time to remove the hood from the voice actor—kind of.</p>

<p><strong>The available information tells us it’s likely Klemens Koehring reprising his role as Harry Hawker for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>I say “likely,” because I have scoured the internet and gone to the furthest reaches of the Earth to find conclusive proof it’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2182668/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Klemens Koehring</a>. There’s nothing definitive, but all signs point to the talented voice actor—a multi-lingual extraordinaire who’s given his talents to various video games, TV, and movies.</p>



<p>Crucially, <strong>Klemens Koehring voiced Harry Hawker in Sniper Elite 4</strong>—confirmed by the game’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6528142/?ref_=nm_flmg_knf_c_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB page</a>. I can certify Klemens is a voice actor in Sniper Elite Resistance (more on this soon) and Harry Hawker would make the most sense.</p>



<p>I’ve said the performance has garnered attention, and that’s because of the character’s distinctness and uncanny resemblance to Jason Statham. It’s been a topic of discussion for Resistance, but any press is better than none!</p>



<p>If it turns out Klemens Koehring isn’t the voice actor for Harry Hawker and is simply part of the project, we’ll be sure to update this guide and correct it.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-voice-actors-in-sniper-elite-resistance">All Voice Actors in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>

<p>The voice actor pool is a small one for Sniper Elite Resistance, and it includes <strong>Klemens Koehring</strong>, along with other talents such as <strong>Atilla Akinci</strong> and <strong>James Goode</strong>.</p>



<p>Atilla Akinci has voiced characters in Greedfall 2, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty. Whereas James Goode has provided voiceover work for Diablo 4, Final Fantasy 14, and also Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty.</p>



<p>There’s a wealth of talent in Sniper Elite Resistance, and it deserves to be recognized. As you can see, only names are listed, not their roles, making it slightly more difficult to declare Klemens’ role.</p>

<p>WWE 2K is joining the Netflix Games library. In an <a href="https://xcancel.com/netflixgames_/status/1884966547220836524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement on Thursday morning</a>, WWE and Netflix announced that WWE 2K will be coming to Netflix Games in Fall 2025.</p>



<p>“This isn’t just another mobile game,” WWE superstar CM Punk said in the video announcement. “This is your chance to live the most extreme, the most intense, the most dominant WWE experience right in the palm of your hands.”</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WWE2KNetflix.png" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PQwyWHBKjIL6XM5K.mp4" playsinline=""></video></figure>



<p>Not much is known about the game that’s coming, but it could be assumed, based on the messaging, that the game is a mobile-specific WWE 2K game for the platform as opposed to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-features-revealed-including-new-game-modes-and-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">version of WWE 2K25</a>. The best comparison could be to how Football Manager is on mobile compared to PC and console.</p>



<p>If you can’t wait that long for a new WWE game, WWE 2K25 launches on March 7 for those who buy the $100 Deadman Edition or $130 Bloodline Edition. If you buy the Standard Edition, you get the game a week later on March 14. That game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>



<p>Netflix Games is currently available to all subscribers for no extra fees. The library boasts <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 120 mobile games</a> to play. To play games from the library, you need:</p>



<ul>
<li>An active Netflix subscription</li>



<li>Android device running Android 8.0 or later</li>



<li>iPhone with iOS 15+ or iPad with iPadOS 15+</li>



<li>An internet connection to download the game</li>
</ul>
