<p>This year, Sony San Diego is heavily promoting the brand new Trade Hub, which they’re calling a one-stop shop for all the deals players will make as Franchise general managers. The logic across all trades has been updated. Players will have access to a more complex system that takes into account several factors, including season standings, market size, rivalries, and more. They’ve also incorporated secondary positions into roster decisions. The hope is that this will lead to the most realistic GM experience yet.</p>



<p>Sony San Diego is also touting updates to the Lineup and Rotation Logic, making it more in line with current MLB lineup trends. There’s also an added trade slot, which means players can make up to 4 for 4 trades this year. Overall, this means more customization, more realism, and hopefully more enjoyment.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/paramount/" id="2941">Paramount </a>appears to have defeated Netflix in the bidding war for Warner Bros. On February 26, Netflix declined to raise its bid for the legendary entertainment studio, leaving Paramount as the frontrunner to purchase WB.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/netflix/" id="1142">Netflix </a>issued an official statement, citing Warner Bros.’s belief that Paramount Skydance’s latest proposal was “superior.” Per The<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-board-warms-to-paramounts-sweetened-bid-new-details-are-revealed-1236514073/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Hollywood Reporter</a>, Paramount’s revised offer includes a cash purchase price of $31.00 per WBD share, a daily ticking fee of $0.25 per quarter starting after September 30, 2026, and a $7 billion regulatory termination fee if the deal doesn’t close due to regulatory issues.</p>



<p>“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval. However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid,” read <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/netflix-declines-to-raise-offer-for-warner-bros-302699059.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Netflix’s statement.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-netflix-seemed-like-a-lock-to-purchase-warner-bros">Netflix Seemed Like a Lock to Purchase Warner Bros.</h2>



<p>On December 5, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/">Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery reached an agreement v</a>alued at $82.7 billion under which Netflix would acquire Warner Bros.’ streaming and studio assets, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/warner-bros-games/" id="1770">Warner Bros. Games</a>. Meanwhile, Paramount made at least eight unsuccessful offers to buy Warner Bros., and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-sues-warner-bros-over-netflix-deal/">sued Warner in January</a>, but persistence ultimately paid off. </p>







<p>Warner has numerous immensely popular properties, including the DC Comics universe, the Harry Potter franchise, and Game of Thrones.  Now, that’s all seemingly heading to Paramount. Insider Gaming will report any further updates to this story.</p>
