<p>Resident Evil fans get ready because the next look at Resident Evil Requiem will be coming during Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>



<p>First claimed by regular Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955312103188992041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dusk Golem</a>, there will be a “new showing” of the game during the show with a media embargo with more details on August 20.</p>



<p><strong>“[Then] it’ll be at Tokyo Game Show next month, too,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>The Gamescom Opening Night Live appearance was then <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1955252938232021272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed by Geoff Keighley</a>.</p>



<p>Aside from the appearance at Gamescom, Dusk Golem also gave a bit more details on what players can expect from the game. Specifically, the role that Leon will have.</p>



<p><strong>“As far as I know, part of RE9’s whole “Long Awaited Endings &amp; New Beginnings” stuff is supposed be Leon’s last major role in the timeline (sure he’ll still pop up in CG movies &amp; earlier timeline stuff), so you got that to look forward to with Resident Evil Requiem then,”</strong> <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955309595418890576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said.</a></p>



<p>Gamescom Opening Night Live takes place on <strong>August 19 at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST</strong>. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of everything Gamescom LIVE from Cologne, Germany.</p>



<p>During his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-returns-to-survival-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-off preview of the game</a> back in June, Insider Gaming’s Albert Perkins said that, <strong>“I could feel my shoulders tensing up as she peeked around the corner of each room and made her way down the dark, narrow hallway. And I mean – DARK to the point that the darkness nearly swallowed her into the abyss. Capcom does survival horror right, and this game will do its job of scaring the hell out of you early and often, I guarantee it.”</strong></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is scheduled to release on February 27, 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p>



<p>What do you think the story holds in Resident Evil Requiem for Leon, and what are you hoping to see at Opening Night Live from the game? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>The next Minecraft Live date has been revealed, and it seems to have happened a bit earlier than planned. </p>



<p>In an FAQ section on the studio’s Spanish website, Mojang has confirmed that the next Minecraft Live event will take place on September 22 at 1pm ET.  As for publishing, the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/es-es/live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spanish site remains</a> but the English version of the site still lists March’s date.</p>



<p>It had been indexed on Google for a short time, as well, but that was removed.</p>



<p>The last Minecraft Live event took place back on March 22. That showcase featured a look at the Minecraft Movie ahead of its launch, game drops, a look at the game’s Vibrant Visuals update, and more. You can catch up on all that via the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2025-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official recap</a>. </p>



<p>Neither Microsoft nor Mojang have confirmed the next Minecraft Live date. However, with it appearing on official websites, it appears to be only a matter of time before it’s made official.</p>



<p>What are you hoping to see announced at the next Minecraft Live in September? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A dataminer has discovered that PlayStation compatible Halo titles were listed in the API, suggesting that a release for the platform is imminent. </p>



<p>Recently, we received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-will-only-feature-a-campaign-mode-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several details</a> about upcoming Halo games, including the Combat Evolved remake, Project Ekur, and the next mainline instalment for the series. The same source has now returned with new datamined details, hinting that a Halo release for PlayStation could be on the cards. </p>



<h2 id="h-halo-datamine-suggests-a-playstation-release-is-on-the-way">Halo Datamine Suggests a PlayStation Release is On the Way</h2>



<p>The new information about Halo games coming to PlayStation comes from <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grunt.api</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1955012440032186804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RebsGaming</a>. Rebs Gaming is known for his scoops on Halo games and has used grunt.api as a source on several occasions. The dataminer has revealed unreleased information and images of upcoming content on multiple occasions in the past. In 2021, grunt.api was able to predict accurately when Halo Infinite’s multiplayer mode would be released. </p>



<p>The Halo Dataminer can access the Halo games’ API (application programming interface), which enables them to provide such details early. According to their latest findings, a “new Halo title with PlayStation compatibilty is listed in the API”. The same title was seen linked to PlayFab last Monday, a backend platform that helps with cross-platform progression, matchmaking, and unified online services. </p>

<h2 id="h-playstation-compatible-halo-title-could-be-project-ekur">PlayStation Compatible Halo Title Could be Project Ekur</h2>



<p>Moreover, a beta title and a second new Halo title with PlayStation compatibility were discovered in the API; however, the dataminer has limited information on these two. According to them, the new Halo title for PlayStation could be Certain Affinity’s upcoming multiplayer title, Project Ekur. The dataminer also speculates that the two listings could be for the same game, one for its beta and the other for the full release. </p>



<p>For those unaware, RebsGaming had stated that Project Tatanka, Halo Infinite’s cancelled battle royale mode, was handed over to Certain Affinity. It was then rebranded as a separate multiplayer game using Unreal Engine 5, which is currently codenamed Project Ekur. RebsGaming also stated that the “best case scenario” would be that players receive announcements for Halo CE Remake, Project Ekur and Project Ekur’s beta at the upcoming Halo World Championship 2025, scheduled for this October. </p>



<p>Halo Studios has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-halo-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that more details about the Halo franchise and its next game will be revealed later this year. RebsGaming concluded in their post that “at least one new Halo game is releasing on PlayStation and it could include a Beta.” Regardless, players should take all of this information with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source. </p>

<p>In NHL 26, EA Sports is introducing updates to the ICE-Q gameplay feature that debuted a year ago. This year, however, in partnership with NHL Edge, NHL 26 will feature real-world puck and player tracking data for the first time.</p>



<p>Dubbed ICE-Q 2.0, EA says <strong>“players will notice significant differentiation between superstar athletes”</strong>. The data from real NHL teamss and players <strong>“directly influences player attributes and personal tendencies like skating speed, shot power, signature playstyles, and even goalie reactions.”</strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-nhl-nhl-26-features-include-be-a-pro-and-gameplay-updates">MORE NHL: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-features-include-be-a-pro-and-gameplay-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NHL 26 Features Include Be A Pro And Gameplay Updates</a></h6>



<p>The studio says that the new integration will elevate the on-ice experience for players to increase authenticity and “strategic depth”.</p>



<p><strong>“The energy from the NHL is electric, with its diehard fans and the talent and physicality of the athletes. It’s our job to translate that energy from the ice to the screen and make it as realistic as possible,” </strong>EA Sports president Cam Weber said. <strong>“By harnessing the very same data points the NHL uses to inform all sorts of game-time strategies, EA SPORTS is doubling down on innovations and partnerships to make the most true-to-life reflection of hockey possible.”</strong></p>



<p>The ultimate goal, EA says, is to allow every player to move, think, and play like the stars they see on the ice.</p>



<p>NHL 26 launches on September 5 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S for players who purchase the Deluxe Edition. Those with the Standard Edition have to wait until September 12. The game is exclusively available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Do you think real-world data with ICE-Q 2.0 will make a difference in gameplay for NHL 26? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
