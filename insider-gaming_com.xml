<p>By playing Battlefield 6 online, you’re bound to level up. Completing matches and challenges will give you precious XP, allowing you to level up your profile. If you want to know how far you can go and how many levels there are to ascend, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-6-5-million-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has a lot of content, to say the least. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> will contribute to this, offering the community more ways to level up and earn rewards. Whether you play for the next few weeks, months, or years, chances are you’ll level up a lot.</p>



<p>So we’re checking out how many player levels there are to grind.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-highest-level-in-battlefield-6">What’s The Highest Level in Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bring the fire. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Technically, there isn’t a max level you can hit in Battlefield 6, as your player level can keep going.</strong></p>



<p>It’s believed that your Battlefield 6 player level can reach the high hundreds, maybe even the thousands. This means you can keep playing, keep leveling up, and flex on people with your incredible rank. Yes, remember to go out and touch some grass once in a while, but make sure you return to BF 6 as it’s always a fun journey starting at player level 1 and seeing how far you can progress.</p>



<p>As long as <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> keeps delivering the multiplayer goods—and offers a strong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale</a> component—there’s no reason not to dedicate many hours to BF 6 to see if you can reach the unreachable ceiling!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-level-do-you-stop-earning-battlefield-6-rewards">What Level Do You Stop Earning Battlefield 6 Rewards?</h2>



<p><strong>At the moment, you stop earning Battlefield 6 online rewards once you reach player level 100.</strong></p>



<p>Again, there seems to be no max level cap, but it should be a while until someone finds out anyway. However, once you hit rank 100, this definitely brings an end to your free rewards. At least for now, as EA might decide to increase the rewards cap, and either give you backdated rewards for levels you’ve already reached, or implement a new reward system.</p>



<p>Special events might also be another way to grind levels within the overall grind. Either way, there are plenty of goodies to attain.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-amp-fastest-ways-to-level-up-in-battlefield-6">Best &amp; Fastest Ways To Level Up in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p><strong>Playing in a party, seeking out special Portal maps, and being smart with XP Tokens are the best methods to level up fast in Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>We’re not going to get into the nitty-gritty of each point here, as we already have a useful, in-depth ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Farm XP &amp; Level Up Fast in Battlefield 6</a>‘ guide you should definitely read and bookmark.</p>



<p>But if you’re looking to level up fast, there are many ways you can embrace to make the process easier.</p>



<p>We hope this gave you the information you were looking for. May you level up in style and take pleasure in the misery of others as you defeat them for XP to level up!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s principal game designer has stated that a fix for bullets not registering is on the way. </p>



<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 have done a spectacular job with the game, and the sales reflect that: the game has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-6-5-million-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 6.5 million copies</a> within a few days. However, there is still some work to do, as several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-glitches-exploits-ea-working-overtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bugs and glitches</a> continue to plague BF6. Fortunately, the next patch will address the ghost bullets issue in Battlefield 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-hits-not-registering-will-be-fixed-in-next-patch">Battlefield 6 Hits Not Registering Will be Fixed in Next Patch</h2>



<p>A new post by Battlefield 6’s principal game designer, Florian Le Bihan, on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978405809814987229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) discusses ‘rolling out a fix’ for bullets not registering. The developers have observed an issue “where bullets hit an enemy and where blood splatters are visible but don’t cause damage.” Le Bihan explained that this issue was caused “intermittently with certain weapons and attachments combinations and should now be resolved.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We are rolling out a fix to address the issue seen where bullets hit an enemy and where blood splatters are visible but don't cause damage.</p><p>The issue happened intermittently with certain weapons and attachments combinations and should now be resolved. <a href="https://t.co/rf4L04PpLR">https://t.co/rf4L04PpLR</a></p></div>— Florian – DRUNKKZ3 (@DRUNKKZ3) <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978405809814987229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a reply to the thread, Le Bihan clarified that some hit registration issues can be caused by poor internet or game server performance; however, players will be informed of this through performance icons at the top left. The principal game designer also confirmed that this Battlefield 6 fix will not address bloom, as that’s “a different issue”. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s campaign tells you to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-campaign-tells-you-to-uninstall-when-youre-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uninstall once you have completed it</a>. Additionally, the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beat Call of Duty’s all-time concurrent player count</a> on Steam with nearly 750k players.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The League of Legends 2025 World Championship is upon us, with the Swiss Stage having kicked off on October 15. This stellar tournament will take players from Chengdu to Shanghai to Beijing, representing the most powerful, popular, and valuable esports event in the business.</p>



<p>This guide breaks down everything you need to know about LoL Worlds 2025, whether you’re a casual viewer or a diehard League of Legends enthusiast. It’s a $5 million tournament that features the talents of the most prolific esports pro players in the world, so you <strong>won’t want to miss a second.</strong></p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-lol-worlds-2025-schedule">LoL Worlds 2025 Schedule</h2>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship tournament is broken down across four stages:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Play-In Stage: </strong>October 14</li>



<li><strong>Swiss Stage</strong>: October 15–25</li>



<li><strong>Knockout Stage</strong>: October 28–November 2</li>



<li><strong>Grand Final</strong>: November 9</li>
</ul>



<p>The tournament’s Grand Final will take place in the Dong’an Lake Sports Park Multifunctional Gymnasium (that’s one heck of a name) in Chengdu, China. It’s one of the biggest venues for an esports tournament to occupy, featuring a whopping 18,000-seat capacity.</p>



<h2 id="h-teams-playing-at-lol-worlds-2025">Teams Playing at LoL Worlds 2025</h2>



<p>There are 17 teams competing at the League of Legends World Championship in 2025. The first team to be eliminated on October 14 was Invictus Gaming, whittling the teams in the Swiss Stage down to 16.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of teams competing at the League of Legends World Championship in 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gen.G</li>



<li>Hanwha Life</li>



<li>KT Rolster</li>



<li>Bilibili Gaming</li>



<li>Anyone’s Legend</li>



<li>Top Esports</li>



<li>FlyQuest</li>



<li>Keyd Stars</li>



<li>100 Thieves</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>KOI</li>



<li>Fnatic</li>



<li>CTBC Flying Oyster</li>



<li>Secret Whales</li>



<li>PSG Talon</li>



<li>T1</li>



<li>Invictus Gaming (<strong>eliminated</strong>)</li>
</ul>







<p>Everyone comes into the League of Legends World Championship with keen eyes on T1 Gaming, the defending champions and the home of Faker, arguably the GOAT of the esports world. Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-2024-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faker made history</a> while flying his traditional T1 banner, and the team has every opportunity to win <strong>yet another </strong>LoL Worlds this time around.</p>



<p>Behind T1 sits Gen.G, the top seed coming out of Korea and heading into LoL Worlds after a <strong>dominant </strong>run through the summer and regional qualifiers. Faker’s nemesis in Chovy is ready to bring it all to the table in China.</p>



<p>For the European League of Legends fans, the pick remains G2 Esports, Europe’s best hope for a League of Legends World Championship trophy.</p>
