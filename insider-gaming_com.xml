<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">play the open beta on steam for free here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Scott Robertson recently got hands-on with the game at a behind-the-scenes event, where he sat down with Amazing Seasun Games CEO, Kris Kwok, so keep your eyes peeled on the website for that interview later this week.</p>



<p>“In the aftermath of the Catastrophe, a mysterious carbon-silicon mineral known as Corite has breathed new life into Earth’s depleted energy industry. But its gift came with a curse — its pathogenic nature and uncontrollable spread are slowly devouring the last habitable spaces on the planet. Within 30 years, the heavily polluted Marcens Zones threaten to engulf the entire globe, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction,” the game description reads.</p>



<p>It continues, “Amid the chaos of this catastrophic event, you find yourself thrust into the role of an unlikely hero — a pilot of the third-generation BREAK Striker. Now, you must navigate an uncertain path, one fraught with peril and discovery. But you are not alone. A secretive organization known as S.H.A.D.O.W. has extended an offer, one that could change the fate of both you and the world.”</p>



<p>“Assault, melee, sniper, reconnaissance, support… Choose your preferred mech and take on enemies across three distinct combat modes: 3v3 Deathmatch, 6v6 Hero Shooter, or PvPvE Extraction Shooter.”</p>
