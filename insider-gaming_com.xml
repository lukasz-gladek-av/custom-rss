<p>Activision is getting ready to launch Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on November 14. With that preparation comes an update to the Call of Duty app on various platforms, and one platform needing the update is PlayStation 5 (PS5).</p>



<p>The Call of Duty HQ app on PS5 requires around 100GB to install. This update includes Multiplayer and Zombies while a separate Campaign pack is needed for that section of the game. And while that should be it to get ready to playing Black Ops 7, if you still want to play either Black Ops 6 or Warzone, you’re going to have to do more after the updating the HQ app.</p>



<p>After the new update, you’re going to be <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1987931198442643822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">required to reinstall</a> both the Black Ops 6 and Warzone packs if you want to keep playing those games and their modes. It’s an extra step and more time to play the games that were already previously installed. And, because the app update is mandatory for everyone, there’s seemingly no way around it on PS5.</p>



<p>Are you going to reinstall Warzone or Black Ops 6 to keep playing on your PS5 after the Call of Duty app update, or are you just going to wait now for Black Ops 7?

<p>It seems like Silent Hill f might be coming to Switch and Switch 2, as well as previous-gen consoles, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. </p>



<p>Silent Hill f was off to a spectacular start, with Konami announcing that the game’s cumulative worldwide shipment volume has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-has-already-sold-over-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceeded 1 million units</a>. It seems like they want to get this number even higher by bringing the game to new as well as previous-gen platforms. </p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-f-might-be-coming-to-switch-switch-2-xbox-one-and-playstation-4">Silent Hill f Might Be Coming to Switch, Switch 2, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 </h2>



<p>If you head over to Konami’s <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/us/en/products/silenthill_f/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> right now, click on their Games tab, and then select Silent Hill f. You will see the Switch and previous-gen port mentioned on that page. These details are mentioned twice, once in the ‘Platform’ section, which lists ‘Switch, Xbox One, Steam, PS4’. The second time in the ‘Games’ section, which lists PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android, and for some reason, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG’ as well. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those unaware of the title, Silent Hill f is a new instalment to the series, which blends psychological horror with a haunting Japanese setting. It is set in the 1960s, in the fictional small mountain town of Ebisugaoka; the characters and story were also created specifically for the game. Players have to embody the role of Shimizu Hinako as they explore this town, solve complex puzzles, and confront the distorted monsters. </p>



<p>The title features a “grotesque yet aesthetic world” with immersive 3D audio that enhances the tension and uneasiness. The title also features multiple endings where your choices shape your outcome. There are five endings that you can explore in total, and the store was written by the renowned author Ryukishi07 and features music by Akira Yamaoka. </p>



<p>In other news, a Microsoft Store leak has revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox release date</a> for Silent Hill 2.
