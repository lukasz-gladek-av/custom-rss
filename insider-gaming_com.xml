<p>Don’t get your hopes up for Titanfall 3 just yet. After a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/titanfall-3-is-almost-complete-says-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak came out suggesting</a> that Titanfall 3 is “almost complete” along with a number of planned features, one prominent journalist has publicly reported that none of the leaked information is accurate.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XsBHGnG9LQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Breaking News</a>, Jeff Grubb shot down the claims by Apex Legends leaker Osvaldatore. </p>



<p>“This isn’t real,” Grubb said. “I’m sorry. It’s not real.”</p>



<p>Grubb then went on to talk about Respawn having a small team that is “probably messing around with games that have titans in them”.</p>



<p>“Does he ( Titanfall 1 director Steve Fukuda) have something like a prototype that has titans in it? I would guess so,” Grubb added. “I don’t know for sure, but I would certainly assume that that is a safe thing to think.</p>



<p>“Now, is that going to get announced in 2025 and released in 2026? No way.”</p>

<p>He then touched on the fact that EA has been on a trend of canceling various games at Respawn. Those cancellations include Titanfall Legends which was a “previous version of Titanfall 3”.</p>



<p>“Do not expect an Unreal Engine 5, single player campaign Titanfall 3 with a full multiplayer suite,” Grubb said while saying he hated being the one to rain on the parade. “I’m not sure where this is coming from…don’t get your hopes up for Titanfall anytime soon.”</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was released on March 20 to a reception that nobody expected. It was lauded in the press, and the reviews were pretty stellar on a universal scale, and then the game went on to sell millions of copies. That performance and the ultimate delivery of the game have led many to believe that it’s a turning point for the series.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been a single month since Assassin’s Creed Shadows hit the market, and it’s already winning awards… <strong><em>Kind of</em></strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-voice-of-the-players">Voice of the Players</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the winner of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/01/players-choice-vote-for-march-2025s-best-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation’s Players’ Choice for March</a>. It was voted the best game of the month based on the results of a poll on the PlayStation Blog, which is about as official as it gets. </p>



<p>Admittedly, the competition wasn’t all that strong in March, except the smash hit Hazelight game, Split Fiction.</p>



<p>I think that Assassin’s Creed Shadows <strong>will </strong>go on to win some prestigious awards this year, as what Ubisoft produced was one of the best games we’ve seen in the series for many years. That’s a sentiment that I echoed in my in-depth review of the game.</p>



<p>Last night, I was fortunate enough to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-lead-actress-shrine-destruction-hurt-heart/">catch up with Masumi</a> (Naoe) at the BAFTA Games Awards, learning more about her role in Assassin’s Creed Shadows and what she thought about the more controversial elements of the game.</p>



<p>It’s not the end of the road for AC Shadows, of course. There is DLC in the pipeline, and Ubisoft is hard at work producing patches to add more quality-of-life improvements, including a recent one that I was desperate for.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Assassin’s Creed Shadows, or have you already moved on and are looking to what comes next? Let me know in the comments or hit up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-prison-safe-locations-in-warzone-verdansk.1159518/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-prison-safe-locations-in-warzone-verdansk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Completing the Return to Verdansk event requires players to open safes in every area of the map. With that in mind, here are all the safe locations in Prison. </p>



<p>The Return to Verdansk event started on April 3 and runs through April 15. Unlike other events in Black Ops 6 that could be completed in multiplayer or battle royale matches, this one can only be completed in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> on Verdansk.</p>



<p>Your loadout weapons will make completing this event easier, as they are much better than what you find from ground loot. So, check out which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loadouts are the best in Season 3</a>, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cr-56-amax-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CR-56 AMAX</a>, before starting this challenge.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-warzone-verdansk-safe-location-in-prison">Every Warzone Verdansk Safe Location in Prison </h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-warzone-verdansk-map-return-intel-drop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Return to Verdank event</a>, the objective is to open one safe in each of <span>Verd</span>ansk’s<strong>&nbsp;12 zones</strong>. In the Prison zone, there are nine safes. Despite the POI being nestled in the bottom right corner of the map, Prison is a hot drop, and it will be challenging to open a safe without facing some opposition.</p>



<p>The image below shows where all of the safes are. After opening one, you can move on to the next zone. However, even after opening one, there is still an incentive to open more because each safe has a chance of unlocking <span>Caine’s rare&nbsp;<strong>Trail Blazer operator skin</strong></span>. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Prison is a hotly contested area, so opening a safe won’t be easy. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-warzone-return-to-verdansk-rewards">Warzone Return to Verdansk Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Kali Sticks always wreak havoc in Warzone. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each Zone has a different reward in the Return to Verdansk event. To unlock the <strong>Kali Sticks</strong>, you must&nbsp;<strong>acquire all 12 zone rewards</strong>. </p>



<p>Superstore, Prison, Stadium, and Hospital will be the most challenging zones to open a safe in because those POIs always attract a lot of players when a match first starts. In addition, it will take at least a few matches to complete this event, as the closing circle limits how many zones you can reach in one match. </p>



<p>And even when other players have completed every zone, safes will always be hotly contested throughout the event because everyone wants the rare operator skin. </p>



<p>Here are all 12 zones and rewards. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Zone </th><th>Reward </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dam </td><td>“Let’s Plan Something!” <strong>Loading Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Miltary Base </td><td>“Jarvdinsk Spomenik” <strong>Emblem </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Quarry </td><td>“Lumberjack Legends” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Storage Town </td><td>“Deathly Chill Return” <strong>Weapon Decal </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Superstore </td><td>“With Fries, Please” <strong>Weapon Charm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Stadium </td><td>“Breaking News” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Train Station </td><td>“The Back Adjustment” <strong>Finishing Move </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hospital </td><td>“Love 4 Tha Game” <strong>Spray </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Downtown </td><td>“Cheering the Squad” <strong>Emote </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hills </td><td>Double XP Token (45 minutes)</td></tr><tr><td>Port </td><td>“Shipping to Verdansk”<strong> Sticker </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Prison </td><td>“Wheel of Glory” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<hr>



<p>That’s everything you need to know about opening safes on Prison for the Return to Verdansk event. With that out of the way, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-april-7-patch-notes-buy-stations-receive-major-update-attachments-suddenly-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> fans have much to look forward to. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-2-3-rated-in-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD MW2 and MW3</a> were reportedly rated in Australia, hinting at potential remasters.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/neil-newbon-nobody-is-playing-ai-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-%E2%80%98nobody-is-interested-in-playing-a-game-that%E2%80%99s-made-by-ai%E2%80%99-neil-newbon-says.1159461/</guid>

<p>Earlier this year, Neil Newbon revealed the Pixel Pack, a stunning representation of some of the finest talent in gaming. The goal of the Pixel Pack is to better represent actors in games, oppose the arduous rise of AI voice replication, and provide a stalwart figure of inspiration to a community that’s facing many difficulties.</p>



<p>At the BAFTA Games Awards in London, I chatted with Neil Newbon about the Pixel Pack and what’s next for the group, learning more about the impact AI is having on skilled actors and developers everywhere.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-problem-is-awareness">‘The Problem is Awareness’</h2>



<p>Neil Newbon couldn’t tell me too much about what the Pixel Pack had in the pipeline, but I picked up a nice mission statement for the group:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re deciding how we can use and galvanise the goodwill that we’ve got at the moment and also how to better represent and try to champion actors. A big part of it is really just about the conversation to not use AI to supplement performers, but also on the fact that game actors are <strong>actors</strong>, we’re not just voice actors, and we’re doing as good work as films and television, theatre… </p>



<p>Actually, just to make people aware that some of these incredible, talented people should continue to work. </p>



<p>There’s a lot of talk about AI performers, it’s honestly boring as hell, nobody really wants to use them. I have spoken to many people in the industry, developers as well.</p>



<p>The problem is awareness of this, it’s making people aware that these actors are doing such incredible, sometimes very challenging experiences, in a good way… But they deserve to be honoured.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the chief goals of the Pixel Pack is to show that ‘anybody from any background can enter into games,’ and to accomplish that, the group is made up of a wide variety of professionals, from motion capture artists to voice actors, and from creature performers to performance capture experts.</p>







<p>Neil continued, and our discussion turned more earnestly towards the use of AI for replication and replacement: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think the point is making awareness of it and saying it’s absolutely not cool, that is a big part of the fight, because ultimately, it comes down to the consumer of the games, the player of the games. Are they going to be as satifsifed with really substandard performances, because I personally think that narrative is the same as gameplay now. </p>



<p>Back in the day, the gameplay was the thing, narrative was sort of shoved in there a little bit, not always but a lot of the time. Now, I think that people have the appetite for great narrative as well as great gameplay, but I think that’s a big part of defending against misuse of AI, because people just don’t want it, ultimately. </p>



<p>Some of the people I’ve spoken to, <strong>nobody is interested in playing a game that’s made by AI</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lack of the human element is always key in these debates. There are certain things that AI can’t replicate, such as the natural imperfection of humanity, which Neil said can often lead to ‘happy accidents’ in a creative environment. In his words, ‘You can’t reproduce that, you can’t create that through software – you just <strong>can’t</strong>.’</p>



<p>The Pixel Pack will undoubtedly be making its collective voice heard very soon as these topics continue to thrive in the wider gaming industry.</p>
