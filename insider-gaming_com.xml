<p>Mega Evolution will make a Pokémon TCG Pocket debut later this year, with the first cards also being revealed during the closing ceremony of the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is bringing Mega Evolution back to the mainline games when it releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 16</a>, while the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolutions-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolution in the physical TCG</a> has already been released in Japan with the first English sets due later this year.</p>



<p>Now, Pokémon TCG Pocket is following suit with Mega Evolutions confirmed to arrive “this fall” as part of a “new season,” which could be in line with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-devs-plan-to-release-a-major-update-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge update that has already been teased</a>.</p>

<p>A trailer shown at the Pokémon World Championships featured a recap of some of the additions to the game we’ve seen so far, followed by the reveal of the Mega Evolutions symbol and a first look at several cards.</p>



<p>Mega Altaria ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Gyarados ex were all featured, showing the art style for the cards and confirming how they will be utilized in the game.</p>



<p>Similar to the latest physical TCG sets, Mega Pokémon will not evolve from their standard forms. Instead, Mega Blaziken evolves from Combusken, Mega Gyarados evolves from Magikarp, and Mega Altaria evolves from Swablu.</p>



<p>Mega Evolution in Pokémon TCG Pocket will also be a high-risk vs reward strategy as, while they will be among the strongest cards in the game, with all the revealed cards having 210 HP and dishing out high damage, the opponent will secure three points if your Mega Evolution Pokémon is knocked out.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether the battle format will change for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new season, but currently, securing three points ends the match. Therefore, a strategy is required on when to introduce them and when to retreat.</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A will feature online ranked battles and a four-player PvP mode, it has been revealed at the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 16</a>, Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the next big release for the franchise heading into a huge year in 2026, where Pokémon celebrates a 30th anniversary and is widely expected to release the tenth generation of Pokémon.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A follows on from the success of 2021’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which featured open-world catching mechanics for the first time, but big steps forward are being taken in the latest entry to the series with online support.</p>

<p>One of the biggest disappointments with Legends: Arceus was the lack of online features, with no battling, trading, or Mystery Gift system. That all changes in Legends: Z-A, however, which will feature them all.</p>



<p>Ranked battles will provide competitive action for trainers around the world, with private matches also being available, while the trading mechanics suggest that trade evolutions will return—having been replaced by single-use items in Legends: Arceus.</p>



<p>Another piece of big news revealed at Anaheim was a four-player PvP mode, where trainers will compete within a time limit to secure the most knock-outs, with Mega Evolution confirmed to be available in the mode.</p>



<p>The four-player mode follows on from the four-player co-op introduced in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, though that was restricted to open-world exploration and did not include battle features. Instead, battles remained in the same one-vs-one format we’ve become accustomed to.</p>



<p>Introducing a four-player PvP mode in Legends: Z-A could mean big things for the tenth generation of the game, given Scarlet &amp; Violet took a lot of the mechanics from Legends: Arceus and introduced them to the mainline games—including open-world catching and exploration.</p>
