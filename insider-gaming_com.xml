<p>Marathon is the next contender in the extraction shooter space, attempting to carve out a name for itself alongside games like Escape from Tarkov. It’s a sci-fi epic that prioritises teamwork and collaboration over milsim mechanics, and for that reason alone, it’s a refreshing title that promises to disrupt the genre.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re answering a critical question that many have on their mind: ‘Is Marathon coming to Xbox and PS5?’</p>



<p>Read on to learn what we know about Marathon on console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-on-console">Will Marathon be on Console?</h2>



<p>Most extraction shooters are only ever released on PC. The top dog is Escape from Tarkov, which is PC exclusive. Then you’ve got competing titles like Gray Zone Warfare, Marauders, and Dark &amp; Darker, all of which are locked to PC platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Marathon will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC</strong>, emerging as one of the few extraction shooter titles on console platforms.</p>



<p>It’s a revolutionary thing that’s sure to turn heads, given that it has been compiled by the creators of Halo and Destiny.</p>



<p>You can wishlist <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon on PS5</a>, and the Xbox link is coming soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marathon-crossplay">Is Marathon Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Marathon will be a fully crossplay and cross-save title, which means you can play with your friends on PC if you’re playing on Xbox. It also means that if you play on PC then want to pick up your progress on PlayStation 5, you’re more than welcome.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most seamless ways to play games, and it makes sense that Bungie would support it, given how progress works in other titles that the team has worked on.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Marathon? Let me know what you think about this upcoming extraction shooter in the comments, or check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Clair Obscur Expedition 33 launches soon, so here is everything you need to know about the release date and times. </p>



<p>Sanfall Interactive’s debut project, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>, turns the traditional turn-based format on its head by adding real-time combat mechanics. The game is set in a distorted version of late 19th-century France and follows an expedition group with a unique goal. </p>



<p>In this universe, there is a paintress, and when she paints a number on a monolith, every one of that age turns to smoke and fades away. Every year, an expedition group departs to stop the paintress before their age is painted, and Expedition group 33 is the latest to attempt to change their fate. </p>

<p>Before Dragon Breath shotguns had an opportunity to take over Warzone’s meta, Raven Software temporarily removed the attachment in the April 11 update, and Treyarch also rolled out a change to the Shattered Veil boss in Black Ops 6 Zombies. </p>



<p>The return of Verdansk in Warzone in Season 3 caused a massive uptick in interest. <span>As a result, some players who previously dropped the game are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/author/ryanlemay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">re-installing Warzone on PS5</a> and other platforms.  </span></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision</a>&nbsp;is reportedly pleased with the results, and the devs have already previewed new content for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-3-reloaded-release-date-expected-start-time-verdansk-ranked-play-new-multiplayer-maps-smg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mid-season update</a>. In addition, the Warzone and Black Ops 6 teams are constantly releasing new minor patches to improve the overall experience. </p>

<h3 id="h-12-gauge-dragon-s-breath-ammunition-removed">12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath Ammunition Removed</h3>



<p>Warzone players discovered that using 12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath ammunition and the Kimura RYL33 Laser Light together on the MX Guardian transformed the shotgun into the best close-range weapon in the game. </p>



<p>With both attachments equipped, the MX Guardian had an unbelievable 280-millisecond time-to-kill speed in gunfights up to five meters, and that only dropped off to 560 ms from 10 meters. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a> explained, “12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath ammo was only meant to be available on specific trigger types for the MX Guardian Shotgun. As such, we’ve disabled this attachment until we can address the issue.” </p>



<h3 id="h-shattered-veil-boss-changes">Shattered Veil Boss Changes </h3>



<p>The Shattered Veil boss was designed to be challenging in BO6 Zombies, but players used an exploit with the Void Sheat that allowed it to do more damage than intended. This update addresses that issue and makes a few changes, to provide other options to use against the boss. </p>

<p>Larian Studios announced an impending final update for Baldur’s Gate 3 in <strong>November 2024, </strong>but it’s only now that it’s shaping up to be released. It’s simply known as ‘Patch 8’, and it’s set to introduce some major changes and additions to Baldur’s Gate 3, which Larian has already moved on from.</p>



<p>Amongst these additions are crossplay mechanics, photo mode, and an array of subclasses.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-is-patch-8-being-released-in-baldur-s-gate-3">When is Patch 8 Being Released in Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2>



<p><strong>Larian has confirmed that Patch 8 will be released globally across all platforms on April 15.</strong> This marks the final major update for the award-winning epic that launched to an overwhelmingly positive reception when it was released in August 2023.</p>



<p>The team has been reluctant to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-comes-next-year-and-includes-cross-play-photo-mode-and-more/">release Patch 8</a> in Baldur’s Gate 3 until it was as close to perfect as possible, it seems. It has been in testing for months and that only came after strenuous efforts to polish the new features.</p>



<p>It has also been reported that Baldur’s Gate 3 will go on sale when Patch 8 is released on April 15, which is sure to bring about a spike in sales as newcomers jump on board to find out what all the fuss has been about over the last year and a half.</p>



<p>In January, Larian Studios confirmed that it had shifted priorities and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-have-moved-their-full-attention-to-the-next-game/">sighted the ‘next game’</a> for the team as the core focus. Baldur’s Gate 3 will get Patch 8, and then no more major updates are set to follow – but the game remains popular regardless.</p>



<p>Will the Patch 8 update in Baldur’s Gate 3 bring you back to the game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.
