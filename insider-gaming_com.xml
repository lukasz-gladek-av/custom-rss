<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket looks to be another profitable venture for The Pokémon Company, and as this journey is just starting, we’re breaking down everything we know about the next Pokémon Pocket expansion, and rounding up all the latest leaks and rumors.</p>



<p>The launch period for Pokémon TCG Pocket was a success, earning an impressive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-earned-over-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$12 million in its first four days</a>. The community hoarded the Shop’s Poké Gold supplies and splashed out to pull the rarest cards and complete their collection. Pokémon TCG Pocket’s debut set is only the beginning though, with many generations of Pokémon cards still to come.</p>



<p>That being said, leaks and datamines have revealed information on the future of Pokémon TCG Pocket, and if you’re a fan (like me), the future looks very fun if true.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-what-the-next-pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-is">Do we Know What the Next Pokémon TCG Pocket Expansion is?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We always want new cards. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neither The Pokémon Company nor leakers and dataminers have been able to pinpoint exact details on the next major expansion for Pokémon TCG Pocket. However, an extensive leak has revealed Season One—AKA the Genetic Apex Set—reportedly ends on <strong>Jan. 29, 2025</strong>. If this report is true, <strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s next expansion is likely gearing up for Season Two at the end of Jan. 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>The set doesn’t have a name, and we haven’t seen any cards revealed, but translated leaks have hit the internet pulling back the curtain on plans and new incoming features.</p>



<p><strong>A</strong> <strong>mini-spoiler warning in case you don’t want to know what’s coming!</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-leaked-pokemon-tcg-pocket-season-2-details-amp-rumors">Leaked Pokémon TCG Pocket Season 2 details &amp; rumors</h2>



<p>The datamined Pokémon TCG Pocket Season Two information comes courtesy of a translated Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gd737a/translated_leaks_on_new_updates_spoilers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit post</a>—via the original <a href="https://www.pocketscroll.it/pokemon-pocket-un-leak-svela-i-dettagli-sui-prossimi-aggiornamenti-eventi-e-set-di-carte/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Scroll</a> source—which says, “<strong>January 29, 2025:&nbsp;Set A2&nbsp;will be released, a new complete set similar in scope to&nbsp;Genetic Apex&nbsp;that contains 226 cards.</strong>“</p>



<p>It also claims the new expansion set has tons of “new cards” and carries on Season One’s content strategy of releasing special promo cards throughout the season “released approximately six weeks after each main set.”</p>



<p>The leaked Pokémon TCG Pocket roadmap also hints at a bunch of new items and gameplay features arriving too:</p>



<ul>
<li>New types of Tickets.</li>



<li>Rainbow Rarity Cards—likely to be as rare as Crown cards.</li>



<li>New <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-flair-in-pokemon-pocket-tcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flair designs</a>.</li>



<li>New Fishing Mode (akin to Wonder Picks) with a chance for free, daily items and goodies.</li>
</ul>



<p>Obviously, take this all with a grain of salt, but the subreddit post’s claims and information have proven 100% accurate so far. Both developer and publisher can always have a change of heart, and plans can be altered for Pokémon TCG Pocket—so stay tuned.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-getting-stakeout-24-7-playlist-tomorrow.1030029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stakeout-24-7-playlist-live/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Camo grinders, rejoice! Treyarch has announced that Black Ops 6 is getting a Stakeout 24/7 rotation from tomorrow at 10 am PT (6 pm GMT). This tiny, intense map has been a fan favourite since Black Ops 6 was released on October 25, particularly amongst those grinding to rapidly unlock attachments and camos for their weapons on the way to Dark Matter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-to-stakeout">Prepare to Stakeout</h2>



<p>Stakeout is a small but mighty map that is equal parts lucrative and frantic. It gives the likes of Shipment a run for its money in terms of balls-to-the-wall chaos, and it has been the source of many energetic Black Ops 6 that have made it to social media in recent days showcasing insane kill feeds.</p>



<p>Treyarch just announced a Stakeout 24/7 playlist, which will behave similarly to the ongoing Nuketown 24/7 rotation:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1854569718344302671
</p></figure>







<p>Aside from the fact it’s small and great for the camo grind, Stakeout is pretty ass. It’s a tactical nightmare that offers no mercy to users, and it’s relentless – from the moment your match starts, you’ll be under fire. There is nowhere to hide on this minuscule map, which is little bigger than a couple of apartments glued together.</p>



<p>It’s also super easy to fall out of the map, so be on the lookout for that.</p>



<p>It’s a super map for grinding camos on melee weapons and small-form weapons like handguns and micro-SMGs, though, so that’s a saving grace. If you’ve got something like the baseball bat outstanding on your path to Dark Matter, this is where you’ll tick those boxes.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Stakeout 24/7? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Six Days in Fallujah has been turning heads in the tactical shooter space since it was released in early access more than a year ago. The game’s developer, Victura, aims to educate as much as it does entertain, and that’s what the Command and Control update is all about.</p>



<p>This major update is available to download and explore now, and at the heart of the patch is the game’s first attempt at a solo mode. This single-player portion is made playable alongside an AI fireteam, and at Gamescom in August, I got to see first-hand how intelligent those AI soldiers can be.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-documentary-video-game">‘A Documentary Video Game’</h2>



<p>Victura has claimed that Six Days in Fallujah is the ‘world’s first documentary video game’, fusing gameplay with real-world footage and interviews with Iraqi and American soldiers who were on the ground in Fallujah in 2004. </p>



<p>I saw some of this content at Gamescom, and Victura hasn’t sugarcoated anything – it’s <strong>harrowing</strong>.</p>



<p>Today’s Command and Control update boasts countless improvements and new features, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>First ‘Documentary’ story missions</li>



<li>Advanced fireteam AI system</li>



<li>‘HLZ Wolf’ procedural mission</li>



<li>Graphics overhaul</li>



<li>300 technical enhancements</li>
</ul>



<p>Six Days in Fallujah is a unique shooter in many ways. For instance, it boasts a procedural architecture system that ensures you’re never playing the same map twice. It becomes impossible to predict what’s next in Six Days, and that’s exactly the kind of concept and emotion that Victura was aiming for.</p>



<p>This latest update is impressive, though. From better utilising NVIDIA’s RTX GI technology to implementing engines to simulate real weather and lightning effects, the visual palette for Six Days has been improved immensely. </p>



<p>Are you going to jump into Six Days in Fallujah’s most sizeable update since it hit the open market? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The last year-plus for Warner Bros. Games hasn’t been the best for the company, and Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav admits that. During the company’s <a href="https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/investor-relations/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest earnings call</a> on November 7, Zaslav said that the games business is “substantially underperforming its potential”.</p>



<p>This comes after financial disappointments such as MultiVersus and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League lost the studio more than $300 million this year alone. Now, Warner Bros. Games is going to put more emphasis on its most successful franchises moving forward.</p>



<p>“I think we’re through some of the worst — and it hasn’t been pretty —  on the gaming business,” Zaslav said during the call. “But we have four games that are really powerful and have a real constituency that love them, and we’re going to focus on those four primarily. We’re going to go away from trying to launch 10, 12, 15, 20 different games. I think we have a real chance now with focus to have the gaming business be steadier.</p>



<p>He added: “We have four strong and profitable game franchises with loyal, global fans: Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, in particular, Batman. We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio.”</p>







<p>Warner Bros. Games is already working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitive edition of Hogwarts Legacy</a> that Insider Gaming exclusively reported on in October. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-in-production-at-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel to the game</a> is also in production. </p>



<p>With Mortal Kombat, the company continues to see character additions for the game with the latest being the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-ghostface-gameplay-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming launch of Ghostface</a> on November 26.</p>



<p>On the Batman side, it’s been quite from the company overall since Suicide Squad. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-working-on-new-batman-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors recently began to circulate</a> that Rocksteady could be working on a new Batman game.</p>



<p>Not mentioned on the call but still in development is the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-latest-claims-about-monoliths-wonder-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman</a> game from Monolith.</p>



<p>What do you think of Warner Bros. Games putting the focus on a few key franchises rather than multiple titles? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>
