<p>Bungie has arrived with new details about Marathon, discussing all the improvements, reconfirming the March 2026 release window, pricing, new features, and more. </p>



<p>Marathon and Bungie have not had the best time since the title’s reveal and initial playtests, thanks to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism fiasco</a> and all the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong player feedback</a>. The title has been undergoing constant playtesting since then, and the developers have finally arrived with new information about their vision for Marathon. </p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-pricing-details-revealed-battle-passes-never-expire">Marathon Pricing Details Revealed, Battle Passes Never Expire</h2>



<p>A new video by Bungie confirms Marathon’s March 2026 release window, reveals pricing details, provides new battle pass information, and much more. The developers are targeting a price of $39.99/€39.99/£34.99 currently and will announce regional pricing closer to launch. Purchasing the title will give players full access to the base game, including free gameplay updates, new maps, Runner shells, events, and more. </p>



<p>Moreover, Marathon Battle Passes will never expire, which means players don’t need to keep logging in due to the “fear of missing out”. You will be able to purchase and unlock prior passes. The developers have also confirmed that “survival will never come down to how much money you spend,” so there will be no pay-to-win elements in Marathon. </p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-devs-reveal-new-features-and-improvements">Marathon Devs Reveal New Features and Improvements</h2>



<p>Coming to the improvements, the new Vision of Marathon video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> reveals all the changes the developers have made since the alpha and their plan for the game. Starting with the latest features since alpha, players will see that Proximity chat and solo queue have been added. There’s also a new Runner Shell called Rook, which is designed to let players enter matches in progress, loot a bit, and escape without too much risk. </p>



<p>The game has also made some improvements to visual fidelity, with corpses now remaining in the match and decaying over time. Additionally, environmental storytelling has been deepened. Immersion has also improved thanks to the role audio plays. The developers have stated that audio is a major gameplay element in Marathon, with every sound serving a purpose. </p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-map-details">Marathon Map Details</h2>



<p>The developers then dived into Marathon’s Zones, the game’s maps. First is Perimeter, which is on the outskirts of the colony and spread out. The next is Dire Marsh, where players not only get a sense of the game’s story but also experience a different style of gameplay, focused more on action. The third map is called Outpost, a UESC facility with many PvE elements, including guards, drones, trip wires, and more.</p>



<p>The fourth map is The Marathon Ship’s Cryo Archive, which is the hardest place to survive in the game, and no point going there without the best loot. Each map features different weather systems and dynamic events. These events don’t happen all the time, but the players will know when they do, and then it is up to them whether they want to risk it all.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-weapons-and-loot-details">Marathon Weapons and Loot Details </h2>



<p>There’s a lot of loot for Marathon players to look forward to, including Runner cores, implants, and over 400 weapon mods. The game also offers a lot of customisation, allowing players to mix and match their weapons in unique ways. The devs showed examples of turning the Battery SMG into a needler and turning invisible with mods on their sidearm. Each of the game’s launch Runner Shell is an archetype of gameplay, which can be upgraded upon. </p>



<p>Lastly, the game has Factions, and agents of these Factions can ask you to jobs like “blow up a UESC dropship”, etc. Factions have upgrade trees and capstone rewards that players can earn each season. </p>

<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is getting a free content update <strong>tomorrow</strong>, December 16. This update will introduce a brand-new storyline with eight quests that can apparently take ‘hours to complete’. It also includes seven new locations, six unique characters with ‘their own backgrounds and stories’, and a new weapon.</p>



<p>It also introduces a mysteriously-named ‘hub to create’. The update will be completely free for all owners of the game across Xbox, PC, and now, PlayStation.</p>







<h2 id="h-stalker-2-s-free-content-update-is-huge">STALKER 2’s Free Content Update is Huge</h2>



<p>On a recent <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog post</a>, the team at GSC Game World expanded on the new quests coming to STALKER 2 with tomorrow’s spontaneous update:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map. The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations.</p>



<p>Professor Medulin witnessed everything with his own eyes. While being good at scientific research, he didn’t know enough about the radio signal and what to do to figure out what was happening. That’s where Banzai steps in, a radio enthusiast, who also joined the investigation, but something went wrong.</p>



<p>You may hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Pay close attention to the Red Forest Region on your map, and from here on, your intuition, rationality and choices will lead you down the rabbit hole to see how deep it is.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Alongside the new update comes the GP37V2 rifle, a modified version of the GP37 rifle that features a suppressor and a low-magnification scope for picking off enemies at range.</p>



<p>The blog post points out the ‘Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp’ and the ‘Old Mine in Red Forest’ being key locations to explore with the ‘Stories Untold’ update. In the Burnt Forest, players will be able to uncover a new hub location, fully stocked with traders, a stash, and a bed.</p>



<p>This permanent update has players excited, and the sentiments on social media are positive. Over time, GSC Game World continues to improve STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, which we reviewed at launch and gave high marks to.</p>
