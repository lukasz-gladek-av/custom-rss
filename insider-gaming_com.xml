<p>When it comes to single-player games, 2025 offered no shortage of memorable experiences. Big sequels, ambitious new IPs, and long-anticipated releases all took turns dominating the conversation, making it one of the more competitive years in recent memory. With so many strong options on the table, the Insider Gaming community had plenty to consider when casting their votes.</p>



<p>In the end, one game stood above the rest. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been voted the Insider Gaming community’s Best Single Player Game of 2025.</p>







<p>In a poll hosted on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>, Clair Obscur finished first with 22.6% percent of the votes. Sandfall Interactive’s RPG edged out a packed field that included Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Dispatch.</p>



<p>The result also lines up with the game’s wider reception. Clair Obscur has been universally acclaimed by fans and holds a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">9.6 user score</a> on Metacritic.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-the-votes-shook-out">How The Votes Shook Out</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the poll was filled with worthy recipients. Dispatch finished second with 14.8% of the vote, while Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 followed at 12.2%. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Death Stranding 2 each earned 11.3%, highlighting just how divided the community was among several games.</p>



<p>What ultimately pushed Clair Obscur ahead was how strongly it resonated with players. Rather than leaning on spectacle or familiar franchise beats, the game delivered a focused, self-contained experience that trusted its atmosphere and presentation to do the heavy lifting. Its distinct visual style and deliberate pacing helped it stand out in a year crowded with massive releases.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nikita Tells Us What He Wants from Tarkov on Console: ‘The Same Frustrating Experience’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-interview-tarkov-console-frustrating/</link>
            <guid>1391839</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We recently sat down with Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, creator of Escape from Tarkov. Amongst other things, we took a dive into the concept of Escape from Tarkov coming to consoles, which is something that the developer teased at the recent Tokyo Game Show event.</p>



<p>In his own words, Nikita has stressed that an Escape from Tarkov console port wouldn’t be made ‘easier’. In fact, it would be ‘the same frustrating experience’ that players have been experiencing on PC for many years, retaining that hardcore, unwelcoming vibe.</p>



<p>It’s his mission to make players break controllers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-would-escape-from-tarkov-on-console-look-like">What Would Escape from Tarkov on Console Look Like?</h2>



<p>Many have surmised that Escape from Tarkov on PlayStation or Xbox would represent a slimmed-down, ‘lite’ version of the tough-as-nails extraction shooter. But after catching up with Nikita Buyanov on the most recent episode of Insider Gaming’s Access Granted, we have gathered a different picture entirely.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure that it would be a ‘lite’ version of EFT. The main goal is to create the same experience for the consoles, so there won’t be any kind of aim assist, any simplifiying of the gaming features.</p>



<p>I really want to get the same frustrating experience for the consoles, to bring on this hardcore feeling to a wider audience.</p>



<p>We don’t plan to conquer something, we just want to create something new for the consoles, something new, a new experience, because they’ve never had that before, I mean the true hardcore experience that will break their controllers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Nikita made the ‘frustrating experience’ comment with a chuckle! </p>



<p>Nikita explained what the challenges are. It’s a discussion mostly centered around the complexity of Escape from Tarkov, which features inventory and health management, survival mechanics, and most importantly, <strong>stacks </strong>of keybinds that only a keyboard and mouse player can realistically handle.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It won’t be something simplified or a casual version of EFT. It will be the same EFT, but of course it needs to be optimized for the current-gen consoles.</p>



<p>The main challenge will be to put in all the controls. It will be the main challenge for us, but in general, I think it will be pretty interesting to do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Given that Escape from Tarkov only hit ‘full release’ in November, it might be ambitious to believe that Battlestate Games will muster up a console version any time soon. The only thing to go on is Nikita’s mention of ‘current-gen consoles’ for any kind of a timeline.</p>



<p>If you want to check out the full interview with Nikita, you can do so on the Insider Gaming app, available now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.insidergaming.app">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insider-gaming/id6753984648">iOS</a>. It’s available exclusively for Insider Gaming Premium subscribers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Shelter is Getting a Reality Show Adaptation, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-shelter-reality-show-adaptation-claim/</link>
            <guid>1391788</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought the Fallout television show wasn’t enough and you wanted more live-action adaptations, you won’t have to wait too long. It has just been claimed that Prime is assembling a new reality show (‘MrBeast style’) that will plant contestants in a live-action representation of <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong>.</p>



<p>It has been reported that production will start in 2026, and that those taking part in the show will need to build and manage their own vault, keeping their vault dwellers ‘alive’.</p>



<h2 id="h-mixed-responses-surface-about-the-fallout-shelter-show">Mixed Responses Surface About the Fallout Shelter Show</h2>



<p>In an exclusive report from <a href="https://www.theinsneider.com/p/fallout-reality-competition-series-amazon-prime-video-jonathan-nolan-lisa-joy-apply-2026-production" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jeff Sneider</a>, it was claimed that Prime is working on a Fallout Shelter reality show produced by Jonathan Nolan, executive producer on the core Fallout show.</p>



<p>Last year, Fallout emerged in live-action form with an all-new television series tied into the game’s central universe. With an original story, Bethesda Game Studios, Prime Video, and Kilter concocted an authentic representation of the post-apocalyptic world that millions of fans know and love.</p>



<p>It seems that the teams involved aren’t content with just that show, as another one is claimed to be in the works.</p>



<p>Working with a ‘Squid Game’ or ‘MrBeast’ operating model, it seems that Prime Video is eager to assemble a Fallout Shelter adaptation. The purported show will see contestants build and run their own vaults, which are pivotal to the story in the Fallout franchise.</p>



<p>In these vaults, survivors live underground and outlast the nuclear annihilation of the world above, but it’s unlikely Amazon will green-light the destruction of the planet to accommodate a Fallout Shelter show.</p>



<p>Let’s hope not, anyway.</p>



<p>Fallout’s second season is unravelling as we speak, with the second episode having dropped yesterday, December 23. It’s an award-winning series with a brilliant cast, and it’s well worth a watch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Insider Gaming’s Best Indie Game of the Year 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-best-indie-game-of-the-year-2025/</link>
            <guid>1391785</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Indie games are more important than ever. With the AAA market experiencing a mix of results and more layoffs than ever, it may be safer to lean toward indie development. It’s worked out for many of the world’s best titles, and Insider Gaming’s 2025 Indie Game of the Year highlights why.</p>



<p>The lines between an Indie game and AA or even AAA titles are becoming more blurred by the second. Some releases appear to have been created by a single person—which is often the case, as seen with LocalThunk’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-balatro-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a>—whereas others seem like premium, high-priced packages. From Schedule 1 to Ball X Pit, this list has picked out the best Indie games of 2025, and there’s one winner.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-indie-game-of-2025-winner-hollow-knight-silksong">Best Indie Game Of 2025 Winner—Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p>It would be remiss if Insider Gaming didn’t clarify two things: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <em>hasn’t </em>made this list, as the budget and development team (which is obviously more than the originally claimed 30 people) does not classify to IG as ‘indie,’ and the other point being that this award could’ve gone to one of two games, quite easily.</p>



<p>That being said, Hornet gets to wear the silky crown! Team Cherry’s Silksong never quite hit the ridiculous GTA 6 levels of hype, but there’s probably no indie game in history that garnered as much attention, anticipation, wishlists, and topped virtually any other metric for an upcoming indie title. Hollow Knight: Silksong had to be as good, if not surpass, than the immense legacy of the original Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>Siliksong is a technical and entertainment masterpiece from start to finish. It still edges out Ori for the most incredible environmental design, and the combat and exploration mechanics have gone up a notch. Boss battles are electric, and there’s an ever-present danger wherever you go. The almost shameless ceiling of difficulty is never masked at any point, but you’re rewarded for your perseverance and persistence with secret areas, enchanting NPCs, and side quests.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Sorrow DLC</a> on the way, enhancing an already criminally low price point, Silksong is a sumptuous banquet of indie excellence.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-indie-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Indie Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Launch time. Image via Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We said this award could’ve gone either way, and Hades 2 will be many people’s pick for Indie GOTY, and rightly so. Supergiant Games already has a GOTY award in the trophy cabinet thanks to the original Hades. This put a burden on the sequel’s shoulders that even Zeus might struggle to shoulder. Thanks to early access (which played a small part in this decision), Hades 2 has taken an already solid foundation, updated it, and tweaked it into a Herculean-looking work of art.</p>



<p>You might not be able to go back to Hades 1 after playing the follow-up! With the added diversity of going above ground as well as slaying below it, and more Boons and combat systems to consider, Hades 2 is a more than worthy successor, and rightly took its place alongside Silksong in the overall <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/6-biggest-announcements-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> GOTY nominees.</p>







<h3 id="h-ball-x-pit">Ball X Pit</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Kenny Sun</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve not heard of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-trophy-list-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball X Pit</a>, you need to; if you have played it, it’s SO good, isn’t it? Ball X Pit doesn’t require inch-perfect timing, lightning-quick reflexes, and its skill ceiling isn’t outrageous. This is easily one of the most chill games of 2025, and it’s another roguelike. You can comfortably sit back and relax for most of your runs, and all you need to do is just move the left analog stick around. But your progress is determined by your on-the-fly decision-making when it comes to Balls and Passive Abilities.</p>



<p>Ball X Pit might not seem skillful at first, but it can take a few in-game hours to understand the nuances of the gameplay: How to angle your shots, where to concentrate your attacks, which synergies are superior, and how to make the game’s most broken combinations. It has one of the best soundtracks of 2025, and you’ll have a <em>ball </em>playing it.</p>



<h3 id="h-blue-prince">Blue Prince</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>In terms of methodical pacing, nothing comes close to Blue Prince. Every move and decision you make is taken one room at a time as you seek to find Room 46—if it even exists. This is the third of four roguelikes on this list—is the industry trying to tell us something? You have a limited amount of time to map out a route in your inherited house to find Room 46.</p>



<p>Along the way are key items that you can use on subsequent runs to make more progress, discover, and solve more mysteries. The idea is to repeat this process repeatedly, as it all helps you to eventually find Room 46. Its masterful environmental storytelling and intrinsic gameplay and teachings make this an easy-to-pick-up and play game. Wonderfully atmospheric and ever-intriguing, the punny-named Blue Prince (Blueprints?) has earned its place.</p>



<p>Did any shooter that’s not Battlefield 6 get your vote for best shooter of 2025? Is it something that didn’t even make it onto our list, like a certain Black Ops 7?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With 2025 coming to a close, the team at Insider Gaming wants to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a happy and healthy New Year. </p>



<p>Our team is taking a well-deserved break to end the year, and will return in full on Monday, January 5. In the meantime, there is plenty of content coming to the site over the next couple of weeks ranging from the results of the Insider Gaming Community Awards to year-in-review features and more.</p>



<p>Of course, should anything major break that needs coverage, we will bring it to you with the same speed and quality that Insider Gaming has become known for. </p>



<h2 id="h-a-sincere-thank-you">A Sincere Thank You</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As we wind down 2025, we want to leave you with our sincerest thanks. Insider Gaming has only been around since 2022, and this year has been far and away our best year yet. And that’s all thanks to you, our dedicated readers.</p>



<p>Your support has made us one of the fastest-growing independent gaming media outlets. Whether it’s been reading our stories, watching our shows, participating in our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community Discord</a>, and even <a href="https://forms.gle/yMkn9VMdSLwXEJn87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking our surveys</a> to help shape our future, everything you’ve done has helped turn Insider Gaming into what it is today. </p>



<p>And we can’t forget to talk about the biggest accomplishment of the year, the release of the Insider Gaming App. Since our launch, an app was one of the of the most requested things in our yearly reader surveys. You wanted a way to get your information in a quick and clean matter, and that’s what we brought you this year.</p>



<p>The free Insider Gaming App’s launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.net/visit/insider-gaming-app-ios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.net/visit/insider-gaming-app-android/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a> has been nothing short of mind blowing. We had our goals of where we wanted to be with it by the end of the year, and you blew that out of the water. Again, thank you!</p>



<p>And lastly, to our Insider Gaming Premium and Premium Plus members. Running an independent gaming outlet in this era is hard of closures and consolidations is hard. To be honest, we were nervous about launching any sort of premium plan. But you all showed up and showed your support in a way that we couldn’t even have imagined. We can’t overstate just how much it means to us that you would support a small editorial team like ours in the way you have. </p>



<p>You are allowing us to do what we love to do, which is tell stories about the gaming industry and bring you the latest news, exclusive information, and reviews that you need to know about. And because of your support, we’ve been able to plan out even more features and content for Premium and Premium Plus subscribers. More details on that will be coming shortly after the start of the new year!</p>



<p>Thank you again to everyone who’s visited the site, downloaded the app, shared our work, and joined our discussions. </p>



<p>Here’s to an even better 2026!</p>

<p>The Holiday Season is almost here, and what better gifts to buy for your loved ones than new games? The most difficult people to buy gifts for are hardcore gamers, as the usual stuff just doesn’t cut it for them. You really need to give them games that let them sink their teeth in and present a real challenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Insider Gaming guide will highlight some of the best game gifts you can purchase for hardcore gamers. The list includes some of the most challenging titles in recent times, which will really test players’ mettle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do check out&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a> for the best deals on games, hardware, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring">Elden Ring</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Let’s start with the big one itself, Elden Ring, the game of the year for 2022. FromSoftware has done wonders with this title, blending its unmatched Soulslike formula with a vast, expansive open world. Elden Ring also features Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, which gives you a lot more hours with new locations, bosses, and weapons.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-bloodborne">Bloodborne</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Blooborne is a title for true soulslike players looking to take on one of the biggest challenges yet. However, it is exclusive to PlayStation 4, so players will not be able to play it on other platforms and will be restricted to the resolution and performance of previous-gen consoles when playing it on the PS5. At the same time, the fun a hardcore gamer will have with this title is unmatched.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-cuphead">Cuphead</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cuphead is a classic run-and-gun action game, with a focus on platforming and boss battles. It is inspired by the cartoons of the 1930s. It features visuals and audio created with the same techniques of that era: traditional hand-drawn cel animation, watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings. The game presents a real challenge for even hardcore gamers, and if it becomes too difficult, they can have a friend join them in local co-op.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-sifu">Sifu</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sifu is a third-person brawler that has intricate, kung-fu-based combat mechanics. There’s another innovative mechanic in the title, where the player ages every time they die, learning more in the process, but becoming weaker as well as time goes on. In this quest for revenge, players will have no allies, just countless enemies to battle across various environments, with only a mysterious amulet to save their lives (only for some time).&nbsp;</p>

It also has over 300 levels across more than five chapters, with some struggle-worthy boss fights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you know anything about the soulslike genre, then you might have heard of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and if the player hasn’t played this title, then there are few better games for hardcore gamers to take on. It is the game of the year for 2019, where you play as a one-armed wolf and dwell in cut-throat sword-based combat. The game takes place during 1500s Sengoku Japan, and players will have to use deadly prosthetic tools and powerful ninja abilities to blend stealth, vertical traversal, and visceral head-to-head combat.&nbsp;</p>

It features the 2011 game with upgraded visuals and 60 fps performance, making gameplay feel much smoother.
