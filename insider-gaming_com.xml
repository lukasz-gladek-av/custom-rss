<p>At the Perfect World Shanghai Major, a Mongolian Counter-Strike 2 team is doing the unthinkable. The MongolZ have accomplished a feat that no other team from the Asia region has ever done before, in a manner that no team in the world has done in more than half a decade.</p>



<p>Just a few weeks prior, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mongolz-wins-thunderpick-world-championship/">The MongolZ claimed their largest prize pool winnings ever</a> at the Thunderpick World Championship. But something even more unimaginable is still possible for them.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-job-s-not-done">Job’s Not Done</h2>



<p>By qualifying for the playoffs of the Perfect World Shanghai Major, The MongolZ became the first Asian Counter-Strike team to do so in Major history. Dating back to 2013, the playoff field has always been dominated by European teams, with one or two North and South American teams sneaking in regularly. Asian teams typically compete alongside Oceanic teams in Major qualifiers, but in the rare occasions were an Asia-Pacific team reaches playoffs, it’s always been an Australian roster until now.</p>



<p>The fashion in which The MongolZ reached the playoffs is also a historical feat. The Major utilizes two 16-team Swiss stages to determine who goes to playoffs. The MongolZ went 3-0 in both the Opening Stage and the Elimination Stage, beating the likes of Heroic, GamerLegion, MOUZ, and G2 Esports. The last time a team went 3-0 in two Swiss Stages at the same Major was at the FACEIT London Major in 2018, when Team Liquid accomplished that feat. G2 did it as well at the ELEAGUE Boston Major prior, which was the first Major to utilize the two Swiss stages.</p>



<p>Fittingly, The MongolZ made playoffs at the first Counter-Strike Major to be held in Asia. The team’s 19-year-old rising star Sodbayar “⁠Techno⁠” Munkhbold <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40498/techno-on-playing-in-front-of-the-asian-crowd-its-a-big-advantage-for-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said the crowd has been “a big advantage”</a> for the team. That advantage should increase as the event transitions over to the larger Shanghai Oriental Sports Center for playoffs.</p>



<p>Do you have The MongolZ going all the way in your pick ‘ems? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-2-focuses-on-customization-and-expressing-yourself/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>CD Projekt Red has announced full details for Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2. Releasing Today (December 10), Update 2.2 is known as the “Express Yourself” patch that adds a number of capabilities for players in areas such as car customization, photo mode, and character creator. </p>



<p>The update is available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Starting with car customization, players will now be able  to update more cars with more colors and designs. There’s also a new “Twintone” feature that allows players to scan any car in the world, and transfer the scheme and color over to their own vehicle. Lastly, in regard to vehicles, Johnny Silverhand can now be a passenger in  your car.</p>



<p>With Photo mode, the developers have added a number of new options for players including a new drone mode that allows for more range and movement when setting up a photo. There are also new lighting updates along with the ability to add up to three NPCs to  your photo. Once you’re happy with your pictures, you can hang them in your apartment or upload them to a gallery for other players to see.</p>



<p>The game’s character creator has been updated to include over 100 new assets as well as a complete character randomizer. There were also updates that the team didn’t want to talk about during the reveal stream. </p>



<p>The full patch notes are available via <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/update-2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While players will no doubt be a bit disappointed to not get any PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements or a New Game+, the additional customization features should breath some extra life into the four-year-old game. </p>



<p>With Update 2.2, CD Projekt Red didn’t confirm that this will be the final update for Cyberpunk 2077. They did say that that “maybe” there would be another surprise or two in the future. However, as the team puts the focus on the game’s sequel Project Orion, it could be assumed that time working on the first game is winding down. </p>



<p>Speaking of the game’s sequel, the game likely won’t arrive until after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-production-cd-projekt-red-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next installment of The Witcher</a>, currently known as Project Polaris.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 has long since replaced the PlayStation 4 as the de facto Sony gaming console. However, if Marvel Rivals is on PS4, it would incorporate a ton of extra players who are yet to upgrade to the latest generation of hardware.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is a technical…marvel. It looks stunning and its cel-shaded graphics pop on modern-day consoles and the latest PC rigs. Not only this, but a 6v6 match featuring a constant stream of projectiles, moving parts, and superhero taunts requires a lot of manpower. If you want to play Marvel Rivals on the PS4 though, it opens up a new line of questioning.</p>



<p>NetEase surely wants as many people playing the hero shooter as possible, but technical limitations are a constant barrier for many AAA games nowadays. Let’s see what the developer decided for Marvel Rivals and its PS4 fate—we already know its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-on-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a> compatibility.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-on-ps4">Is Marvel Rivals on PS4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re Doomed, all Doomed. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is not available to play on PS4. Developer NetEase has restricted the free-to-play shooter’s platform releases to the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a sad, harrowing reality of gaming in 2024. The PlayStation 4 (and its Pro upgrade) were once considered the pinnacle of console gaming. Now, they are becoming relics companies hardly take time to consider. Marvel Rivals isn’t alone in this neglect—so think twice before harboring a grudge!</p>



<p>I’m no expert, but I think it has a lot to do with developers unwilling to devolve their vision for a title. For example, a PS5 has a lot more power than the PS4, and therefore the main development is done with the PS5 in mind. A PS4 is very limited compared to its younger brother, and sacrifices need to be made.</p>



<p>As we’ve seen with Switch ports trying to imitate titles released on superior hardware, a dumbed-down version of a game isn’t necessarily worthwhile—or reflective of its quality. Therefore, many new releases are kept for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It doesn’t necessarily a PS4 port is dead as stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/news/20241205/40185_1198415.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals release FAQ</a> mentions “Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, Epic Store, and our official website (Loading Bay)” as the available platforms—not specifying which versions of those platforms. So if you’re a PS4 user desperate to yeet Captain America’s shield like a boomerang, all isn’t completely lost. We’ll update this guide in case anything changes. </p>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s 5.0 update introduces an Obelisk Operation, a new enemy and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-space-marine-2-obelisk-update-details">Space Marine 2 Obelisk Update Details&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Space Marine 2’s Obelisk Operation takes players to Demerium. Here, their goal is to disrupt the flow of energy protecting an Aurora device. To do that, you must rotate a replica of the obelisk. However, the console control of the device is placed deep into the heart of a “tomb plunged into darkness”. The operation is set to occur “parallel to the final events of the campaign.”</p>



<p>Space Marine 2’s Obelisk Update also introduces a new Majoris enemy called Tzaangor Enlightened. This disk-flying, melee/ranged-hybrid enemy will be found in all Operations featuring the Thousand Suns and should be considered a formidable opponent when in great numbers. The way to bring them down is to catch them after a parry or during a long animation; the developers have advised using a Target Lock when facing this enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, the update also brings new Season Pass content with the Dark Angels Chapter Pack. Season Pass owners can grab Dark Angels Successor Chapters cosmetics, including Dark Angels Champion skin (Bulwark) and weapon skins for Auto Bolt Rifle, Plasma Pistol, Power Sword and Bulwark’s Storm Shield.&nbsp;</p>
