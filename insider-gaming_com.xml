<p>Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, has trolled the Escape from Tarkov community with a code appropriately named ‘PAY2WIN’. On social media, the prolific developer posted an image featuring some of the most valuable items in Escape from Tarkov, announcing that a code would drop soon, suggesting that those very items would be obtainable.</p>



<p>When the code dropped, it was with a tongue-in-cheek reference: ‘PAY2WIN’. However, upon redeeming the code, players quickly learned that they’d been hilariously duped.</p>







<h2 id="h-pay2win-was-a-joke-all-along">PAY2WIN Was a Joke All Along</h2>



<p>The code that Nikita Buyanov was teasing led users to believe they’d be getting <strong>stacks</strong> of stuff in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>This image included an FLIR optic, an Altyn helmet, stacks of Bitcoins, and a THICC case, amongst other things. However, shortly after, Nikita revealed the code, PAY2WIN, and users quickly set about redeeming it in the game’s launcher.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The bundle was ultimately unveiled as one of the worst stacks of items you’d ever hope to get in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This includes some of the most useless weapons, such as the TOZ and the Blicky, one of the smallest backpacks, a pack of croutons, a fuze (but no grenade), and a replica helmet. You literally couldn’t have asked for a worse bundle.</p>



<p>It’s not often that the Escape from Tarkov developers crack a joke like this, but they’ve admittedly given away quite a lot of stuff recently with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-escape-from-tarkov-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more reward codes</a>.</p>



<p>It’s often pointed out that ‘free is free’, but perhaps this bundle isn’t even worth anything!</p>







<p>Did you redeem the code in Escape from Tarkov? Let us know if you’re happy with your little Blicky on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The Streamer Awards have wrapped for another year, and the trophies have all been dished out to the most deserving content creators of 2025. It was a mixed bag, and while most awards were fairly predictable, there were a few hidden gems in the line-up. The least surprising of all was the award for Best VTuber, which went to TheBurntPeanut.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has had a stellar year, putting up some remarkable numbers and growing at an alarming pace on account of his entertaining, high-energy content, hilarious animations, and genuinely enjoyable gameplay. This year, he pushed Ironmouse out of the spot that the former champion had held for three years straight.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-is-your-vtuber-of-the-year">TheBurntPeanut is Your VTuber of The Year</h2>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar with TheBurntPeanut, all you need to do is check out a compilation of his most entertaining clips on YouTube to get a taste of his brand. He’s an animated peanut that uses a mix of skins and ‘costumes’, combined with an energetic commentary and some hilarious gameplay, to keep tens of thousands of viewers entertained at any given time.</p>



<p>This year has been transformative for TheBurntPeanut, who has used games like Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders to propel himself into the major spotlight.</p>



<p>At The Streamer Awards this year, the nominations were pretty close to call:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chibidoki</li>



<li>Ironmouse</li>



<li>Kenji</li>



<li>Mori Calliope</li>



<li>TheBurntPeanut</li>
</ul>



<p>Ironmouse had previously won the VTuber of the Year award at The Streamer Awards for three consecutive years, but TheBurntPeanut’s stellar year managed to push him into the top spot.</p>



<p>In his acceptance speech, TheBurntPeanut said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am honored to accept this Best VTuber of the Year award.</p>



<p>It is a great honor to accept this Best VTuber of the Year award, big shout-out to QTCinderella for putting on this immaculate award ceremony as well as a shout-out to the Peanut team, making sure the streams are always the best they can be.</p>



<p>Obviously, the largest shout-out to the Bungulators, you guys are the best, thank you for all the support, gentlemen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full ceremony can be watched here:</p>

<p>TheBurntPeanut also scooped the award for Best FPS Streamer, making him one of only a few streamers to walk away with more than one award at the event.</p>
