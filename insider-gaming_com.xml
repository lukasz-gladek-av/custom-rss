            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-admitted-which-fallout-proud-of/</link>
            <guid>1439833</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Todd Howard has been around the block when it comes to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda/" id="419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda Game Studios’</a> titles. He has contributed greatly to the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" id="311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-elder-scrolls/" id="976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/starfield/" id="307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield</a>, so he’s qualified to speak at length about any of them.</p>



<p>During a recent interview, the head honcho himself took a deep dive into <strong>every game </strong>on that list, stopping briefly to explain which Fallout game he’s <strong>the most proud of</strong> from all the titles he’s worked on. That includes Fallout 3, Fallout 4, Fallout Shelter (kind of), and Fallout 76.</p>



<p>But which one of them is the gem for Todd Howard?</p>







<h2 id="h-you-might-not-expect-it">You Might Not Expect It</h2>



<p>Out of the slew of Fallout games released in the last two decades or so (discounting New Vegas, as Todd didn’t really work on that one), there’s <strong>one </strong>that stands out for the visionary developer.</p>



<p>In a recent super-sized interview on the Kinda Funny Gamescast, Todd Howard gushed over <strong>Fallout 76</strong>, declaring it the post-apocalyptic epic that he’s most proud of.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In many respects, it’s the game that we’ve done that I’m the most proud of. It’s so hard to do and then maintain as a relevent game, and I think if you look across the industry, the amount of games like it that there have been or come and gone, and here’s 76 still there with big numbers and doing well.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of energy in the studio.</p>



<p>Look, people love it. The team on it, led by Jon Rush, they just do a fantastic, fantastic job, and you see the roadmap that’s planned for the game, and it gets even better.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Todd Howard also admitted that they designed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout-76/" id="438">Fallout 76</a> as a multiplayer title despite knowing that it wouldn’t be ‘for everyone’. That was always an expectation, given how Fallout was a single-player game for twenty years before Fallout 76 landed on the market.</p>



<p>He also stressed that more people need to recognize the work they’re putting into Fallout 76. It’s kind of a sticking point because everyone just keeps crying out for Fallout 5, which is <strong>many years away</strong> from even being revealed. But at the same time, Bethesda Game Studios has this phenomenal MMORPG that they’re keeping updated with reams of <strong>free content drops</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WWE 2K26 MyRise Details Revealed by Developer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-myrise-details-revealed-by-developer/</link>
            <guid>1439830</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> developer is providing new details on this year’s MyRise mode.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 will be released in about 3 weeks, on March 13. One of the key game modes every year is MyRise. This is the professional wrestling take on NBA 2K’s MyCareer. Every year, players take their created wrestlers on a journey to the top of WWE, with each year bringing a new storyline to the squared circle.</p>







<h2>Details on WWE 2K26 MyRise Are Starting to Be Revealed</h2>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/wwe-2k26-myrise-lead-talks-this-years-campaign-and-why-fan-favorite-jordynne-grace-is-taking-on-the-role-of-a-villain-we-work-so-far-ahead-from-wwe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechRadar Gaming</a>, WWE 2K26’s MyRise lead narrative designer, Sean Conaway, shared details of this year’s storyline, dubbed “The Comeback.” This year, the bones of the campaign mode remain the same regardless of whether you choose to play as a male or female WWE Superstar. In this year’s game, you play as a superstar returning to WWE after a long hiatus, something that has become more common on actual WWE television in recent years.</p>



<p>Your character, known as “The Archetype,” will run afoul of Paul Heyman. Paul Heyman’s main client in the campaign will either be Bron Breakker or Jordynne Grace, depending on the gender you choose for your character. Heyman and Breakker are currently paired on WWE television, but Conway says 2K had the idea to align them before WWE did, as game development takes considerable time.</p>



<p>“We work so far ahead from WWE that we kind of have to look in our crystal balls and try to forecast as best as we can who we think is going to be hot a year from now,” he said.</p>



<p>As for the decision to turn Grace into a villain, something she has yet to portray on WWE television, it was noted that the team at 2K sees a lot of potential in Grace, and that’s why they chose her for the role.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-expect-the-story-to-play-out-completely-the-same-depending-on-the-main-villain">Don’t Expect the Story to Play Out Completely the Same Depending on the Main Villain</h2>



<p>While the decision was made not to create two different stories and allow players to craft “The Archetype” as either a man or a woman, it is noted that the decision you make and the division you’re playing through will have substantial differences from its counterpart.</p>



<p>Also, with regard to some players feeling fatigued after being forced to play the WWE 2K25 MyRise multiple times in order to unlock the most content, Conway acknowledged that they were aware of the fatigue and noted it wouldn’t be like that this year.</p>



<p>Speaking of unlockables, learn how the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/" id="175166">Ringside Pass system</a> shakes up unlockables in WWE 2K26.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 The Final Chapter? Poppy Playtime Chapter 6, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/</link>
            <guid>1439812</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is finally here, and the twisted story of murderous toys continues. However, before it arrived, plenty of fans were theorising that this could be the final Chapter in the series, with a natural conclusion seemingly drawing near. </p>







<p>Well, now that the game is in the hands of the masses, the answer is pretty clear, and it seems like the fanbase is pretty divided on the outcome. If you’re wondering whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a> will continue after Chapter 5, then you’re in the right place, as Insider Gaming has it all figured out.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-chapter-5-of-poppy-playtime-the-final-chapter">Is Chapter 5 Of Poppy Playtime The Final Chapter?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s not over yet. Image by Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is not the final chapter. Judging by the ending of Chapter 5, a sixth chapter is all but guaranteed.</strong></p>



<p>Without spoiling the ending, which raises even more questions, it’s clear that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mob-entertainment/" id="3160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mob Entertainment</a> aren’t quite ready to cut the cord and wrap up Poppy Playtime just yet.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-cost-price-explained/" id="177112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Much Does Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 Cost? Price, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>For fans of the franchise, this is great news, as that means there is bound to be even more monstrous cuddly toys to evade and mysteries to uncover. But it also raises a new question: When will Chapter 6 be released? </p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-release">When Will Poppy Playtime Chapter 6 Release? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t let him catch you! Image by Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Although it may be obvious that Poppy Playtime Chapter 6 is a given, no official confirmation of its existence has been made by Mob Entertainment. Therefore, there’s no official release date to share. </strong></p>



<p>However, chapters for Poppy Playtime have released fairly regularly, with a new one dropping pretty much every year since the franchise began back in 2021. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-horror-games-ever/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/best-horror-games-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 Best Horror Games Ever, From Resident Evil to Outlast</a></li>
</ul>







<p>With that in mind, it’s highly likely that Chapter 6 will be released sometime in 2027, though that’s purely speculation. The franchise missed a year of content back in 2023, so it’s not a guarantee, but that would imply that it’d arrive by 2028 at the absolute latest.</p>

<p>Another first for CM Punk is now checked off the list: his indie wrestling theme song will be included in the next WWE video game.</p>



<p>Today, everyone knows that “Cult of Personality” by Living Colour is the song that plays whenever CM Punk heads to a WWE ring. However, there was a time when “Miseria Cantare: The Beginning” by AFI blared over PA systems as CM Punk made his way to the squared circle in promotions like Ring of Honor and Ohio Valley Wrestling.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a>, young CM Punk is a playable character, and not only have they included his Ring of Honor attire from the early 2000s, but the AFI song is also in the game. This news was reported first by <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/wwe-2k26-myrise-lead-talks-this-years-campaign-and-why-fan-favorite-jordynne-grace-is-taking-on-the-role-of-a-villain-we-work-so-far-ahead-from-wwe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechRadar</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-cm-punk-takes-center-stage-in-wwe-2k26">CM Punk Takes Center Stage in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>Not only is CM Punk the cover star of WWE 2K26, but he’s also the focal point of this year’s 2K Showcase mode. The mode will allow fans to play through many classic CM Punk matches and fantasy matchups that never occurred. </p>



<p>The scenes feature multiple eras of CM Punk over the last two decades, as well as his own custom arena, the CM Punkvillion. Learn more about Showcase mode <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-matches-and-details-revealed/" id="175572">here</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, CM Punk is heavily featured in this year’s Island storyline as the leader of one of the core factions, the Order of Anarchy. Learn more about Island mode at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" id="170633">this link.&nbsp;</a></p>







<p>WWE 2K26 releases globally on March 13. However, if you pre-order any premium edition, you can play the game one week early.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Amy Rose has found her voice.</p>



<p>Amy Rose was teased at the end of the third Sonic film. Now, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sonic-4-kristen-bell-voice-amy-rose-1236508342/">the Hollywood Reporter</a> has shared that Kristen Bell has been tapped to voice everyone’s favorite pink Hedgehog in Sonic 4, coming in March 2027. She joins the cast, which includes Jim Carrey, Ben Schwartz, James Marsden, and more.</p>



<p>Past Sonic movies have also featured Idris Elba voicing Knuckles the Echidna and Keanu Reeves voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>







<h2 id="h-kristen-bell-s-history-in-top-ips">Kristen Bell’s History in Top IPs</h2>



<p>Kristen Bell’s most famous voice-acting role is likely Princess Anna in Disney’s Frozen films. However, she’s also known for voicing Lucy in the first Assassin’s Creed game. Now, she adds Amy Rose to the list.</p>



<p>At this time, plot details are scarce regarding the fourth Sonic movie. Amy Rose is best known as the franchise’s most established female character. If you ask Amy, she’s the love of Sonic’s life, but he’s never fully committed to that.</p>







<h2 id="h-amy-rose-s-history-in-sonic-the-hedgehog">Amy Rose’s History in Sonic the Hedgehog</h2>



<p>The character debuted in Sonic CD in 1993 but became a focal point of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sonic-the-hedgehog/" id="570">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> franchise with Sonic Adventure in 1999. </p>



<p>The character has regularly appeared in games since then, sometimes as a playable character. She’s also been a key player in the Sonic X, Sonic Prime, and Sonic Boom cartoons.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega </a>announced plans to bring other IPs from the ’90s into animation.

<p>Todd Howard of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda/" id="419">Bethesda Game Studios</a> has put a spanner in the works of everyone hoping for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/starfield/" id="307">Starfield</a> resurgence by closing down claims that ‘Starfield 2.0’ is on the horizon (or the <em>event </em>horizon? Space joke).</p>



<p>Recently, those who attended behind-closed-doors sessions hosted by Bethesda were quickly taking to social media to pledge the imminent evolution of the game, but Todd Howard wants to set expectations straight. He has done so in a new interview by stressing that everything <strong>going forward </strong>will be about Starfield.</p>

<p>Starfield hasn’t exactly had the most love from Bethesda Game Studios. The game dropped in September 2023, and despite claims of a yearly DLC release schedule, we’ve had just <strong>one </strong>expansion land – Shattered Space. That expansion was known about <strong>long before </strong>the game came out, but by today, the game’s second expansion hasn’t been unveiled by the company behind the space-faring RPG.</p>



<p>Like other Bethesda titles, Starfield has relied heavily on the modding community to keep the content flowing.</p>



<p>However, now that the Fallout TV show has wrapped and Bethesda is looking to make Fallout 76’s content updates less ambitious, more focus can be applied to Starfield. In a recent interview with Kinda Funny, that’s exactly what Howard alluded to:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Obviously, we’ve been working on a lot of Starfield content, we haven’t talked about it yet. The end of last year for us was prickly, for us – we have periods where we focus on IPs and franchises, and Fallout obviously dominated the fall and earlier this year, but you’ve seen it. </strong></p>



<p><strong>And I can tell everybody we’re gonna be talking about it really soon. We’re moving into a phase where we’re going to be talking about Starfield and really show that in the right way.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then shut down the rumors and claims about Starfield 2.0, the sought-after next level of the sci-fi RPG that everyone believes would make it worth playing again.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>It is not Starfield 2.0 – I’ve seen some of that, and for expectation setting – I think it’s the kinda thing where – if you like Starfield, we think you’re going to love this. It’s updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but you know ‘meta’ – using outer space and things in ways that we haven’t. </strong></p>



<p><strong>But if Starfield is something that didn’t connect with you right away, or you bounced off it, or found it boring in places – I don’t think it’s going to change that fundamentally, but if you’re someone who loves Starfield and we think, we’re really happy with it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starfield is in dire need of a resurgence, especially as we’re not getting a new Fallout game for many years and The Elder Scrolls 6 doesn’t seem to be surfacing any time soon. Once upon a time, Starfield was the most hotly anticipated game in the business, but now it feels ready to be forgotten.</p>

<p>It’s almost the end of another week, and hopefully you’re ending it as strong as your streak is going right now (potentially). We’ve got another slammer of an NYT Connections puzzle to grind through today, but if you want to solve it as quickly as possible, just scroll down and pick out my best NYT Connections hints.</p>



<p>If you don’t want the answer straight away, I’ve got NYT Connections clues for you, but if you do, just hit the bottom of the page to secure what you need to know.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>
