<p>The DM-10 is a Marksman Rifle in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> capable of killing enemies in just two shots. However, you must use the best set of attachments, Perks, and Equipment to make the most out of the weapon in multiplayer.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-dm-10-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best DM-10 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Ported Compensator</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Weighted Handguard</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Kepler Microflex</strong> is a good optic choice for the DM-10 as the maps in Black Ops 6 are on the smaller side, and having a bigger scope would only leave you tunnel-visioned when the action is intense and fast-paced. This clean optic provides enough field of view to take down enemies easily.</p>



<p>Coming to the <strong>Ported Compensator</strong>, this muzzle will improve the accuracy of the Marksman Rifle by significantly enhancing the vertical and horizontal recoil. The <strong>Long Barrel</strong> will improve the damage range while the <strong>Weighted Handguard</strong> further lowers horizontal recoil.</p>



<p>Get hold of the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> Fire Mods as it will increase the fire rate of the DM-10. This will come in handy to shoot down enemies faster, especially when they appear in numbers.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-dm-10">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for DM-10</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Bankroll</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Tactical Insertion</li>
</ul>



<p>The combination of <strong>Ghost, Forward Intel, and Cold-Blooded</strong> will activate the <strong>Recon</strong> Specialty – which is crucial as a Marksman Rifler. You can briefly see opponents’ positions through walls during the start of a round and that split-second is enough to plan for lethal attacks.</p>



<p>Once you unlock Perk Greed, keep <strong>Bankroll</strong> in the fourth Perk slot to gain a +150 score toward <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-scorestreaks-black-ops-6-and-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scorestreaks</a>. This will come in handy to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-weapons-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level your weapons quicker</a> as Scorestreaks will recharge faster.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-dm-10">Best Secondary for DM-10</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the DM-10 are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-dm-10-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock DM-10 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You need to reach <strong>player Level 43</strong> to unlock the DM-10 in Black Ops 6. This is the last Markman Rifle you can unlock at launch and will require you to play several matches to get this gun. In case you were wondering, here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how you can level up fast in BO6</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-dm-10-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the DM-10 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the DM-10 is one of the best Marksman Rifles in the game at the moment. It comes with a very fast TTK and offers great mobility at the same time. Although its ADS speed is a little slower and a semi-auto weapon, you can kill enemies in just two headshots.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-dm-10-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the DM-10 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you don’t like handling semi-auto weapons, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> would be the best DM-10 alternatives in BO6. They are fully automatic rifles and are two of the most hard-hitting ones you can use.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-call-of-duty-zombies-original-crew-could-return-in-2025.1022889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Several sources have revealed that Call of Duty zombies original crew might be making their return in Call of Duty 2025.</p>



<p>The news comes from several sources who were invited to Call of Duty 2025 playtests and feedback sessions, where it was revealed that the original crew for zombies are set to make their return. </p>



<p>Dempsey, Tank, Takeo, and Nikolai were all said to be featured as a part of the feedback sessions, with one eagle-eyed zombies fan stating that the versions of the characters were not Ultimis, and that the characters looked older than Primis. </p>



<p>According to the same sources, the zombies storyline will evolve around a new enemy character who wants to absorb the “Dark Aether Essence” of the original four characters and bring back the old multiverse. </p>



<p>Sources also corroborated the recent zombies leak, that also originated from such playtests and feedback sessions. Sources said that the main zombies map will be “Tranzit inspired,” with some form of travel system to navigate around the map. One source, who was a part of such playtest also revealed that there was the plan to have 6 total zombies maps throughout the lifecycle of Call of Duty 2025, but whether or not the games scope has changed is unclear.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that these playtest events usually have some variations to the details, in order to gain valued feedback and potentially pinpoint the origin of leaks. However, from what we’re been able to determine, this information has been at various different feedback events worldwide over the past 12 months or so, suggesting that the information is almost certainly accurate (but never say never).</p>



<p>Per Insider Gaming’s reporting, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty 2025 is set to be a Black Ops 2 sequel</a>. It’s understood that the games campaign follows Harper and Mason as they try to save the world from a new villain following the death of Menendez. </p>

<p>Black Ops 6 players have figured out that you can explore the upcoming Warzone map ‘Avalon’ by using Black Ops 6 spectator mode.</p>



<p>Video footage of people exploring the map have been ongoing since the games launch, which shows the entirety of the upcoming map and what exactly it’s going to entail.</p>



<p>To load the map yourself, simple load up the multiplayer map ‘Lowtown’ in a Black Ops 6 private match and enter spectator mode, from here, you’ll be able to explore the map in full detail in the ‘Codcaster’ role.</p>



<p>You can see a video of the full flythrough below:</p>

Black Ops 6 Accidentally Leaks New Avalon Map?!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfWzQB1DdIM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But don’t get your hopes up just yet. Despite the map being already fully complete (and being so for a while now), it isn’t actually the next Warzone map to be released. Earlier this year, we reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk is set to make its triumphant return first</a>, which was a decision made around the same time as the highly popular original Fortnite map made its return and was tremendously successful.</p>



<p>It’s understood that Verdansk is set to make it’s return sometime at the beginning for 2025, with Avalon releasing sometime later in the year depending on Verdansk’s success.</p>
