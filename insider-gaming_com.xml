<p>BLEED Esports’ leadership team has come under fire once again for reportedly failing to pay players and staff. It has been claimed that for more than a year, the organisation has been lying to <strong>all of their players</strong> across multiple games, withholding salaries, and refusing to pay out tournament winnings.</p>



<p>In a straw-that-broke-the-camel’s-back move, the BLEED Esports Rainbow Six roster has pulled away from the organisation following a month of negotiation and communications with Ubisoft, and the players are now on an exposé mission.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-if-it-bleeds">If It BLEEDs</h2>



<p>The situation with BLEED Esports reached a tipping point when Patrick ‘MentalistC’ Fan, the R6 squad’s IGL, took to social media to slam BLEED’s leadership:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For the past year, BLEED has been lying to all of their players (Valorant, CS2, R6, OW, MLBB, Dota 2…) about payments, failing to pay salaries, making false promises, and withholding prize pools. They only ever provided us payslips with no proof of actual funds, a tactic they used to fool other organisations into thinking that they paid the buyouts of players.</p>



<p>For the past month, we have been consistently and clearly communicating with Ubisoft, pleading our case. We have clearly communicated with Ubisoft that:</p>



<p>BLEED has been ghosting us, having zero intention to cure their contract breach.</p>



<p>BLEED has been full of lies and false promises, and their words cannot be trusted.</p>



<p>As of the writing of this letter, our contract breach notice to BLEED has taken effect. We can now terminate our contracts with BLEED. We are awaiting Ubisoft’s final decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>MentalistC’s Twitter bio now marks him as a player for ‘NOTPAID R6S’, but moving forward, the roster will play under the name ‘BLED’. </p>



<p>He was backed up by other players, such as Taylor ‘Terdsta’ Ching, who claimed BLEED owed him a whopping $35,000. He insisted that he would be unable to pay his bills or even feed himself if it wasn’t for other avenues of income, like streaming.</p>



<p>In the wake of his scandal, seven members of BLEED (including a coach and an analyst) have vacated their Rainbow Six positions. One Counter-Strike coach claimed that BLEED has racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt in the CS world. This allegation came from Aleksandar ‘kassad’ Trifunovic, who claimed that <a href="https://x.com/kassad/status/1856281399617106130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BLEED’s CEO is actively ghosting</a> the situation and is fully aware of what’s happening.</p>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/r6/news/63631-bleed-r6-players-depart-the-organization-they-only-ever-provided-us-payslips-with-no-proof-of-actual-funds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EscoreNews</a> for the references.</em></p>



<p>The CEO, Mervyn Goh, has been scrutinised by fans and critics for the longest time. The bad press surrounding Goh is often insurmountable. In 2022, he allegedly beat a woman at a nightclub, and in 2023, it was claimed that the Singaporean government struck BLEED Esports from the registry.</p>



<p>If you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/R6ProLeague/comments/1g297l4/a_deeper_dive_into_the_allegations_about_mervyn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dive deeper into the topic</a>, you start to uncover references to ‘Mervyn Goh En Wei’ being embroiled in a vast array of legal issues.</p>



<p>Presently, nobody has been able to reach the CEO for a statement.</p>



<p>What do you think about this situation? If you’ve got anything to share, feel free to make a note in the comments.</p>

<p>The BLAST R6 Major Montreal tournament is unfolding as we speak, and this weekend, it’ll wrap as the action moves away from ‘Phase Two’ into ‘Phase Three’. Presently, the sixteen teams that made it into the Swiss System portion of the $750,000 tournament are battling away, but in just a few days, the victor will be crowned.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the tournament isn’t having as strong an impact as the last BLAST R6 Major, which took place in Manchester, England. Per a report published by Esports Charts, Montreal’s opening days pulled in 36% fewer viewers than the May Major, and things are yet to improve.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-weaker-traction">Weaker Traction</h2>



<p>Despite the tournament being days away from ending, the viewer count hasn’t risen all that sharply. On the first day of the tournament, per Esports Charts, the Montreal Major’s viewership peaked at 55,000 users. By today, that number has managed to climb to 78,000, but the Manchester Major’s peak hit 162,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It was the most popular BLAST R6 Major ever – but it was admittedly helped by an intense grand final between Team BDS, the tournament’s favourite to win, and beastcoast, an underdog side on a tenacious streak.</p>



<p>In the report published <a href="https://escharts.com/news/r6-montreal-major-day-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Esports Charts</a>, it was mentioned that fewer co-casters were covering the action at Montreal, which might go some way towards explaining the lower viewership, but we’re talking a single-digit difference. There’s still a solid spread of teams present at the event, from FaZe Clan to Team Liquid, so the fans <strong>should </strong>be eagerly tuning into the action.</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how things pick up going into the weekend. The grand final for the BLAST R6 Major Montreal is set to take place this Sunday, and it’ll hopefully be the biggest and most popular match of the event.</p>

<p>A God Pack is a set of opened cards that almost have to be seen to be believed in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Every man and his Growlithe are desperate to secure this most sacred of packs, and if you’re a regular Pokémon&nbsp;Pocket player with no idea what I’m talking about, here’s some quick background on a God Pack.</p>



<p>The Genetic Apex set kicked off Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket at launch. The collection features an array of super-special pulls, and the contents of each Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pack boil down to pure luck and RNG—there are no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-bent-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bent Pack Tricks</a> or secret <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Pick exploits</a> here.</p>



<p>This being said, if luck is on your side, there’s a slim chance you can pull a God Pack—and immortalize yourself in the annals of Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket history.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-pack-explained-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">God Pack explained in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We can all dream. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A God Pack is when every card in a Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pack is either a Holographic, EX, Full Art, or Gold Crown</strong> <strong>card</strong>.</p>



<p>Ordinarily, you’re hoping for at least one of the above in each pack: Or two at a push! As of writing, the closest I’ve come to a God Pack is two occasions where I’ve had two different Full Art cards in the same pack.</p>



<p>Now, there’s a chance you dear reader haven’t even had two in a pack (don’t envy me, I’ve had plenty of stinkers too), but this is nothing compared to some of the obscene Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pulls out there. Trickery and clever photo and video editing are part and parcel of the modern age, so not all “God Packs” are to be believed. However, a quick search of “God Pack” on either X or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/hot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TCG Pocket subreddit</a> is guaranteed to leave your jaw on the floor.</p>



<p>I’ve seen multiple packs featuring <strong>five Full Arts</strong>, and it’s absurd. The lowest pull percentage for a Full Art is <strong>5.263%</strong>—according to Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s Offering Rates—and it boggles the mind how it’s possible to get two, let alone <em>five</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-a-god-pack-in-pokemon-nbsp-tcg-pocket">How to get a God Pack in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<p><strong>You must get extremely lucky to get a God Pack in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket as it’s a completely luck-based process.</strong></p>



<p>There are no special items to use, no one-time-use percentage boosters, and no superstitions in the world that can boost your odds of getting a God Pack. Like any gacha-based system, Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s packs harness the concept of chance, inevitably leading to a ton of duplicates and disappointments once you begin to fill your compendium of creatures.</p>
