<p>A huge changing of the guard has occurred behind the scenes at Sucker Punch Productions. The mega-successful developer has announced that co-founder Brian Fleming has left, and two new faces will oversee the company’s future moving forward. </p>



<p>Since 1998, Brian Fleming has served as co-founder and producer of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-possible-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker Punch</a>. The team has created banger after banger through a myriad of Sly Cooper games, inFamous titles, and the acclaimed ‘Ghost’ series, from the PlayStation 1 all the way to the PS5. But December 16 is a significant day in the studio’s illustrious history.</p>

<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment announced the big news through a blog <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/the-next-chapter-of-sucker-punch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> on December 16.</p>







<p>The article states that “The Next Chapter Begins” with Jason Connell and Adrian Bentley teaming up to take the studio forward with new releases and ideas. The statement rather transparently reveals that Fleming has actually ‘worked closely with PlayStation Studios to ensure that Sucker Punch was in the best hands moving forward’ for the last year.</p>



<p>Here’s a more in-depth look at the statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Jason and Adrian have been instrumental in shaping the creative and technical direction of Sucker Punch in recent years. Jason, who served as Co-Creative Director on the Ghost franchise, has helped define the studio’s visual identity and storytelling style, bringing cinematic depth and emotional resonance to PlayStation players around the world.</p>



<p>Adrian, as Technical Director, has led the studio’s engineering and production efforts, driving innovation across development tools and game systems that make Sucker Punch’s worlds so immersive. Together, they represent the perfect blend of creative vision and technical excellence that has always set the studio apart.</p>



<p>Nate Fox will continue as Co-Creative Director to complete the overall creative leadership team.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It closes by wishing Fleming the best and reassuring fans that Sucker Punch is in good hands with its new direction. There’s also a little eyebrow-raising line at the bottom about “Crafting new adventures.”</p>



<p>This is nothing new, as it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker Punch might make a new Sly Cooper or inFamous game after Ghost of Yotei</a>. There’s still no word on the studio’s next game, but it will be under new leadership.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers behind the viral game ‘Unrecord’ have announced that it has received investment from Tencent to accelerate its development.</p>







<p>In a report via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-makes-minority-investment-in-frances-drama-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gamesindustry.biz</a>, it was said that Tencent bought a “minority stake” in Unrecord publisher Drama Games, but the percentage and investment amount was not disclosed.</p>



<p>“Since the surge of attention after our initial trailer, we’ve worked relentlessly to build a game that meets the expectations of our community,” Drama studios CEO and founder Theo Hiribarne said.</p>



<p>“In Tencent, we found not just a world-class partner, but a team genuinely passionate about our game and vision. Despite its scale, Tencent has approached this partnership with humility, respect, and a real appreciation for our creative identity. It believed in Unrecord early and has supported us at every stage of our growth. We’re confident this collaboration will help us reach our full potential.”</p>



<p>Tencent Games Europe’s VP of partnerships, Mark Maslowicz, said“Tencent believes deeply in creative talent. We’ve been consistently impressed by the drive and dynamism of Drama Studios, and the remarkable progress it has made on Unrecord, especially with such a small team and limited resources. This investment will help the studio unlock their full potential and deliver the first of many outstanding games. We’re excited to be part of Drama Studios journey.”</p>



<p>Unrecord currently has no set release date and it only targeting PC, but is currently number 9 on Steam’s wishlist chart.</p>







<p>The studio received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unrecord-developer-drama-studios-secures-2-5m-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.5 million in a seed series investment</a> from The Games Fund in September 2024.</p>
