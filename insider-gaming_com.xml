<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98">Marathon </a>will have a ranked mode, a new report suggests.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99">Bungie </a>has not officially confirmed many details about the upcoming extraction shooter, Marathon. However, new details have been shared with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marathon-ranked-mode-surface-scoring-holotags" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a> courtesy of leaker <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/2019105753978794502?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X0X_Leak.</a></p>



<p>The ranked mode in the upcoming game will have 6 tiers, with discussion of a 7th “Master” tier. The 6 tiers mentioned in the report are Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Pinnacle. Each tier has three individual sub-rankings as players level up. Ranked rewards will include cosmetics and other items, some of which players will be able to equip directly, and others will be gifted to them after a season is over.</p>







<h2 id="h-scoring-details-for-marathon-ranked-mode">Scoring Details for Marathon Ranked Mode</h2>



<p>The report goes on to mention scoring details, noting that players must have a Holotag equipped to score in a match. There is no Holotag equipped; there will be no contribution to the score. If players successfully exfil from a ranked match before reaching the target score, no rank progress is gained or lost. Failing to exfil results in a point loss equal to the full Score target.</p>



<p>Holotags have rarities equivalent to the ranks mentioned above. Each tag has unique effects that boost score targets when looted from other Runners during a match, also enabling potential scores higher than the initial target.</p>



<p>For example, a Silver Holotag grants players 5,000 credits to their score target on Infil, and any additional looted silver tags expand players’ credit capacities by 1,000.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ai-is-here-and-not-going-kingdom-come-director-admits/</link>
            <guid>1425901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Daniel Vávra, the writer and director of Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, has posted a predictive and somewhat damning statement about artificial intelligence on social media. He was responding to a video showcasing the insane advancements of photorealistic, gen-AI video creation tools, which are fast becoming <strong>terrifying</strong>.</p>



<p>Vávra, a games industry veteran of more than 20 years, stressed that movies and gaming ‘will never be the same’, and suggested we need to make the most of it because of the benefits it offers.</p>







<h2 id="h-everybody-hates-ai-well-actually-not-everybody">‘Everybody Hates AI (Well Actually, Not Everybody)’</h2>



<p>In a recent statement that some might dub inflammatory, Daniel Vávra, the creative director of 2025’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-year-ago-medieval-masterpiece-kingdom-come-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, bigged up generative AI. <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2019133539053084862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everybody hates AI (well actually not everybody). But I told you its unavoidable future. </p>



<p>Hate me as you wish. Its the truth. This is fan made trailer. Made in two days. By one person. Movie (and gaming) industry will never be the same. You can see it as an game over or as an opportunity for everyone to make great stuff without the big money from corporations. </p>



<p>But it doesnt matter what you think. Its here and its not going anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Vávra suggests that pushing back against AI is a fruitless effort, as it’s inevitable that the technology will continue to evolve. Instead, Vávra indicates that a symbiosis of sorts is the best way forward, using the progressive technology as a way to make things better and faster without gargantuan investments from ‘corporations’.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that more developers are falling into the use of AI these days. It allows them to iterate faster, test more effectively, and create games, especially larger ones, at a much more efficient pace. The sketchy area comes when generative AI is used to replace artists, musicians, and actors, and it has caused an intense amount of flak across the industry in recent years.</p>



<p>In a throwback interview with Insider Gaming, Doug Cockle (Geralt of Rivia, <em>The Witcher</em>) named <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doug-cockle-ai-voice-replication/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI voice replication ‘theft’</a>. It was a sentiment that has been echoed countless times since.</p>



<p>Vávra gave his thoughts back to those opposing his energy towards AI, offering up an analogy of sorts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My “art” is just a materialization of my thoughts, the result of my brain guiding my hands. Its similar as if you were saying that driving cars is unnatural cheating to reach something faster and only peple who really arrive in destination are those who walk…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s rough, but it makes quite a lot of sense, and it’s one of the biggest debates around the use of AI. Are you inherently evil or immoral for using AI to make your life easier, and is it better to struggle, take longer to do things, and spend more money just to declare you’re <strong>not using AI</strong> for something?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What is Liberty Prime Alpha? Fallout Season Two Ending Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/liberty-prime-alpha-fallout-season-two-explained/</link>
            <guid>1425871</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve just finished season two of the Fallout television show, you might have a few questions spinning around your head. Most critically, you might be wondering what Liberty Prime Alpha is and why it’s so important to those in the Fallout universe. This behemoth character was ‘introduced’ in the mid-credits sequence of the Fallout TV show’s second season finale, and it has some fans confused.</p>



<p>In case you’re unaware, Liberty Prime is the name of an enormous robot character in the Fallout universe, made most iconic in 2008’s Fallout 3 when it stormed into battle against the Enclave. It was seen again in 2015’s Fallout 4, but has lived in the shadows ever since.</p>



<p>But what’s <strong>Liberty Prime Alpha?</strong></p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-s-liberty-prime-alpha-is-coming">Fallout’s Liberty Prime Alpha is Coming</h2>



<p>In the closing seconds of the season two finale of Fallout, we saw blueprints for Liberty Prime Alpha, a towering robot that the Brotherhood of Steel, now led by ‘Quintus the Destroyer’, intends to build.</p>



<p>Those familiar with Fallout will instantly recognize Liberty Prime, but Liberty Prime <strong>Alpha </strong>is an entirely new construct, seen for the first time as the second season wrapped.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Liberty Prime Alpha could be the bgiger brother of this</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s assumed that Quintus, who was betrayed by Knight Maximus in the second season of the show, will attempt to build Liberty Prime Alpha, but his intended target is unclear. Liberty Prime is an utter wrecking machine, so Liberty Prime Alpha should be borderline apocalyptic, no pun intended.</p>



<p>It’s unclear where the blueprints for Liberty Prime Alpha came from, as Maximus’ friend Dane approached Quintus with them as the mid-credits sequence played out. At that point, Area 51, the home of the Knights of San Fernando, was the site of an exploding civil war between various chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel, one of Fallout’s oldest and most recognizable factions.</p>



<p>The most likely explanation is that the blueprints were somewhere <strong>in </strong>Area 51, and that was one of the driving reasons for Quintus to relocate his chapter there and try to align with the other faction bodies.</p>







<p>Whatever happens in season three of Fallout, we might see the creation of one of the biggest robots the franchise has ever seen. Are you excited? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/blizzard-entertainment/" id="87642">Blizzard </a>confirms <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch </a>will drop the “2,” launching a year-long Reign of Talon story arc with new heroes and seasons through 2026.</p>



<p>During the Overwatch Spotlight on February 4, Blizzard announced that not only are they launching the first year-long story for Overwatch with the “Reign of Talon” plot, but moving forward, the game would simply be known as Overwatch again. Season one of the new format begins on February 10. This arc will run through 2026, with five additional seasons, after which a new story arc will begin with season 1 in 2027.</p>



<p>Along with the new season will come the launch of five new heroes. Three of the heroes will be Talon-aligned: Domina, a tank hero; Emre, a damage hero; and Mizuki, a support hero. There will also be two Overwatch-aligned heroes: Anran (damage) and Jetpack Cat (support).</p>

<h2 id="h-the-reason-for-the-shift-away-from-overwatch-2-explained">The Reason for the Shift Away From Overwatch 2 Explained</h2>



<p>In a press release, the Overwatch team explained that they’re dropping the “2” from the game title because they believe the game is more than a number or an expansion; it’s a living universe, and this year marks a turning point in development.</p>



<p>“This year marks a huge turning point in how the development team envisions the future of Overwatch, so we are officially dropping the ‘2’ and moving forward as Overwatch,” they said.</p>



<p>Overwatch officially became Overwatch 2 in 2022, shifting to a 5v5 PVP-style game. In May 2023, Blizzard canceled planned hero missions for the game, which were to have RPG-style skill trees. The cancellation was due to the risk of diverting too many development resources from the live service game. </p>







<p>Now, the game again shifts focus and makes a new attempt to reach more players while still giving current players something to look forward to.</p>
