            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FPS weapon skins is always a divisive topic. Call of Duty’s reputation as a serious military shooter has been increasingly questioned in recent years due to its outlandish camos and Operator skins. Battlefield 6 appears to be curbing this zaniness, and the new BF6 weapon skin leaks suggest this.</p>



<p>Adding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-adding-beavis-butt-head-operators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beavis and Butt-Head to Black Ops 6</a> jumped the shark for many CoD fans. The franchise has incorporated anime characters and larger-than-life Kaiju characters such as Godzilla in recent years. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-cod-next-2025-schedule-where-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> fans are becoming disillusioned with the series’ lack of seriousness and self-awareness, and this seems to be something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/this-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6-fans-react-to-black-ops-7-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> is trying to steer away from.</p>



<h2 id="h-here-s-a-look-at-battlefield-6-weapon-skins">Here’s a Look at Battlefield 6 Weapon Skins</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No floating dragons here, yet. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 devs have already hinted that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-dev-hints-that-game-wont-have-unrealistic-skins-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BF6 won’t have unrealistic skins and cosmetics</a>. EA and Battlefield Studios <em>seem </em>to know what the people want.</p>



<p>A new leak from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a> reveals many Battlefield 6 weapon camos. Honestly, they’re quite normal, and it’s refreshing!</p>



<p>We’ve seen hundreds of camos from FPS games over the years. You’ve likely seen or equipped these skins if you play FPS games like CoD regularly. The Battlefield 6 camo leak shows an assortment of leafy woodland camos, minimalistic makeovers, more artistic and complex designs, and some that resemble classic Call of Duty Digital and Blue Tiger colors.</p>



<div><article><p><span>LEAK: Here are some of the Weapon Camos coming to Battlefield 6

W or L?</span></p></article></div>



<p>This is a leak at the end of the day. Don’t be surprised if some of these don’t make it to the final game. They could be subject to change, as we don’t know at which stage of development these leaked designs come from. So keep this in mind before you start dreaming about your favorite camo.</p>



<p>Are you hoping and praying that Battlefield 6 keeps it on the straight and narrow and doesn’t start throwing in lucrative tie-ins left, right, and center?

<p>It doesn’t seem to happen as often as it used to, but physical copies of games can still occasionally be sent out too early, and players get games several days ahead of launch. This is exactly what’s happened with Lost Soul Aside, and you should be on alert for spoilers, according to the game’s social media team.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a> continues the recent trend of pure action games instead of the relentless march toward Soulslike supremacy. The new ARPG is in the same vein as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Blade Zero</a>, and if you’re excited for it, you might want to watch out for spoilers.</p>



<h2 id="h-lost-soul-aside-spoilers-could-be-out-there">Lost Soul Aside Spoilers Could be Out There</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sworn to secrecy. Credit to Ultizero Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lost Soul Aside doesn’t officially release until August 29. This applies to digital editions and physical launches. However, unlike digital copies, it’s harder to keep a lid on physical pre-orders. Retailers can send out orders early, for example.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/Lost_Soul_Aside" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X account</a> for Lost Soul Aside has become aware of this very act happening: “It has been brought to our attention that some people may have gotten their hands on physical copies of Lost Soul Aside. Please do not spoil the game online, out of respect for each other!”</p>



<p>People are always keen to be first to everything. You can bet that YouTube is probably already filled with Lost Soul Aside videos and walkthroughs for content that’s not supposed to be seen by the public eye yet. I won’t check, as I also don’t want the game to be spoiled for me!</p>



<p>I advise you to block and avoid all mentions of ‘Lost Soul Aide’ on social media until the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonys-lost-soul-aside-release-date-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>.</p>



<div><article><p><span>It has been brought to our attention that some people may have gotten their hands on physical copies of Lost Soul Aside.

<p>How do you avoid spoilers for upcoming games? Or are you not bothered and are quite happy to get the early leaks before launch? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Helldivers 2 x Halo ODST Warbond releases on August 26, with an official start time of 5am PT.</strong></p>



<p>The start time coincides with the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox, a seismic moment as it marks the first time a Sony title has made the jump to the rival platform.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-division-2-was-%E2%80%98saved%E2%80%99-by-a-team-of-five-developers-%E2%80%98we-weren%E2%80%99t-supposed-to-exist%E2%80%99.1280397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft recently appeared at Gamescom to present the future of The Division 2, including the unveiling of ‘a big project’ that turned out to be The Division 2: Survivors. As the game approaches its tenth anniversary, more content has been lined up, but for a while, things looked a little sketchy for Ubisoft’s once-iconic third-person shooter MMO.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Palle Hoffstein, art producer at Massive Entertainment, revealed that a micro-sized team stumped up the courage to ‘resurrect’ The Division 2 when it was in a slump and content delivery had effectively ended, and the turnaround was something incredible.</p>



<h2 id="h-something-bigger-and-lasting">‘Something Bigger and Lasting’</h2>



<p>Ubisoft posted a timeline to social media on August 22, unveiling the immediate and long-term future of The Division franchise, including the string of expansions coming to The Division 2. The team also discussed The Division: Resurgence, an all-new mobile experience set at the heart of The Division’s <em>borderline </em>post-apocalyptic universe.</p>



<p>In a line of comments responding to that post, art producer <a href="https://x.com/Palle_Hoffstein/status/1959275482462953660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Palle Hoffstein revealed</a> how The Division 2 almost slipped out of reach, but a dedicated team of just <strong>five developers </strong>clawed it back from the zero-content abyss:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We had 5 people to restart Division 2. Five! What were we thinking? Ah that was fun.</em></p>



<p>When a few of us made a small team to resurrect TD2 I had zero interest in adding a year or two, just to sunset the game again. The goal, what we believed we could do, was to <strong>build something bigger and lasting</strong>. This is fun to see but there’s still so much more we want to do.</p>



<p>I figured the biggest challenge would be staffing and yeah. Studios plan staffing years in advance to keep everyone allocated and busy. We created a problem of being a team that needed positions filled that weren’t on anyone’s spreadsheet. <strong>We weren’t supposed to exist.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p><em><span>(</span>Thanks to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/ubisoft-allocated-5-devs-restart-the-division-2-build-something-bigger-lasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The Division debuted in 2016 and turned heads thanks to a solid marketing campaign and a great launch that plunged players into a desperate fight to reclaim New York from looters, shooters, and organized criminals. The Division 2 was released in 2019 and has become a staple of Ubisoft’s live-service lineup, even if things went wavy for a while.</p>



<p>Palle later revealed that when a 2024 crossover event that introduced Resident Evil to The Division aired, he might have been ‘the last person’ on the D2 team:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I might have been the last person actually on the D2 team, to launch the Resident Evil stuff. We were done. Then a few weeks later I was asked if I could do another apparel event for D2. Despite having no artists I said, “sure.” I assumed I could figure something out lol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahead of Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2025 in September, PlayStation has announced its lineup for the expo. The convention, held yearly, has already shown promise this year with contributors like Capcom and Koei Tecmo showing up with huge games. Now, PlayStation has joined in on the fun with two of its biggest upcoming titles.</p>



<p>This is the company’s second year in a row showing up to TGS after being absent from 2020-2023.  Last year, the biggest games were Monster Hunter Wilds and the GOTY winner Astro Bot. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach also held a showcase, where a new trailer was unveiled. While no showcases are revealed just yet, the two titles on display are sure to make fans happy.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As of right now, only two brand-new titles will be available for attendees to play on the show floor. Those titles, according to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/sony-interactive-entertainment-announces-preliminary-tgs-2025-lineup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a>, are Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yotei and ARC System Works’ Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls. More games will be announced closer to the expo’s start on September 25th, 2025. </p>



<p>This marks the first public demo of Ghost of Yotei, which launches a week after TGS on October 2nd. Meanwhile, many fans at EVO got their hands on Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls, with many more when the closed beta comes on September 6th. Still, both games are some of the studio’s and are sure to make a splash with attendees.</p>

<p>As part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/action_tps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam TPS Fest</a>, the multiplayer 5v5 shooter Last Flag released a surprise demo today. The fest, which celebrates Third-Person games with sales and demos, started today. While many demos were already available, like Star Wars Outlaws, Last Flag is one title nobody expected to see. </p>



<p>Last Flag, scheduled for 2026 for Steam (with console versions in the works), is a 5v5 multiplayer shooter by Night Street Games based on the infamous Capture the Flag mode. With a unique 70s art style and fun gameplay, it definitely stands out from other titles like Call of Duty and Battlefield. Therefore, the surprise release of a limited-time demo is sure to get some attention, especially after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-record-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s success</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-last-flag-s-free-demo-lasts-from-august-25th-to-september-1st">Last Flag’s Free Demo Lasts from August 25th to September 1st</h2>







<p>As per a press release, a free demo for Last Flag is available now on Steam for players to try. The demo will only be up for a week, ending September 1st. To get the demo, head over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721340/Last_Flag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Steam page</a> and download the demo. </p>



<p>With multiple characters to choose from, with a wide range of abilities, you’ll work together with your team to hide the flag and capture it. In addition, music for the game has been worked on by Dan Reynolds (Imagine Dragons), Grammy-nominated producer/writer JT Daly (Benson Boone), and Dave Lowmiller (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare). It seems like the perfect mix for players to create an unforgettable experience on and off the battleground.</p>



<p>Do you plan on playing Last Flag this week? If you have, how are you liking it? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>
