            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has just pushed out a small but mighty update for ARC Raiders – 1.4.0. This patch addresses some of the game’s most critical bugs and exploits, including one that has been plaguing players for the last couple of weeks.</p>



<p>It’s a graphical and quality-of-life thing more than anything else, and while no <strong>new content </strong>has been added with the 1.4.0 update, the improvements included in the change are being welcomed with open arms by players.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-more-locked-door-exploits-in-arc-raiders">No More Locked Door Exploits in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>The full list of content and bug fixes included in the ARC Raiders 1.4.0 update is being appreciated by fans of the ambitious extraction adventure:</p>



<ul>
<li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.</li>



<li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick-use item and back.</li>



<li>The exterior access to Spaceport’s Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low-resolution textures in the Main Menu.</li>



<li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.</li>



<li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.</li>



<li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.</li>
</ul>



<p>The locked door exploits were a huge bugbear for players legitimately using keys (which are often single-use) to enter high-tier areas, only to find that somebody had already scooped loot from the room without needing to bring in the key at all, some of which are drastically rare.</p>



<p>With this update, players attempting to access locked rooms without keys will now be incinerated. That’s right, <em>burned to death</em>.</p>



<p>The other bug (read: exploit) that was disturbing users everywhere was the ‘double pump’ gun exploit that allowed users to swap to a quick-use item and back again, flicking between two shotguns to produce an alarming rate of fire and damage output.</p>



<p>It was seen being used even by the game’s most prominent streamers, and it made close-quarters PvP almost unwinnable.</p>



<p>That has also been addressed by this small patch, which is available to download and install <strong>right now</strong> on all platforms.</p>







<p>Are you grateful to see the back of these exploits? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server.</a></p>

<p>Nintendo has announced plans to acquire Bandai Namco’s Studio in Singapore, where they already have an existing relationship due to contributions in developing the likes of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco Studio Singapore, which was established in 2013, has worked on the likes of Ace Combat 7 and Splatoon 3, and will now be brought under the Nintendo umbrella.</p>







<h2 id="h-bandai-namco-studios-singapore-to-become-nintendo-studios-singapore">Bandai Namco Studios Singapore to Become Nintendo Studios Singapore</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo announced</a> that, subject to approval, an acquisition of 80% of the studio’s shares will be acquired on April 1, 2026, with the remaining shares being acquired “after a certain period.”</p>



<p>Nintendo will rename the studio Nintendo Studios Singapore, which will become a subsidiary of Nintendo, but the studio will “continue its development operations.”</p>



<p>The Singapore studio is likely to become a support studio for Nintendo, continuing in a similar role that it has operated in for the past decade, with Nintendo stating it has “strong expertise in creating in-game art assets.” Nintendo adds that the acquisition “will have only a minor effect on Nintendo’s results for this fiscal year.”</p>



<p>Nintendo’s ongoing business relationship with the Singapore studio should lead to an easy transition, with the studio already familiar to the working processes given their involvement in the development of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>The ongoing expansion of Nintendo is already set to bring more of its famous IPs to life in the movie scene, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-movie-franchises-mario-zelda-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo involved in multiple projects</a> set for release after The Legend of Zelda in 2027.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Holiday season covers the months of November, December, and January. Most of the biggest game releases happen outside of this period, but there’s still plenty of the best games releasing in Holiday 2025.</p>



<p>As 2025 begins to wind down, players are peppered with massive games from August through to October. The season starts again around February and March. Sandwiched in this is the Holiday season, and 2025 still has the odd homerun to knock out of the park first.</p>



<p>Also, for even more holiday shopping guides, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a>&nbsp;for the best deals available.</p>

<h3 id="h-football-manager-26">Football Manager 26</h3>

<p>Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It’s incredible to think it’s been two years since the last FM game. But Sports Interactive finally dropped Football Manager 26, and while it’s <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-is-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-rated-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the worst games ever rated on Steam</a>, it’s selling like hotcakes!</p>







<p>It would make a nice present under the tree, and is sure to eat up any free time you have.</p>







<h3 id="h-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A big sequel. Image from Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Dynasty Warrior-like combat and gameplay aesthetics are back in The Legend of Zelda, thanks to Age of Imprisonment. It carries on the spin-offs’ focus on large-scale combat over cave exploration and puzzles, but it makes for one of the most unique Zelda games of all time.</p>







<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More Call of Duty. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ranked-play-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is the next Call of Duty game, and it doesn’t matter how it reviews, it’s guaranteed to be under most Christmas trees for Holiday 2025. It doesn’t have to be the best game; it just has to be Call of Duty—which it is. Insider Gaming understands this, which is why you can get money off the heavy-hitter below.</p>







<h3 id="h-kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A nice surprise. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stand back, Mario Kart World, there’s a new racing game speeding onto the Nintendo Switch 2. Mario Kart World was the guaranteed winner for the Switch 2 in 2025, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/controversial-kirby-air-riders-bikini-skin-has-already-been-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a> whistled through and turned out to be a pleasant competitor. It brings back a fairly niche franchise into the mainstream again.</p>







<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Samus strikes again. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-new-unlisted-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> journey has been stressful, but potentially rewarding. Metroid Prime 4 was starting to slip into the void and become another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-evil-2-still-advertising-new-job-roles-after-17-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>. It finally reappeared, and now it’s set to grace Nintendo Switch 2 consoles for the Holiday 2025 season, and it’s one of the most anticipated games—one you should probably buy if you have the console!</p>







<h3 id="h-code-vein-nbsp-2">Code Vein&nbsp;2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More pain. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Code Vein was Bandai Namco’s solo attempt to crack the Souls genre market. It didn’t quite reach the levels of a FromSoftware game, but its enchanting art style and sales were enough to captivate Bandai into giving the franchise another chance. Code Vein 2 is one of 2026’s first big games.</p>

<p>The new update and patch notes for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Version 1.02, are out now for Nintendo Switch 2. With it, new quests, weapons, and fixes have been added.</p>







<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-announced-at-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the newest entry</a> in the Hyrule Warriors spinoffs for The Legend of Zelda. In it, fans get to see the original Guardians that took a stand against Ganon, which is shown in flashbacks in Tears of the Kingdom. The Musou hack-and-slash combat and colorful visuals are well worth it, especially on Nintendo Switch 2, but now, there’s a lot more to get excited about with Version 1.02.</p>



<p>For Version 1.02 of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, available now, there’s some new content to enjoy. The biggest of all are new battles and quests, which are unlocked after beating the main story. New stylish Sync-Strike Attacks between Zelda and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-new-trailer-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calamo</a> have been added, as well as the Longsword of Light for Rauru. Furthermore, some improvements to split-screen and UI have been addressed and fixed.</p>
