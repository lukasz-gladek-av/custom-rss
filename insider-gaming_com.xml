<p>In a recent trademark filing, it was discovered that Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson, the world’s most-watched YouTube creator and a prolific entrepreneur, is planning to open a financial institution. The filing names the endeavour as ‘MrBeast Financial’, and categorizes it as ‘downloadable software in the nature of a mobile application for banking services’.</p>



<p>The filing went on to explain that MrBeast Financial would be used to provide short-term cash advances, cryptocurrency exchange services, investment banking services, and consumer lending services.</p>



<h2 id="h-from-youtube-to-big-banking">From YouTube To Big Banking</h2>



<p>Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson is more than ten years into his journey as a YouTuber, and in that time, he has risen to become the number one personality on the platform. He’s worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and from chocolate bars to restaurants, his entrepreneurial spirit has led him to kickstart many spin-off labels.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=99440901&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent filing</a> with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, it was discovered that Donaldson’s next foray might be into the financial world, with MrBeast Financial, a banking app, having been uncovered.</p>



<p>The MrBeast Financial platform has been described as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Software as a service (SAAS) services featuring software for banking services, investment banking services, investment management services, providing financial advisory and providing financial consultancy services.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/mrbeast-files-trademark-for-banking-app-with-a-focus-on-crypto-3269568/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The entity would have the power to provide cash advances, issue debit cards, process electronic credit card transactions, and operate a cryptocurrency exchange, amongst other things.</p>



<p>This is all up in the air, as while the application has been submitted, it’s not a promise that such a platform <strong>will surface</strong>.</p>



<p>What are your expectations of the MrBeast Financial app? Let me know what you’re predicting on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Former Assassin’s Creed Boss Confirms Ubisoft Asked Him To ‘Step Aside’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him-to-%E2%80%98step-aside%E2%80%99.1327333/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The news broke recently that Marc-Alexis Côté, a Ubisoft veteran and strategic leader of the Assassin’s Creed series, had departed the company after more than two decades. In the reports that surfaced after Côté’s withdrawal from the firm, it was suggested that he was offered a leadership role in the newly formed Vantage Studios, but wasn’t happy with the position and stepped back.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, Côté has set the story straight and explained that he remained business as usual until Ubisoft asked him to step down. He expressly confirmed that <strong>he did not walk away </strong>from the company he has called home for twenty years.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-truth-of-why-cote-left-ubisoft">The Truth of Why Côté Left Ubisoft</h2>



<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcalexis_the-past-24-hours-have-been-deeply-emotional-activity-7384672277055012864-87QR/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn post</a>, Marc-Alexis Côté explained why he’d departed Ubisoft after twenty years, the latter portion of which had been spent managing the strategic direction of Assassin’s Creed. In his words, it wasn’t his choice, and he did not walk away willingly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it.</p>



<div><p>The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.</p><p>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure.<br>A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years.</p></div>



<p>But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly:</p>



<p>I did not walk away.</p>



<p>I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It mostly gels with what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-assassins-creed-has-left-ubisoft-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original report</a> referenced, in that Côté left the company because of a situation related to the new Vantage Studios, formed after the merger between Ubisoft and Tencent.</p>



<p>Côté’s statement indicates his expectations were that he would <strong>lead </strong>the direction of the Assassin’s Creed franchise at Ubisoft, but that wasn’t the case. When that didn’t come through, Côté took it very personally and turned down whatever else was offered as a compromise, ultimately being asked to step down by Ubisoft because he (most likely) had no home in the new organization.</p>



<p>Côté wrapped up his post by saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As someone who grew up inspired by Star Trek (TNG!), in the later years of my career I came to see myself as the captain of the Assassin’s Creed ship, someone who leaves only once every soul on board is safe.</p>



<p>And that is exactly what I have done for as long as I could.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was expected that Pokémon TCG Pocket was going to celebrate its first anniversary in a big way, and it appears it will be delivering on that promise. Here comes the incoming Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising Pack.</p>



<p>We already knew that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-year-one-anniversary-update-includes-huge-wonder-pick-buff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shares, an upgrade to trades, and improving wonder picks</a> were going to be on the way, but now we know that the next pack will focus on mega evolutions.</p>



<p>Here is everything we know about the next Pokémon TCG Pocket expansion, Mega Rising.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-releases">Do We Know When Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising Releases?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One of the three headlines in the new packs. Image by The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>While there is no official announcement for Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising as of this writing, it is expected that the new packs will release on October 30. The release times for updates for these games are very early in the morning for the United States at 2 AM ET.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising">What to Expect in Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising</h2>



<p><strong>While we don’t know a ton of what to expect from the Mega Rising packs, you can definitely expect mega evolutions to be heavily featured.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vS2fnu49pw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Back in August</a>, the mobile game released a trailer saying that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-debut-mega-evolution-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mega evolution was going to be coming to the game this fall</a>. As of this writing, there are only three mega-evolved Pokémon we know for sure will be in the Mega Rising packs: Mega Altaria EX, Mega Blaziken EX, and Mega Gyarados EX. The packs that can be opened are split between the three cover Pokémon and should feature over 200 new cards.</p>



<p>When a mega evolution is in play, it will definitely be a big weapon for the player in control. They can be directly evolved from their previous form and give a nice boost in power. However, if the opposition takes down the card in battle, they will instantly win the battle, so be sure you are ready for the fight if you are bringing it in, as that is quite the balance of risk and reward.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shinies-dont-disappear-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> just releasing, mega evolutions are on everyone’s minds. That game brought back the feature in a console game for the first time since Pokémon X and Y were released on the Nintendo 3DS. Of course, Pokémon Go has had mega evolutions for a bit now, so Pokémon TCG Pocket will not be the lone mobile game to feature the mega popular power-up creatures.</p>

<p>Did you know that Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-removes-artwork-from-new-set-after-plagiarism-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed artwork due to some plagiarism claims</a>?

<p>The Apex Legends live service wagon just keeps rolling along, consistently bringing out new battle passes and content to keep players coming back time and time again. Up next is Apex Legends Season 27.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-apex-legends-season-26-fuse-mad-maggie-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 26, titled Showdown</a>, Apex Legends brought in a new permanent game mode called Wildcard, focusing on faster gameplay and chaos. It also added amps, which make a new way to augment your team in tough situations. Now, it’s time to look to the future.</p>



<p>Here is everything we know about Apex Legends Season 27.</p>







<figure><figcaption>This place may look very different soon. Image by Electronic Arts</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>While there is not an official release date announced for Apex Legends 27 as of this writing, leaks are suggesting that the update will happen on November 5.</strong></p>



<p>Of course, things can easily change between the information that leakers get and an official announcement, but typically, this does line up with the usual release for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-expected-decline-further-few-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a> seasons, which last about three months.</p>







<p><strong>You should expect the update for Apex Legends Season 27 to go live around 10 AM PT / 12 PM CT / 1 PM ET / 7 PM GMT on November 5.</strong></p>



<p>This is the usual time that seasons go live in the game, unless, of course, there are setbacks in the server maintenance or possibly delays.</p>



<h2 id="h-leaked-content-in-apex-legends-season-27">Leaked Content in Apex Legends Season 27</h2>



<p>The biggest leaked content that people are talking about in the upcoming Apex Legends Season 27 is a second Olympus. According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KptWKFHZI3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apex Legends leaker HYPERMYST</a>, there will soon be new screens displayed around the Olympus map that say, “Discovery on Pagos: Another Olympus?” If you ping that screen, your character will have a unique voiceline mentioning the scary prospect of a second copied city appearing out of nowhere.</p>



<p>So what does the second Olympus mean for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-launches-on-nintendo-switch-2-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a>? We highly doubt that this will be an additional map added to the rotation. Instead, the current version of Olympus might be getting a significant rework, this time receiving a lot of ice theming considering the mention of Pagos. A potential in-game event could follow it.</p>



<p>Outside of the second Olympus, HYPERMYST also says that the Sentinel will be getting a reactive skin, and Bangalore, Lifeline, and the Hemlock will be getting legendaries in the battle pass. There is also <a href="https://x.com/Osatou_Apex/status/1976969684949074254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">footage of dual-wield blades</a> coming to the game alongside the new season.</p>



<p>As of this writing, that is all we know about the Apex Legends Season 27 update. Expect some official announcements to be coming very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Like many other live service games, everyone is always looking forward to the next season of content, so we continue the cycle with Marvel Rivals Season 5.</p>



<p>In Season 4, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-daredevils-duelist-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daredevil</a> and Angela were both added to the playable roster, adding to the already expansive set of heroes in the duelist and vanguard classes.</p>



<p>Here is when you can expect Marvel Rivals Season 5 to begin.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-5-release-date-and-time">Marvel Rivals Season 5 Release Date and Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Wolverine is ready for some old friends to join the party. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals Season 5 will begin on November 14 at the usual start time of 2 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>The date has been confirmed by <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1974142618360570254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NetEase as of the release of the Season 4.5 roadmap</a>, which notches that day as&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below is a table that goes over the release in major time zones.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Time Zone</th><th>Marvel Rivals Season 5 Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pacific Time (PT)</td><td>2 AM – November 14</td></tr><tr><td>Central Time (CT)</td><td>4 AM – November 14</td></tr><tr><td>Eastern Time (ET)</td><td>5 AM – November 14</td></tr><tr><td>Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td>10 AM – November 14</td></tr><tr><td>Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td>8 PM – November 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-is-coming-in-marvel-rivals-season-5">What is Coming in Marvel Rivals Season 5?</h2>



<p><strong>As of this writing, there is no official announcement of the new content coming in Marvel Rivals Season 5, but various leaks, rumors, and in-game references point to Gambit and Rogue being added to the hero roster. Leaks suggest Gambit is a duelist and Rogue is a specialist.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Additionally, </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cross-progression-season-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>cross-progression</strong></a><strong> is making its full debut for all players after some have been able to test it in Season 4.5.</strong></p>



<p>With Gambit and Rogue being such a powerhouse couple being added to the game, the theme for Season 5 is rumored to be focused on romance and love. An interesting theme to take considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> had the Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman wedding day skins and event, which was held earlier this year.</p>



<p>The Season 4 Gallery Card also teases an upcoming tournament being held by Shou-Lou, who is directly linked to the new K’un-Lun map. With this map just recently being added, we would be surprised for another to be added so soon, so this tournament might be a new in-game mode, potentially something similar to Overwatch 2’s Stadium Mode, which was introduced in that game earlier this year.</p>



<p>That is just about all we have heard for possible content coming to Season 5, but knowing NetEase, there will be some surprises in store, including new skins, especially themed around romance.</p>
