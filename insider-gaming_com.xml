<p>Origins once again asks you to command an army and dominate the battlefield. You need to do this over many hours of gameplay, and Dynasty Warriors Origins has a few chapters to overcome—along with thousands of enemies.</p>



<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins is another exercise in hacking and slashing until it can be done no more. Moving from one arena to another, mercilessly chopping down hundreds of opposing forces. Developer Omega Force has done a good job with Origins as it’s currently the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-dynasty-warriors-origins-metacritic-score/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-rated Dynasty Warriors game</a> in history!</p>



<p>A refreshing overhaul of gameplay mechanics, a deeper story, lots of fun <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-dynasty-warriors-origins-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achievements</a>, and some of the most spectacular combat to date make Origins a strong entry. If you’re wondering how much action there is, let’s check out every chapter in Dynasty Warriors Origins and how long the game is.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-dynasty-warriors-origins-chapters-are-there">How Many Dynasty Warriors Origins Chapters Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lead and conquer. Credit to Omega Force</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five Chapters for each of Dynasty Warriors Origins’ campaigns. </strong></p>



<p>The chapters themselves aren’t named, the dev choosing to stick to generic numbers instead. <a href="https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw_origins/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Origins</a>‘ longevity comes from multiple playthroughs required to see and complete every mission. This is because you eventually come to a crossroads in the main campaign.</p>



<p><strong>Two of the five chapters are shared across the three campaigns</strong>, and you’re forced to <strong>choose your side in Chapter 3</strong>—leaving certain stones untouched until another journey through the conquest.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-missions-in-dynasty-warriors-origins">How Many Missions in Dynasty Warriors Origins?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 70 main story missions and 48 side missions in total if you replay Dynasty Warriors Origins multiple times and take sides with different factions at the point of no return.</strong></p>



<p>This is where we get to see a true test of your mettle. It’s a lot of content and requires many hours, but doing so is your best way of seeing all Origins has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-dynasty-warriors-origins">How Long is Dynasty Warriors Origins?</h2>



<p><strong>Your initial Dynasty Warriors Origins playthrough should take around 20-40 hours.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll likely wander off the beaten path because of how much side content there is. But based on Omega Force’s comments, and the consensus around Origins, this is a solid figure for your first playthrough. However, as I’ve said, there are well over 100 missions to complete, a ton of special weapons and items to find, and powerful abilities to unlock.</p>



<p>Completionists are looking at well over <strong>100 hours of epic Dynasty Warriors Origins content to see and do!</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is enormous. It boasts an open-world environment that players can explore at their desired pace, and it’s packed with secrets waiting to be discovered. From a massive medieval city to crumbling ruins, and from picturesque hamlets to bandit camps, you’ll never run out of things to uncover in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>Fans of the series <strong>know </strong>it’s a sizeable game, but how big is the map in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</p>



<p>Read on to find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-map-s">Map(s)</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 starts with players exploring a region called ‘Trosky’. Like in 2018’s Kingdom Come Deliverance, this is a faithful recreation of a real-world territory, and the towns scattered around the starter map all exist.</p>



<p>Trosky is fairly big, and it incorporates forest regions, a large central castle, winding rivers and hills, and a scattering of smaller villages, mills, and towns. The largest town on the map is Troskowitz, which is where you’ll find most of your traders.</p>



<p>To give you an impression of how big Trosky is in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, I had logged 35 hours in the game before I felt ‘ready’ to move on, satisfied that I’d done everything possible…</p>



<p>… And then I came back to the region later to find more objectives and locations to trawl through.</p>



<p>To learn more about that journey, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/">my full preview of the game</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map-size-huge">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Map Size = Huge</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <strong>really </strong>opens up when players get to the Kuttenberg region. Again, this real-world location is perfectly represented in KCD2, and every town that you visit <strong>exists </strong>in Czechia.</p>



<p>The Kuttenberg region is staggering in size and is made up of more than a dozen towns and villages. The heart of this region is Kuttenberg, a sprawling city that plays host to some of the game’s most major sequences and missions. At first blush, you’ll be blown away by Kuttenberg – it’s an imposing medieval city with branching alleys, dozens of stores and taverns, and many people to meet.</p>



<p>The Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 map is ‘fogged’ by default, requiring players to travel to actively uncover the map. This means that you’re constantly finding new locations and villages, up until the point where you’ve found everything – and even then, it doesn’t end.</p>



<p>I feel as though you’ll always bump into another NPC with a tip on a hidden location or a point of interest.</p>



<p>If you’re an explorer, you’re in luck – the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 map (or maps, if you’d prefer) is enormous.</p>



<p>Before you leave, check out my guide that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-a-sequel-answered/">explains more about the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 story</a>.</p>

<p>As promised, S-Game has released a new gameplay trailer for Phantom Blade Zero. The studio had said it would release an trailer today to celebrate the Year of the Snake. In case you didn’t know, 2025 is the Year of the Snake in the Chinese and Japanese calendars.</p>



<p>Watch the video below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero - Year of the Snake Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZX1k0z2pPY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Made in Unreal Engine 5, the visual quality of the game is impressive. The lighting and combat animations have definitely been given a hefty boost since the last trailer for the game.</p>



<p>Players are increasingly looking forward to Phantom Blade Zero. The game ended up being sponsored by PlayStation, which certainly helps to raise expectations for it. Phantom Blade Zero is a spiritual successor to Rainblood: Town of Death, a game created in RPG Maker.</p>



<p>Over the years, Rainblood became an IP called Phantom Blade, which has sold more than 20 million units. Now, S-Game is seeking its place in the AAA gaming ecosystem with this new venture.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-story-of-phantom-blade-zero">The story of Phantom Blade Zero</h2>



<p>Phantom Blade Zero will have a semi-open world and the story has already been revealed. Check out the synopsis below:</p>



<p><em>In Phantom Blade Zero, you are Soul, an elite assassin who serves an elusive but powerful organization known simply as “The Order”. He was framed for the murder of The Order’s patriarch and seriously injured in the ensuing hunt. A mystical healer managed to save him from death, but the impromptu cure only lasts 66 days. He must discover the mastermind behind it all before his time runs out, facing powerful enemies and inhuman monstrosities.</em></p>



<p>Kenji Tanigaki, the action director of the Samurai X films, acts as action director for Phantom Blade Zero. This alone explains how the moves are so acrobatic and realistic.</p>

<p>There’s still a future for Mortal Kombat 1. In a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1881825221369528644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multi-post thread</a> on Twitter on Tuesday evening, Mortal Kombat created Ed Boon talked about the state of the game while quickly mentioning future DLC plans for Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>First thing’s first, Boon announced that Mortal Kombat 1 has sold more than 5 million copies since its September 2023 launch. On top of that, the game continues to remain in the top 15 games on PlayStation 5 in terms of weekly active users.</p>



<p>Boon also mentioned the release of the game’s Conan the Barbarian DLC that launched on January 21 as the game’s 11th DLC fighter. A 12th fighter, the T-1000 Terminator, will be the next addition to the game’s roster.</p>



<p>As far as future fighters go, there has been a lot of rumors surrounding DLC wrapping up for the game after the lackluster sales of Kombat Pack 2 and the Khaos Reigns expansion. While Boon didn’t mention another Kombat Pack or story expansion specifically, he did say that there was more to come for players.</p>



<p>“With Conan getting into player’s hands, we are excited to keep trucking forward with future DLC,” he posted. </p>



<p>The end of Mortal Kombat 1 DLC began thanks to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known franchise leaker</a>. According to their claims, says that plans for Kombat Pack 3 and a second story was cancelled at NetherRealm studios. He did say, however, that it was possible for “a kameo or two” to be added to the game after Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 due to the work that had already been done. </p>



<p>NetherRealm hasn’t fully addressed those claims.</p>



<p>What do you think of more future Mortal Kombat 1 DLC being a hinted at? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>
