<p><strong>LATEST UPDATE 9:00PM ET: </strong>Sony has published on social media that it is ‚Äúaware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN.‚Äù They then point people to the official PlayStation Network status page for updates where it says they are ‚Äúworking to resolve the issue as soon as possible.‚Äù </p>



<p>As of this update, the service remains offline.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: It‚Äôs not just you. The PlayStation Network is down for everyone.</p>



<p>Outages began appearing around 6pm ET, according to multiple reports. A visit to the official PlayStation <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status page shows</a> that all services are down, including the PlayStation Store, gaming,  account management, and more.</p>



<p>As of writing there is no official word from PlayStation regarding the outage. Nor is there any idea as to when service will be restored.</p>



<p>Based on a preliminary check, it appears to be only PlayStation Network suffering issues. Other major online services such as Xbox Live, Nintendo Online, and Steam appear to be working as expected. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to provide updates as they become available.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98you-just-can%E2%80%99t-beat-me%E2%80%99-%E2%80%93-m80-gunnar-goes-off-against-liquid-at-six-invitational.1103781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/m80-gunnar-team-liquid-six-invitational/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier today, M80 dominated Team Liquid in the group stage of the Six Invitational 2025 tournament. This super-sized event boasts a $3 million prize pool and is one of the most important tournaments in the annual esports calendar, so it comes as no surprise that emotions can run wild.</p>



<p>Following the 2 ‚Äì 1 win over Team Liquid, M80‚Äôs Shaun ‚ÄòGunnar‚Äô Pottorff blew up behind the scenes, with the moments after the victory just about being captured by M80‚Äôs social team. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-doesn-t-matter-what-team-i-m-on">‚ÄòIt Doesn‚Äôt Matter What Team I‚Äôm On‚Äô</h2>



<p>Gunnar has been around the block against Team Liquid. The comments he made following M80‚Äôs win in the group stage of this year‚Äôs Six Invitational were backed up by cold, hard numbers. In recent years, Gunnar has taken down Team Liquid while being a part of three separate rosters.</p>



<p>He did it with Soniqs, then against with beastcoast, and now with M80.</p>



<div><article><p><span>After our WIN vs LIQUID 

‚ûû Take a look INSIDE the ARENA! üèü </span></p></article></div>







<p>In 2024, Gunnar and beastcoast stormed to success at the BLAST Manchester Major, securing the organisation‚Äôs first major win. That victory included the brutal knocking out of Team Liquid. Beastcoat eliminated the Brazilian squad without dropping a map, before going on to beat Team BDS 3 ‚Äì 2 in the grand final.</p>



<p>Gunnar had sharp words for Team Liquid following today‚Äôs win:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You can‚Äôt beat me! You guys just can‚Äôt beat me. It doesn‚Äôt matter what team I‚Äôm on.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs three different teams ‚Äì you can‚Äôt beat me.</p>



<p>Three different teams, three different rosters, same f***ing results, bro.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>M80 picked up the former beastcoast roster following the disbanding of the team in the run-up to the Six Invitational 2025. Thus far in the tournament, M80 has performed pretty well, and at the time of writing, the team sat in second place in the group, just a few points behind G2 Esports, the favourite to win the event.</p>



<p>This weekend, the Six Invitational will depart the group stage and enter the playoffs bracket, with the bottom teams in each group being effectively eliminated from the running.</p>

<p>Take-Two stocks have reached an all-time high after reconfirming that GTA 6 will be releasing fall 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1887983768201298182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">videotechuk_</a> on X, after CEO Strauss Zelnick reaffirmed a fall 2025 release date for GTA 6 at their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent earnings call,</a> Take-Two‚Äôs stocks started climbing, creating a new record today. Take-Two Interactive Software‚Äôs stock opened at $198, reached a high of almost $213, and closed at $208.77.&nbsp;The company‚Äôs confidence has reassured investors. </p>



<p>GTA 6 is the most anticipated release in the gaming industry, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many publishers</a> do not want to release their games close to Rockstar‚Äôs new instalment. Players were worried, as no news about the game had been revealed since the trailer in December 2023. The community speculated that a delay could be imminent. However, since the game was announced, the developers have stayed strong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-2025-release-promoted-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the 2025 release window</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the CEO of Take-Two recently made a statement, players hope Rockstar will provide more information soon to get them even more excited about Fall 2025. It would be exciting to see some new gameplay and glimpse all the fresh innovations Rockstar may have implemented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same earnings call, Take-Two‚Äôs CEO spoke about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-plans-to-support-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo‚Äôs upcoming console, Switch 2</a>. However, it wasn‚Äôt confirmed whether their upcoming games, like Grand Theft Auto 6 and Borderlands 4, will be released on the platform. Also, NBA 2K25‚Äôs player spending <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-says-nba-2k25-surpassed-player-spending-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‚Äúgreatly surpassed‚Äù expectations</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Insomniac Games wanted to develop Resistance 4, but PlayStation turned it down. That‚Äôs according to soon-to-be president of Insomniac Games Ted Price.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZWKbHKCUkpw?t=1311s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kinda Funny Games</a>, Price was asked about a favorite game of his that was pitched but never greenlit.</p>



<p>‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôll share one,‚Äù Price said after a brief pause. ‚ÄúResistance 4.‚Äù</p>



<p>He continued: ‚ÄúWe did pitch that one and it was a wonderful concept, and, it just, in terms of timing and market opportunity, didn‚Äôt work out. But it was the result of a lot of Insomniac  team members being passionate about extending the story further because I do believe that Resistance has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are.‚Äù</p>



<p>Price said that they spent a lot of time working on backstory and brainstorming on where the series could go in the future.</p>



<p>‚ÄúPersonally, I love this franchise,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúI was fortunate enough to be creative director on the first two Resistances. And I will remember many, many moments‚Äîgood and bad‚Äîwhen it comes to development that taught us all a lot about how we can elevate ourselves under some pretty difficult situations.‚Äù</p>



<p>Resistance, which first debuted with 2006‚Äôs Resistance: Fall of Man, hasn‚Äôt seen a mainline game since 2011‚Äôs Resistance 3. Price said that there‚Äôs no answer to the question of if the studio will ever develop another Resistance game, but it‚Äôs something he hopes will happen in the future.</p>



<p>What do you think of Price and Insomniac wanting to develop Resistance 4? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>There is going to be a major update coming to Balatro sometime in the future. What‚Äôs included in that update, however, is currently unknown, and that‚Äôs by design.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-07/maker-of-smash-indie-hit-balatro-talks-about-what-s-next?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODk1NTUwNCwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NTYwMzA0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkJVTUxEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.vnpDPy2eO2srUo1cO71bFTutl-JvFojih-o2zs4niu4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg‚Äôs Jason Schreier</a>, Balatro developer LocalThunk gave a small update on the next update he‚Äôs working on. </p>







<p>The update, which he calls a ‚Äú1.1‚Äù update for the game will include new Jokers along with various other features. LocalThunk didn‚Äôt want to get into exactly what those features will be because of potential constraints that would put on him such as the ability to ‚Äúpivot if something new doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs healthier for the game that I keep my cards close to my chest, then give you the best version of whatever this new content update is,‚Äù he said.</p>



<h6 id="h-listen-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">LISTEN: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Despite not wanting to give anything away, he did reveal two changes that will come with the update. The first is a change to the ‚Äúblue stake‚Äù modifier while the second is a change to the Matador Joker‚ÄîEarn $8 if played hand triggers the Boss Blind ability. As far as what those changes will involve, that wasn‚Äôt said. Details on that, along with everything else players can expect, will come closer to its release.</p>



<p>The update is expected to arrive sometime this year.</p>
