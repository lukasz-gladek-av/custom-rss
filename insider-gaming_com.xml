            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, clips have started emerging on social media showcasing ARC Raiders players creating mobile barricade systems via a newly-discovered exploit. With the assistance of ziplines and deployable barricades, users are building semi-useless bulletproof shields that they can carry either in front of themselves or as a complete, 360-degree shield.</p>



<p>It sounds strange, and it’s hard to convey, so be sure to check out the clips below to understand what we’re talking about.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-barricade-exploit-is-pretty-hilarious">ARC Raiders Barricade Exploit is Pretty Hilarious</h2>



<p>The recent barricade exploit in ARC Raiders has been popularized by streamers like TheBurntPeanut. The award-winning streamer was captured experimenting with the exploit during a recent broadcast, when one of his teammates – Hutch – was seen enshrouded by a four-barricade shield.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a later clip, the creator was using a bizarre contraption made up of a barricade, zipline, and jolt mine to push along a corridor while trying to deflect damage with his mobile shield. It wasn’t a successful effort, which has prompted ARC Raiders players to ridicule the exploit, dubbing it completely pointless.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple to complete this exploit. For those wanting to build a large, mobile shield, you’ll need four ziplines, four deployable barricades, and a ‘depot battery’. You need to place ziplines onto the battery, and then once deployed, you can place a barricade <strong>on </strong>the zipline, with a little fiddling around.</p>



<p>Do that four times, and you have your shield.</p>



<p>In the second clip from TheBurntPeanut, you can see the zipline trick was only completed once, creating a ‘riot shield’ of sorts rather than an encircling barricade.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mpc-25-kicked-out-of-cdl-by-pro-players/</link>
            <guid>1402345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League has come under intense scrutiny once again from fans due to a questionable GA that has locked down anyone attempting to use the MPC-25 SMG. The weapon was used <strong>very briefly</strong> in recent days, most notably by Skyz, and all of a sudden, pro players have decided to nix the gun ahead of Major I.</p>



<p>This pushes the CDL back to a two-weapon meta, forcing players to use the Dravec and M15 once again, prompting an outcry from fans desperate for a little variety ahead of the season’s first Major tournament.</p>







<h2 id="h-mpc-25-is-gone-from-the-cdl">MPC-25 is Gone From the CDL</h2>



<p>The MPC-25 lasted no time at all in the Call of Duty League, the top flight of COD esports. It was used for a couple of hours and then pushed clean out of the rotation by a fresh GA (Gentleman’s Agreement).</p>



<p>This has prompted fans of the League to take to social media to rage against ‘soft’ pro players who will do anything to control every facet of the ecosystem.</p>



<p>ACHES, one of the most prolific former pro players in the space, said: <em>‘Slasher retired and the next day they GA’d the one gun used on 2 maps. The last of the old guard is gone.’</em></p>



<p>Sam ‘Octane’ Larew, one of the more recent retirees from the Call of Duty League, wrote:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The current set of pro players gotta be the most cry baby pussy set of players COD has ever had. They’d GA the M8 in BO3. <a href="https://t.co/esK6xiC1n8">https://t.co/esK6xiC1n8</a></p>— Sam “Octane” Larew (@OctaneSam) <a href="https://twitter.com/OctaneSam/status/2009833696279617691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Many pointed out how ‘busted’ the MPC-25 is under a 10-meter range, which is the leading reason behind the GA, but others have stressed that it simply doesn’t hold a candle to the existing meta and should have been left alone.</p>



<p>Another CDL fan wrote, <em>‘The MPC gets demolished outside of like 12 meters by the Dravec and M15, you’re taking a BIG risk pulling out an MPC, and you’re rewarded with a better TTK up close. That’s how it should be. Pros just HATE 3 gun metas, BO7’s our last good cod in a long time, we’re wasting it.’</em></p>

            <guid>1402342</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>Update: </strong>At the same minute as this article was posted, the Apex Legends team gave an update confirming the resolution of this issue: ‘This incident is now resolved with the help of our community. Anti-Cheat is a constant cat-and-mouse game and your reports are imperative to bringing information to our attention, including the one that helped us today. Thanks for your patience as our teams jumped to tackle and resolve this issue.’</p>



<p>Fans have taken to social media to cry out against the latest Apex Legends hack. The situation is dire, and ‘a bad actor’ is utilizing an unknown exploit to control other players’ characters in the popular battle royale game. This has led to Respawn making an official statement declaring an ‘active security incident’.</p>



<p>In a two-minute clip uploaded on social media, users get a first-hand look at the depth of this issue. In the video, a player is toyed with multiple times, with the hacker emptying their inventory and throwing them off the map.</p>











<p>In a post on social media, the team at Respawn Entertainment wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are aware of an active security incident where a bad actor is able to control the inputs of another player remotely in (Apex Legends).</p>



<p>Based on our initial investigation, we have not identified evidence that suggests the bad actors can install or execute code as in the case of an RCE or injection attack. </p>



<p>We are actively working on a solution and will update you when we have more information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This message was posted a few hours after a clip surfaced showcasing the exploit in question:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is far from being the first major hacking incident to hit Apex Legends, one of the oldest and most popular battle royale games on the market. In January 2025, some of the most notable pro players had their accounts hijacked, and in March 2024, the Apex Legends Global Series was <strong>taken over </strong>by malicious operators during a live broadcast, and the hack was <strong>very similar </strong>to this one.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to criticize the situation in the comments under Respawn’s post. One user pointed out:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apex is a security risk to have installed at this point</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>lol maybe if they focused more on Anti-Cheats and better security they wouldn’t have these problems but instead they focus on buffing characters and more boring events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use these Roblox Death In The Box monthly redeem codes to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Wheelspins and much more.</p>



<p>Death In The Box is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-volleyball-legends-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a high-stakes survival and strategy game. Players are required to compete against up to 15 other participants upon launch, and from there, navigate through a series of deadly challenges orchestrated by a menacing clown figure. With a unique blend of luck-based events and strategic card play, Death In The Box offers an intense competitive experience where players must outthink and outlast their opponents to be the last one standing.</p>







<p>Having been released in August 2023, Death In The Box has gradually gained traction and now boasts over 87 million visits with an active player base of more than 2,000 players. Although mastering the card system and understanding strategic voting mechanics is enough for players to improve their survival chances, using redeem codes to get extra Wheelspins is never a bad idea.</p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes, so players can redeem the active codes safely.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Death In The Box Codes Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Redeeming Death In The Box codes is a fairly straightforward matter, and they have made sure that even newer players to the game can navigate to the codes section and claim their rewards without too much fuss. Here’s how:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Death In The Box in Roblox</li>



<li>Click on the button with the gears on the left-hand side of the screen</li>



<li>At the base of the pop-box, there will be a text box for codes</li>



<li>Enter or paste the active code in the box</li>



<li>Click on ‘Confirm Code’ to collect the freebie</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-death-in-the-box-codes">How To Get More Death In The Box Codes</h2>



<p>Death In The Box codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Death In The Box Discord server, which features a dedicated announcements channel where all new codes are posted first, and the ARK-ADE Roblox group, where updates and milestones are announced.</p>



<p>Codes often come out around special events, major updates, or game milestones, but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as new codes go live, and any expired codes are removed promptly, so you always see only the ones that are still active.</p>

<p>Games Workshop announces plans to bring Warhammer World to the United States by 2027</p>



<p>For those enthralled by the Warhammer universe, a Warhammer World could be coming to the United States within the next two years. Games Workshop announced on their website that they have begun working on the second Warhammer World just outside of Washington, DC.</p>

However, they hope to create something special for Americans passionate about the Warhammer hobby.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Based just outside Washington DC, this new Warhammer World will be a flagship venue that celebrates Warhammer in all its forms: gaming, painting, modelling, storytelling, events, and community.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>As for the video game side of Warhammer 40,000, Space Marine 3 is<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-is-in-development"> currently in development</a>, but there are still free updates planned for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 later this year.

<p>Masahiro Sakurai is one of the most well-known game developers in the industry. Best known for his work in the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, he remains a pillar of Nintendo.</p>



<p>Now, he’s discussing the changes the game development process has undergone over the years and why he’s not a fan of massive teams.</p>







<h2 id="h-masahiro-sakurai-dislikes-how-game-development-teams-continue-to-increase-in-size">Masahiro Sakurai Dislikes How Game Development Teams Continue To Increase In Size</h2>



<p>Recently, he was interviewed by Japan’s <a href="https://www.47news.jp/13701368.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">47NEWS</a> and discussed how much more satisfying it is to see the results of your work when you work solo, rather than constantly checking in with others. To him, the strength of an individual’s work runs the risk of getting lost in the shuffle when part of a larger team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Talking specifically about game development, it’s very satisfying to see the results of your hard work,” Sakurai said<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-it-can-be-really-frustrating-working-on-massive-games-with-hundreds-of-devs-there-is-work-that-clearly-shows-your-results-and-work-that-doesnt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> (via GamesRadar+)</a>. “You don’t get this when working in a team, and it can be really frustrating. For example, when a pixel artist draws a picture by themselves then they of course finished it. But when managing a team, it’s often difficult because you have to keep talking about what kind of pixel art is suitable.</p>
</blockquote>







<blockquote>
<p>“I feel like this is getting more difficult with large-scale games. Staff size is rapidly increasing into the hundreds. The sense of fulfillment gained from making something by yourself is different to something made as part of a group. What you are meant to do is also changing.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sakurai recently helmed the development of Kirby Air Riders, released exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2. Check out our coverage of the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=kirby+air+riders">here</a>.</p>

<p>The first Nintendo GameCube game to hit the Nintendo Switch Online service in 2026 is a pillar of one of Nintendo’s top franchises, one with a new game releasing later this year.</p>



<p>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is now playable for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online as part of the Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics service, which is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-fire-emblem-takes-center-stage-in-2026">Fire Emblem Takes Center Stage in 2026</h2>



<p>Released in 2005, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is the sole game in the series released on the Nintendo GameCube. It’s also the first console game in the series to be released in the U.S. At the time, the game was received well critically. Since then, five more games have been released in the series. The game features Ike as the main character. He would go on to be a playable character in multiple Super Smash Bros. games.</p>



<p>Path of Radiance is the eighth Nintendo GameCube game to be made available on the Nintendo Switch Online service. However, unlike other releases such as F-Zero GX and Wario World, players know when the next game in the franchise will be coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Later this year, Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave will launch as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. That game was announced during the September 2025 Nintendo Direct. As of this writing, there is no official release date for the game.</p>

Featuring 38 characters, the game will have the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-unveils-new-features-and-characters-in-mario-tennis-fever-gameplay-overview-trailer/">largest roster in series history.</a></p>
