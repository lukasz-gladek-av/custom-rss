<p>Eagle-eyed users have found an ad for Black Ops 7 that seems to have aired too early, promoting the game’s pre-order availability, release date, and Vault Edition pack. In the short, fifteen-second ad, we get a first look at boost jump abilities, a mission containing hulking mech suits, and some kind of dream sequence pitting players against a human enemy several storeys tall.</p>



<p>This ad was mistakenly released mere hours before Black Ops 7 is set to be revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-release-date-confirmed-in-leaked-ad">Black Ops 7 Release Date Confirmed in Leaked Ad</h2>



<p>On social media, users started circulating a screengrab of an ad for Black Ops 7. In this fifteen-second clip, we see highly vertical combat aided by ‘mega jump’ boost packs, <strong>not </strong>jetpacks. In the sequences that unfold, the player character leaps high into the air and coasts over the battlefield, which is a representation of the traversal in this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>We also see a snippet of a mission showing a fight against an enormous and heavily armed mech. In classic Black Ops style, things appear to get a little trippy as the player is forced into a battle against a Galactus-sized enemy in what looks like a dream sequence.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer (might have been removed by the time you read this):</p>

<p>The screen grab is low resolution, but we get a look at the Vault Edition components, too. It looks like the skins that were previously leaked, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/">the Reznov Challenge Pack</a>, are all coming. When you pre-order, you’ll get early access to the beta, but the date for that test wasn’t revealed.</p>



<p>The release date was confirmed as November 14, which was suggested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/">in an earlier leak</a>.</p>
