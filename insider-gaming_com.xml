<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed that Helldivers 2’s file size has been reduced by 85%, and the new ‘slim version’ can be tried in beta. </p>



<p>The performance issues and installation size in Helldivers 2 have become a pain in Arrowhead’s neck, and they have been hard at work trying to solve these problems. The developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-comment-on-installation-size-and-load-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> in October on improving the game’s file size, and now they have delivered the result, reducing the installation size by more than 3 quarters. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-file-size-reduced-from-154gb-to-23gb">Helldivers 2 File Size Reduced from 154GB to 23GB </h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Steam states that the Helldivers 2 developers have made good progress on reducing the PC installation size while adding new content. Thanks to their partnership with Nixxes, the team has reached its goal sooner than expected, with all data being de-duplicated. The file size reduction will also help improve load times, “seconds at most”. </p>



<p>The new file size for Helldivers 2 on PC has been reduced to 23GB, which cuts 131GB (85%) from the previous 154GB installation size. The new ‘Slim version’ of the game has gone through several rounds of internal QA and has been rolled out for early adopters as a public technical beta. After the public beta returns with no issues, the slim version will become the default for Helldivers 2. </p>



<p>At the same time, the legacy version will be available as opt-in once the slim version becomes the default to help players “self-troubleshoot any issues that were not picked up during our internal testing or the public technical beta.”</p>
