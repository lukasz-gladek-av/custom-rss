<p>According to a new interview with Insomniac, Marvel’s Wolverine may or may not be released in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a conversation with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ceo-ted-price-exits-ryan-schneider-chad-dezern-jen-huang-playstation-1236281913/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-have-to-be-like-logan-today-and-remain-very-stoic-insomniac-quiet-on-whether-wolverine-will-make-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-games-founder-and-president-ted-price-is-retiring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new co-heads</a> of Insomniac, Ryan Schneider, Chad Dezern and Jen Huang, were asked whether Marvel’s Wolverine is still slated to release in 2025. Dezern didn’t confirm or deny the release window but stated they would “love to talk more about Wolverine”, as the title has already been announced. Still, they must “be like Logan today and remain very stoic until it’s time to pop the claws down the road”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dezern added that they will have to hold on to their “pent-up excitement” for Marvel’s Wolverine, and that’s all they could speak about their upcoming projects during the conversation. Marvel’s Wolverine was announced during a PlayStation Showcase in 2021, where a small snippet showcased the character’s iconic claws. Since then, we have yet to hear any official announcements for the game; however, much has been revealed through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/major-wolverine-leaks-appear-online-spoilers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, the Insomniac heads also expressed interest in “game-to-screen adaptations.” Ryan Schneider spoke about the Ratchet &amp; Clank film and how they “got an early start on that.” Schneider added that they are “interested in that kind of thing,” and the team loves Ratchet &amp; Clank in particular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel’s Wolverine’s creative director has joined <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-creative-director-leaves-to-join-xboxs-perfect-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s Perfect Dark team</a>. Also, Insomniac confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-additional-story-dlc-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no additional story content is coming</a> for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Do you think Marvel’s Wolverine will release in 2025?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>PockerPair Publishing and Tales of Kenzera: Zau developers Surgent Studios have announced that they’ll be joining forces, with PocketPair supporting the development of a new horror game at Surgent.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), the publisher said, “We’re pleased to announce that our first project as Pocketpair Publishing will be supporting a brand new horror game from Surgent Studios. SURGENT STUDIOS is a studio with an original approach, and Pocketpair is excited to support them to the fullest extent. Please look forward to future announcements for details of specific projects!“</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Abubakar Salim, the Founder of Surgent Studios, about the deal.

<p>The game hit a peak concurrent player count of 2,101,867, making it one of Steam’s highest-ever concurrent player counts. As of February 22, 2024, the company announced that the game sold 15 million copies on Steam and had reached 10 million players on Xbox.</p>

<p>The developer of the GTA 6 parody game Grand Taking Ages is launching on Steam after a revamp. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A little over a month ago, a title called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-iv-grand-taking-ages-ps-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Taking Ages VI </a>popped up on the PlayStation Store, and it felt eerily similar to Rockstar’s highly anticipated 2025 release, GTA 6, with both games even having the same acronym (GTA VI). After a closer look, it was revealed that Grand Taking Ages VI was a game development simulator where the player manages a studio while tackling obstacles that developers encounter while creating the game. The title was recently pulled from the PlayStation Store due to its controversial appearance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulled-gta-6-parody-game-grand-taking-ages-from-the-playstation-store-but-its-now-cleared-for-release-on-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> reveals that Grand Taking Ages, the GTA 6 parody game, is now launching on Steam while remaining pulled from the PlayStation Store. The developer, Violarte, stated that their approach towards Steam differed, as they “engaged with the team” early on with the game’s concept before the official submission. For its approval, the game underwent a “thorough” review process to be listed on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After arriving on Steam, you can spot key differences in the GTA 6 parody game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3464800/Grand_Taking_Ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing</a>. Grand Taking Ages has dropped the number ‘VI’ from the title. Additionally, they have new screenshots, a fresh trailer, and a revamped description. These changes were made to “clearly differentiate Grand Taking Ages from the original inspiration, GTA 6, and to emphasize its unique direction.”</p>



<p>Grand Taking Ages developer also addressed the PlayStation Store listing, stating they “strongly believe” that the new changes should be enough for the game to return to the platform. The game is slated to release in July 2025; check out its new description:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming Soon Since Forever! Start your game dev journey in Mom’s garage! Battle angry fans, dodge ruthless journalists, and perfect the art of “creative” deadlines. Survive on pizza and energy drinks while building your dream studio into… a slightly better garage!</p>

<p>The Shopify Rebellion Game Changers roster, the reigning two-time champions, have made history. The women became the first GC team to qualify for a VALORANT Challengers event, after years of attempts.</p>



<p>The roster core that has dominated the women’s VALORANT scene has finally overcome their greatest obstacle on the path to their ultimate goal: the international VCT leagues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shopify-rebellion-makes-history">Shopify Rebellion Makes History</h2>



<p>While the Shopify Rebellion Game Changers team has dominated the GC circuit, they had always fallen short of advancing past qualifiers into Challengers. For VALORANT teams, the Challengers leagues are the path to the Ascension event, a regional tournament that determines who is promoted to the international VCT leagues.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-game-changers-vct-win/">winning their second Game Changers Championship in December</a>, Shopify were dealt a huge blow when their star Ava “florescent” Eugene signed with VCT EMEA team Apeks. In doing so, flor became the first Game Changers player to compete in VCT, but it left a big hole in the roster for Shopify to fill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just prior to the North American Challengers closed qualifier, Shopify found their replacement in Karnthida “dodonut” Chaisrakeo. In the closed qualifier, Shopify overcame dodonut’s former team, FlyQuest RED, before beating Funhaver to secure the third and final qualifier spot in NA Challengers.</p>







<p>For the Shopify Rebellion organization, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-merges-with-ludwig-and-cr1tikals-esports-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh off their merger with content creator stars Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig’s Moist Esports</a>, they will field two roster in NA Challengers, as their men’s roster returns after competing in the league last year. Organizations are permitted by Riot to field two teams in the same ecosystem, provided one of them is eligible to compete in Game Changers. The Shopify GC roster is the two-time champion of Game Changers, so they should be permitted to compete when the NA Challengers League stage one begins later this month.</p>
