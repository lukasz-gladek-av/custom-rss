<p>Sony San Diego has announced the first set of details for the next installment of its long-running baseball franchise, MLB The Show 25. </p>



<p>In a post on the game’s website, Sony San Diego gave minor teases of what fans can expect across the game while also announcing a major change coming to Diamond Dynasty in MLB The Show 25.</p>



<p>Starting with Diamond Dynasty, the game’s popular card-collecting mode, it has been announced that Sets and Seasons will no longer be part of the mode starting next year. The removal of Sets and Seasons means that every card will be able to be “used freely throughout the year”.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the game, both Franchise Mode and Road to the Show will be getting updates in MLB The Show 25. Though not a lot was shared, the <a href="https://theshow.com/news/looking-towards-the-future-of-mlb-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">team did give a short tease</a> of what fans should expect. </p>



<h2 id="h-mlb-the-show-25-first-details">MLB The Show 25 First Details</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Road To The Show</strong>: Deepen the player’s journey, before being drafted, and return control to how a player develops and grows in new and interesting ways. &nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Diamond Dynasty*:</strong>&nbsp;Alongside the retirement of Sets and Seasons, our fans can look forward to all-new elements of the Diamond Dynasty experience blended with what our fans love most about Diamond Dynasty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Franchise:</strong>&nbsp;Improved trade evaluation metrics are coming along with a new fun and engaging offseason experience.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>&nbsp;With the expansion of quick time events, defensive AI, and pathing updates, enjoy more engaging moment-to-moment gameplay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>MLB The Show 25 is scheduled to launch in spring 2025 and official platforms will be announced at a later date.</p>

<p>If you’ve pre-ordered STALKER 2 or bought a higher edition, you’ll have learned that you’re able to unlock a series of unique weapons and outfits as you explore the game. However, it’s not immediately available where to find pre-order items in STALKER 2, which can leave you feeling confused.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll help you figure out where to get your pre-order bonus in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>Read on!</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-pre-order-items-in-stalker-2">How To Get Pre-Order Items in STALKER 2</h2>



<p>If you’re trying to figure out where to find your pre-order items in STALKER 2, you’ll need to follow a particular quest that’ll take you all over The Zone.</p>



<p>It’s called Seek, And You Shall Find, and it’s started after you complete ‘A Needle in a Haystack’ in Zalissya, the first major settlement you find in the Lesser Zone. The quest you need will be started once you’ve picked up a flash drive left in your stash by a mysterious individual.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can track down the white, single-storey building and find the PDA jammed between two beds to kickstart the quest.</p>



<p>Once you’ve activated Seek, And You Shall Find, you’ll notice that a string of stash locations have been added to the map on your PDA. If you head to each location, you’ll be rewarded with an exclusive weapon or outfit – these are the pre-order items in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>They’re also what you’ll receive for buying the Ultimate or Deluxe editions of the game.</p>



<p>There’s at least one Journalist Stash in each area of the map, and almost all of them require a little snooping to find. Perhaps you’ll need to find your way around a locked door or up onto a building, but they’re all relatively accessible and with a little common sense, you’ll have them tracked down in no time.</p>



<p>It’s not immediately obvious, but that’s where to get your pre-order bonus in STALKER 2. It takes a little work and a lot of walking, but as you’ll naturally explore The Zone on your travels, you can work passively to tick them off as and when you get near them.</p>



<p>That’s where to find pre-order items in STALKER 2 – happy hunting! Stop by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you want to chat about the game.</p>
