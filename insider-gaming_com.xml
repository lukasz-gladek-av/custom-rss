<p>In a post on social media, OpTic expressed kind sentiments at everything Kenny has done for OpTic Texas since joining the starting roster, before parting ways with the veteran Call of Duty pro player. In recent weeks, OpTic Texas has struggled immeasurably, securing one of the worst records in COD esports history by hitting a 0-18 map streak before landing a win against LAG M8.</p>



<p>Amidst the losses, Kenny showed up as one of the worst players in the squad. He dropped a 0.3 KD series record against Toronto Ultra a few days back, prompting (more) fans to demand his cancellation from the roster.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been revealed who will be taking Kenny’s spot as Major II approaches.</p>

<h2 id="h-desperate-times">Desperate Times</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas went from a world championship win to the bottom of the table in the last few weeks. The team hit a cursed streak and failed to win a single map out of eighteen straight rounds, prompting major concerns from fans worldwide. Kenny was often found footing the blame, with many critical CDL viewers stressing that he was the catalyst for many of the team’s issues.</p>



<p>Here’s the post from OpTic that surfaced on social media today:</p>



<div><article><p><span>A true World Champion, in and out of the game. We’re grateful for the leadership and legacy you’ve built with OpTic

Thank you, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Kuavo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Kuavo</a><span> 🦖 </span></p></article></div>







<p>As for who <strong>could </strong>replace Kenny on OpTic Texas, one of the leading suggestions is Cesar ‘Skyz’ Bueno, of LAG M8 fame. It was a few days back that Skyz was benched, being locked out of the starting roster on LAG M8 with an impending drop sitting on the horizon. In the most recent regular match the team played, Skyz was out of the picture, and Lunarz and Priestahhh stood up instead.</p>



<p>During the 2023 season, Skyz was part of the Subliners roster that tore up the CDL, landing Major chips and a world championship title. The grand final of COD Champs was a sweep by the Subliners, with the team securing a 5-0 win over Toronto Ultra in record time.</p>



<p>Who would you like to see replace Kenny on OpTic Texas? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>PlayStation has a new first-party studio under PlayStation Studios called Dark Outlaw Games. The studio is being led by former Call of Duty Zombies lead Jason Blundell.</p>



<p>The name of the studio was confirmed by Blundell in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4&amp;t=4729s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Jeff Gerstmann</a> that was published on Monday.</p>



<p>“The studio is called Dark Outlaw,” Blundell said. “We’ve been working away in the shadows for a while, when we’ve got something to talk about we’ll step out into the light.”</p>



<p>As far as the secrecy behind the studio’s creation, Blundell says the story is about the game and not the studio. He added that doing it under the Sony umbrella is a “privilege”.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-meet-the-creator-behind-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-creator-of-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meet The Creator Behind Call of Duty Skill-Based Matchmaking—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>“It’s such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio, Sony doesn’t start up first-party studios all the time, so to have that privilege is humbling,” Blundell said while adding that the studio is making new hirings for the development of its first game.</p>



<p>Those new hires could be for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-yet-to-announce-live-service-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unannounced live service multiplayer game</a> that began making the rounds. According to the recent job postings, this new game is still early in its development—that’s even if it’s the same game at all.</p>



<p>Most details surrounding the studio, aside from its name and who’s leading it, remain…dark.</p>



<p>What do you think of Blundell leading a new first-party PlayStation studio, and what do you make of the name Dark Outlaw Games?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zywoo-passes-s1mple-in-major-counter-strike-milestone/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Counter-Strike GOAT debate may never end, but French prodigy Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut has reasserted his case, passing a record held by the one and only Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev. However, it could very well be CS2’s fastest rising star that eventually claims the record for himself.</p>



<h2 id="h-zywoo-sets-counter-strike-record-for-most-tournament-mvp-trophies">ZywOo Sets Counter-Strike Record for Most Tournament MVP Trophies</h2>



<p>At ESL Pro League Season 21, Vitality added their second trophy of the year to their case, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vitality-stuns-spirit-3-0-in-grand-finals-of-iem-katowice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming IEM Katowice</a> just a month prior. ZywOo was named MVP of both tournaments by HLTV, bringing his MVP career total to 22, passing s1mple’s record of 2021. </p>



<p>To put in perspective how dominant s1mple was in his prime, his most recent MVP award was from IEM Cologne 2022. He hasn’t won an MVP award in more than two years, while ZywOo has won a staggering nine since the start of 2023, and only now has the French superstar finally passed s1mple. S1mple still owns the record for most MVP awards won in a single year, after winning eight in 2021, the same year where he finally won the Major. Both s1mple and ZywOo are also tied with just a single Major win, but ZywOo is in the better position to win a second considering how dominant Vitality is looking to start 2025.</p>



<p>“I’m one ahead of s1mple,” ZywOo <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/41218/zywoo-i-wont-stop-just-because-i-am-one-in-front-of-s1mple" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told HLTV</a> after winning ESL Pro League Season 21. “I will just keep going, keep grinding, and I will never stop just because I am one in front. I will just show I can go 25, 30 MVPs.”</p>



<p>Right now s1mple’s career is at a crossroads. The 27-year-old is still officially on the NAVI bench, and hasn’t played in a professional match since November during his loan to Falcons. Either ZywOo will set a standard so high that no one will catch it, or a new contender for GOAT status will emerge. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2s-biggest-superstar-donk-dazzles-in-first-match-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The player many are watching out for is Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</a>, the rising star of Team Spirit, after a 2024 rookie campaign that saw him win a record-breaking Major and five MVP awards. Still, even if he maintains the pace he set last year, it will take him years to catch up to ZywOo’s record, and that’s assuming the French star stops winning. And given that he’s still only 24, I wouldn’t bet on it.</p>



<p>Will any player ever catch ZywOo’s MVP numbers? Is he the GOAT of Counter-Strike? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
