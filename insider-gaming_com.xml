<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>explains how updates to Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Splatoon 3 help maintain player loyalty during the Switch-to-Switch 2 transition.</p>



<p>In January 2026, Nintendo launched a significant update for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" id="3155">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. This update not only introduced additional in-game content but also quality-of-life improvements for those who pick up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2</a> edition of the game. Splatoon 3 also received a major update, extending its lifecycle. Splatoon also received specific updates to support the next Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Now, Nintendo is admitting that it is trying to balance releasing new titles for its latest console with easing players into the transition from the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-president-discusses-transition-philosophy">Nintendo President Discusses Transition Philosophy</h2>



<p>During its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investor presentation</a>, Shuntaro Furukawa, president of Nintendo Co., Ltd., explained that major updates to existing titles are a key part of Nintendo’s philosophy because they help maintain connections with existing customers.</p>



<p>The belief is that it allows players to feel they are still getting value from their original Nintendo Switch while creating a pathway to adopt the next-generation console.</p>



<p>“As we move forward with the multi-year transition from Switch to Switch 2, we believe it is also very important to maintain contact with our customers who are currently using Nintendo consoles.</p>



<p>“In that sense, we thot it would be a good idea to update titles that have been big sellers on the Switch, such as ‘Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ and ‘Splatoon 3,’ at this time,” he said (via Google Translate).</p>







<p>Nintendo is continuing to march into its next generation. However, they are not fully finished with the original Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, scheduled for February 5, will feature games coming to both consoles. Insider Gaming will have coverage of the presentation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For those concerned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" id="155026">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> failed to sell 1 million copies, there is some good news.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>released its financial results for the end of 2025, many noted that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was not among the games reported to have sold over a million copies. The game was released in December for both the original Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, leading to some being concerned that a major Nintendo release failed to meet these benchmarks. </p>



<p>However, Nintendo has confirmed that the game has surpassed 1 million sales across both the original and successor Nintendo Switch consoles.</p>







<p>Stephen Totilo on Bluesky said a Nintendo representative told him the combined sales surpassed the metric.</p>







<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-was-the-final-game-for-nintendo-dev">Metroid Prime 4 Was the Final Game for Nintendo Dev</h2>



<p>In the wake of the release of Metroid Prime 4, Kensuke Tanabe, a legendary producer at Nintendo known for his work on the franchise,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-will-be-kensuke-tanabes-final-nintendo-project/" id="171810"> confirmed</a> that this would be the final game that he would work on at Nintendo.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4 was announced in 2017 and took nearly a decade to release, after the project switched development Studios from Bandai Namco to Retro Studios. Ultimately, the game received favorable reviews, but many admitted it failed to live up to the legacy of earlier games in the franchise.</p>







<p>Nintendo continues to march into the future with a Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase on February 5, announcing more games coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 and some that will release on the original Nintendo Switch. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the presentation on February 5.</p>

<p>The game sold tens of millions of copies early in its lifecycle and was named best action game at the 2024 Game Awards.</p>

<p>Details remain scarce, but the development team announced that Overwatch is heading to the Nintendo Switch 2 in Spring 2026. The announcement was made during the Overwatch Spotlight on Thursday, February 4, 2026. The game was released on the original Nintendo Switch. As such, it is playable on the successor console. However, a dedicated Switch 2 release would mean some likely upgrades and optimization for the new hardware.</p>



<p>As of yet, there is no specific release date attached to the release of Overwatch: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p>

<p>The big announcement from the showcase was the reveal of a year-long story arc known as “The Reign of Talon.” Reign of Talon will be a 6-season storyline, introducing five new heroes, new in-game events, and more. A new arc will then commence in early 2027.</p>



<p>Also, it was announced that Overwatch, which had renamed itself “Overwatch 2” in 2022, will revert to its original name.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98">Marathon </a>will have a ranked mode, a new report suggests.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99">Bungie </a>has not officially confirmed many details about the upcoming extraction shooter, Marathon. However, new details have been shared with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marathon-ranked-mode-surface-scoring-holotags" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a> courtesy of leaker <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/2019105753978794502?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X0X_Leak.</a></p>



<p>The ranked mode in the upcoming game will have 6 tiers, with discussion of a 7th “Master” tier. The 6 tiers mentioned in the report are Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Pinnacle. Each tier has three individual sub-rankings as players level up. Ranked rewards will include cosmetics and other items, some of which players will be able to equip directly, and others will be gifted to them after a season is over.</p>







<h2 id="h-scoring-details-for-marathon-ranked-mode">Scoring Details for Marathon Ranked Mode</h2>



<p>The report goes on to mention scoring details, noting that players must have a Holotag equipped to score in a match. There is no Holotag equipped; there will be no contribution to the score. If players successfully exfil from a ranked match before reaching the target score, no rank progress is gained or lost. Failing to exfil results in a point loss equal to the full Score target.</p>



<p>Holotags have rarities equivalent to the ranks mentioned above. Each tag has unique effects that boost score targets when looted from other Runners during a match, also enabling potential scores higher than the initial target.</p>



<p>For example, a Silver Holotag grants players 5,000 credits to their score target on Infil, and any additional looted silver tags expand players’ credit capacities by 1,000.</p>

<p>Daniel Vávra, the writer and director of Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, has posted a predictive and somewhat damning statement about artificial intelligence on social media. He was responding to a video showcasing the insane advancements of photorealistic, gen-AI video creation tools, which are fast becoming <strong>terrifying</strong>.</p>



<p>Vávra, a games industry veteran of more than 20 years, stressed that movies and gaming ‘will never be the same’, and suggested we need to make the most of it because of the benefits it offers.</p>







<h2 id="h-everybody-hates-ai-well-actually-not-everybody">‘Everybody Hates AI (Well Actually, Not Everybody)’</h2>



<p>In a recent statement that some might dub inflammatory, Daniel Vávra, the creative director of 2025’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-year-ago-medieval-masterpiece-kingdom-come-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, bigged up generative AI. <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2019133539053084862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everybody hates AI (well actually not everybody). But I told you its unavoidable future. </p>



<p>Hate me as you wish. Its the truth. This is fan made trailer. Made in two days. By one person. Movie (and gaming) industry will never be the same. You can see it as an game over or as an opportunity for everyone to make great stuff without the big money from corporations. </p>



<p>But it doesnt matter what you think. Its here and its not going anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Vávra suggests that pushing back against AI is a fruitless effort, as it’s inevitable that the technology will continue to evolve. Instead, Vávra indicates that a symbiosis of sorts is the best way forward, using the progressive technology as a way to make things better and faster without gargantuan investments from ‘corporations’.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that more developers are falling into the use of AI these days. It allows them to iterate faster, test more effectively, and create games, especially larger ones, at a much more efficient pace. The sketchy area comes when generative AI is used to replace artists, musicians, and actors, and it has caused an intense amount of flak across the industry in recent years.</p>



<p>In a throwback interview with Insider Gaming, Doug Cockle (Geralt of Rivia, <em>The Witcher</em>) named <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doug-cockle-ai-voice-replication/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI voice replication ‘theft’</a>. It was a sentiment that has been echoed countless times since.</p>



<p>Vávra gave his thoughts back to those opposing his energy towards AI, offering up an analogy of sorts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My “art” is just a materialization of my thoughts, the result of my brain guiding my hands. Its similar as if you were saying that driving cars is unnatural cheating to reach something faster and only peple who really arrive in destination are those who walk…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s rough, but it makes quite a lot of sense, and it’s one of the biggest debates around the use of AI. Are you inherently evil or immoral for using AI to make your life easier, and is it better to struggle, take longer to do things, and spend more money just to declare you’re <strong>not using AI</strong> for something?</p>

<p>If you’ve just finished season two of the Fallout television show, you might have a few questions spinning around your head. Most critically, you might be wondering what Liberty Prime Alpha is and why it’s so important to those in the Fallout universe. This behemoth character was ‘introduced’ in the mid-credits sequence of the Fallout TV show’s second season finale, and it has some fans confused.</p>



<p>In case you’re unaware, Liberty Prime is the name of an enormous robot character in the Fallout universe, made most iconic in 2008’s Fallout 3 when it stormed into battle against the Enclave. It was seen again in 2015’s Fallout 4, but has lived in the shadows ever since.</p>



<p>But what’s <strong>Liberty Prime Alpha?</strong></p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-s-liberty-prime-alpha-is-coming">Fallout’s Liberty Prime Alpha is Coming</h2>



<p>In the closing seconds of the season two finale of Fallout, we saw blueprints for Liberty Prime Alpha, a towering robot that the Brotherhood of Steel, now led by ‘Quintus the Destroyer’, intends to build.</p>



<p>Those familiar with Fallout will instantly recognize Liberty Prime, but Liberty Prime <strong>Alpha </strong>is an entirely new construct, seen for the first time as the second season wrapped.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Liberty Prime Alpha could be the bgiger brother of this</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s assumed that Quintus, who was betrayed by Knight Maximus in the second season of the show, will attempt to build Liberty Prime Alpha, but his intended target is unclear. Liberty Prime is an utter wrecking machine, so Liberty Prime Alpha should be borderline apocalyptic, no pun intended.</p>



<p>It’s unclear where the blueprints for Liberty Prime Alpha came from, as Maximus’ friend Dane approached Quintus with them as the mid-credits sequence played out. At that point, Area 51, the home of the Knights of San Fernando, was the site of an exploding civil war between various chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel, one of Fallout’s oldest and most recognizable factions.</p>



<p>The most likely explanation is that the blueprints were somewhere <strong>in </strong>Area 51, and that was one of the driving reasons for Quintus to relocate his chapter there and try to align with the other faction bodies.</p>







<p>Whatever happens in season three of Fallout, we might see the creation of one of the biggest robots the franchise has ever seen. Are you excited? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
