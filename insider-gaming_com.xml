<p>The upcoming open-world action RPG Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is releasing on PC after all. </p>



<p>After first being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-mobile-game-is-launching-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed for iOS and Android</a> at The Game Awards 2024, developer Netmarble has confirmed the game will launch on Windows. The confirmation came via an announcement for <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">closed beta signups</a> that added PC to the available platforms. </p>



<p>Alongside the beta announcement came a list of minimum PC specs that players need. those include an Intel Core i7-9700 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU, 8GB of memory, 30GB of storage space, Windows 10/11, and at least an Nvidia GeForce RTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT graphics card.</p>



<p>Regarding the Game of Thrones: Kingsroad closed beta, it will take place from January 16-22 and be on both PC and mobile. It will feature the first look at the land of Westeros, three classes to try,  and a look at the original story developed specifically for the game. Those who take part in the beta will receive exclusive rewards after the game’s full launch later this year.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned, the game features a new original story that starts with the dead of King Robert Baratheon.</p>



<p>“As the Lannisters desperately cling to the Iron Throne, the war between those who would claim it for themselves hurtles towards its final act,” the <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">story reads</a>. “The king’s brother, Stannis Baratheon, gathers his forces for a final assault, while the vast, frozen lands of the North smolder after the betrayal at the Red Wedding.”</p>



<p>According to Netmarble, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad also features a “realistic manual combat system” that requires you to defeat enemies using “strategic combos”.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is almost here. Scheduled for release in less than two months, the game’s promotional campaign is in full swing.</p>



<p>Aware of the huge hype for the game, IGN brought the title to its <a href="https://youtu.be/yp-28fhhOs4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN First</a> panel. The show is dedicated to revealing new information about highly anticipated games. In the videos released today, they provided details of two monsters: Ajakaran and Rompopolo.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 9 Minutes of Ajarakan Oilwell Basin Gameplay (4K)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aX0wxnX6WDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to the videos, the two monsters reside in the Oilwell Basin area. A volcanic ecosystem full of caves, tar pits, oil lakes and large thermal vents that spew out smoke and other gases. The region is home to the Azuz Tribe. They use the region’s characteristics to produce energy and weapons. The region’s Apex monster is called the Black Flame, however, no further details about the monster have been revealed yet.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As we can see in the videos above, the Ajarakan resembles a Flaming Gorilla with a carapace and the Rompopolo resembles a mosquito fused with a mantis. Both monsters are new to Wilds. According to the game’s Wiki, they are very territorial and often fight each other.</p>



<p>The Rompopolo usually buries its tail in mud and oil to cause gas explosions, while the Ajarakan is strong and agile, using its aggression to unleash flaming attacks.</p>



<p>Scheduled for release on February 28th, the next game in the franchise is one of the most anticipated games of 2025. It will come as no surprise if it ends up being nominated for the best game of the year. Judging by all the materials released so far, the game looks spectacular. Of course, we’ll have to see it in action next month!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/one-of-the-most-blatant-pokemon-rip-offs-can-now-be-wishlisted-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>One of the most blatant Pokémon rip-offs is now available to be wishlisted on Steam. Insider Gaming was recently contacted by the developers behind “Fay Keeper,” a brand-new creature-catching game where players collect and battle hundreds of creatures called “Fays.” The request was for a paid partnership – and in the current game industry climate it’s an opportunity that comes few and far between.</p>



<p>Yet, having looked at the game initially, we couldn’t help but feel inclined that the game is a blatant rip-off of Pokémon.</p>



<p>From the color pallet to the creatures themselves, the comparisons are strikingly similar, and although it’s clear that the developers want to capitalize on an itching Pokémon audience on the PC, I can’t help but feel the team is likely going to run into legal issues. You even get your very own “Faydex.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming compiled a couple comparisons between Fay Keeper and Pokémon below (click to enlarge) so you can muster your own opinions.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, the developers of the game have addressed them slightly on social media when asked by fans about the comparisons to Pokémon. BGS Studios doesn’t hide the fact that it takes inspiration from the classic franchise, but maintains that there will be enough differences between the titles to avoid any potential legal claims.</p>



<p>“Pokémon was a huge ref and the idea was for it to feel nostalgic, but me and the team are working on a lot of unique features that Pokémon games never had,” <a href="https://x.com/FayKeeper/status/1861816033549443480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one post reads</a>.</p>



<p>In another response to a question regarding copyright, <a href="https://x.com/FayKeeper/status/1861906032097718607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BGS Studios said</a>, “Although we took inspiration from a very nostalgic reference, every single pixel and line of code is being made from scratch by us. We’ll also have mechanics that were never in the original ref, so it will hit close while also being a different thing.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming did reach out to BGS Studios for further comment on the similarities, and to talk about any potential worries or concerns. Those attempts, however, have gone unanswered as of publishing.</p>



<p>What do you think of the similarities between Fay Keeper and Pokémon? Do you think this could lead to problems down the road?
