<p>Micron is completely shutting down its consumer brand Crucial, and is ending the line of budget-friendly RAM and solid-state drives (SSDs). </p>



<p>Announced on Wednesday, Micron said that the growth of AI has led to this “difficult decision”.</p>



<p><strong>“The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage,” </strong>Micron EVP Sumit Sadana said in the media release.<strong> “Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments.”</strong></p>



<p>Sadana continued to thank the “passionate community of consumers” the Crucial brand has had over the last 29 years.</p>



<p><strong>“This decision reflects Micron’s commitment to its ongoing portfolio transformation and the resulting alignment of its business to secular, profitable growth vectors in memory and storage,”</strong> the company added. <strong>“By concentrating on core enterprise and commercial segments, Micron aims to improve long-term business performance and create value for strategic customers as well as stakeholders.”</strong></p>



<p>Micron says Crucial shipments will continue until the end of February 2026, and they will work with partners and customers to provide warranty service. </p>



<p>The decision to end the entry-level Crucial brand comes at a time when AI and data center growth continue to harm the consumer sector. Because of larger companies buying up all the supply, consumer RAM <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-prices-have-soared-by-up-to-250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices have even risen by 250%</a> and beyond across different brands. </p>
