<p>The day that Slay the Spire 2 will enter Early Access has been confirmed. Thankfully, for fans of the beloved roguelike deckbuilder, they won’t have to wait long.</p>



<p>Slay the Spire 2 enters Steam Early Access on Thursday, March 5, 2026, 12 days from this writing. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mega-crit/" id="3619">Mega Crit</a> announced the news in a YouTube trailer.</p>



<p>This is the long-awaited follow-up to the game that helped solidify the roguelike deckbuilder genre. Shore, some may feel like they’re a dime a dozen these days, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528">Slay the Spire 2</a> gets the opportunity to finally build on what the original game brought to the table in 2019.</p>

<p>The sequel to 2019’s Slay the Spire was originally scheduled for an Early Access release in late 2025. However, in September, Mega Crit announced it would delay the game to uphold its own quality standards. </p>



<p>Such improvements will include a new 4-player co-op mode, complete with specific multiplayer cards and new team synergies. Learn more about the new developments and updates here.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming will provide more information on the upcoming Slay the Spire sequel as Early Access approaches.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Vehicles Will Be Improved in Dedicated Labs Tests]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vehicles-improved-testing-labs/</link>
            <guid>1442569</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dice/" id="2384">DICE</a> is acutely aware of the issues that poorly-balanced and unoptimized vehicles are causing in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a>. It’s something that must be added to the ever-growing list of player woes, given the state of the shooter at present.</p>



<p>Even the arrival of the season two update did little to revitalize the ‘game-changing’ Battlefield 6, which was released last October with a goal to bring about a major resurgence for the franchise. Now, DICE is preparing to tackle the issues in the game piecemeal and has identified vehicle feedback as being a cause for concern.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-weakest-vehicles-are-being-upgraded-hopefully">Battlefield 6’s Weakest Vehicles Are Being Upgraded (Hopefully)</h2>



<p>In a recent interview, DICE advised that it’s starting to look at player feedback around vehicles. This is one of the most tentative, divisive topics in the Battlefield 6 space, which continues to be contentious, even amongst the most die-hard fans of the franchise. It’s not in a good spot, and the game that the company thought would hit 100 million players has… Not done that.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/dice-agrees-that-some-battlefield-6-vehicles-are-death-traps-and-is-planning-a-labs-test-dedicated-to-vehicle-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, DICE’s Kit Eklöf said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to take the light vehicle feedback with me to the team from you today.</p>



<p>But I also want to promote that there’s a Battlefield Labs test coming up where we’re going to test some vehicle improvements around this issue, specifically because we’ve heard the feedback that vehicles are death traps. We are going to try a package of vehicle improvements on Labs very soon, so keep an eye out for that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a small thing, but a warranted one nonetheless. In Battlefield, many matches live and die by the vehicles players have at their disposal, and having an entire class that splinters into pieces at the first sight of incoming fire is <strong>not </strong>ideal.</p>



<p>Foot soldiers feel all too overpowered in Battlefield 6, effortlessly taking down hulking MBTs without much of a concern. That leaves a game that’s rooted in destruction feeling less destructive than you might like. The sight of a tank lurching towards you used to instill you with a sense of dread, but now it’s just a sign to switch classes and whomp it with a rocket or two, no drama.</p>

<p>The weekend is here, and hopefully you’re ready to get started by cracking into today’s NYT Connections challenge and acing it without a single missed step. Fortunately, I’m here with the NYT Connections hints and answers you need to accomplish that task in a matter of minutes!</p>



<p>Read on to secure the NYT Connections solutions and explanations you need today.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

<p>New Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma gives her stance on AI. She also firmly believes that human beings are the ones responsible for great stories in gaming.</p>



<p>On February 20, 2026, Xbox underwent a great restructuring that led to Phil Spencer’s retirement. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sarah-bond-shares-memo-to-her-team-following-departure-at-xbox/" id="178381">Sarah Bond, former Xbox president</a>, also stepped down. In their place, Asha Sharma has been named new EVP and CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p>







<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-s-vision-for-xbox-and-the-future-of-microsoft-gaming">Asha Sharma’s Vision for Xbox and the Future of Microsoft Gaming</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a>, Sharma, who was previously the head of CoreAI at Microsoft, commented on her stance on AI in gaming. She admits the industry is in a tumultuous place but remains optimistic and open-minded about the future.</p>



<p>Speaking of the future, while she does have a background in AI, she also has no tolerance for “bad AI.” Furthermore, she also believes in protecting what she believes in. As that pertains to AI, she is cognisant that AI is part of gaming’s future, as it has played a role in its past. Still, she believes humans tell good stories.</p>



<p>“AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be,” Sharma said, noting that gaming needs new “growth engines,” but that “great stories are created by humans.”</p>
