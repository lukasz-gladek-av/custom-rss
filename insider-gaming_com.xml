<p>A new report from Bloomberg has said that Warner Bros. gaming division is struggling to find new success and has rebooted its Wonder Woman game.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues?leadSource=reddit_wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Warner Bros. gaming has had a rough year with a 300 million thanks to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, and MultiVersus.</p>



<p>The studio has also apparently rebooted Wonder Woman, which has reportedly cost over $100 million in development costs already.</p>



<p>“One of the company’s biggest bets in development, a video game based on Wonder Woman, has struggled to coalesce, according to people familiar with the project. Early last year, it was rebooted and switched directors. The game has already cost more than $100 million, said the people who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information, and is still years away from release, if it ever makes it to market,” the report says.</p>



<p>“According to interviews with two dozen current and former Warner Bros. employees, a lack of a strong, cohesive vision during Haddad’s reign — a tumultuous period in which Warner Bros. struggled through multiple reorganizations — led to years of ineffectual trend-chasing and wasted development time. Along the way, once-revered studios under the Warner Bros. umbrella have taken reputational hits, lost key staff members and burned through hundreds of millions of dollars,” it continued.</p>



<p>According to the report, Rocksteady is now eying up a new single-player Batman game, but is still years away from coming to fruition.</p>



<p>The rumor of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-working-on-new-batman-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady moving to Batman</a> surfaced last year by leaker and rumormonger&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1838116987236655458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shpeshal Nick</a>.</p>



<p>“Not sure which studio people’s dreams is, but I heard Rocksteady are back making it,” he&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/shpeshal_nick/status/1838116987236655458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a response</a>&nbsp;to a Tweet asking for fans’ dream developers on the next Batman game. “I also think Sony are trying to moneyhat it lol.”</p>

<p>A bed may seem trivial in the grand scheme of things in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, but sleep helps Henry in numerous ways. One of the first things you must do in KC2 is find a bed, so let’s show you how.</p>



<p>I didn’t play the first Kingdom Come game, so I felt at a disadvantage when I set foot in the Kingdom of Bohemia for the first time. The combat is tough, and you must embrace realism as hydration, hunger, and sleep deprivation will hit you. The latter is the focus of this guide though as Henry needs to sleep in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>—which means he needs a bed.</p>



<p>You can feasible spend a few hours in KC2 without finding a bed of your own. Owning a bed won’t be an issue if you follow this walkthrough.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-a-bed-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How to Get a Bed in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</h2>

<p><strong>The quickest and fastest way to get a bed to sleep in during Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is to find Radovan or Kreyzl early on in Troskowitz—they’re enjoying a beer next to the town’s Tavern—and seek them out and complete their Quest.</strong></p>



<p>I did this and went to see <strong>Blacksmith Radovan in Tachov</strong>. I completed his Smithing tutorial, and after making the finest weapon you’ve ever seen, Radovan generously gifted me a bed, storage chest, and free goodies.</p>



<p>Check out these simple instructions to get you started in <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>:</p>



<ol>
<li>Start a game of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</li>



<li>Play through until you finish the final introductory Quest—<strong>Laboratores</strong>.</li>



<li>You now have access to the whole game, unencumbered or hindered.</li>



<li>Head to <strong>Tachov</strong>—Northwest of <strong>Troskowitz</strong>—and find the town’s Smithing setup.</li>



<li>Speak to <strong>Radovan </strong>and initiate his questline.</li>



<li>Complete the Smithing tutorial.</li>



<li>Once it’s all done, a room in the attached building <strong>is now yours</strong>.</li>



<li>You can tell which bed is yours as it gives you an <strong>option to save</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>This is now considered “My Bed,” and any time I need somewhere to put my head down for a few hours, I can come back here.</p>



<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Don’t make the same mistake I did (and have done repeatedly) of <strong>sleeping in someone else’s bed</strong>. </p>



<p>This is considered <strong>Trespassing</strong>; it’s a crime, and you face punishment for your actions. Again, as the screenshot shows above, it needs to say “<strong>Sleep and save</strong>,” for you to have a peaceful, uninterrupted, and felon-free snooze.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-sleeping-do-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">What Does Sleeping do in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Sleeping helps Henry to recover health and reduces fatigue, but it also increases hunger in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</strong></p>



<p>If your max HP recovery has been capped due to conflict, sleep <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-heal-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heals</a> you. If Henry is drowsy and it’s affecting him, you need sleep. Be warned that if you sleep too much, the benefits eventually stop, and all you do is end up making Henry hungry because he’s gone so many hours without eating.</p>



<p>This means your food is also likely to spoil faster, and you might end up with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-cure-food-poisoning-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">food poisoning</a> if you’re not careful.</p>
