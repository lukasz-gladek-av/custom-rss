<p>The world of the extraction shooter continues growing monthly as indie developers jump into the fray with their vision of the genre. Some choose to combine horror elements; others stick with tried-and-tested realism formulas. But one king reigns supreme, and that’s Escape From Tarkov. It’s the one extraction shooter every other title strives to topple. Thanks to a Black Friday deal, you can score Escape From Tarkov cheap!</p>



<h2 id="h-buy-escape-from-tarkov-for-25-off-for-black-friday">Buy Escape From Tarkov for 25% Off for Black Friday</h2>



<p>If you’re one of the many who don’t yet own Escape From Tarkov but have your sights set on the extraction shooter genre, this Black Friday deal should be on your radar. You can score the extraction shooter king cheap—<strong>25% off</strong>—for a limited time between <strong>November 28 and November 30</strong>.</p>



<p>This deal includes all of the game’s various editions. That said, Battlestate Games was quick to tell everyone the 50% discount for upgrading from the Edge of Darkness Edition to The Unheard Edition does not, unfortunately, stack with the Black Friday discount.</p>

<p>CD Project Red has confirmed that that The Witcher 4, currently known as Project Polaris, has officially entered full production.</p>



<p>The announcement came as part of the studio’s <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 2024 earnings report</a> on Tuesday. </p>



<p>“I’m pleased to announce that several weeks ago it moved on to full-scale production,” Piotr Nielubowicz, CD Projekt Red chief financial officer, said during the earnings call.</p>



<p>“Of all our projects, this one is currently the most far along, and we’re starting the most intensive phase of development. I wish to thank the team and I’m keeping my fingers crossed for further progress.”</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba added, “With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin.”</p>



<p>As of October 31, 2024, the studio has 400 people working exclusively on The Witcher 4. It’s slightly down from the 410 reported in July as the studio moved those employees to other projects within the company. Still, the number represents just over 61% of the company working on the next game of the franchise.</p>



<p>First announced in October 2022, a release date for The Witcher 4 has not yet been announced. Polaris is being called the beginning of a new Witcher saga that will span another new Trilogy for the series. For fans of the first trilogy, the new game will still see a continuation of&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-geralts-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geralt of Rivia’s story</a> in some form.</p>

<p>It appears as though future content for Mortal Kombat 1 is ending after Kombat Pack 2 wraps up. According to new claims, developer NetherRealm Studios has cancelled DLC plans for a Kombat Pack 3 and second story expansion for Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>Known Mortal Kombat 1 leaker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mortalkombatleaks/comments/1h0c1lo/comment/lz2xyr9/?share_id=xUcvJ-sw8qJXVkTAM75be&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FateUnknown posted</a> on Reddit that the cancellations happened recently after the Khaos Reigns expansion sold poorly.</p>



<p>It’s not all bad for Mortal Kombat 1 fans as there are still characters from Kombat Pack 2 to join the roster such as Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2. FateUnknown also said that its possible a “kameo or two” make it to the game due to work that had already been done on them but he “didn’t know yet”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetherRealm Studios for comment on the claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated.</p>



<p>Recently, Warner Bros. showed commitment to the Mortal Kombat series  when CEO David Zaslav said that future game development efforts was going to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focused on its core franchises</a> with Mortal Kombat being listed among them. Series head Ed Boon has already said, as well, that NetherRealm had been working on its next game even before Mortal Kombat 1 was released.</p>

<p>NetEase Games should be celebrating Marvel Rivals’ impending launch, instead, the Chinese company has been left reeling following the dramatic arrest of several key officials in the company due to a money laundering controversy.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals could be the shooter to break the online multiplayer dominance of other shooters: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a>, Fortnite, Overwatch, and Apex Legends (amongst others.) Other newcomers—such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadlock-was-the-top-game-on-steam-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadlock</a>—are doing their best to make an impact, but Marvel Rivals’ superhero star power has the potential to supersede all.</p>



<p>Money laundering, arrests, and an intense investigation and scrutiny were likely not on the Marvel Rivals bingo card though. If you’re confused, it’s understandable—so let’s explain all.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-money-laundering-controversy-explained">Marvel Rivals Money Laundering Controversy—Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An explosive situation. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Marvel Rivals money laundering Controversy potentially involves <strong>several high-ranking NetEase officials who have been arrested due to allegations of money laundering amounting to potentially $300 million</strong>.</p>



<p>I appreciate this is a lot to take in, so let’s start from the top. The original story was broken by Chinese outlet <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Leifeng</a>, and on Nov. 7, 2024, the <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/category/industrynews/D1r2qIXu83HaLD5q.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">translated exclusive</a> said this, “Multiple sources said that Xiang Lang, the GM (general manager) of NetEase Games in charge of marketing, was taken away by NetEase’s internal integrity department for investigation, and it is said that the police have intervened, and the specific case is under investigation.”</p>



<p>The story continues and reports the potentially laundered amount equates to <strong>Two Billion Yuan</strong>—or <strong>$275,800,000</strong>, as of writing. It does go on to say the full amount is actually closer to <strong>800 Million to 1 Billion Yuan</strong>—making the final amount in the region of <strong>$111.4 million to $139.3 million</strong>.</p>



<p>Leifeng also says Xiang Lang—the general manager of NetEase—was taken away by NetEase’s internal integrity department for investigation, and it is said the <strong>police have intervened, and the specific case is under investigation</strong>.” The money laundered reportedly affects up to <strong>28 companies</strong>, and the investigation is set to continue.</p>



<p>If you’re worried this affects Marvel Rivals, you can put those doubts to rest. Despite the ongoing controversy, Marvel Rivals is still gearing up for its Dec. 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>, and production on the shooter seems to be unaffected. Whatever is going on behind the scenes at NetEase, we can put these alleged business indiscretions to one side, and look forward to a fully fledged superhero title in the Marvel universe.</p>



<hr>

<p>Donkey Kong Land 2 is the latest Game Boy title <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1861215895873298613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now playable</a> through the Nintendo Switch Online membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Land 2 is a platformer released for Nintendo Game Boy in 1996. It is a sequel to Donkey Kong Land, sometimes called Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong’s Quest. This game features Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong as the playable characters, both with different gameplay mechanics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game’s main characters have different movement systems, and players can control only one at a time. With Diddy Kong, players will be able to ride train tracks, cartwheel their enemies and swing on grappling hooks. On the other hand, Dixie Kong can float in the air using her Helicopter Spin and throw barrels at enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The end goal of Donkey Kong Land 2 is saving Donkey Kong from K. Rool, and players must go through 40 levels filled with traps, collectables, Kremlings, barrels, and bananas to do that.&nbsp;</p>
