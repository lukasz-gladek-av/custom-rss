<p>Everyone knew Forza Horizon 6 was finally getting its first gameplay reveal at the Xbox Developer Direct 2026. It’s fair to say expectations were high, as should be with such a class series—but Playground Games might have outdone themselves with FH6.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-setting-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6’s location</a> was revealed, it made sense. A ludicrously beautiful country with rich culture and a storied heritage. It’s a match made in heaven. Forza was always going to be the main highlight of the Xbox Developer Direct 2026, but its first gameplay footage went up another gear.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-confirmed-has-4-day-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6 Release Date was confirmed</a> hours before the 2026 Xbox Developer Direct. But that quickly became an afterthought once gameplay sped onto the screen.</p>







<p>On one hand, it looks like Forza Horizon, it’s Forza Horizon 5, baby! The visuals are out of this world, and there’s a ton of new modes, cars, and features being added.</p>



<p>You can check out the trailer for yourself.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.

<p>It’s time to be directed by Xbox once again. The fourth annual Xbox Developer Direct is here for 2026, and with Microsoft celebrating the 25th anniversary of Xbox, it’s certain to be a big show to kick off the year. </p>



<p>Xbox Developer Direct 2026 starts at 1pm ET/6pm GMT and airs on all official Xbox channels. This year’s event has three games advertised so far. </p>







<p>Players will get their first look at gameplay for Forza Horizon 6, a deeper dive into Fable, and new details for Game Freak’s—yes, <em>that </em>Game Freak—Beast of Reincarnation. There are also rumors of a surprise game or two making the rounds, but fans will just have to tune in and see if those turn out to be true. </p>



<p>To stop you from having to go elsewhere, though, you can watch it, in full, in the video below. And don’t forget to leave your thoughts on everything down in the comments and join the discussion with other games in the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
