<p>EA Sports is back with NHL 26, the latest installment of the long-running hockey franchise. As with any new release, NHL 26 features a number of trophies and achievements to unlock for all of the completionist who’ll boot up the game. </p>



<p>When it comes to sports games, earning achievements is a bit different than story-focused titles. These games reward you for winning games and championships, completing tasks in various game modes, scoring certain types of goals, and more.  </p>



<p>So, without any more delay, let’s get into everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-nhl-26-trophy-and-achievement">How To Get Every NHL 26 Trophy And Achievement</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In total, there are 49 trophies and achievements to earn in NHL 26. The challenges range from winning a Champions Hockey League trophy in Be A Pro to simply assigning a scout to the CHL in Franchise mode. If you want to 100% the game, you’ll have to play every mode in the game, including online modes like World of Chel and Hockey Ultimate Team.</p>

<h2 id="h-nhl-26-secret-trophies">NHL 26 Secret Trophies</h2>



<p>Unlike fellow EA Sports title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-madden-26-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>, NHL 26 has no secret trophies to unlock this year. All 49 of the achievements can be seen when you load up the game on Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-nhl-26">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In NHL 26?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 49 trophies and achievements to unlock in NHL 26.</strong></p>



<p>Looking further shows that there are 34 bronze trophies, 12 silver, two gold, and one platinum trophy to unlock. Compared to NHL 25, there are two less total trophies and achievements this time around. There are four less bronze trophies, but two more silver.</p>



<p>As far as unlocking them is concerned, they are all pretty straight forward. Most can be done in various single-player modes. Others, however, require you to play online against other players such as winning a Ones Eliminator Tournament in the World of Chel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Return to Silent Hill, a film adaptation of Silent Hill 2, has released the first teaser. The film, which hits theaters on January 23rd, 2026, looks to capture the magic of the iconic sequel. We had seen glimpses before last year during Silent Hill Transmission, but nothing concrete. </p>



<p>The film comes from director Christophe Gans, who did the original Silent Hill film in 2006. Last we had heard about Return to Silent Hill, it got its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-comes-to-theaters-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official release date of January</a>, but no pictures or footage came of it. Regardless, we now have our first look at the upcoming adaptation, and it looks rather interesting.</p>



<h2 id="h-return-to-silent-hill-brings-silent-hill-2-to-life-in-film">Return to Silent Hill Brings Silent Hill 2 To Life in Film</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Return to Silent Hill - Official Teaser Trailer (2025) Jeremy Irvine, Hannah Emily Anderson" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eej34Jw7woA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, shown above, we get a brief glimpse into the world of Return to Silent Hill. As the film is an adaptation of Silent Hill 2 (though the trailer doesn’t seem to indicate that), the plot remains the same. Protagonist James Sunderland, played by Jeremy Irvine, goes to the eerie town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his recently deceased wife, Laura. What follows is a bit too spoilery, but it does involve grotesque monsters and, of course, the iconic Pyramid Head. It looks like it may not be a direct adaptation, as there are a few things not from the games in it. However, it is a teaser, so expect more of a concrete plot come the full trailer.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 is widely regarded as one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-silent-hill-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scariest games of the generation</a>. Last year, Bloober Team and Konami released a remake of the game, which was heavily praised and was up for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/495868/2024-award-winners-game-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dozens of awards</a>. Now, the Silent Hill series is readying the next generation with Silent Hill f, releasing on September 25th, 2025. Following that will be Bloober Team’s return with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-silent-hill-remake-development-bloober-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a remake of Silent Hill</a>, announced earlier this year. Until then, fans can look forward to seeing Silent Hill 2 on the big screen in January.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/today-tom-mckay-last-day-kingdom-come/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/today-was-tom-mckay%E2%80%99s-last-day-in-the-kingdom-come-booth.1281258/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tom McKay has officially wrapped his time in the booth and on the motion capture floor as Kingdom Come Deliverance’s Henry of Skalitz. In a post on social media, the Warhorse Studios team shared the news that McKay has completed his work on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s DLC suite, which means that after almost nine years with the character, he’s <strong>finished</strong>.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to jump to the conclusion that there won’t be a Kingdom Come Deliverance 3, and if there is to be another game in the series, it won’t star Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<h2 id="h-henry-of-skalitz-is-done-with-kingdom-come">Henry of Skalitz is Done with Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>In a post on Twitter, the Warhorse Studios team shared a short video of Tom McKay walking into a large meeting area and being met with a round of applause from the entire squad.</p>



<p>As he approached, he put his hand to his heart and said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to do my best not to cry…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full post:</p>

Today was <a href="https://twitter.com/thisistommckay?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thisistommckay</a>'s last day in the booth &amp; on the mocap stage for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KCD2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#KCD2</a>. For nearly 9 years, he's been giving life to Henry and has helped shape our story. We celebrated with a little surprise (yes, cake included).

<p>Recently, Tom McKay also <a href="https://x.com/thisistommckay/status/1959191623407165807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">called to a close</a> his Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 streams, which were being broadcast live from Warhorse Studios’ headquarters in Prague, close to where the Kingdom Come series is set.</p>



<p>During the recent Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom, Warhorse Studios announced Legacy of the Forge, the second story DLC for KCD2, which has now been on the market for more than seven months. There’s one final DLC lined up for KCD2, and it’s Mysteria Ecclesiae, which is most likely what McKay was working on before wrapping his time at Warhorse.</p>



<p>I’m hugely hopeful that there will be another Kingdom Come Deliverance title, as I’m a huge fan of the series and hold both the games and the actors in high regard. In 2024, I was the first person <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">to interview Tom McKay</a> regarding KCD2, and we had the opportunity to catch up again at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-kingdom-comes-tom-mckay-labels-game-success-a-fever-dream/">BAFTA Games Awards in April</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft wants King employees to use AI on a daily basis. </p>



<p>According to a new report from mobilegamer.biz, employees at the studio behind Candy Crush were given a mandate to continually use AI for general tasks.</p>



<p>Sources <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-king-layoff-lawsuits-toxic-leaders-toothless-ethics-teams-low-morale-and-mandatory-ai-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told the outlet</a> that AI usage was <strong>“introduced by Microsoft as mandatory a while ago”.</strong> They say that in 2024, the goal was to have <strong>“70 or 80% daily usage of AI”</strong>. That goal was pushed to 100% for 2025, meaning that “every artist, designer, developer, even managers have to use it” daily.</p>



<p>King was one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studios hit hardest</a> by Microsoft’s round of layoffs back in July, with 200 people being let go. At the time, it was revealed via an internal memo that the studio was going to “unlock” more AI tools for productivity” and that many employees will be <strong>“replaced by the AI tools they built and trained.”</strong> Those tools include ones for narrative, testing, and level design.</p>



<p>As far as adoption goes, one source told Mobile Gamer that <strong>“AI adoption is very low apart from ChatGPT”</strong> and that even the leadership at King is skeptical of AI’s role in the studio.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to King and Microsoft regarding these claims. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Baby Steps is now the fifth game to get delayed due to Hollow Knight: Silksong. Just yesterday, indie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/demonschool-delayed-november-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG Demonschool</a> pushed its release date to November in order to avoid Silksong. Now, even a Devolver Digital-backed game is getting out of Hornet’s way.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Baby Steps is the newest game from Bennett Foddy, whose games QWOP and Getting Over It provided joy and frustration to players. The challenging gameplay was a hit with both YouTubers and streamers, so, naturally, the new ambitious Baby Steps has been on many people’s radar. Unfortunately, it seems you’ll have to wait a few weeks longer to play it.</p>

<iframe title="Baby Steps | Now Releasing on September 23" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5apDFK64tI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Devolver Digital <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5apDFK64tI">released a video</a> earlier today announcing the delay of Baby Steps. The game will now release on September 23rd, 2025 instead of the slated September 8th date. In a not-so-subtle fashion, the protagonist is seen walking on a model of Hornet. As Silksong’s protagonist is Hornet, it’s obvious that the delay is, at least somewhat, due to Team Cherry’s highly anticipated spinoff.</p>



<p>Bennett Foddy’s Baby Steps joins five other indie titles pushed after Silksong’s surprise announcement last week. Those delayed games are as follows: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3314790/view/520848458437886253?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CloverPit</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/frogteam.games/post/3lwwege2ipc2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stomp and the Sword of Miracles</a>, <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aeterna Lucis</a>, Demonschool, and now Baby Steps. </p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is one of <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s most wishlisted games</a>, so it was likely that titles would avoid releasing next to it. However, due to it being September 4th, less than two weeks away, it’s caused a panic in the indie scene. As many developers have said, including Bennett Foddy before the delay, via <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aftermath</a>, gamers’ attention will all be on Silksong come next week.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Call of Duty Skins or Weapons Will Carry Over? Activision Has Said That Before]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-call-of-duty-skins-or-weapon-will-carry-over-activision-has-said-that-before/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-call-of-duty-skins-or-weapons-will-carry-over-activision-has-said-that-before.1281171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a reversal of plans, Activision has announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t allow weapons, operators, or operator skins to carry forward from Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>In a community update posted on Tuesday, Activision says that it has seen the discussion about “the identity of Call of Duty”.</p>



<p><strong>“Some of you have said we’ve drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded,” </strong><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. <strong>“That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.”</strong></p>



<p>The publisher continues to say that developers Treyarch and Raven’s “north star” is to bring players a true spiritual successor to Black Ops 2. Because of that comes the decision to remove carry forward options. The publisher says the decision was ultimately made in order make Black Ops 7 <strong>“feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</strong></p>



<p>Now, wanting to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-content-will-no-longer-carry-forward-into-black-ops-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep things authentic</a> to the new game is understandable, but there’s one problem: they’ve kind of said this before.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-this-isn-t-the-first-time">This isn’t the first time</h2>



<p>Ahead of the release of Black Ops 6, Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions#Content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced that content</a> from Modern Warfare 2 and 3 wouldn’t carry forward to the new game. At the time, they said that it was done to allow players to <strong>“experience the Black Ops universe the way it’s meant to be played.”</strong></p>



<p>Again, it’s understandable. But then, it only took a few months before Black Ops 6 became filled with operators and skins such as Beavis and Butt-head, Jay and Silent Bob, Stan Smith, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and more. All done in the name of, apparently, “keeping that signature Black Ops style.” </p>



<p>To give credit, reports did surface earlier this year that Activision was aware that certain skins <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-skins-make-game-look-stupid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the game “look stupid”</a>. Still, after that report, more skins like the American Dad crossover came out, continuing the trend.</p>



<p>Recently, our Tom Henderson wrote about Call of Duty executives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being worried</a> about the competition from EA’s Battlefield 6. Sources told Henderson that many at the top believe Call of Duty is “too big to fail”. While that might be true in a sense, it seems that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaction and interest</a> in Battlefield 6—along with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/this-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6-fans-react-to-black-ops-7-gameplay-trailer/">the negative reactions</a> to the Black Ops 6 reveal—has changed some thoughts.</p>



<p>You’d like to think that Activision truly has listened to the community regarding the over-the-top nature of some of the operators and skins that have made their way to Call of Duty in recent years. But, then again, if these crossovers are going to continue to print money for Activision and Microsoft, how long until they pick up again with Black Ops 7? History suggests players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BlackOps7Skins-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t have to wait long</a> to find out.</p>
