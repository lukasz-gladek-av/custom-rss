<p>Sonic 3 recently surpassed Detective Pikachu to become the second-highest-grossing video game movie ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://screenrant.com/sonic-3-second-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-box-office-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a>, a report by <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Sonic-the-Hedgehog-3-(2024)#tab=summary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Numbers</a> reveals that Sonic 3 earned $462.5 million globally, with domestic and international box office earnings almost at par. Sonic 3’s latest numbers beat Detective Pikachu’s $450 million, which held the title of second-highest-grossing video game movie of all time until today. However, Sonic 3 is miles away from The Super Mario Bros. Movie’s earnings, which managed to bring in $1.36 billion globally, retaining the title of the highest-earning video game movie ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sonic 3 sees Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails join forces to confront one of their most formidable opponents yet: Shadow. Shadow is a fan-favourite character from the video game series, and excitement for the movie skyrocketed when Keanu Reeves was announced to portray the enigmatic character. The enhanced visuals and Jim Carrey’s outstanding performance as Dr. Eggman have also contributed to the film’s success.</p>



<p>With Sonic 3 becoming the second-highest-grossing video game movie of all time, players will expect more movie adaptations to be released in the near future. Just recently, a popular video game got greenlit for a movie adaptation, and fans are waiting in anticipation for its arrival. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-movie-confirmed-story-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sleeping Dogs movie</a> is now confirmed to be in production, with Story Kitchen, Square Enix, and Simu Liu bringing it to life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 has been confirmed, with the movie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-confirmed-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poised to release in 2027.</a> Also, a post-credits scene may have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked the new characters</a> arriving for Sonic 4.

<p>EA has given players a small tease of what appears to be gameplay from the upcoming Battlefield 6 (name not confirmed). As part of their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Battlefield Labs</a>, EA released a short clip of gameplay from the popular shooter.</p>



<p>The gameplay comes from a Pre-Alpha version of the next game. You can check it out for yourself, courtesy of EA, below.</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BF6Screen.jpg" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BF6Gameplay.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>With Battlefield Labs, select players will be able to have a direct line of communication with developers as they build the next game in the Battlefield franchise. </p>



<p>“We’re going to test all the new features that we’re putting out, and we’re going to test hardware like weapons, vehicles, and gadgets,” Creative Director Thomas Andersson said. </p>



<p>“That feedback is crucial in helping us know what’s prioritized, what needs improvement, and what feels like a true Battlefield experience.”</p>



<p>The next Battlefield game is currently in development at what EA is calling “Battlefield Studios”. These studios are made up of four EA subsidiaries—DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect—working on different aspects of the new title. More information on the next game in the franchise will come later on. </p>

<p>As I watched the credits roll over an impeccable soundtrack, I found myself reflecting on my journey through Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. This beautiful, unforgettable game captured my full attention (no easy feat) for more than 70 hours, and I felt a strange concoction of emotions running through me.</p>



<p>It was a sense of relief at how the story had wrapped up, and a comedown from the adrenaline-fuelled high that accompanied the final sequences of this wonderful game. I revelled in victory and mourned those I’d lost along the way, and of course, I looked to whatever would come next, as for all the hours I’d invested, my path through KCD2 <strong>wasn’t yet finished</strong>.</p>



<p>This is everything I ever wanted in a sequel – and so much more. In this comprehensive Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, I hope you’ll come with me as I look back at one of the best games I’ve ever played.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pure-cinema">Pure Cinema</h2>



<p>From the very opening sequences of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, you’re made aware that Warhorse Studios wants to transcend delivering ‘a game’ and instead has chosen to offer players worldwide the ultimate cinematic experience. The soundtrack is bold and lifting, the visuals stunning, and the acting right off the bat is nothing short of sumptuous.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 doesn’t mess around with a light-hearted introduction. Within the first hour of the game, you’ve seen slaughter and decimation at the hands of bandits, you’ve been left for dead, and your situation is looking dire. It’s quite a callback to the first game, which was released in 2018 and opened much in the same way.</p>



<p>As the game unfolds, you’ll be treated to a twisting, winding story packed with choices and consequences, which is exactly what I was hoping for. The paths you pick will shape the world around you, and from the relationships you embrace to the decisions you make midway through a conversation, <strong>everything means something.</strong></p>



<p>This isn’t just a medieval RPG – it goes far beyond that.</p>



<p>In Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, you’ll be forced to meander through an intense story with intrepid abandon, ready and willing to change the course of history and the lives of those close to you. How you dress, fight, act, kill, and succeed (or <strong>fail</strong>) will mould your story and your version of Henry of Skalitz, the game’s bold protagonist.</p>



<h2 id="h-small-becomes-mighty">Small Becomes Mighty</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The pacing shifts in such a nice way between wanton violence and jubilant revelry</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s not just about the gorgeous landscapes, the towering castles, or the ambitious mission sequences in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. One of the things I love most about this game is the attention to even the smallest details. This is a world that lives and breathes around you, and at no point in my 70-hour campaign run did I feel as though I <strong>wasn’t </strong>immersed in something.</p>



<p>The best way I can explain this concept is to highlight how <strong>crime </strong>works in this Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review.</p>



<p>If you steal a set of keys from a character, you might return to their home later to find they’ve changed the locks. When you commit a crime against nobility, you’ll be more harshly pursued and punished than if you’d robbed a peasant. When you drop something on the floor, an NPC might steal it – but only if it suits their character or their desires.</p>



<p>On the topic of NPCs, the game’s ‘named characters’ aren’t just existing, they’re living their lives and working through a schedule. They might wake up in their designated home, go to work, revel in the tavern in the evening, and then head home for some food before going to sleep again.</p>



<p>In one sequence, I saw a gaggle of women huddled outside the local pub having a chat, and when it started to rain, they moved under a shelter to get out of the bad weather and continue their conversation. In another, I walked into a town covered in dirt and was berated by an innkeeper – until I washed in a nearby trough, prompting him to praise me for a job well done.</p>



<p>These interactions feel almost unscripted, and they’re more common than you’d think.</p>



<p><strong>Time </strong>also plays a detailed role in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. If you accept a side quest but take too long to do something, you might miss some kind of deadline and you’ll fail that task. People aren’t waiting on you forever – life doesn’t last that long in 15th-century Bohemia.</p>



<h2 id="h-and-scale-it-up">And Scale It Up</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll be mindblown by the scale of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</figcaption></figure>







<p>From the grandeur of the story and the depth of the smaller details to the scope and scale of the wider world.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-back-to-trosky-kcd2-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">split between two large maps</a> – Trosky and Kuttenberg. The first is more of a starter realm, while the second is a gargantuan, open-ended environment with more than a dozen towns and villages to explore. Both are rich, varied, and stunning, and you’ll never want for something to do while you’re out digging through the forests and fields.</p>



<p>As your story unravels, you’ll go from small-scale skirmishes to immensely brutal fortress sieges, such is the natural progression of the incredible story of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. It’s not done quickly, though – the events that lead from the opening hours to the grandest battles in the game are plentiful and relatively heavy.</p>



<p>The meat on the bone is, in a word, staggering. One of the things that kept slowing down my playthrough was the plethora of content up for grabs, the spontaneity of random events and side quests, and the ability to just <strong>look</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m being literal when I say that.</p>



<p>On more than one occasion, I found myself sitting down in a glade or the middle of a village somewhere, soaking up the sunlight and the atmosphere around me, listening to the wind in the trees and the birds tweeting above me. In the distance, a cart rolled by, prompting a guard dog to bark loudly, and down the road, I could see two farmers sharing a joke as they passed each other by.</p>



<p>The small details might be remarkable in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but it’s the enormity of the game and the consistency of the world-building and environment around you that blows your mind.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-honest-experience">The Honest Experience</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a cutthroat world out there, but he’ll find my chain hard to slash</figcaption></figure>







<p>For 70 hours, I played a pre-release version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but I’m pleased to report that I had no performance issues (on PC), nor did I have any game-breaking bugs. I experienced some minor issues with shaders, misbehaving AI, and some glitching ragdoll physics, but that was about it.</p>



<p>My biggest concerns were eliminated by the game’s day one patch, which I received ahead of launch.</p>



<p>As I explored the game to piece together my Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, I thought after a while that the title’s forced stealth sequences would ruin my impression of the game altogether. There are plenty of them and they’re a little cumbersome at times, but once you learn your routes and understand the core mechanics of how to be stealthy, they’re not <strong>terrible</strong>.</p>



<p>I’ll also stress quite openly that this game is <strong>challenging</strong>. The combat and some mechanics <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like lockpicking</a> are notorious, and since the first game, they’ve evolved but remain quite tough in general. Even at a higher level with a stack of advantageous perks and killer equipment, I found myself getting my head stoved in during the many fights you get involved in.</p>



<p>Practice makes perfect, and you can often run away to fight another day, of course.</p>



<p>Also, I’ll address the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-banned-saudi-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KCD2 controversies</a>‘ here. Before launch, it slipped out that Henry of Skalitz, the game’s protagonist, could engage in a homosexual sequence with another male character. That prompted people to launch into a tirade against the game, but I’m here to set the story straight.</p>



<p>It’s entirely <strong>optional</strong>, it’s the result of a few choices you’re <strong>offered</strong> throughout the game, and it’s beautifully portrayed by Warhorse Studios. It’s not graphic, and it’s not gratuitous – it <strong>makes sense</strong>, given the circumstances and story. In a similar vein, I was able to romance a female love interest and frequented the city baths for favours – so ignore the chatter of anyone deluded enough to judge without first experiencing what’s on offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-beautiful-palette">The Beautiful Palette</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How will you get out of this one?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect. It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection. It features my favourite trope, with all the game’s heroes (and villains) coming together for a grand, full-scale, spectacular battle at the end of the adventure.</p>



<p>It’s not a bridge too far to suggest that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 <strong>taught me </strong>something, too. From the codex packed full of historical information to the <strong>real people, places, and events</strong>, there’s a lot to break down from this title that’ll have you feeling like a genuine historian, rubbing shoulders with old kings, lords, and ladies.</p>



<p>I implore you to buy and finish Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 – the final cinematic cutscene made me yearn for this game to generate a sequel and perhaps a few spin-off television shows and movies. I can’t stress enough how much of a fantastic time I had playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and I am forever grateful to everyone at Warhorse, and to Tom McKay (Henry of Skalitz) and Luke Dale (Hans Capon) for their stellar work and performances.</p>



<p>This monumental medieval adventure will have you living a double life – but in this one, you’re a brave adventurer exploring the most faithful recreation of a real place I’ve ever seen. From ethereal sequences packed with tearjerker scenes to a phenomenal weather engine, and from genuinely interesting side activities to a neat little photo mode, I cannot find one major fault with this game.</p>



<p>It has been hard to find the words to accurately represent how phenomenal this game is. If I could sum up Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in just one, it would be this: <strong>masterpiece</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going back to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. I’ve got a lot left to do, and this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three expansions</a> are set to be released, which means I’ve got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many hours of gameplay</a> left to unpack.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>

<p>The United States government—led by Donald Trump—is set to impose new trade tariffs across a number of countries such as Canada, Mexico, and China. These tariffs are set to impact a number of industries including video games, and has garnered a response from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA).</p>



<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1886390949091123378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, the organization is asking Trump and the United States government to consult to avoid “significant harm” to people in the United States.</p>



<p>“Tariffs on video game devices and related products would impact Americans of all ages across the country,” the statement reads. “We urge the administration to consult with the private sector in a transparent process to avoid causing significant harm to everyday Americans and to one of the fastest growing entertainment sectors in the United States.”</p>



<p>It’s worth nothing that digital software is likely to avoid the tariffs, physical products like game discs and consoles aren’t likely to be so lucky. It’s unknown just how much of an impact on prices gamers will see on things like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, computer graphics cards, and even the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The tariffs are scheduled to being at 12:01 ET on February 4.</p>



<p>How do you think these tariffs will affect the video game industry, and what do you think of the ESA’s statement?

<p>A recent Fortnite leak has revealed which Jujutsu Kaisen characters will be featured in the upcoming Wave 2 skins collection.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885794070682910998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, the Fortnite x Jujutsu Kaisen collaboration will feature three new skins for players to try out, including Ryomen Sukuna, Mahito and Toji Fushiguro. Sukuna is a no-brainer, one of the series’s most popular characters, and players will be excited to see this skin arrive. Toji Fushigiro is a new favourite from the anime series’ second season, and you can see the comment section of this post already raving about his arrival. Mahito, on the other hand, was one of the series’ main antagonists till the end of season 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the leaks are correct, Fortnite’s collaboration with Jujutsu Kaisen will provide players with new skins and cosmetics themed around season 2. The Wave 1 collaboration featured season 1’s Yuji Itadori, Satoru Gojo, Nobara Kugisaki, and Megumi Fushigiro as skins. Fortnite also featured some popular moves from the series as Mythics: Hollow Purple and Straw Doll Technique, which makes players wonder if the next collaboration will introduce new mythics or see the return of the existing JJK mythics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR has also provided an <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885409443933741111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">updated list</a> of collaborations for Fortnite, which features much more than Jujutsu Kaisen. In this update or upcoming ones, players might see Disney’s Avatar, a new Ironman skin, Off-White cosmetics, an AC Milan Collaboration, a Demon Slayer collaboration, a Pixar Cars collaboration, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite will receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-get-more-dc-collabs-after-multiversus-shutdown-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more DC collabs after the Multiversus shutdown</a>, according to a new claim. Also, the game is seemingly receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-red-hulk-falcon-and-superman-skins-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Hulk, Falcon and Superman skins</a>. What are your thoughts on Fortnite’s Wave 2 Jujutsu Kaisen skins?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
