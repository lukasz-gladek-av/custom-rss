<p>Fable fans can finally count down to the long-awaited release of the next game in the franchise after the release window was announced during the Xbox Developer Direct on January 22.</p>



<p>Developed by Playground Games, the new Fable is a reboot for the franchise, releasing a whopping 16 years after Fable III, and, after previous delays, a new release window has finally been announced.</p>

<p>During Xbox’s January 2026 Developer Direct, Playground Games announced that Fable will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC in Autumn 2026. As previously announced, Fable will be available day one with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was confirmed that Fable will be available on PlayStation 5, and the release window will be the same as on other platforms, meaning that PlayStation players won’t have to wait longer for a release, unlike another Playground Games title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-playstation-5-release-window-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>.</p>



<p>Fable was previously slated for release in 2025, but was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed back to a 2026 window in February</a> last year, when Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan said the title was “definitely worth the wait” and is the “most beautifully realized version of Albion” that players have ever seen.</p>



<p>The Fable reboot was officially announced in 2020, though gamers had to wait until 2023 to see the first proper trailer, and it’s been somewhat of a rollercoaster ride since then due to the hefty delay. Finally, though, the end is now in sight.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Double Fine Reveals ‘Kiln’ Almost 10 Years After First Announcement]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/double-fine-reveal-kiln-10-years-after-announcement/</link>
            <guid>1413505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Double Fine has taken to the (virtual) stage at the Xbox Developer Direct showcase to reveal Kiln, a unique multiplayer, team-based party brawler, <strong>almost a decade </strong>after it was announced. The game first surfaced in 2017, emerging from Double Fine’s ‘Amnesia Fortnight’ event, an annual, two-week game jam that spawns prototype game ideas.</p>



<p>It has remained silent, aside from some prototype images appearing online years ago, until now. During the recent Xbox Dev Direct, Double Fine finally revealed the physics-based, destruction-laden brawler.</p>



<h2 id="h-kiln-ten-years-in-the-making">Kiln – Ten Years in the Making</h2>



<p>If you try to find any information online about Kiln, you’ll find a blurb penned by Double Fine in April 2017:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Kiln is a multiplayer, team-based brawler by Derek Brand with a focus on creating unique player sculpted characters featuring crazy physics-based animation and destruction. In Kiln you play as a Mountain Spirit, supernatural beings forever at war on the summit. You’ll use an ancient pottery wheel to create warrior golems called Vessels, inhabiting them and enabling you to interact with the physical realm to do battle. </p>



<p>Created during the match, extremely diverse character shapes and sizes are possible each exhibiting unique attributes and controls that leverage the possibilities in procedural animation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also in 2017 that Double Fine revealed the developers responsible for shaping the early game:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>All of this was <strong>re</strong>shared by Double Fine during today’s announcement.</p>



<p>Today, during the Xbox Developer Direct, we saw how that game has evolved over the last decade. </p>



<p>The trailer opened up with Tim Schafer, the head of the studio at Double Fine, working on some pottery. That’s basically the core concept of Kiln. Players take clay characters and shape them into whatever they can imagine, taking them into destructive environments and smashing each other to pieces.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>You take your pottery mechanisms, craft ‘pots’, and take those ceramic imaginations into multiplayer battles across entertaining, engaging maps built with the ‘spirit of creativity’.</p>



<p>Double Fine confirmed that Kiln is coming Spring 2026, and a closed beta will come soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Beast of Reincarnation’s release window has been confirmed during the latest Xbox Developer Direct 2026, with the game releasing in Summer, 2026.</p>







<p>The upcoming souls-like RPG is being developed by none other than Game Freak, the masters behind the ever-popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-is-coming-to-hytale-through-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon series</a>. It’s fair to say it’s a harsh departure from their usual titles, but judging from the gameplay showcased, there’s a lot to be excited about.</p>



<h2 id="h-beast-of-reincarnation-releases-summer-2026">Beast of Reincarnation Releases Summer, 2026</h2>



<p>It’s not just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-confirmed-has-4-day-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a> that takes place in Japan, as Beast of Reincarnation is also heading there, but with more of a post-apocalyptic twist. The footage showcases a deeper look at the nation, which has been ruined by a strange blight and plagued by monstrous beasts.</p>



<p>The gameplay is described as a ‘one-person, one-dog experience,’ and it’s clear that the protagonist’s wolf companion, Koo, will play a large part in the experience. Together, you’ll explore the ruins of Japan and hunt down Malefacts in an effort to cleanse the blight from the world. </p>



<p>And there’s good news for PlayStation fans out there, as it was confirmed that Beast of Reincarnation will release on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation concurrently—no delay like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-playstation-5-release-window-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>.</p>

<p>Forza Horizon 6 is racing onto the scenes later this year, but PlayStation 5 players will have to wait a while longer to get behind the steering wheel.</p>



<p>The first gameplay for the Playground Games title was shown at the Xbox Developer Direct on January 22, officially confirming the previously leaked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-confirmed-has-4-day-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 19 release date</a>, alongside the release window for a later PlayStation 5 release.</p>







<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-6-ps5-release-window-confirmed">Forza Horizon 6 PS5 Release Window Confirmed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ready, set, go. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>During the Developer Direct, Playground Games confirmed that Forza Horizon 6 would launch on PlayStation 5 ‘later this year’, confirming players on the platform will be able to jump in before the end of 2026.</p>



<p>The PS5 launch, therefore, takes place significantly later than Forza Horizon 6 arrives on Xbox Series X|S and PC, though it was already known that the PlayStation launch would not be simultaneous.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-6-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial reveal</a> of the game in September, it was stated that due to “the excitement for this franchise on other platforms,” Playground Games and Turn 10 Studios are “working together to bring Forza Horizon 6 to PlayStation 5 post-launch.”</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6’s arrival on PlayStation continues Microsoft’s growing trend of releasing titles that would have previously been exclusives onto other platforms, following the likes of Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, and Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle, with the likes of Halo making the move later this year.</p>



<p>While it’s not the concrete release date PlayStation gamers will have hoped for, at least players won’t need to wait until 2027 to jump in.</p>
