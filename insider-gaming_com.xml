            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s destruction technology has received praise from all players, and it seems that dropping previous-gen consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, was key in reaching that standard. </p>



<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 have elaborated on the destruction tech used in the game several times ahead of release. The title utilizes tactical destruction, which brings “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-elaborate-on-tactical-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unparalleled levels of freedom</a>” to the game, and was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-took-huge-inspiration-from-bad-company-2s-destruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inspired</a> by <span>the&nbsp;intimate destruction</span> experience in Bad Company 2. Now, the developers have explained what it takes to achieve this level of destruction in BF6. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-magic-trick-behind-battlefield-6-s-destruction-is-dropping-previous-gen-consoles">The ‘Magic Trick’ Behind Battlefield 6’s Destruction is Dropping Previous-Gen Consoles</h2>



<p><span>During a new interview with Battlefield 6’s technical director, Christian Buhl,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-dev-says-its-destruction-tech-is-so-delicious-for-one-simple-reason-the-only-magic-trick-is-that-were-not-on-the-ps4-or-xbox-one-any-more/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a>&nbsp;asked what the secret sauce was behind the game’s destruction system.</span> Buhl revealed that “Maybe the only magic trick is that we’re not on the PS4 or Xbox One anymore.” This enabled developers to work with increased memory and CPU speed, which in turn improved overall performance. As the developers weren’t trying to optimize the “game to run on a PS4, for example.”</p>



<p>However, there was still a lot of work done towards Battlefield 6’s destruction after dropping previous-gen consoles. Buhl spoke about “testing destruction” and the different areas that need to be optimised. The technical director also talked about the Frostbite engine, which was built for Battlefield, and destruction, and “those pieces are core parts of the engine.” The developer concluded, stating,”&nbsp;I don’t think there was any magic bullet. It was just a lot of testing, a lot of iteration, a lot of work.”</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-and-multiplayer-has-the-same-destruction-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale and multiplayer</a> have the same destruction system. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-players-dont-give-a-damn-about-new-portal-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 12% of BF6 players</a> give a damn about the new Portal mode. What are your thoughts on removing previous-generation consoles like Xbox One and PS4, which could help improve Battlefield 6’s destruction?

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Legends: Z-A Preload Guide & File Size Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preload-guide-file-size-revealed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The file sizes for Pokémon Legends: Z-A have dropped ahead of next week’s release, and, as is customary with titles on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles, you won’t have to clear out too much space.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the first Pokémon title to launch on Switch 2, though it’s also available on the original Switch console and launches on both platforms on October 16.</p>



<p>While Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-vs-switch-2-performance-which-version-should-you-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn’t include any additional features or content</a> that have been advertised ahead of launch, the file size is almost double on the newer console.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Small sizes. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Preloads for Pokémon Legends: Z-A are now available on both platforms, as of October 8, which confirms the file size on both generations of Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>On the original console, you’ll need 4.0 GB of space for the game, while those on Switch 2 require 7.7 GB of space, which even those of us who struggle with maths can spot is almost double the size.</p>



<p>The small size of the game on the original Switch may raise eyebrows when compared to previous titles, with Scarlet &amp; Violet clocking in at around 6.8 GB, Legends: Arceus being 6.1 GB, while Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl were 6.9 GB. Those pale in comparison to Sword and Shield, though, which was 12.4 GB.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A on the original Switch is, therefore, the smallest file size of a mainline Pokémon game since Sun &amp; Moon on the Nintendo 3DS.</p>



<p>The smaller size can be explained by the setting of Legends: Z-A taking place solely in Lumiose City, rather than an entire region, but the new battle mechanics could have pushed the file size up in comparison.</p>



<p>Either way, it’s good news on both platforms for any player who doesn’t want to uninstall other games to make room for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, as you should have more than enough space.</p>



<p>Which starter are you going to choose in Pokémon Legends: Z-A? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Wednesday Addams, from the hit Netflix series, Jason Vorhees, Poppy’s Playtime, and The Terrifier all feature among the collabs in the event, which is due to be available until the end of the current season on November 1.</p>



<p>The content drop includes two Jam Tracks from Doja Cat’s latest album, along with the landmark Season 10 of Fortnite Festival. This time around, rather than focusing on a single artist, the Music Pass is full of hits from stars around the world.</p>
