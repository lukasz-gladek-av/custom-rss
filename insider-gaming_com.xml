<p>One of the worst-kept secrets is out in the open—Forza Horizon 5 is coming to the PS5. We know its release period, and the developer has already discussed the game’s release time details and brand-new content on the way.</p>



<p>The Xbox and PlayStation partnership continues to blow minds in 2025. The two companies have waged war for two decades across numerous generations of Xbox and PlayStation consoles. But the tides have turned in the last few years. We’re seeing more Xbox exclusives and Microsoft-owned titles come to the PS5.</p>



<p>Halo is rumored to be coming to PlayStation, as are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War and Hellblade</a>. One title we can tick off though is Forza Horizon 5. The Horizon series (and Forza Motorsport) have battled against PlayStation’s Gran Turismo for years, but now the racer has turned a corner.</p>

<p><strong>Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PlayStation 5 and it marks the first time a Forza title has ever been released on a PlayStation console.</strong></p>



<p>We thought the official announcement was coming in 2024, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5 PS5 Release was apparently delayed</a>. The news finally arrived on January 30 to say <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5 is on its way to PS5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-release-period">Forza Horizon 5 Release Period</h2>



<p><strong>Spring 2025 is the release period for Forza Horizon on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>The season of Spring is considered <strong>March, April, and May</strong>, meaning Forza Horizon 5 isn’t far away. I can hear the tires screeching in the distance it’s that close. As the weeks fly by faster than a Lamborghini, we’re sure to get a more accurate release date for you to write down in your diary.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we learn the latest on Forza Horizon 5’s release date. </p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-forza-horizon-5-s-release-times">Do we Know Forza Horizon 5’s Release Times?</h2>



<p>Official release times haven’t been released yet, but developer Playground Games has said to “<strong>Wishlist Forza Horizon 5 on the PlayStation Store&nbsp;today to stay informed about updates and release times.</strong>“</p>



<p>This is significant because it makes me believe we may be getting different release times everywhere. Again, stay tuned for updates on Forza Horizon 5’s release time for PS5.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-horizon-realms-content">Forza Horizon 5 Horizon Realms Content</h2>



<p><strong>Horizon Realms is a completely new piece of content for Forza Horizon 5, and it’s “a curated collection of some of the community’s favorite previously released Evolving Worlds.”</strong></p>



<p>That’s not all though as the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer is also promising</a> “<strong>other surprises</strong>” too. The content is releasing alongside all “the same content as the Xbox and PC releases of the game.” PlayStation 5 players have a lot of gameplay to look forward to and a lot of rubber to burn!</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve primarily been a PlayStation and occasional Nintendo fan in my life, making Forza Horizon 5 my first foray into Forza. How about you? Is this going to be a debut drive? Or have you already racked up a ton of mileage?</p>



<p>We have even more rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-playstation-exclusives-are-coming-to-xbox-next-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox games coming to PlayStation</a>, and we already know other Xbox and Bethesda games are PS5-bound: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-be-on-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-fps-released/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new leak has shared that Avowed will have 30, 40, and 60 FPS Modes for the Xbox Series X.</p>



<p>Also leaked was that 30 and 40 FPS modes will also be available for the Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>The news was shared by <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, who shared the information from someone who appears to have got a review copy of the game (which were sent out earlier this week).</p>



<p>Avowed faced some criticism in mid-2024 following an announcement via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBL4jTHs5w&amp;ab_channel=IronLordsPodcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Iron Lords Podcast</a> that the game would be “targeting a baseline of 30FPS,” even on the more powerful Xbox Series X. </p>



<p>“It’s a first-person, single-player game, you don’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-doesnt-need-60-fps-mode-says-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">necessarily need that 60 frames</a>. And that allows us to get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting and all this other stuff,” said Obsidian art director Matt Hansen. Of course, after the comments, social media blow up in rage at the lack of 60FPS, but it’s a feature that Obsidian has seemingly overcome.</p>



<p>Even so, Insider Gaming’s Senior Editor Grant-Taylor Hill got hands-on with Avowed at Gamescom 2024 and failed to see any issue with how Avowed ran. “Even in intense combat sequences filled with blasts of magic and clashing swords, the game looked brilliant on screen,” he said.</p>



<p>On social media, players seem to be happy with the leak, with some even going saying that 40fps is the best FPS for single-player console gaming.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, it’s currently unclear on if Avowed will be capped at 60FPS or not on PC.</p>



<p>Avowed releases on February 18, with its review embargo lifting on February 13. You can see more dates on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Calendar</a>. </p>



<p>What do you think of Avowed’s 30, 40, and 60 FPS options? Let us know what you think about this news on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
