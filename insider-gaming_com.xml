<p>Earlier today, Valve officially updated their Counter-Strike 2 Major <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_rules_and_regs/blob/main/major-supplemental-rulebook.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rulebook</a>, confirming the reports that their illustrious tournament would <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40062/sources-majors-to-expand-to-32-teams-from-2025-rmrs-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expand from 24 teams to 32</a>. The increase in teams also means that the CS2 Major will expand the number of Swiss Stages from two to three. There will also be a new series of qualifier events, called the Major Regional Qualifiers.</p>



<p>The next Major on the schedule, the BLAST.tv Austin Major in April 2025, should be the first to incorporate the new changes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-re-gonna-need-a-bigger-stage">We’re Gonna Need a Bigger Stage</h2>



<p>The CS2 Major will now prominently feature three 16-team Swiss Stages before culminating in the traditional eight-team single-elimination playoff bracket. Each Swiss Stage will still feature best-of-one matches in the first two rounds. </p>



<p>Eight teams will receive a direct invite to the third stage, and eight will receive a direct invite to the second stage. The Major Regional Qualifiers, which are replacing the Regional Major Ranking (RMR) events, will determine the 16 teams that begin in stage one.</p>



<p>The regional distribution of the teams invited to each stage of the CS2 Major is directly determined by that region’s performance at the previous Major. Six European teams, one Americas team, and one Asia/Pacific team are invited to stage three, based on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the teams that reached the playoffs of the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a>. Four EU teams and four Americas teams will be invited to stage two. Six EU teams, six Americas teams, and four Asia/Pacific teams will qualify from MRQs to stage one. </p>



<p>The official Valve Regional Standings for each of the three regions will determine which teams are invited to stage three, stage two, or the MRQs. The highest ranked teams from each region that haven’t already been invited to stage two or stage three will be invited to the MRQs.</p>



<p>Speaking of MRQs, which are replacing the Regional Major Ranking (RMR) events for determining Major participants, here are the new formats:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eight Asia/Pacific teams will compete in a two-group GSL-style bracket. Four teams will advance to Stage One.</li>



<li>16 European teams will compete in their own Swiss Stage. Six teams will advance to Stage One.</li>



<li>16 Americas teams will compete in their own Swiss Stage. Six teams will advance to Stage One.
<ul>
<li>If Americas must be subdivided to North America and South America due to ping issues, “Major invitations will be split evenly among the regions.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the changes to the CS2 Major rulebook say that the MRQs may be held online, though players and teams will likely heavily oppose playing online. </p>

<p>Atari has unveiled the Gamestation Go, an all-new handheld device with a few bizarre features that contribute nicely to a retro-futuristic vibe. In a short trailer uploaded on social media, we’re given a glimpse at the new console, which features typical button-based inputs alongside a keypad, paddle, and a Trak-Ball input.</p>

<h2 id="h-an-icon-reimagined">An Icon, Reimagined</h2>



<p>Atari is preparing to fully showcase the Gamestation Go handheld console at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, which will commence on January 7.</p>



<p>The first whispers of this device surfaced more than a year ago when it was revealed that Atari was partnering with MyArcade to piece together a handheld unit with these very features. That collaboration has come to fruition with the Gamestation Go.</p>



<p>At CES 2024, the ‘Gamestation Portable’ was revealed, featuring:</p>



<ul>
<li>A 7-inch high-resolution display</li>



<li>Paddle, Trak-Ball, and keypad inputs</li>



<li>Officially licensed titles</li>
</ul>



<p>The original design showcased at CES 2024 has undergone a few changes, with the team making some aesthetic tweaks and shifting some buttons around.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer released by Atari:</p>











<p>With charming hints of backlighting, a colour scheme that screams retro, and a promising line-up of titles, the Atari Gamestation Go could be a winner in the ever-growing handheld market. The unique inputs promise to accommodate games found on platforms like the Atari 5200 and the Jaguar. </p>



<p>In recent years, the concept of the handheld console has exploded in popularity, with almost every major tech manufacturer getting in on the action. Recently, we’ve seen every tech titan from MSI to Logitech and from Lenovo to ASUS have their crack at making a handheld gaming device.</p>



<p>When CES 2025 kicks off, we’ll likely have more information about the unit, including a release window and potentially a price point.</p>
