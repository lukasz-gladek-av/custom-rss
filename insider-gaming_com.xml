            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Teases Far Cry 60 FPS Update For THREE Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-teases-far-cry-60-fps-updates/</link>
            <guid>1409029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s Far Cry team has posted an image on social media that clearly teases (and essentially confirms) the imminent arrival of 60 FPS updates for Far Cry 3, Far Cry: Blood Dragon, and Far Cry: Primal. While fans wait patiently for news about the next major Far Cry release, this is a welcome tidbit to surface, even if some of these updates are coming <strong>more than a decade </strong>after the games were released.</p>



<p>The newest game in the collection is Far Cry: Primal, a unique release that was released in February 2016. It puts players in control of a tribal warrior in a prehistoric era – ‘caveman times’.</p>







<h2 id="h-major-far-cry-updates-coming-soon">Major Far Cry Updates Coming Soon</h2>



<p>It’s not exactly hard to decode the image posted by the Far Cry social team recently. The strings of emojis aren’t enigmatic enough to require a code breaker. See for yourself:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you know Far Cry, it’s easy to decode the suggestions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Far Cry + Jungle + Six Tea + Frame Pair Time = ?</li>



<li>Far Cry + Blood Dragon + Six Tee + Film Pear Time = ?</li>



<li>Far Cry + Primate + Six Tea + Frame Purr Time = ?</li>
</ul>



<p>In the comments under the post, one user wrote, ‘Far Cry 3 60 FPS update PLEASE,’ to which Ubisoft’s team simply responded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I mean… it’s pretty clear what (it) is, no?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When one user decoded the messages, Ubisoft was pretty clear in their confirmation:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s not clear if the updates will come with any other tweaks or optimizations, but who knows? Far Cry is in a bit of a slump right now, with the last game, Far Cry 6, having been the worst-received game in the series. This year will mark the game’s fifth anniversary, and fans are hungry for more.</p>



<p>Early in 2025, it was reported exclusively by Insider Gaming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/">Ubisoft’s extraction-based multiplayer</a> title set in the Far Cry universe had been <strong>rebooted</strong> after failing to impress in internal reviews. It was going to be set in Alaska and would put players against the harsh environment, wildlife, and enemy players, but that was all pulled back for an assessment.</p>



<p>That’s in addition to Far Cry 7, known as Project Blackbird, which remains in development.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Deadpool Pushed Marvel Rivals Player Count to Nine-Month High]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-player-count-soar/</link>
            <guid>1409026</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s no big secret that Deadpool is one of the most beloved Marvel characters of all time. The loud-mouthed mercenary is a fan-favorite through and through, which is why there was so much buzz around his arrival in Marvel Rivals, the sensational hero shooter with a star-studded line-up.</p>



<p>On Friday, January 16, Marvel Rivals’ sixth season of content went live, introducing Deadpool as a playable hero. The move caused players to <strong>flock back </strong>to the game, pushing the player count higher than it has been in <strong>nine months</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-deadpool-pulls-in-players-in-marvel-rivals">Deadpool Pulls in Players in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Yesterday, Marvel Rivals hit 200,027 players on Steam, the highest the count has risen since April 14, 2025, and the release of season two.  Every time a major update drops in Marvel Rivals, it’s accompanied by a small increase in player traffic, but nothing moved the ticker up quite like Deadpool has.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The sixth season of content in Marvel Rivals is more than just Deadpool, of course, including new controller settings, an improved photo mode, enhanced hero ‘Proficiency’, and a stack of new bundles in the store. With every new season also comes a fresh battle pass, so more reasons to dive back in and get to the Marvel Rivals grind.</p>



<p>This season brings a new limited-time event, some adjustments to existing modes, a fresh round of Twitch Drops for viewers watching their favorite streamers, and a whole host of fixes and optimizations.</p>



<p>The introduction to this season’s patch notes was ‘written by’ Deadpool himself:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Deadpool here, hijacking the patch notes because, let’s face it, nobody reads these unless you need to know if your main got nerfed. Then you whine that there are no balance updates here, and some random internet person tells you what you really want is the Balance Post, not the Patch Notes. I see you, internet people! </strong></p>



<p><strong>Well, guess what? Season 6 is almost here! (They took this long to add me!? Who came before, oh Gambit &amp; Rogue… together? #$%&amp; that!) Anyways, I’m here, I’m playable, and I’m ready to make the Collector’s Museum wilder than a taco truck at a biker rally.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are still plenty of adored characters for NetEase to lean on for Marvel Rivals, so the train is far from running out of steam. Deadpool might be the hottest new character yet in Marvel Rivals, but he’s nowhere near the last.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#951)—Clues and Answers for Saturday, January 17]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-17-951/</link>
            <guid>1408972</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The weekend is here, which means it’s time to relax, get some tasks ticked off your to-do list that has inevitably built up over the week, and, most importantly, <strong>complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle</strong>. Fortunately, I can help you with that last point, as I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need, waiting for you below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-17">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 17)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #951:</p>



<ul>
<li>PLASTER</li>



<li>SLING</li>



<li>HIDE</li>



<li>BLANKET</li>



<li>PELT</li>



<li>SINK</li>



<li>RED</li>



<li>COAT</li>



<li>SKIN</li>



<li>COVER</li>



<li>CAST</li>



<li>INKS</li>



<li>SIMON</li>



<li>HURL</li>



<li>KINS</li>



<li>CAPTURE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Things you might lay on top.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Ways to really chuck something.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Same letters, different order</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>How classic playground games begin.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 17:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-17-951">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 17 (#951)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BLANKET, COAT, COVER, PLASTER</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CAST, HURL, PELT, SLING</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – INKS, KINS, SINK, SKIN</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CAPTURE, HIDE, RED, SIMON</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tinder User Spots Nadeshot in Their Feed, But Something Isn’t Right]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tinder-user-nadeshot-feed-not-right/</link>
            <guid>1408966</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, a user uploaded an image to the Tinder subreddit of a recognizable face that popped up in their Tinder feed. They’d scrubbed out the profile name, but the image was clear as day: Matthew ‘Nadeshot’ Haag, former Call of Duty pro player, founder of 100 Thieves, and popular content creator.</p>



<p>The strange thing was, the profile <strong>absolutely wasn’t </strong>representative of the man himself. It was for a 28-year-old ‘night shift’ worker who is ‘overbearing and weird’.</p>







<h2 id="h-nadeshot-probably-doesn-t-use-tinder">Nadeshot Probably Doesn’t Use Tinder</h2>



<p>Being happily married and a father, the chances are that Nadeshot <strong>doesn’t </strong>use Tinder, but that doesn’t stop people from apparently impersonating him.</p>



<p>In a recent image shared on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/1qdyalf/umm_im_speechless/">the user ‘AlyFromCali’</a> revealed Nadeshot on the app in his ‘gun-to-the-head’ meme pose that <strong>many of us </strong>will already recognize.</p>



<p>The bio is cut off in the image, but we can see some of it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s be honest! Do people really read bios on tinder? Big on mutual obsession, I’m pretty overbearing and weird :3. So don’t say I didn’t warn…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s a doozy of an intro.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The 28-year-old likely used the image of Nadeshot a) to grab attention, and b) because it sums up their vibe perfectly. The profile holder’s job title reads ‘night shift at labor thief’, so something is bubbling there to suggest not everything is hunky-dory in this person’s life.</p>



<p>Hence, the image of Nadeshot holding a gun to his head.</p>



<p>The user uploaded the image to Reddit because <strong>that </strong>was enough to creep them out – they didn’t even know it was Nadeshot. In the comments, they wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I did notice he didn’t quite look the same in the rest of his pictures, but wtf.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s strange is that the image was the first one used on the profile, which means it’s the initial impression anyone gets of that person’s account. It also suggests that Tinder’s verification processes are potentially lax, as this could be seen as a catfishing attempt by some.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceiling-glitch-players-doing-glitches/</link>
            <guid>1408963</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a stellar extraction adventure title, but it’s not without some clear issues. Over the festive window, concerns started rising regarding cheaters, which went largely unaddressed until Embark Studios returned to the office as 2026 kicked off. Patches were pushed out, things improved, but certain problems remained.</p>



<p>One of the biggest problems is the ‘ceiling glitch’ mechanic that exists in the game, allowing users to manipulate their way above the map in certain areas and shoot down on unsuspecting players. In a recent clip online, it was shown how some users are fighting fire with fire.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-do-ceiling-glitches-in-arc-raiders">Don’t Do Ceiling Glitches in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>In a clip uploaded to social media by ‘aimkey’, we see a trio of players hightail it into the rafters of Stella Montis to exact revenge on… a trio of players in the rafters of Stella Montis.</p>



<p>It’s a weird game of cat and mouse that shows the ultimate punishment for those abusing an exploit that others are being banned for. Tired of people abusing the exploit, aimkey and his comrades glitch into the ceiling and chase down malicious players trying to use the glitch to <strong>take them out</strong>.</p>



<p>Is it right? Well, it’s two wrongs, and we know what the adage says about that.</p>



<p>It’s like the situation that surfaced a couple of years ago in Escape from Tarkov. One YouTuber purchased and used cheats in Escape from Tarkov, Battlestate Games’ popular extraction shooter, to determine <strong>who else was cheating</strong>. He stressed that he didn’t use the cheats to get an advantage over other users, but for research for his deep-dive video into the state of play.</p>



<p>It was a success, in some ways. He was able to semi-accurately see that cheaters were <strong>absolutely everywhere</strong>.</p>



<p>The ARC Raiders ceiling glitch situation isn’t as severe as <strong>that problem</strong>, but it is irritating, and as aimkey says, it’s ‘super easy to do.’</p>



<p>In the comments section under the clip, viewers were supportive of aimkey’s efforts:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘We got anti-exploiters before anti-cheat.’</li>



<li>‘Y’all just went up there and hunted them down? That’s great.’</li>



<li>‘We need more people to kill those guys who are spamming this glitch btw’</li>
</ul>



<p>Unfortunately, these kinds of issues have existed in multiplayer games since multiplayer games have existed. Back in the day, we’d use out-of-map exploits in games like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. There are some iconic spots, such as the hillside glitch on Overgrown, that are still memorable to this day.</p>

<p>In December, The Game Awards ended the 2025 showcase with a reveal of Highguard, an all-new first-person shooter. It prompted a wave of disappointment from gamers eager to see which title would land the prestigious finale spot in one of the most-watched gaming events ever made.</p>



<p>Highguard emerged, with the developers at Wildlight uncovering a confusing, overdone first-person arena shooter, and viewers went nuts, wondering why they’d paid so much to secure the drastically expensive slot. It turns out that Wildlight didn’t pay for that spot in The Game Awards at all.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-a-million-dollars-saved">Half a Million Dollars Saved</h2>



<p>In recent years, the cost of acquiring space to run a trailer during The Game Awards has skyrocketed, with the longest slots now having around a half a million dollar price tag.</p>



<p>When Highguard, a brand-new game with no marketing beat before (or since) surfaced in the final spot, viewers were dismayed. There were expectations of something impressive appearing, but Highguard came on screen as a hard-to-pin shooter that looked like many other games we’d already seen emerge (and often fail) in recent years.</p>



<p>It was quickly judged as bizarre, because there was <strong>no way </strong>this all-new studio would stump up the half a million required to land that final spot, right?</p>



<p>In a new post <a href="https://xcancel.com/PaulTassi/status/2012258185495650308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a> by Forbes’ Paul Tassi, it was stated that the developers at Wildlight Entertainment <strong>did not pay </strong>for that spot:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Have learned that Highguard did not actually pay for that Game Awards finale spot. Was just the show putting it there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments, Tassi’s followers surmised that Geoff Keighley, the host of The Game Awards, was so enamoured by Highguard that he offered the team the final spot. That rings true, given Keighley’s hype for the game in the closing minutes of the show.</p>



<p>However, many were quick to point out that, if anything, the reveal did the game more harm than good. There’s now an emotional angle stifling the game’s anticipation, with folks everywhere wishing something else had popped up at the end of The Game Awards.</p>







<p>Do you think Highguard is going to exceed (low) expectations and surprise everyone when it launches in just nine days? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The team behind Helldivers 2 planned to launch a new Warbond, Redacted Regiment, on January 20. However, Arrowhead Game Studios has indefinitely delayed the release after discovering an issue during final testing that failed to meet the studio’s quality standards.</p>



<p>The upcoming premium Warbond plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-warbond-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduce two new weapons</a> for players to use, as well as new Stratagems and cosmetics.</p>







<h2 id="h-arrowhead-game-studios-first-informed-the-helldivers-discord">Arrowhead Game Studios First Informed the Helldivers Discord</h2>



<p>While Arrowhead Game Studios did not specify exactly what went wrong during testing, they informed their Discord server that they would ensure the content was properly ready before releasing it to the public.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Greetings, Helldivers.</p>



<p>During final testing for the Warbond, we found a key issue that didn’t meet our standards for a release. We’re taking some extra time to get it fixed, so the Redacted Regiment Warbond is going to be delayed.</p>



<p>We’re sorry for the change in plans, but we want to make sure the update is actually ready for you before it goes live. Thanks for the patience.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Back in December, the studio confirmed that new Killzone-themed gear was headed to Helldivers 2 as a Premium Warbond. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-returns-as-a-legendary-warbond/">here</a>. In other news related to Helldivers, the team behind ARC Raiders revealed that they scrapped plans to make that game free to play because of Helldivers.

<p>The next Assassin’s Creed game has secured its Lead Scriptwriter, and it’s someone with a history of working on the franchise.</p>



<p>Christopher Grilli, someone with a history as the Scriptwriter for Assassin’s Creed Origins and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, and the lead writer for Assassin’s Creed Mirage, recently revealed on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christophergrilli_im-thrilled-to-share-that-im-starting-a-activity-7417934734485413889-FrRL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAGBVXOMBvz_qCqVv-uRJAvpCCT5UFNbGSog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> profile that he has signed on to be the Scriptwriter for the next game in the long-running franchise, code-named Hexe.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m thrilled to share that I’m starting a new position at Ubisoft Montreal as a Lead Scriptwriter on Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe. Incredibly grateful to be a part of this team and project,” he shared on January 16.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming reported</a> that the game was in a relatively early stage of development and was expected to be released this year. It’s also believed this will be a more linear experience than other games in the franchise, and that the series will feature a female protagonist named Elsa with supernatural abilities.</p>



<p>The game takes place in 16th-century Central Europe during the Holy Roman Empire, and reports indicate developers plan to implement a fear system inspired by the Jack the Ripper DLC from Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>With the Lead Scriptwriter only now coming on board, it’s fair to suggest that the game is still a ways from release, but with someone with such experience on the team, it appears to be heading in the right direction.
