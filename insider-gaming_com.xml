<p>Following the immense success of the live-action Fallout television series, thanks to Amazon Prime, it was only a matter of time before the series’ second season started attracting more high-profile names. Of course, season one ended on a cliffhanger, so we’re all beyond excited to dive in for more, and now we have a tidbit of information to run with. According to a recent report, Macaulay Culkin joins the cast of Fallout season two, apparently playing a ‘crazy genius-type’ character. I’m a little curious about the role, and something in me thinks his part involves the Enclave.</p>



<p>In the original report published by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/macaulay-culkin-cast-fallout-season-2-1236170530/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Macaulay Culkin’s role in the television series based on the long-popular role-playing game franchise remains relatively new. The only information we have about his performance is that he’s a crazy genius of some sort.</p>



<p>That said, Culkin joins a large and growing roster of exceptional stars, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ella Purnell</li>



<li>Walton Goggins</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-plays-knight-titus-in-the-fallout-tv-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Moten</a></li>



<li>Kyle MacLachlan</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-xelia-mendes-jones-in-fallout-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xelia Mendes-Jones</a></li>
</ul>







<p>Following the overwhelming reception to the first season, which debuted as one of Prime Video’s Top 3 most-watched series and received 16 Emmy nominations, a second season was almost immediately greenlit for production. While it’s still a ways off, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallouts-second-season-starts-filming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filming begins shortly</a>.</p>
