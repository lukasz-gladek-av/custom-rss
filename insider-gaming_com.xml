<p>Raven Software was forced to step in on April 7 with a new Warzone update in Verdansk after two weapon attachments became overpowered and the number of Buy Stations in trios was incorrect. </p>



<p>It’s not unusual for Warzone updates to accidentally introduce new issues, but Season 3 avoided glaring setbacks. Despite some complaints about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> being too powerful and not having enough armor plates on the map, players have enjoyed having iconic weapons like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-kilo-141-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/#:~:text=The%20Kilo%20141%20is%20a,to%20complete%20your%20Warzone%20loadout." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kilo 141</a> back in the game. </p>



<p>In addition, Season 3’s weapon balancing changes created a healthy variety of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/author/andrewhighton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meta weapon </a><span><a href="http://-/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">options</a></span> for short or long-range engagements. In saying that, two attachments disrupted that harmony.</p>

<h3 id="h-snakeshot-ammunition-and-thermal-6x-scope-removed">Snakeshot Ammunition and Thermal 6x Scope Removed </h3>



<p><strong>.500 Snakeshot Ammunition</strong> is an attachment for the <strong>Basilisk</strong> pistol that transforms the weapon into a shotgun in close-range engagements. Over the years, there have been several instances of the attachment becoming too powerful in Warzone, and it happened again in Season 3. </p>



<p>With the ammunition type equipped with the <strong>Akimbo</strong> attachment, the pistols consistently<strong> two-shot killed enemies</strong> up close, much faster than every other short-range meta weapon. </p>



<p>This update temporarily restricts the attachment. Meanwhile, the <strong>Thermal 6x Scope</strong> has also been temporarily removed because the scope didn’t have any glint. This was a massive issue because scope glint helps warn players that an enemy is looking at them. </p>



<h3 id="h-buy-station-change">Buy Station Change </h3>



<p>Raven Software <strong>reduced the amount of Buy Stations</strong> to Trios to better reflect the larger squad sizes. Usually, the map scales the number of available Buy Stations based on the squad size of a lobby because larger teams don’t need as many Buy Stations. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025.1157583/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The HDR was an unbelievable lobby-wrecking beast back in the day. In 2025, the HDR Sniper Rifle is as good as ever in Warzone’s Verdansk map, and if you want to run it, the best HDR Meta Loadout is the perfect way to eye up some prey.</p>



<p>Activision put the FPS world on notice when it boldly declared the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-verdansk-is-back-calling-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a>. The classic battle royale map has landed with flying colours and comes with a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Mode</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-monolithic-suppressor-attachment-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motholithic Suppressor</a>, and iconic guns like the AMAX.</p>



<p>One of the most eye-catching additions has to be the HDR Sniper Rifle. The long-range legend is back and hits like a tank. So we’ve whipped up the best HDR Meta Loadout for Warzone’s Verdansk map.</p>







<figure><figcaption>One shot, one kill. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best HDR Loadout needs the right Attachments in Warzone. This is why we’ve gone for tried and trusted parts that are either Meta, or we think should be.</p>



<p>Here’s every Attachment we recommend for the HDR Sniper Rifle:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong>&nbsp;Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong>&nbsp;Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong>&nbsp;Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong>&nbsp;108MM Suppressed</li>
</ul>



<p>I’ve already harped on about the <strong>Monolithic Suppressor</strong>, but it’s a must-own Attachment. It was used in pretty much every OG <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/warzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone</a> loadout at one point, and we’re slapping it on the HDR to quieten the gun’s deafening shots. The <strong>Gain-Twist Barrel</strong> is perfect as it greatly reduces Bullet Velocity, making bullets fly straighter and truer.</p>



<p>We’re going for the <strong>Combat Stock</strong> as it reduces Flinch Resistance. This means if you’re taking shots from someone and they land, your aim is more resolute, and you have more control to get away a potentially devastating shot with more accuracy.</p>



<p>The <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> speeds up ADS time—getting your mighty weapon to your eye faster. Finally, the <strong>108MM Suppressed</strong> Fire Mod has excellent Bullet Penetration. If your target is behind a solid surface, the Fire Mod increases its ability to go through surfaces, and is perfect for chewing through vehicles—maybe to one-shot the driver or pilot?</p>







<p>We’re pairing the HDR with the AMAX as it’s too good a combination to pass up. This is a deadly duo in CoD Warzone at present, and you need to try it out:</p>



<p>Check out the best AMAX Attachments in Warzone’s Verdansk era:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong>&nbsp;Otero Red Dot</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong>&nbsp;Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong>&nbsp;Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong>&nbsp;Extended Mag II</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Otero Red Dot</strong> Optic is a completely subjective pick for a sight. You might not even need a sight for your AMAX. Me, I like a visual aid, and the Otero Red Dot is the perfect remedy.</p>



<p>Again, very little needs to be said about the <strong>Monolithic Suppressor</strong>—it’s a silent and stealthy cheat code. The <strong>Gain-Twist Barrel</strong> is a Meta Barrel, and the reduced bullet velocity turns shots into lasers. The <strong>Vertical Foregrip</strong> is an immense Attachment that gets the recoil under control, whereas the <strong>Extended Mag II</strong> gives us much-needed leeway if we’re doing a little too much spraying and praying.</p>







<p><strong>The perfect selection of Perks for our HDR Warzone Loadout is Veteran, Quick Fix, and Alertness.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick list showing our selections:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Veteran</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Quick Fix</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Alertness</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Veteran </strong>improves Flinch Resistance and Hold Breath duration. When your main weapon is a Sniper Rifle, you want both of these skills.</p>



<p><strong>Quick Fix</strong>&nbsp;is a Meta pick across the board due to its health regeneration qualities. Not everything is going to go swimmingly when you’re running around with a hefty HDR, and times will come when you need a…well, you get the idea!</p>



<p>I’m giving the third Perk slot to <strong>Alertness</strong>. Whereas Ghost is another solid option, you’re a lot more static with a Sniper Rifle as your primary weapon. This Perk lets you know if you’re being watched by an enemy, and might give you the time you need to un-ADS.</p>







<p><strong>Overkill is an easy Wildcard to pick, so we can have the AMAX by our side as a secondary.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a double-edged sword for Warzone’s Wildcards: Do you go Overkill and take the extra weapon? Or Gunfighter for more Attachments? I think <strong>another main weapon as your secondary is always going to take priority</strong>. So Overkill it is!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-hdr-in-black-ops-6-amp-warzone">How to Unlock HDR in Black Ops 6 &amp; Warzone</h2>



<p><strong>You unlock the HDR Sniper Rifle as a Season 3 Battle Reward for Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</strong></p>

The main thing to note is that it’s quite easy and shouldn’t take you long to acquire and start leveling it up.</p>
