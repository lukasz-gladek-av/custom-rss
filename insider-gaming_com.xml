<p>After years of speculation, all signs point to The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake coming soon, so here is everything you need to know about the leaked announcement and release period. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-release-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda</a> and 2K Games partnered to create <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/virtuos-unannounced-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion</a>, which was released in 2006. The fourth installment in the series is often considered one of the greatest games ever made. In saying that, it is almost overshadowed by its successor, The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim, which is one of the best-selling games of all time and went on to receive several remasters. </p>



<p>As fans wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-6-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, Bethesda reportedly has plans to remind fans just how special the fourth game in the series is. </p>

<p><strong>No, The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion hasn’t officially been confirmed by Bethesda.</strong> </p>



<p>Rumors originated in 2022 when a remake or remaster of Oblivion first popped up during the FTC investigation into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The game was expected to be released during the 2022 fiscal year. </p>



<p>When that date passed, the project resurfaced again in December 2024, as rumors <span>suggested</span> Virtuos was developing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake on Unreal Engine 5</a>, which was further believed to be included in January’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Direct</a>, which came and went without an announcement. </p>



<p>No official announcement hasn’t stopped rumors from intensifying. </p>







<p><strong>No, The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion has no official release date</strong>.</p>



<p>However, Giant Bomb’s <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ifsfg5XFuRI&amp;t=14s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb</a> revealed, “I have been told it’s going to shadow drop at any moment this month.”  </p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with the term, a shadow drop is immediately releasing a game without any previous announcement or confirmed release date. </p>



<p>Shadow-dropping a game of this magnitude would be a surprise. Still, it isn’t something Bethesda hasn’t done before: Bethesda’s former studio, Tango Gameworks, shadow-dropped Hi-Fi Rush in January 20203. </p>



<p>The marketing strategy ultimately failed, as Grubb claimed in April 2023 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-microsoft-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a> “didn’t make the money it needed to make.” </p>



<p>Despite the game receiving positive reviews, the lack of marketing might have resulted in lackluster sales, and Tango Gameworks was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-microsoft-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to shut down</a> in May 20024. </p>



<p>That reportedly hasn’t scared Bethesda from trying the shadow drop strategy again. </p>







<p><strong>Bethesda has a proven track record of producing successful remasters, so fans should feel confident with The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake. </strong></p>



<p>In 2016, The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim Special Edition contained all three DLC add-ons with a graphical upgrade. In 2017, Bethesda brought Skyrim to VR with a new title and released an Anniversary Edition of the beloved game in 2021 with additional Creation Club content. </p>



<p>Based on that, fans should expect The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake to include the Knights of the Nine&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shivering Isles expansions and a much-needed visual overhaul. </p>



<hr>



<p>The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion isn’t the only remake reportedly coming soon. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-complete-ps-store-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last of Us Complete Edition</a> is now available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-animated-playstation-backgrounds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-seemingly-teased-by-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 9 remake</a> was recently teased. </p>
