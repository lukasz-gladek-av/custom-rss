<p>Jake Paul is joining the Undisputed boxing roster. Developer Steel City Interactive announced on Thursday that Paul will be joining the game as part of The Problem Child DLC pack on December 12.</p>



<p>“Jake’s influence on modern boxing is undeniable. His meteoric rise has introduced a whole new generation to the sport, especially those who have followed him from a YouTube phenomenon to a legitimate boxing contender,” Founder and CEO of Steel City Interactive Ash Habib said via release.</p>







<p>“I’ve been breaking barriers and making history in real life, so it’s only fitting that I bring the same energy to Undisputed. This isn’t just about being in a video game; it’s about inspiring a new generation of fans to step into the ring—virtually and in real life,” Paul said.</p>



<p>To get Paul into Undisputed, the developers at Steel City Interactive did full motion capture at their UK-based studio. </p>



<p>“The Steel City team nailed every detail, from my moves to my swag, and I can’t wait for players to test their skills,” Paul said.</p>



<p>In addition to Paul, The Problem Child DLC pack will feature six more fighters, including: Zhilei Zhang, James ‘Buster’ Douglas, Otto Wallin, Erik Morales, Marco Antonio Barrera, &amp; Juan Manuel Marquez.</p>



<p>As of writing, no price for the DLC pack has been announced. As far as future additions go, Insider Gaming has heard of a few names the studio has had talks with that were either close to a deal or have signed a deal that hasn’t been announced yet. Paul was one of those names, and there are others that, while can’t be said yet, are pretty obvious fighters to be added in future DLC.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is just an Overwatch clone. That’s what former Blizzard President Mike Ybarra seemed to suggest in a post on social media on Wednesday (December 4).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1864450732054675950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his post</a>, Ybarra called the game “Overwatch Marvel Rivals” while making comparisons to a recently announced game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looks similar to Horizon Zero Dawn</a>.</p>



<p>“Looks like Overwatch Marvel Rivals ships tomorrow,” Ybarra said. “Much like Light of Motiram (a clear copy of HZD) out of China. I mean even the character name – Widowmaker in OW vs. Black Widow in Marvel Rivals lol. NetEase/TenCent – all the same.”</p>







<p>Of course, one part of his comment that stood out was comparing Overwatch’s Widowmaker to Marvel’s Black Widow. It’s unclear to tell through text whether that was a legitimate criticism, but users on Twitter were quick to use the community note feature on the post.</p>



<p>Black Widow, for those that don’t know, first debuted in 1964. That puts the character 52 years older than Widowmaker. Again, however, it’s hard to tell if that comparison was serious or made in jest. That said, he has made other posts in relation to the game without addressing the comparison.</p>

<p>NZXT has released a lengthy response to claims that its Flex gaming PC subscription <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-scam-allegations-gamers-nexus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">service is a scam</a>. After an hour-long video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamers Nexus</a> dove into what it called a “predatory computer scam” from NZXT, the company not only posted a video with statements from its CEO Johnny Hou, but also listed out some of the actions they state will be taken.</p>



<p>“NZXT takes feedback seriously and, ultimately, wouldn’t be here if we didn’t listen to our community,” he said. “A lot of the issues are very serious, and it’s really important to us that we address each and every one of them.”</p>



<p>Regarding price increases after a subscription is started, Hou said that the “only instance” it’s happened is when they were required by certain states to start charging state taxes. </p>



<p>Hou then went on to talk about claims and “misconceptions” around changes to the hardware specs.</p>



<p>“You have to first understand that the Flex program doesn’t give you fixed specs,” he said. “We it comes to the availability of PC parts, it’s hard for us to control when Nvidia or Intel or AMD decide they’re going to need all the parts, so sometimes we don’t have more supply coming in. So, in the midst of that, we actually have to change the specs of our PCs.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>He then reaffirmed that you have to be at least 18 years old to sign up for the service. However, he didn’t address the claims that orders were being pushed through without proper identity verification. </p>



<p>As far as actions go, NZXT says that it will be pulling all “influencer-led” Flex advertising after statements were made within the adds that the company found to “not accurately reflect the details” of the program. They will also be updating the names of products offered through the Flex service in order to provide “a very clear distinction” between what is being bought versus what is part of the subscription.</p>



<p>After those two actions were announced, the <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company listed details</a> about what the Flex subscription program is and is not. You can read that via the company’s website.</p>



<h2 id="h-gamers-nexus-response">Gamers Nexus’ Response</h2>



<p>Not long after the response from NZXT, Gamers Nexus — the original source of the uncovering — made its own statement on what NZXT said. </p>



<p>“NZXT has posted a statement which not only misrepresents facts, but distorts the reality of their predatory rental computer program,” Gamers Nexus Editor-in-Chief Stephen Burke wrote. “The statement ignores major points and introduces several new concerns. GamersNexus has become aware of deeper elements connected to this story that GN has begun independently investigating.”</p>

<p>Delta Force, a highly-anticipated shooter reminiscent of Battlefield is out <strong>today</strong>. It was pieced together by Team Jade, a branch of TiMi Studio Group, the company that built the most popular COD game of all time – Call of Duty Mobile. For now, it’s a multiplayer-only offering, but Team Jade has confirmed when the game’s single-player campaign will be released.</p>



<p>There isn’t all that long to wait – the single-player portion of Delta Force will be available in January 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-hawk-down">Black Hawk Down</h2>



<p>Delta Force, which started life <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-name-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Delta Force: Hawk Ops</a> before the name came under scrutiny, is available today in open beta on PC.</p>



<p>In earlier testing periods, Delta Force presented an enjoyable and authentic large-scale combat experience that felt diverse and satisfying. Many have dubbed it ‘the better version of Battlefield 2042’, and it has plenty to offer users as it transitions into this open beta period.</p>



<p>Most players will be diving into the ‘Warfare’ mode, a 32 v 32 PvP mode bursting at the seams with military might. Users will be invited to explore land and air vehicles and go boots-on-the-ground with a dense arsenal of weapons across a series of maps.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, there is the ‘Operations’ portion of the game. This is a cooperative mode that pits three players against AI-controlled enemies as they explore developing objectives across a variety of environments.</p>



<p>Team Jade confirmed that in January, the game’s <strong>single-player </strong>component, a story based on the real-world events of ‘Black Hawk Down’, will be released on all platforms. That’ll arrive shortly after the game, which is designed to be crossplay across multiple platforms, is released on the iOS Store and Google Play, opening up two new, huge markets.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the ‘Black Hawk Down’ portion of Delta Force? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
