<p>Marvel Rivals Season 2 is set to launch on April 11th, bringing a plethora of new changes to the wildly popular multiplayer title. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-promises-a-new-hero-each-month-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seasons will be shortened down from three months to two months starting with Season 3</a>, but there will still be plenty of new content to explore over the next few months.</p>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown of the changes coming to Marvel Rivals in Season 2, including the new heroes, new features, and gameplay changes.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-heroes-emma-frost-and-ultron">New Heroes: Emma Frost and Ultron</h2>



<p>When Season 2 launches, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-confirms-emma-frost-and-ultron/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emma Frost will join the roster of heroes</a> in the Vanguard role. Emma Frost will be able to “adeptly utilize her telepathic and diamond abilities” while “standing at the fore front to shield her allies and obliterate her foes.”</p>



<p>Ultron will join a month and a half after the launch of Season 2, during the Season 2.5 update. Details about Ultron have not been released yet, but he will most likely join the roster as either a Vanguard or Duelist.</p>



<h2 id="h-costume-colors-and-costume-sharing">Costume Colors and Costume Sharing</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>New color options for some of the “more popular costumes” are being added in Season 2. Psylocke’s Vengeance costume and Luna Snow’s Mirae 2099 costume are just two examples of costumes that will have new color options. </p>



<p>A new feature that allows players to gift costumes and bundles to their friends is also going live with Season 2. When at the checkout screen for a costume bundle, players can select the “Gift” option instead of buying it for themselves. It appears that players will be limited to sending only five gifts a day.</p>



<h2 id="h-team-up-ability-and-hero-balance-changes">Team-Up Ability and Hero Balance Changes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>For the first time since the game’s release, Team-Up Abilities are being either altered or removed. Since Marvel Rivals launched, Team-Up Abilities have only been added to compliment new hero arrivals. Here are the changes coming to Team-Up Abilities in Season 2:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>New</strong>: Emma Frost can team up with Psylocke and/or Magneto to form Mental Projection. Emma creates illusory clones of Psylocke and Magneto.</li>



<li><strong>New:</strong> Doctor Strange can share his arcane magic with Scarlet Witch to form Arcane Order, which transforms her right-click into a rapid-fire, long-range projectile that doesn’t consume energy.</li>



<li><strong>New: </strong>Captain America and Winter Soldier (finally) can team up with Stars Aligned. Winter Soldier can pounce forward and deal a shockwave pulse. He and Captain can pounce together to cause more damage and debuff nearby enemies.</li>



<li>Metallic Chaos (Scarlet Witch and Magneto) has been removed.</li>



<li>Voltaic Union (Storm, Captain America, and Thor) has been removed.</li>



<li>Psylocke has been removed from Dimensional Shortcut (Black Panther and Magik).</li>



<li>Winter Soldier has been removed from Ammo Overload (The Punisher and Rocket Raccoon).</li>



<li>Namor has been removed from Chilling Charisma (Luna Snow and Jeff).</li>



<li>Doctor Strange has been replaced with Namor in Gamma Charge (Iron Man and Hulk).</li>
</ul>



<p>Without giving specific details yet, the Marvel Rivals team also provided some information on who’s getting buffed or nerf in the next balance update. Here are the changes players can expect to hero balance in Season 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Peni Parker, Scarlet Witch, Mister Fantastic, Black Widow, Rocket Raccoon, Jeff the Land Shark, Captain America, Winter Soldier, Moon Knight will receive buffs, either via increases to their power or through Team-Up Abilities.</li>



<li>Doctor Strange will get a nerf to his offensive power, but a buff to his survivability (health).</li>



<li>Loki and Adam Warlock are getting nerfs to their area-of-effect healing abilities.</li>
</ul>



<p>A deeper dive in the balance changes coming to Season 2 will be coming soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-changes-to-missions-competitive">Changes to Missions, Competitive</h2>



<p>Starting in Season 2, Marvel Rivals will implement weekly missions alongside the existing daily missions and challenges. Players won’t be able to earn more Chrono Tokens, instead those will be rebalanced across all three mission types. </p>



<p>On the Competitive side, some players might be disappointed to learn that ranked players will drop nine divisions at the start of Season 2. For example, a player that ends Season 1.5 at Diamond 1 will start Season 2 at Silver 1. The new map, Hellfire Gala: Krakoa, will enter the competitive pool, while Yggsgard: Royal Palace and Tokyo 2099: Shin-Shibuya will be “retired” from competitive play. </p>



<p>The minimum level requirement for competitive play is being increased from level 10 to level 15. The hero pick and ban system will also be implemented starting at Gold 3. Only duo queueing will be allowed when a team includes players that are Eternity or One Above All. And finally, the rank rating players receive will now be more weighed by individual performance.</p>



<p>The full Dev Vision video can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thyG51IdChc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, and full patch notes will release closer to the April 11th launch date for Season 2 of Marvel Rivals.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-struggles-to-beat-ps4-performance-in-some-ways.1154661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-struggles-beat-ps4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Digital Foundry has published an in-depth technical review for The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC, which was released earlier today. While it has been regarded as an improvement over the woeful release of The Last of Us Part I on PC, it’s still <strong>not as good as it could be</strong>.</p>



<p>In some aspects, The Last of Us Part II on PC performs worse – or not as well as you’d expect comparatively – than the base PlayStation 4, which was released in 2013. For instance, Digital Foundry found that a GPU with more than three times the compute power of the base PS4 wasn’t able to consistently double the performance of The Last of Us Part II on PlayStation 4.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-the-weeds">In The Weeds</h2>



<p>Digital Foundry’s comprehensive technical review of The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC is pretty insane. It’s fifteen minutes long, and it takes the time to dive into absolutely every aspect of the game, from frame rates and load speeds, and from texture clarity to settings optimisation.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Last of Us Part 2 PC Review - We're Disappointed - Analysis + Optimised Settings" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0IoZxiv1i0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The team mentioned that the game’s usage of GPU resources is ‘a bit inordinate’, comparing the figures between a base PS4 and an RTX 3060 GPU. The PC GPU should be able to walk rings around the PlayStation 4’s tech, but that’s not what’s happening with this game, as DF explains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We should be looking at a GPU that is around 3.5 times <strong>more </strong>performant in compute, even at a non-boosted clock. Yet the RTX 3060 cannot fully double the PS4’s performance in this game at the closest equivalent settings.</p>



<p>This is a very large outlier in our history of examining PC ports.</p>



<p>Whether or not that’s justified is up to the jury, but that means you as a user will have to adjust your expectations accordingly. You really don’t want to drop below those PS4 settings, as I see it, as you’re getting a visual experience worse than a 12-year-old console at that point.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>DF also revealed that stuttering and framerate drops were fairly common, and at one point, they reveal that the game would lock up without any prior warning before leaping back into life a few seconds later. They also detected issues with shadows popping in at odd times – even on maxed-out settings. </p>



<p>These issues weren’t present on the PS4 Pro backwards-compatible version of the game on PS5.</p>

<p>More details and news about Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon could be coming sooner rather than later. </p>



<p>On Thursday afternoon, the official Marathon Twitter <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907840558544072722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account posted</a> a “glitching” teaser video while updating its header image. Not long after that, the official PlayStation account also updated its header image to something Marathon related. </p>



<p>Other aspects of the game’s online presence such as its Steam page, Facebook, and YouTube were also updated. Lastly, a MIDA profile had been created on Twitter as well.</p>







<p>That has led to plenty of speculation that fans are only days away from getting more information of the relatively unknown reboot of the classic Bungie franchise.</p>



<p>To add fuel to the fire, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Grubb reported</a> back in February that Marathon wasn’t a part of that month’s PlayStation State of Play because PlayStation was planning a standalone event for the game. At the time, he said that April was the target for such a showing.</p>







<p>“I think April [is] when we probably hear from them about Marathon,” he said. “And it would be its own thing separate from a State of Play.”</p>



<p>As of publishing, neither PlayStation nor Bungie have officially confirmed anything regarding when more Marathon news will be announced. Based on the teases, however, it should be only a matter of time.</p>



<p>When do you think Bungie will give the next look at Marathon? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>Call of Duty Warzone is back at the top of the streaming charts as Verdansk comes storming into the game once again. In 2021, Verdansk was removed rather unceremoniously from Warzone, being replaced with Caldera – a decision that many fans were disappointed with.</p>



<p>Even if it’s a flash in the pan, the return of Verdansk has proven the power of nostalgia – at the time of writing, more than 336,000 people were watching Call of Duty Warzone on Twitch. The last time the game had numbers that high was in <strong>November 2022</strong> when Warzone 2.0 was released.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-up-the-charts">Up the Charts</h2>



<p>Warzone is currently the most popular game on Twitch, which is a position it hasn’t occupied for many years. It was in 2022 that the previous peak was set, as 615,000 people tuned in to see what was new in Warzone 2.0, the release that came with Modern Warfare II.</p>



<p>Presently, more than 336,000 <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/512710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">are watching Warzone on Twitch</a> – and the number is growing. Before this, Warzone had struggled to push beyond the 280,000 mark, even during groundbreaking events and new map releases.</p>



<p>As I write this, 11,000 channels are streaming Warzone gameplay, which is <strong>almost </strong>hitting that November 2022 peak. It seems everyone wants a piece of the Verdansk pie on streaming platforms – and this is before we even start talking about YouTube. On <strong>that </strong>platform, streamers like TimTheTatman are currently broadcasting to as many as 40,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that, all in all, across the suite of streaming platforms, a good 500,000 – 750,000 people are watching Warzone gameplay in some way, shape, or form.</p>



<p>Many doubted that Verdansk would herald a return to form for Warzone, but if streaming figures are anything to go by, it’s looking <strong>very </strong>good for the battle royale title.</p>



<p>Are you playing in Verdansk? Let me know what you think of the map’s return on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that people are just a little bit excited for the start of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 and the return of Verdansk in Warzone. After just the first few hours since the start of the season, player count for Call of Duty on Steam has risen over 200%.</p>



<p>As of writing, Call of Duty currently sits with 111,377 players <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/#3m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>. That represents a 207.8% increase from its numbers prior to the start of the season. It also marks the first time Call of Duty has been over 100,000 concurrent players on Steam since early February when 102,000 players were on at once on February 2.</p>







<p>While not the be all, end all for numbers, Steam’s player counts are often a solid indication of the performance for a game. With numbers rising as high as they have on the platform, it could be safe to assumed that early numbers on console are just as strong, if not stronger.</p>



<p>The question then becomes whether these numbers will continue, or if players will tune out again after seeing what the return of Verdansk has to offer. Either way, the game has a ways to go to match the 160,000+ average player count it saw in its first month after release. Since then, the average count has dropped by double digits each month as of the end of March.</p>



<p>Do you think Call of Duty’s player count will stay elevated with Season 3? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1812/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is a more powerful console than the Nintendo Switch, but, according to Nvidia, it’ll feature ten times the graphics power of the original.</p>



<p>In a post on its website going over Nintendo’s latest console, Nvidia discussed DLSS and 4K gaming coming to a Nintendo platform for the first time. The post goes over how Tensor Cores will help improve “AI-powered graphics” while adding that RT Cores will “enhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections.” Nvidia also says that variable refresh rate and G-Sync for the console’s screen result in “ultra-smooth, tear-free gameplay.”</p>



<p>These features, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company says</a>, will give the new system “10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch”, providing “smoother gameplay and sharper visuals.”</p>







<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-features-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features a 1080 LCD screen</a> that supports up to 120 frames per second (FPS) and HDR in handheld mode. When docked, the system supports 4K output at 60 FPS. One game that doesn’t seem to have 60 FPS on the system, however, is CyberPunk 2077 as CD Projekt Red’s RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-on-nintendo-switch-2-runs-at-40-fps-costs-70/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runs at 40 FPS</a> when docked.</p>
