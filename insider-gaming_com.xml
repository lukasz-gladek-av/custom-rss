<p>Next month, The Game Awards celebrates its tenth anniversary as the leading award show in the gaming space. It’s the premier presentation for gamers worldwide, with awards being dished out, new games being teased, and updates being revealed. This year’s event, which will take place on December 12, is set to be a monumental showcase.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the event, The Game Awards has posted an email revealing to fans that it’s trying to secure registration with the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office, legitimising the brand. It has called on those same fans to bolster the application and help secure the trademark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-distinctive-association">Distinctive Association</h2>



<p>In an email circulated amongst fans, The Game Awards’ team explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are just 1 month away from The Game Awards and our 10th anniversary. </p>



<p>As a fan who joined us for one of our Zoom sessions during the pandemic, we are reaching out with a quick request. </p>



<p>We are currently in the midst of registering “The Game Awards” as a mark with the US Patent &amp; Trademark office. We are looking for letters of support to establish that consumers (that’s you!) distinctively associate the term “The Game Awards” with our annual awards show.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email then requested any ‘personal reflections’ that fans might have, all of which will be added to the application when it’s submitted in the coming weeks. If successful, the patent will recognise The Game Awards with a trademark, representing the legitimacy of the event and the high standard to which it’s now held by gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>Upon opening the link in the email, users are presented with a pre-written letter regarding them as a ‘video game enthusiast and an avid viewer of The Game Awards’. By signing the letter, you confirm to the best of your ability that The Game Awards is a ‘well-known trademark’ associated with the showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley – and Ola Balola LLC.</p>



<p>What do you think? Do you associate the term ‘The Game Awards’ with <strong>nothing but </strong>the annual showcase hosted by Geoff?</p>
