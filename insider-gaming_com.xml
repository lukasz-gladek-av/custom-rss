<p>The MindsEye project began as part of the universe of Everywhere, a massive and experimental game developed by Build A Rocket Boy. However, due to its ambition, it became an independent title, focused on an engaging narrative experience with a lot of action elements. Check out the gameplay trailer below:</p>

<p>The game synopsis says the following:</p>



<p>“Introducing Jacob Diaz, a former soldier fitted with The MindsEye, a mysterious neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Fight to uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unchecked military power shape every encounter. Jacob isn’t the only one searching for answers, forces working in the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined. Get ready for intense combat – on foot, behind the wheel, and in the air – where every decision can mean the difference between survival and defeat.”</p>
