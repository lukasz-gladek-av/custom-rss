<p>Warzone is set to get a huge overhaul with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a>, as the battle royale takes on Omnimovement, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/area-99-revealed-as-new-resurgence-map-in-warzone-at-codnext-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Area 99</a>, and a fresh set of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guns</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering when the Warzone x <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> Season 1 update is arriving, here are all the details you need.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-warzone-black-ops-6-season-1-release-date">Warzone Black Ops 6 Season 1 release date</h2>



<p>Warzone’s first season under Black Ops 6 will begin on <strong>November 14 at around 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Prestige" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">downloadable update</a> brings a plethora of new content to the battle royale as well as Black Ops 6. Warzone Season 1 will include some huge gameplay, UI, and weapon changes too, as the devs aim to bring the battle royale more in line with BO6.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that it will also bring the brand-new Black Ops 6 Season 1 Battle Pass, which is filled with new weapons, Operators, and other rewards.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-area-99-map-arrives">New Area 99 map arrives</h2>



<p>A <strong>brand-new Resurgence map called Area 99</strong> arrives in Warzone Season 1. Set in the same classified facility as the multiplayer maps <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nuketown-manniquin-easter-egg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown</a> and Warhead, Area 99 is an ode to the iconic map that first arrived in the original Black Ops.</p>



<p>As well as Area 99, both Urzikstan and Rebirth Island will be returning. That said, it will be a slightly older version of Urzikstan, the version without Superstore.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-omnimovement-amp-guns-in-warzone">Black Ops 6 Omnimovement &amp; guns in Warzone</h2>



<p>Both <strong>Omnimovement and Black Ops 6’s arsenal of weapons</strong> will be brought to Warzone in Season 1. This means players will experience the all-new movement system that allows you to sprint, slide, and dive in every direction, as well as a new set of weapons.</p>



<p>The guns, Perks, and Equipment from Black Ops 6 will be implemented into the battle royale too. This brings the grand total of weaponry in Warzone to 177. This includes the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-weapons-black-ops-6-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 new weapons arriving in Black Ops 6 Season 1</a>, such as the Krig C and Saug.</p>



<p>Most of the weapons from previous titles will be unusable since Black Ops 6 weapons will be so dominant, so it’s not like players will be using guns from MW2 or MW3.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-ranked-play-arrives-in-season">Warzone Ranked Play arrives in-season</h2>



<p>The devs also announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ranked-play-coming-to-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Play</a> for Warzone will be <strong>arriving in-season</strong>, which likely means the mid-season update.</p>



<p>It will likely follow a similar format to what has previously been seen in the battle royale and Call of Duty Multiplayer, where players climb Skill Divisions and earn Rank Points by performing well.</p>



<h2 id="h-looting-changes">Looting changes</h2>



<p>Warzone is getting some huge looting changes with the Black Ops 6 integration, as <strong>Backpacks are being removed and the inventory is reverting back to a more classic system</strong>, where there are set slots for your Equipment.</p>



<p><strong>Satchels are also returning</strong>, there will be an Armor Satchel that increases the amount of Armor Plates you can carry, and a Munitions Satchel, which allows you to carry more ammo.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-progression-carries-over-to-warzone">Black Ops 6 progression carries over to Warzone</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-black-ops-6-mastery-camo-in-multiplayer-zombies-warzone-all-camos-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastery Camos system</a> will also make their way into Warzone. Battle royale players will have their <strong>rank reset to their Black Ops 6 level </strong>and will be able to unlock a <strong>new set of Mastery Camos through Warzone</strong>.</p>



<p>Playing and earning XP in Warzone will contribute to your overall level and Prestige progression, allowing you to continue <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-prestige-rewards-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlocking rewards</a> just like in Multiplayer and Zombies.</p>

<p>Hideo Kojima announced that Death Stranding has had 19 million players worldwide, even before the game’s Xbox port was announced.</p>



<p>The news came from Hideo Kojima’s X account (formerly Twitter), where Kojima said that November 8th marks the fifth anniversary of Death Stranding’s release. During the thank you video, Kojima revealed that the game had sold 19 million units to date.</p>



<p>“We have expanded to various platforms, and currently, the number of porters has reached over 19 million worldwide, for which I am very grateful,” <a href="https://x.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/1854779891046400213">Kojima said</a>.</p>



<p>Kojima’s announcement follows a surprise <span>shadow drop yester</span>day, in which the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-xbox-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding Director’s Cut was announced for Xbox</a> and released at a 50% discount. Death Stranding on the Xbox will be published by 505 Games.</p>



<p>Kojima Productions also announced that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company now wholly owns the Death Stranding IP</a>, implying that Death Stranding 2 will also be coming to the Xbox platform in the future. Death Stranding 2 is scheduled to release in 2025 on the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>That’s not all for the Death Stranding IP, either. Earlier this year, Kojima announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-adaptations-kojima-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding has several adaptions in production</a>. </p>



<p>During&nbsp;<a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-hollywood-wme-1236157008/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his interview</a>, Kojima spoke about what the team is building with the Death Stranding IP:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There are several “Death Stranding” adaptation projects currently underway, but there is a different story I’ve written that’s intended for a movie. But I don’t have the time to direct it, so I won’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sony has announced that PlayStation has sold 65 Million Units of the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>The news came via the company’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q2_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q2 earnings results</a>, which revealed&nbsp;that the company had sold 3.8 million units in its last quarter, bringing the total number of PlayStation 5s sold to 65.5 million. The company reported that the last quarter saw a 29% reduction in PlayStation 5 sales compared to the same quarter the previous year.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the PlayStation 5 total sales are just behind that of the PlayStation 4, which sold around 67.5 million units, a 2 million unit difference. Earlier this year, PlayStation announced that it expects a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-sales-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued decline in its PlayStation 5 sales</a> as the console enters its latter half in the market.</p>



<p>It’s not all doom and gloom, though (if you could argue that anyway), as the company saw its biggest amount of Monthly Active Users for Q2 in its history at 116 million. The company saw 107 million Monthly Active Users during the same period last year.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>During the same earnings call, Sony also announced that PlayStation 5 exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot sold 1.5 million units in its first 2 months</a>.</p>
