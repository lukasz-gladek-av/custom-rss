<p>GameStop has issued a statement revealing that the ‘Infinite Money Glitch’ used when trading in items has been patched. </p>



<p>GameStop is one of the few offline video game stores that continues to operate effectively, consistently providing new deals and offers to its customers. Just two months ago, they launched a unique promotion called “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-trade-anything-day-coming-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Trade Anything Day</a>.” Now, they have introduced a new offer on pre-owned games. However, some customers took unfair advantage of this promotion, prompting GameStop to put an immediate stop to it.</p>







<h2 id="h-customers-were-buying-and-trading-in-the-switch-2-at-gamestop-for-extra-credit">Customers Were Buying and Trading in the Switch 2 at GameStop for Extra Credit </h2>



<p>This is how the infinite money glitch worked at GameStop stores. The company was offering a 25% bonus on the trade-in value of any pre-owned item. Customers would buy a Nintendo Switch 2 for $414.99, along with a pre-owned game that costs no more than $0.99. When they traded in both of these items, a promotional bonus was triggered, increasing the trade credit to $472.50. This effectively gave the customer $57.51 in store credit.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GEgSUUJ758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTuber</a> who exposed this glitch revealed that they were able to make $600 across both their trade cards and also get the Switch 2 they traded for at an even lower price, since it was tagged as pre-owned once it was traded in. </p>



<p>GameStop has now issued a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/2013691078109733056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> revealing that customers could repeat this process as many times as they wanted, creating an infinite money glitch. However, the glitch has been patched, and customers will not be able to “convert basic arithmetic into an endless revenue stream.” At the same time, the company will not stop promotions, and even though they “applaud the creativity,” they don’t want their stores to be used as “infinite money printers”. </p>



<p>Check out GameStop’s complete statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>GameStop is aware of the “GameStop Infinite Money Glitch,” exposed by YouTuber RJCmedia. </p>



<p>By purchasing a Nintendo Switch 2 for $414.99 and then immediately trading it back in along with the purchase of a pre-owned game, a promotional bonus was triggered that increased the Switch 2 trade credit to $472.50. </p>



<p>In short, our system briefly valued the pre-owned trade more than the new retail cost of the console itself, creating a narrow window where customers could repeat this transaction over and over again to amass infinite trade credit. </p>



<p>Effective immediately, the glitch has been patched. Trade promotions have been updated to ensure customers can no longer convert basic arithmetic into an endless revenue stream, and balance has been restored. </p>



<p>GameStop remains committed to offering promotions that reward our customers, and while we applaud the creativity, we gently remind everyone that our stores are not designed to function as infinite money printers.</p>

<p>The Midnight Walkers is stumbling into view with an early access release on the horizon, giving players a new PvPvE zombie extraction shooter to sink their teeth into.</p>



<p>With over 300,000 wishlists on Steam, anticipation is high for The Midnight Walkers, and the countdown for the release date is well and truly on.</p>



<p>If you’re chomping at the bit and are eagerly awaiting the release date of The Midnight Walkers, Insider Gaming can help you count down to the exact minute of release.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-midnight-walkers-release-date">What is The Midnight Walkers Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming in hot. Image via  Oneway Ticket Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The official release date for The Midnight Walkers is January 29, but players in some regions will be able to play a day earlier.</strong></p>



<p>Developer Oneway Ticket Studio is based in Korea, so release times are adapted to their time zone, which means the official release date isn’t actually solid. Instead, it flows with the regions of the world, but the doors will open to players simultaneously.</p>



<p>The Midnight Walkers does not have a staggered release, so there won’t be any situations where players in one region can access the game while others are locked out, and the length of the wait is the same for all players.</p>



<p>However, theoretically at least, some players will be able to play ahead of the official release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-midnight-walkers-countdown-exact-start-time">The Midnight Walkers Countdown: Exact Start Time</h2>



<p><strong>The Midnight Walkers official release time is 6 PM PT on January 28, with the exact time of entry varying for players across the world.</strong></p>



<p>Release times come from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2795540/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, which shows that players in the United States will be able to start playing the game earlier than the official January 28 release date.</p>



<p>The table below shows the exact start time for The Midnight Walkers in major time zones across the world, so you can jump in as soon as the doors open. If there are any changes to the release times, this guide will be updated.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">The Midnight Walkers Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">6 PM – Jan. 28</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">8 PM – Jan. 28</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">9 PM – Jan. 28</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Jan. 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – Jan. 29</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>A new multiplayer mod for The Witcher 3, called ‘Witcher Online’, lets players complete the entire campaign with their friends. </p>



<p>There appears to be a lot happening with the Witcher franchise. Reports suggest that a new DLC is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to arrive by May 2026</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next installment is also in development</a>. However, it seems we have a long wait ahead before these releases become available. In the meantime, players can explore a mod that significantly enhances the original game’s replayability. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-online-mod-features-customization-emotes-and-full-campaign-experience">The Witcher Online Mod Features Customization, Emotes, and Full Campaign Experience </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/multiplayer-mod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, a new mod for The Witcher 3 has surfaced on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NexusMods</a> called Witcher Online. The mod adds multiplayer to the title, allowing players to play through the entire story with their friends. The mod features chat functionality for conversations with strangers, along with emotes to express yourself even more.</p>



<p>The Witcher Online Mode can be combined with the Custom Player Characters mod to add more customisation, and the Chill Out mod just to have a relaxing time in the taverns with your friends. Check out the The Witcher 3 multiplayer mod in action in the video below: </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players will need a non-pirated next-gen version of The Witcher 3, version 4.04 or higher. It can be purchased through Steam or GOG. </p>



<p>The Witcher 3 is known for having some of the best choice-driven narrative campaigns, a wealth of high-quality side quests, and some of the most intriguing characters. It is a wonderful experience on your own, which will only be enhanced once your friends join in on the fun. </p>

<p>A reliable insider has reaffirmed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will release for Xbox in 2026. </p>



<p>For those unaware, back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-will-release-for-xbox-and-switch-2-in-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2025</a>, it was claimed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth would release for Xbox and the Switch 2 in 2026. We have yet to receive any official confirmation from either Xbox or Square Enix, but the insider seems confident it will release this year. </p>

<p>The insider who has reaffirmed the release for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Xbox is none other than NateTheHate. Interestingly, the reconfirmation comes via the insider’s latest <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013705307499712834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter), where he thanked the community for dubbing him r/GamingLeaksAndRumour’s Leaker of the Year. </p>



<p>In one of the comments, NateTheHate was asked whether the plans for Rebirth coming to Xbox in 2026 are still the same, to which he <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013710238508077359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a>, “Yes.” NateTheHate also stated that leaking something about Half-Life 3 is something he will “try to achieve” this year. And, there’s a chance that we might get some new leaks on his next podcast. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake has already released for both Xbox consoles and the Switch 2 on January 22, 2026, and hopefully, the port for FF7 Rebirth should be next on the list. At the moment, all we can do is wait for an official confirmation, but we do know the entire trilogy is making its way to Switch 2; it is just a matter of when now. </p>







<p>In other news, the director of Final Fantasy 7 Remake has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-should-be-led-by-someone-else-says-ff7-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the FF6 Remake series should be led by someone else</a>. Additionally, the game experience for the third instalment in the FF7 Remake series is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>“. When do you think Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will be officially announced for Xbox and Switch 2 in 2026?
