<p>A new rumor has circulated online that the next-gen Xbox called ‘Xbox Prime’ is targeting a 2026 release date.</p>



<p>The news comes from X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1876099668482085289?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, who has a history of posting primarily Call of Duty leaks. According to Hope, he says that he’s heard the next Xbox console “is still coming in 2026 and will be called Xbox Prime.”</p>



<p>He continues to say that it’s unclear if the console’s name is the codename or not and that Infinity Ward’s next Call of Duty title, presumably Modern Warfare 4, will be a Day 1 release.</p>



<p>Hope later continues that the Xbox next-gen release is “pretty much an open secret within the industry.”</p>



<p>If the rumor proves to be true, it could suggest that we could be hearing about the next generation Xbox sooner rather than later, possibly by the end of the year.</p>



<p>As for whether the rumor is true, Hope has had a history of posting Call of Duty leaks and is known to have sources within Activision and Call of Duty development teams, and with the company now owned by Microsoft, it’s entirely plausible that he’s been given the information from a developer working on a next-gen version of Call of Duty 2026. </p>



<p>As Hope points out, hopefully, the rumor leads to others with knowledge of the console speaking out to other leakers or journalists to confirm or deny the rumors.</p>



<p>As of September 2024, the Xbox Series S|X has sold 29.64 million units, half of that of the PlayStation 5’s 60 million.</p>



<p>What do you think of a next-generation Xbox console releasing in 2026? Do you think the next-gen Xbox is called Xbox Prime? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 release date flings itself onto PC bringing New York’s web-swinging protectors to a new format. The PS5 launch was a summer blockbuster in its own right, but new life is breathing into this sleeping symbiote.</p>



<p>Insomniac Games don’t make bad games. It’s spent 30 years crafting one compelling adventure after another: Spyro, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and Resistance. 2018’s Spider-Man elevated the developer’s status to new heights (literally), Miles Morales kickstarted the PS5 generation off in the right way, and 2024’s Spider-Man 2 is a technical marvel—pun intended.</p>



<p>PlayStation 5 was fortunate enough to get the exclusive launch of the third mainline sequel. However, a Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 PC release date is looking to kick some criminal butt, and it’s a crime for you to not know the launch date of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-million-copy-selling sequel</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 release date on PC is locked in for Jan. 30, 2025</strong>, and it is available to purchase from two different storefronts: Epic Games Store and Steam.</p>



<p>Sony users are accustomed to PS4 and PS5 exclusives releasing under a timed window. The early days saw 2018’s God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn eventually get ported to PC, and now most releases follow suit: God of War Ragnarok, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, and the original Spider-Man, for instance.</p>



<p>Now, it’s the turn of Spider-Man 2 to arrive on PC. 2024’s New York Comic Con fittingly played host to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Release Date announcement</a>. The “Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Announce Trailer” is a chance to revisit some of the open-world title’s most epic battles and emotional, gut-punching scenes, and is sure to whet the appetite of Spidey fans everywhere.</p>

<p>So far, <strong>Enhanced ray-tracing options</strong> is the headline maker when it comes to Spider-Man 2 on PC.</p>



<p>Through a dedicated Oct. 18, 2024, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/18/marvels-spider-man-2-arrives-on-pc-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spider-Man 2 PlayStation Blog</a>, we learned details on the PC launch. “We are excited to continue this collaboration and bring Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 to PC with a suite of enhanced features, including enhanced ray-tracing options, to take full advantage of a variety of setups and configurations.

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the second installment in Square’s epic remake trilogy. It’s nearly time for the PC release date of FF7 Rebirth for new users to enjoy a fresh chunk of reimagined RPG gameplay, and the potential impact can only be rivaled by the use of Meteor Materia.</p>



<p>I’ve already said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-deserves-more-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth deserved more love in 2024</a>. Ultimately, it was overshadowed by fascinating new IPs, intricate roguelike card games, and an adorable PlayStation mascot. This doesn’t mean FF7 Rebirth wasn’t a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">success</a> (far from it) as it’s believed Rebirth has sold several million copies to go with its various game of the year awards and nominations.</p>



<p>PlayStation 5 players have had exclusive access to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but PC players are finally set to get their turn to strike.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-release-date">When is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC Release Date?</h2>

<p><strong>The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC release date is Jan. 23, 2025</strong>, marking the launch of FF7 Rebirth on only its second platform.</p>



<p>The PC release comes 11 months after the Feb. 29, 2024 debut of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on PlayStation 5. The launch was PS5-exclusive, but as we’ve seen with various PS5-only titles—God of War, Horizon, and Spider-Man—Sony has a habit of timed exclusivity. This means a PC release is always on the cards later down the line, and FF7 Rebirth is the latest addition to the crossover catalog.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s PC release date</a> was confirmed at The Game Awards 2024. The exciting reveal trailer’s climax shows the Jan. 23, 2025 date, but the brief announcement was not the full story here.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-new-features">All Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC New Features</h2>



<p>The “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bzWvyncQh8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth PC Announce Trailer</a>” explains the PC port’s litany of upgrades over the original. </p>



<p>You can check out each promised improvement below:</p>



<ul>
<li>DLSS</li>



<li>Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling</li>



<li>Improved Lighting</li>



<li>VRR</li>
</ul>



<p>DLSS stands for <strong>Deep Learning Super Sampling</strong> and is a real-time technique designed to artificially boost the frame rate and upscale the rendered gameplay. <strong>Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling</strong> should help Mt. Corel, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-where-to-go-in-nibelheim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nibelheim</a>, and various biomes to pop in new ways never before seen. </p>



<p><strong>Improved Lighting</strong> allows environments to illuminate naturally and look more engaging and lifelike, whereas VRR means <strong>Variable Refresh Rate</strong> and this modern technical process provides various benefits from smoothing the frame rate to reducing lag and preventing screen tearing.</p>



<p>Additionally, “more” differences are indicated by the trailer, but we need to wait for the official launch to see what other surprises Square Enix has up its sleeve.</p>
