            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-is-returning-to-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1145556/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-is-returning-to-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new claim states that a Star Wars collaboration is planned for Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Season 2 ends on May 2, 2025, and post that date, according to a post by <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1904930387219874285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FNBRintel</a> on X (via <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1904931354669691269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hypex</a>), Season 3 will kick off with a Star Wars collaboration. The Star Wars collaboration will arrive as a mini-season that lasts approximately 30-35 days. The update will include a new POI based on the series, new mythics, skins, and other content.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1904931282011758877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Loolo_Wrld</a>, who recently leaked a Fortnite x <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-collaborating-with-dragon-ball-daima-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daima collaboration</a>, also corroborated the Star Wars Season 3 rumour while adding more details. Players should expect new Star Wars Bosses, NPCs, POIs, and items in Fortnite accounting to their posts. Moreover, the battle pass will seemingly feature 4-5 themed skins as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite and Star Wars have been collaborating since 2019, with new content arriving each year. Fortnite is known to have a new Star Wars collaboration or content ready for players each year on May 4, also known as Star Wars Day. Some of the most popular characters from the franchise, like the Mandalorian, Darth Vader, Han Solo, and a bunch more, have already been introduced to the game. </p>



<p>Last year, we saw the likes of Chewbacca, Dagobah Luke, Lando Calrissian, and AWR Trooper join the game. The collaboration was across several of Fortnite’s game modes, including Battle Royale, LEGO Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, and Rocket Racing. It will be interesting to see what Star Wars property Fortnite brings over this year, whether a new game, TV show, or movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Fortnite leaker has confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaker-confirms-mortal-kombat-content-is-finally-koming-to-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat content</a> is finally coming to Fortnite. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sabrina-carpenter-might-be-the-next-playable-fortnite-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a> could also be the next Fortnite Festival Icon.

            <title><![CDATA[New Lies of P: Overture Details Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-lies-of-p-overture-details-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-lies-of-p-overture-details-revealed.1145553/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-lies-of-p-overture-details-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Lies of P: Overture is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-overture-prequel-announced-its-not-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to release</a> sometime later this summer, and new details on what players can expect have come out.</p>



<p>Thanks to a recent interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-remain-single-player-despite-refreshing-elden-ring-nightreign-says-director" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Lies of P: Overture director Choi Ji-won gave insight into where the upcoming prequel stands in terms of experience and in relation to the original Lies of P.</p>



<p>According to Choi, the story of Lies of P: Overture will be “accessible seamlessly from around chapter nine of the base game.” That means the new story is integrated into the original as opposed to being a completely standalone tale.</p>



<p>“We never really saw the development of Overture as a separate entity,” said Choi to Eurogamer. “With the base game and the expansion together, we believe that the whole entire thing delivers the game of Lies of P as how it was supposed to be experienced. We just couldn’t do that earlier on.”</p>



<p>As far as length is concerned, Lies of P: Overture will take “experience players” roughly 15-20 hours to complete. It features new locations, enemies, bosses, weapons, and characters. Two of those new weapons are a bow and claws, though not much else was given away by Choi.</p>



<p>Lastly, when it comes to what the DLC will actually be, Choi told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-director-says-overture-dlc-isnt-connected-to-base-games-massive-final-cutscene-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> in a separate interview that players should replay the base game. He says that there are various clues throughout that give hints as to what you’ll get with Overture. He also made it clear that the final cutscene of the game is unrelated to what will be in Overture. That scene—don’t worry, no spoilers here—is a tease for future adventures from the developer.</p>



<p>What do you think of the new Lies of P: Overture details? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>EA Sports and Codemasters have officially revealed F1 25, the latest installment in the long-running Formula 1 racing franchise. The game will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC starting May 27 for those who buy the Iconic Edition of the game.</p>



<p>Those who <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-25-official-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">buy the base game</a> get it starting May 30.</p>



<p>As with any new release of an annual franchise, the biggest questions surround the improvements and new features coming to the game. With F1 25, Codemasters is bringing back a new installment of the Braking Point story mode with Braking Point 3.</p>



<p>“Hot off the heels of the 2023 season and under new ownership, the familiar faces of Callie Mayer, Aiden Jackson, and of course, Devon Butler, make their return,” the mode’s description reads. “However, with a dramatic event threatening to derail their title aspirations, will you have what it takes to steer the team to championship glory?”</p>



<p>In addition to the story mode, F1 2025 features a crossover with the upcoming F1 The Movie, bringing in the APXGP race team for use in both My Team and Driver Career as well as various post-launch chapters “inspired by the film”.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, My Team is getting its “biggest overhaul since it was introduced”. The mode will see you have new challenges and responsibilities as the owner of an F1 team. More specific details on what that entails will be revealed closer to the game’s launch.</p>



<p>Lastly, the game’s EGO engine has been updated along with improved “circuit authenticity made possible through LIDAR technology”.</p>
