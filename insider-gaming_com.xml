            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter, is getting a major update tomorrow (1.0.2) that will introduce the long-awaited Escape from Duckov collaboration content. We still don’t know what that looks like, but it marks the first cross-game collaboration in a hot minute for Escape from Tarkov and Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Battlestate announced an impending outage that will take Tarkov offline for up to six hours tomorrow, February 10.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-first-major-collaboration-is-coming">Tarkov’s First Major Collaboration is Coming</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, the teams at both Team Soda (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-duckov/" id="2714">Escape from Duckov</a>) and Battlestate Games (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a>) have been teasing a cross-platform collaboration. It promises to introduce crossover content in <strong>both games</strong>, despite the former title being a <strong>parody </strong>of the latter.</p>



<p>It looks like Escape from Tarkov’s maps will be replicated in Escape from Duckov, and the duck-themed characters from Duckov will surface <strong>in some way </strong>in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tomorrow, February 10 at 7:00 AM GMT / 2:00 AM EST we are planning to install patch 1.0.2.0 for Escape from Tarkov. The installation will take between 4 and 6 hours, but may be extended if required. The game will be unavailable during this time.</p><p>The official websites… <a href="https://t.co/lkoojEGgyk">pic.twitter.com/lkoojEGgyk</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/2020890440648573414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>We have no idea how long this collaboration is set to run for, but it’s likely to be a limited-time event that will expire after a few days. As with past Escape from Tarkov LTMs, it’s likely players will have achievements, items, and other rewards to unlock that, if they don’t get them now, they’ll never see them again.</p>



<p>You can expect Escape from Tarkov to be offline tomorrow from 7 AM GMT to at least 11 AM GMT, and <strong>most likely </strong>until 1 PM GMT. In true Tarkov style, you should also anticipate an extension to the maintenance window. To play it safe, perhaps wait until around 2 PM GMT for Escape from Tarkov to come back up.</p>







<p>What are you hoping to see in the Escape from Tarkov crossover with Escape from Duckov? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/riot-games/" id="52298">Riot Games</a> has downsized the team working on its League of Legends-themed fighting game, 2XKO.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">A blog post on February 9</a>, which was written by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/2xko/" id="1323">2XKO </a>executive producer Tom Cannon, revealed that the difficult decision to downsize the team was made in response to emerging trends. While the game has resonated with a core audience, momentum has stagnated, and Riot Games is unable to support a full-size team long-term.</p>



<p><span>A Riot Games spokesperson t</span>old <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>&nbsp;that approximately 80 staff members were laid off, about half of the development team.</p>



<p>The post states that, with the smaller, “focused” team, they will still make key improvements to the game, including items players have already requested. It is reiterated that this is a shift in how the development team will operate, not a sign that “the journey is over” for the 2XKO team.</p>



<p>“This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward,” Cannon wrote.</p>







<h2 id="h-riot-games-offering-support-to-laid-off-2xko-staff">Riot Games Offering Support to Laid-Off 2XKO Staff</h2>



<p>Furthermore, the blog noted that Riot Games will support staff through their transition, help them explore other opportunities within the company where possible, and provide at least 6 months of notice pay and severance where that’s not possible.</p>



<p>2XKO entered Early Access on PC on October 7, 2025, and launched across all platforms on January 20. Canon explained that during the console expansion, concerning player trends emerged. </p>



<p>Plans for the 2026 competitive series remain unchanged, and Riot will continue to focus on supporting events and organizers in local and broader communities.</p>







<p>Unfortunately, layoffs are currently a trend in the gaming industry. Ubisoft is undergoing a major restructuring, which has led to the cancellation of many projects, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">planned remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> and<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-assassins-creed-multiplayer-game/" id="174712"> a multiplayer Assassin’s Creed title.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to bring the latest updates on this story as more information becomes available.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-leave-ceo-build-a-rocket-boy-mindseye/</link>
            <guid>1430383</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Leslie Benzies, co-founder and co-CEO of Build a Rocket Boy, the developer behind MindsEye, is reportedly on ‘temporary leave’ from the firm. This was confirmed by the <strong>other </strong>CEO, Mark Gerhard, who recently revealed an alleged €1 million plot to sabotage BARB and MindsEye.</p>



<p>Per an email from Gerhard to the wider company, Benzies is taking a ‘well-earned temporary leave to recharge after more than a year of working around the clock.’ But following that, Gerhard stressed he’d be guiding the company forward and signed off his email as ‘CEO’ and not ‘co-CEO’.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-did-leslie-go">Where Did Leslie Go?</h2>



<p>It has been a tough few weeks for the team at Build a Rocket Boy. After the disastrous launch of MindsEye, the studio’s inaugural game, and several bouts of layoffs, the team was hit again by yet another scandal earlier this month. Leslie Benzies, formerly of Rockstar North fame, found himself accused of sexual assault in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-accused-sexual-assault-in-epstein-files/">recently uncovered ‘Epstein file.’</a></p>



<p>He categorically <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ex-rockstar-north-president-denies-epstein-files-allegations/">denied the assault</a> but confirmed he was in a consensual relationship with his accuser.</p>



<p>In a new report published by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/can-build-a-rocket-boy-save-itself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry</a>, it was revealed that an email posted by Mark Gerhard after an all-hands call confirmed Leslie Benzies’ temporary departure from the company.</p>



<p>Gerhard worded the email quite strangely, making it sound like the absence might be a little longer than you might assume:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>He has our deepest gratitude, and with the leadership team and your support, I will guide us forward.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report expanded with comments from former and current employees at BARB, one of whom explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think BARB survives this crisis. I believe the end is coming for BARB, and it’s not heralded by saboteurs, but by Mark and Leslie themselves.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That was in response to Gerhard’s claim of having evidence that Build a Rocket Boy and MindsEye were subject to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/">a ruthless and targeted campaign</a> to bring the brand down. Insider Gaming recently published a report detailing this exact claim.</p>

<p>The latest patch update for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/apex-legends/" id="27">Apex Legends</a> features new Meshes, audio updates, weapon updates, and so much more.</p>



<p>On February 9, Apex Legends announced the launch of their latest season: Breach. With the new season comes a range of updates, including the all-new Hardlight Mesh. These meshes serve as destructible, breachable windows. They are translucent, block projectiles, and affect player movement.</p>



<p>They allow players to create new entry points and attack angles, and they rebuild after a significant delay following damage. Controller Legends can also reinforce them to become more sturdy and allow them to bunker down, delaying enemy assaults.</p>







<p>In the latest patch, there are also updates to different Legend types. The Fuse type has received major updates, particularly to its ultimate, which now drops a mortar that detonates on impact, then sprays smaller bombs around its landing point. Additionally, they’re no longer slowed by explosive damage, have faster weapon stow time, and more.</p>



<p>The Apex team described the Catalyst type as “needing help for a while.” They can now reinforce up to four doors, have a maximum of three traps, and work in a larger area.</p>







<h2>Audio Updates Included Also</h2>



<p>Additionally, the Apex team announced audio updates for season 28. There are now more audio customization options, providing finer-tuned control over: Legend Dialogue, Ping Dialogue, and Announcer Dialogue.</p>



<p>Players can check out the full patch <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/breach-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Shared Watch event was announced in a social media trailer and will run through February 24. </p>



<p>While not specified, the caption states that players will clean up with strangers to turn their barrels on the machines, hinting at a PvE event. Still, people in the comments were asking for clarification as to whether this would be a PvP event.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>You watch my back, I'll watch yours – that’s how Speranza keeps ticking 🫶<br>Join your fellow Raiders in celebrating the Shared Watch; team up with strangers, turn your barrels on the machines, and earn rewards in the process.</p><p>The Shared Watch Event begins tomorrow! <a href="https://t.co/ssYtkLxZ4r">pic.twitter.com/ssYtkLxZ4r</a></p></div>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2020905547927552273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-what-follows-this-event-in-the-arc-raiders-roadmap">What Follows This Event in the ARC Raiders Roadmap</h2>



<p>Following the conclusion of the shared watch event on February 24, players can sign up for the second in-game Expedition on February 25. The event will begin on March 1. This time around, ARC is introducing a Skill Point catch-up system, which will allow players to reclaim some coins they missed during the first Expedition. </p>



<p>Each missing Skill Point from the first Expedition now only requires 300k stash value, and any Coins collected will first count toward the second Expedition before being applied to previously missed Skill Points.</p>
