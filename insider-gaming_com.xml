<p>A new report from Bloomberg has said that Warner Bros. gaming division is struggling to find new success and has rebooted its Wonder Woman game.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues?leadSource=reddit_wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Warner Bros. gaming has had a rough year with a 300 million thanks to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, and MultiVersus.</p>



<p>The studio has also apparently rebooted Wonder Woman, which has reportedly cost over $100 million in development costs already.</p>



<p>“One of the company’s biggest bets in development, a video game based on Wonder Woman, has struggled to coalesce, according to people familiar with the project. Early last year, it was rebooted and switched directors. The game has already cost more than $100 million, said the people who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information, and is still years away from release, if it ever makes it to market,” the report says.</p>



<p>“According to interviews with two dozen current and former Warner Bros. employees, a lack of a strong, cohesive vision during Haddad’s reign — a tumultuous period in which Warner Bros. struggled through multiple reorganizations — led to years of ineffectual trend-chasing and wasted development time. Along the way, once-revered studios under the Warner Bros. umbrella have taken reputational hits, lost key staff members and burned through hundreds of millions of dollars,” it continued.</p>



<p>According to the report, Rocksteady is now eying up a new single-player Batman game, but is still years away from coming to fruition.</p>



<p>The rumor of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-working-on-new-batman-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady moving to Batman</a> surfaced last year by leaker and rumormonger&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1838116987236655458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shpeshal Nick</a>.</p>



<p>“Not sure which studio people’s dreams is, but I heard Rocksteady are back making it,” he&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/shpeshal_nick/status/1838116987236655458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a response</a>&nbsp;to a Tweet asking for fans’ dream developers on the next Batman game. “I also think Sony are trying to moneyhat it lol.”</p>
