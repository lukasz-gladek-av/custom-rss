<p>Steam’s Personal Calendar will help players discover new and upcoming games through a schedule of upcoming releases and personalized recommendations. </p>



<p>Personal Calendar is a store feature that will be available as a Steam Labs experiment. This will allow the company to gather feedback and make more improvements to this tool. It will show players not just recently released games but also upcoming games, and it has been filtered down to a collection that Steam believes the player is most likely to be interested in.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-steam-s-personal-calendar-work">How Does Steam’s Personal Calendar Work?</h2>



<p>Explained in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/507342099205587494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, this new Steam tool will find players with similar playtime to the user and then look at the games they have been adding to their wishlists. The system will also look at the games the player plays the most (relative to other players) and spend most of their playtime in.&nbsp;Which means that the games and demos players put in for a few minutes won’t be recorded; only those they sink their teeth into will matter.</p>



<p>Steam’s Personal Calendar system will be retrained daily to incorporate the latest data. It has a new calendar view that lists soon-to-release titles, filters them to the set we recommend most for you, and maps them across time so you can see them at a glance. This view will also include the player’s wishlisted games. However, the Calendar is weekdays-only, since very few games are released on weekends, and they needed as much space as possible to show upcoming games. </p>



<p>There are some customisation controls, including the ability to filter by tag and adjust the number of results. Also, the page will filter games based on your&nbsp;store content preferences, such as Early Access titles, ignored products, ignored tags, and the general level of mature content.</p>

<p>A new announcement confirmed that Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition will no longer release for the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025 and has been delayed to 2026. </p>



<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition’s development has been struggling slightly on Nintendo Switch 2, with the recent Gamescom 2025 demo not doing it many favours, as players pointed out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-struggles-on-nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">substantial framerate drops</a>. It seems that’s why the developers want to take more time before they deliver the final product. </p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-release-pushed-to-2026-date-still-unconfirmed">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition Release Pushed to 2026, Date Still Unconfirmed</h2>



<p>The announcement about the delay comes through a post on the official Elden Ring <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post states that development for the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition is moving “wholeheartedly toward release”; however, they have decided to delay the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments.” The developers have apologized to the players for the delay and thanked them for their patience and support. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>While development on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> Tarnished Edition continues wholeheartedly toward release, we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments. </p><p>We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support. <a href="https://t.co/TsLrhAWIGc">pic.twitter.com/TsLrhAWIGc</a></p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Overall, it’s a sound decision to delay the launch of the Elden Ring: Tarnished edition, as the game was genuinely suffering from very real performance issues. Players have reported framerates dropping to as low as 15 fps, while doing “the most simple stuff,” and when players “get to the outside world, and the framerate just tanks.” The added time will help developers to work towards optimisation and provide a more solid build for release. </p>

<p>After a lot of feedback on the XP farm nerfs, Battlefield 6 developers have revealed that progression is being tested on PvE and curated servers. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 XP farms and bot lobbies were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-xp-bot-farming-portal-lobbies-nerfed-by-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerfed</a> recently, after players were seen using them to primarily earn XP, player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots.” However, since then, a lot of feedback has poured in, with players calling for solo lobbies for a more relaxed experience and the option to play as they wish. The developers have now responded to this feedback, revealing they will be testing progression in some curated BF6 servers. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-will-now-feature-progression-eligible-or-not-eligible-lobbies">Battlefield 6 Will Now Feature Progression Eligible or Not Eligible Lobbies </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/they-just-keep-winning-steam-was-already-beating-every-store-at-finding-games-and-it-just-got-better-with-custom-calendars-showing-recent-and-upcoming-games-valve-thinks-youll-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, community manager Shepard has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/811336158986581167/?ctp=2#c599667160179125243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to the feedback on the Battlefield 6 XP farm nerfs. Shepard first spoke about how the devs understand that many players “want full progression in solo/co-op and on curated custom servers—not just in matchmade PvP.” Some players have also expressed frustration with the game’s messaging regarding progression eligibility, whereas others worry about stat/leaderboard integrity and bot-farm exploits.</p>



<p>The developers understand that players with less time prefer low-stress PvE and still want meaningful unlocks, which is why they are enabling account XP and unlock/unlock-track progression in solo/co-op, as well as a curated list of community servers. However, to safeguard the integrity, K/D, leaderboards, and certain mastery tallies won’t update in these spaces during the test. If the data indicates low exploit/noise on these servers, they will expand eligibility. </p>



<p>At the same time, the developers don’t want XP farms in Battlefield 6, hence some anti-farm guardrails have been put in place. These include minimum difficulty, activity checks (AFK/loop detection), mixed target requirements, and sensible XP-per-minute caps. Any server that raises flags regarding exploits will lose its “Progression Eligible” status until the issue is fixed. Moreover, clear labelling will be put in place for Progression Eligible or Not Eligible on the browser and pre-match screens, with a short tooltip explaining the rationale.</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 players are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wicked-grin-skin-argument/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arguing about unrealistic skins again</a>.
