<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has stated that Rebirth’s Switch 2 gameplay experience is “pretty much exactly the same as all the other platforms.”</p>



<p>The Xbox and Switch 2 versions of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade are already live, and players have already started thinking about the next instalments. Moving on to the next instalment, a reliable insider has reaffirmed that Rebirth should <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrive for Xbox in 2026</a>. And now, we have been informed about the game’s performance on the Switch 2. </p>

<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-Interview-Naoki-Hamaguchi-Director-3010151.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke about Rebirth’s Switch 2 performance. The director was asked about the next instalments in the FF7 remake series, and Hamaguchi answered, stating that he can’t reveal too much information, but can confirm that Rebirth and the third instalment to the series are indeed in development for the Switch 2. </p>



<p>Development on both titles is progressing for Switch 2 and other platforms. Hamaguchi also stated that it’s his “personal policy” not to make any versions of a game different from one another, or “offer a different gameplay experience just because they’re on different hardware.” He has assured players that the Switch 2 version’s gameplay experience is “pretty much exactly the same as all the other&nbsp;platforms.”</p>

<p>Highguard developers have finally announced a gameplay showcase for the title, which will arrive on launch day. </p>



<p>Since Highguard was announced during the finale slot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, players have been eagerly waiting to learn more about the upcoming free-to-play shooter from the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall. However, close to the marketing or promotion for the title has been done, apart from the reveal trailer. It seems that we are finally going to get something, but it may be too close to launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-gameplay-showcase-arrives-on-launch-day">Highguard Gameplay Showcase Arrives on Launch Day</h2>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) of Highguard is finally showing signs of life, posting for the first time since December 12, 2025. The new announcement reveals that a Highguard Launch Showcase will be held on January 26, 2026, at 10 AM Pacific Time. The showcase will provide an in-depth look at the game, featuring year-one plans, a gameplay deep dive, and more. Players are speculating that the game could be dropped right after the showcase. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tune in on Monday, January 26, at 10am PT for the Highguard Launch Showcase⚔️</p><p>Here, we'll share an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.</p><p>👉<a href="https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI">https://t.co/zm4I62mMpI</a> <a href="https://t.co/VlQ4qbCNA3">pic.twitter.com/VlQ4qbCNA3</a></p></div>— Highguard | Launching Jan 26 2026 (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2014760310046085443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Highguard marketing has been almost non-existent, with developers providing players absolutely no concrete information about their upcoming free-to-play raid shooter. Interestingly, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-trophy-list-has-revealed-more-details-than-the-devs-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophy list leaked</a> recently, providing players with the most information we have received to date about the upcoming title. The information included details on the game’s mechanics, items, characters, and more. </p>







<p>In other news, a recent claim alleges that Highguard developers Wildlight Entertainment <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t pay for the spot</a> at The Game Awards finale. Additionally, here’s all you need to know about the upcoming shooter’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms</a>.

<p>Fantastical Parade is a fantastical name for the first new Pokémon TCG Pocket set of 2026. The new B2 set brings new cards, new Shinies, and new Mega ex variations. Fantastical Parade B2 is kicking off the new year with a bang, and IG has the Pokémon TCG Pocket Fantastical Parade release date, start times, and more.</p>



<p>It hasn’t gone unnoticed that developers Creatures Inc.&nbsp;and&nbsp;DeNA have taken feedback on board. The regularity of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-to-expect-from-pokemon-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> sets has eased up since the first anniversary, and the Deluxe ex set has been a big help. It’s now time for Set B2, and Fantastical Parade is looking to party on through the night (and every other night).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has revealed a <strong>four-month roadmap </strong>for ARC Raiders, the studio’s new extraction adventure title that was released in October 2025. The roadmap, which spans January to April, is a long-awaited thing that fans have been begging for, and now that it’s here, it promises <strong>plenty</strong>.</p>



<p>Each month boasts a unique theme that comes with new ARC enemies, map improvements, quality-of-life changes, and events galore. If nothing else, the ARC Raiders 2026 roadmap promises to hugely expand the game’s lore.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-roadmap-finally-unveiled">ARC Raiders Roadmap Finally Unveiled</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders was in a rocky place coming out of the festive period. The game fell prey to some issues over the holiday break, and exploits and cheaters alike were running rampant. As soon as Embark Studios got back into the office, things sharpened up a bit, and now that the roadmap is here, fans finally have something to look forward to.</p>



<p>That includes a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">four-part update spree</a> that rewards players with new content once per month.</p>



<p>Here’s the full spread:</p>



<p><strong>January – Headwinds</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New matchmaking option (level 40+)</li>



<li>New minor map condition</li>



<li>Player project</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February – Shrouded Sky</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New map condition</li>



<li>New ARC threat</li>



<li>Player project</li>



<li>Raider Deck</li>



<li>Map update</li>



<li>Expedition window</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>March – Flashpoint</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New map condition</li>



<li>New ARC threat</li>



<li>Player project</li>



<li>Scrappy update</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>April – Riven Tides</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New map</li>



<li>New large ARC</li>



<li>New map condition</li>



<li>Expedition window</li>
</ul>



<p>The introduction of the first new map condition in February should bring about Toxic Swamp, which was discovered weeks ago by eagle-eyed gamers. We’ve also known for a while that February will yield a new Raider Deck and Expedition window.</p>



<p>What’s not so amazing is that we need to wait until <strong>April </strong>to get a large-scale ARC threat and a new map, but talk of a ‘map update’ in February is enough to potentially keep players engaged.</p>



<p>Plenty is coming in ARC Raiders, and the roadmap is indicative of all the work Embark Studios is doing – and plans to keep doing – to keep this game growing and thriving.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has finally revealed its plans for the future of ARC Raiders, and as you could expect, it’s chock full of content. </p>



<p>This was all revealed in a recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders 2026 Roadmap</a>, where content for the next four months was laid out. A few bits drop in the remainder of January with the release of Headwinds, such as a new Player Project and Minor Map Condition, but the real fun begins in February with Shrouded Sky. </p>







<p>Check out this guide for everything to know about the new content coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-meta-guns-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> in February 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-every-piece-of-new-content-coming-to-arc-raiders-in-february-2026">Every Piece Of New Content Coming To ARC Raiders In February 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get ready for new experiences topside. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, the Escalation Roadmap for ARC Raiders suggests that plenty of new content is on the way, including a new Map Condition, new ARC, and even a new Map Update. </strong></p>



<p>And somehow, that’s not all, as February is gearing up to be a major month in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-aggression-based-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>. Here’s everything coming to ARC Raiders during the Shrouded Sky updates.</p>



<ul>
<li>New Map Condition</li>



<li>New ARC Threat</li>



<li>Player Project</li>



<li>Raider Deck</li>



<li>Map Update</li>



<li>Expedition Window</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a comprehensive list, and each phrase has a small image next to it, which might hint at more details. For example, the New Map Condition is pictured alongside a gust of wind—can we expect a storm to hit certain maps? As for the new ARC threat, a flying insect is shown, implying another airborne ARC is on the way. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-the-february-content-release-in-arc-raiders">When Will The February Content Release In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no detailed release window for the upcoming content, but it’s fair to assume that when it does drop, it’ll be at the usual ARC Raiders timings: 1:30 a.m. PT / 4:30 a.m. ET / 9:30 a.m. GMT / 10:30 a.m. CET</strong></p>



<p>It looks like it’s going to be an exciting month, but it can be frustrating to be left guessing when it could all arrive. It’s reasonable to assume that Embark Studios will scatter the content throughout the month to keep the game as fresh as possible. </p>







<p>That’s how they’ve handled it in the past, but everything is subject to change as it draws ever nearer. As usual, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> will keep this article updated should anything change or be announced.</p>
