<p>Several builds of unreleased games have been uploaded to an undisclosed datamining discord server, including Riot Games’ 2XKO.</p>



<p>So far, Insider Gaming has been able to verify that early builds of the following games have been uploaded to the server:</p>



<ul>
<li>Killing Floor 3 </li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/riot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games</a>‘ 2XKO</li>



<li>PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback</li>



<li>Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders </li>



<li>An early build of Delta Force Hawk Ops</li>
</ul>



<p>According to one source that’s in the server, uploads of the games builds are primarily used for datamining purposes, but some games with less protection will likely get leaked online. Either way, it looks like all of these games will have new bits of information leaked about them in the near future.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on where all of the builds originated, but according to other sources, 2XKO, PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback, and ARC Raiders have all recently been in a wider pool of playtesting.</p>



<p>Should any of the games leak, we will keep you updated.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has pushed out a limited-time event in Escape from Tarkov, setting bosses to a 100% spawn rate for a single day. One of the biggest talking points coming out of this spontaneous change is that PvE players have once again missed out on the event, for reasons unknown.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov stressed that as a wipe progresses in Tarkov, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/">around 50% of players</a> are locked in on the PvE platform. It comes as a surprise to learn that all those players are missing out on this latest Tarkov event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pushed-aside">Pushed Aside</h2>



<p>The newest <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1903734472383590723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Escape from Tarkov event</a> is a simple thing that allows boss characters to spawn on their respective maps with a rate of 100%. Every raid you enter is guaranteed to have a boss in it – unless you’re too late to reach them, of course.</p>



<p>However, fans are up in arms on social platforms because once again, Battlestate Games has neglected to loop in the PvE-based players for this event. This is far from being the first time this has happened, but this time around, it makes <strong>no sense</strong>.</p>



<p>Typically, PvE players miss out on pre-wipe events <strong>because their games won’t automatically reset</strong>, but this is a limited-time, one-off event that’s disconnected from any major update.</p>



<p>Fans are yet to determine <strong>why </strong>this Escape from Tarkov event has been pushed live, as it’s out of the blue and serves no purpose other than giving players a tighter challenge and helping them out with some ‘boss kill’ tasks.</p>



<p>Are you one of the many people playing PvE in Escape from Tarkov? Are you annoyed at missing this event? Let me know in the comments how you feel about it all.</p>

<p>Recently, Mojang revealed the Vibrant Visuals update for Minecraft. It’s an evolution of the game’s 15-year-old visual palette, and it’s set to change how reflections, sunlight, water, draw distances, and more all behave in Minecraft. It’s set to alter the game’s overall appearance without changing too much, but when is Vibrant Visuals coming to Minecraft?</p>



<p>The Vibrant Visuals update is already exciting fans worldwide. It’s one of the most major updates to hit Minecraft for a while, and it’ll be added alongside various changes – such as the introduction of a <strong>happy ghast</strong>. Amazing.</p>



<p>Read on to learn when Vibrant Visuals is coming to Minecraft.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-vibrant-visuals-release-date-status">Minecraft Vibrant Visuals Release Date Status</h2>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, the release date for Vibrant Visuals in Minecraft was pending, with Mojang having mentioned that it’s coming ‘in the future’.</strong> However, players on select Minecraft: Bedrock Edition devices using a beta or preview system will be able to test Vibrant Visuals sooner than that.</p>



<p>Minecraft Live 2025 had some solid reveals, but the Vibrant Visuals announcement was by far the best received. It’ll follow the Minecraft Spring to Life update, which is set to drop soon. Later this year, players will also get their first look at the dried ghast, which can be claimed and turned into a ghastling, and then into a <strong>happy ghast</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-vibrant-visuals">What is Vibrant Visuals?</h2>



<p>The Vibrant Visuals update was perfectly broken down in the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-vibrant-visuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Minecraft Live recap</a>, but I’ll paste the most important details about the update here.</p>



<p>Vibrant Visuals will change and introduce various key features in Minecraft:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shadows interacting with sunlight more accurately</li>



<li>Volumetric fog</li>



<li>Directional lighting upgrades</li>



<li>Infinite clouds across the draw</li>



<li>‘Thousands of individually crafted elements’</li>



<li>Accurate light rays through trees, windows, water, etc</li>



<li>Glow upgrades and evolved reflections</li>



<li>More accurate water visuals</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at Mojang was quick to point out that the Vibrant Visuals update in Minecraft won’t destroy the ‘creative principles’ of the game – it’s almost entirely a visual update.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to know, ‘When is Vibrant Visuals coming to Minecraft,’ you’ve got a little longer to wait, I’m afraid. It won’t be long, though – Mojang has announced it will be speeding up these ‘Game Drops’ in future, so you’ll know more very soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-is-getting-%E2%80%98vibrant-visuals%E2%80%99-and-happy-ghasts-this-year.1142403/</guid>

<p>In the latest Minecraft Live event, several key updates were revealed as coming to the block-building game soon, including ‘Vibrant Visuals’. This visual upgrade is an attempt from Mojang to upgrade the look of Minecraft without messing with ’15 years of design’. It’s set to redefine how the game looks, but the fundamentals won’t be adjusted too much.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>HAPPY GHASTS </strong>are en route to the Minecraft world. These adorable renditions of the creepy creature require a little work to obtain, but once you’ve got one, you can use it to fly around the map with reckless abandon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-game-drops-coming-soon">Minecraft Game Drops Coming Soon</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2025-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mojang revealed</a> that smaller updates will come to Minecraft more regularly going forward, and they’re being dubbed ‘Game Drops’. Also, the annual schedule will now accommodate <strong>TWO </strong>Minecraft Live broadcasts.</p>



<p>First up this year is the Spring to Life update, landing on March 25. It’s set to change various mobs, equipping them with warm and cold variants, and new ambient features are being added, such as the glittering firefly bush and falling leaves.</p>



<p>Vibrant Visuals is next on the docket. This overhaul will transform the game’s appearance, with Mojang evolving and upgrading directional lighting, volumetric fog, reflections, and more. The sun will cast better shadows, water will have more clarity, clouds will have more 3D depth, and various surfaces will glow and reflect light more accurately.</p>



<p>Fans worldwide are super excited about the impending introduction of happy ghasts, too. Later in 2025, players will be able to head into the Nether and secure ‘dried ghasts’, which are sad creatures on their last legs. By bringing them back to the Overworld, they’ll be able to rehydrate it and have a happy, helpful ghastling on their hands.</p>



<p>Once you have generated a ghastling, it’ll mature into a happy ghast, which you can then use to fly around the Overworld with other players, using it to craft tall, otherwise out-of-reach structures in Survival.</p>



<p>Which of these updates are you most looking forward to? Let me know in the comments.</p>
