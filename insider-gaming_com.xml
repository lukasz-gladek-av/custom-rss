<p>Whether you are on PlayStation 5, PC, or Xbox Series X, here is everything you need to know about the cost of Blue Prince and whether the game is free.  </p>



<p>Game prices are a hotly contested topic at the moment. Nintendo fans were shocked when it was revealed that Switch 2 games cost $80 instead of $60, as seen on the first Switch console. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo defended the decision</a> by arguing that it was due to the game’s value to players. </p>



<p>Additionally, physical Switch 2 games cost more than digital and will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost up to $98</a> when converted from Euros. This is, of course, in addition to the console itself, which is expected to cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$450</a> or more. Playing video games has always been a rather expensive hobby, but not all titles are increasing in price, as is the case with Blue Prince. </p>

Blue Prince will not be available physically, and there is only one edition, meaning there aren’t any pre-order bonuses or early access. </p>



<p>Blue Prince will not be available on the Epic Games Store or GOG at launch. Dogubomb revealed that the game will be Steam Deck compatible, but that won’t be until a later date. </p>
