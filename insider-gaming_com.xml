<p>With Nintendo Switch 2 just one week from its official full reveal, this year’s annual GDC was buzzing with talk around the future of the console. One such discussion was around the Nintendo Switch 2 launch date, which according to people that I spoke to at the event falls in June. </p>



<p>But that’s not all, according to various sources, the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch its games in a three-phase strategy, starting with primarily first-party games on launch. </p>



<p>According to sources, the second-stage will arrive in October-November for third-party studios, most of which are expecting the dev kits for the Switch 2 to be sent in June. Finally, it was said that the third phase for games will be in the holiday period.</p>



<p>In addition to the talk of the three-phase launch plan, Insider Gaming has also learned that select media and creators will be attending Nintendo Switch 2 hands-on next week, where they’ll get hands-on with the console and some of its launch games for a few hours.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is scheduled to be fully revealed on April 2nd, so we expect more in-depth hardware coverage and perhaps some of its launch games too. A launch price along with the official release date is also expected to be announced during the event.</p>



<p>According to various gaming insiders, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-direct-expected-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo is also planning a Nintendo Direct later this week</a>, but its contents is currently unknown.</p>

<p>Nintendo’s long-awaited Pokémon Legends Z-A sequel is reportedly playing it safe by adding no new Pokémon. This may come as both a shock and disappointment to fans waiting to see what new species were going to be added to the ever-growing Pokédex.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-platforms-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> is the next Pokémon title in the tall grass. It’s been a while since Scarlet and Violet, so it feels like the right time for fresh blood. It’s an ironic sentiment, as a leak has outed a lack of new Pokémon in the upcoming sequel to Pokémon Legends Arceus.</p>



<p>While nothing is official with leaks or rumors, the source is very reliable, and it’s looking like a quiet one on the incomings front.</p>

<p>Reliable and regular Pokémon leaker <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Centro Leaks</a> is back at it again. In a March 25 message on their X page, they said: “<strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A will not introduce any new Pokémon species</strong>.”</p>



<p>With 1,025 Pokémon registered in the total Pokédex, everyone was waiting with bated breath to see who Z-A would add. The news feels out of left field, more so when you consider that Legends Arceus at least added seven fresh-faced Pokémon, with an additional two variations on top of these.</p>



<p>Alas, it isn’t to be for Pokémon Legends Z-A. It appears the RPG will use a mix of Mon from the previous several generations. There could always be a surprise or two, so we won’t count our chickens just yet.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Pokémon Legends Z-A will not introduce any new Pokémon species.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Either way, it’s not all doom and Gloom, though. The return of Mega Evolutions is part of the recent Pokémon Legends Z-A leaks. If this news isn’t enough for you, check this out: A total of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-will-bring-27-new-mega-evolutions-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27 brand-new Mega Evolutions will appear in Legends Z-A</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killzone-remastered-trilogy-%E2%80%9Cwould-be-successful%E2%80%9D-says-series-composer.1144086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/killzone-remastered-trilogy-would-be-successful-says-series-composer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Could a Killzone remastered trilogy have success in the current era of gaming? If you ask series’ composer Joris de Man, that could be the case.</p>



<p>Killzone is one of the more beloved first-party franchises from PlayStation. But since 2014’s Killzone: Shadow Fall, the series as laid dormant as developer Guerrilla Games has since put full focus into the Horizon franchise. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/killzone-composer-would-love-a-remaster-trilogy-dont-know-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videogamer</a>, de Man talked about the franchise and bringing it to a new generation of players.</p>



<p>“I know that there have been petitions for it,” de Man said regarding bringing back Killzone. “I think it’s risky because, I can’t speak for Guirella or anything… I don’t know if it will ever happen. </p>



<p>“I hope it will because I think it is quite an iconic franchise, but also I think it kind of has to take into account kind of the sensitivities and the shift in, I guess, what people want because it is quite bleak in some ways.”</p>



<p>When asked about if that meant a new Killzone game or a remaster, de Man believes a remaster would perform better.</p>



<p>“I think it remastered one would be successful,” he said. “I don’t know if a new game would be as much. I don’t know if people have moved on from it and want something—I don’t know, sometimes I get the sense that people want something a bit more casual, a bit more quick.”</p>



<p>Would you like to see Killzone return either with a new game or a remastered trilogy of some sort? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. </p>

<p>Civilization 7 is getting its latest update that aims to solve a number of issues players have had with the latest game in the legendary series. In a new post on Steam, along with a subsequent explainer video, developer Firaxis listed some of the improvements and additions coming in Civilization 7’s Update 1.1.1.</p>



<p>Some of those updates include the addition of Quick Move as a toggle option, Mount Everest as a new natural wonder, the ability to rename Settlements and commanders, and various UI updates.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Civilization VII Developer Update - March 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1ilg2l87Ak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the developer update video on the patch, creative director Ed Beach also touched on a new “Start Position” option in relation to map generation. Beach says the default setting called “Standard” will feel “a lot like Civ 6 where the continents are move varied and less predictable.” There is also a “Balanced” option that “puts everyone on an even playing field”.</p>



<p>There’s even a restart button to allow players to quickly restart a match with the same settings and Civilizations if they don’t like their starting position. </p>



<p>Regarding the game’s UI, there are new notifications for when you are under attack as well as new indicators for crises in the status bar. The rest of the patch notes for Civilization 7 Update 1.1.1 can be found in the dropdown below or via their <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s been a rough launch for Civilization 7. As of publishing, the game is averaging less peak players per day than both Civilization 5 and 6.</p>

<p>The Atomfall map is split up into several key areas you’ll backtrack through. It’s a dense, detailed world, and well worth exploring. But if you want to know how big the map is and what it holds, we’ve got answers. </p>



<p>An RPG’s map size is an unavoidable question at this point. I’d say the sandbox stylings of GTA kickstarted the topic many years ago. Ubisoft popularized the construction of gigantic maps, and now it’s commonplace. We have reached a point where maps are getting too big, and it’s nice when an RPG cuts back on the square-feet of land.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-review-rebellion-curveball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> promises an adventure through an alternate-history Cumbria. The area is quite a decent part of England, but has Rebellion brought Cumbria to life, to scale?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-atomfall-open-world">Is Atomfall Open World?</h2>

<p><strong>Atomfall is not a bona fide open-world title and is akin to a semi-open-world title featuring several interconnected biomes.</strong></p>



<p>The best way to describe <a href="https://atomfall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Atomfall</a>‘s map is like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands</a>. It has a ton of large-scale areas, but you need to go through a loading screen to get to them, so it’s not a completely open world. I prefer this kind of map in many ways as it allows the developer to concentrate their efforts on creating unique, focused biomes.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-atomfall-s-map-all-areas-explained">How Big is Atomfall’s Map? All Areas Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Collectively, Atomfall’s map is comparable to a medium-sized open world game and consists of six large areas.</strong></p>



<p>Atomfall is made up of six main biomes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Casterfell Woods</li>



<li>The Interchange</li>



<li>Sewer Tunnels</li>



<li>Slatten Dale</li>



<li>Skethermoor</li>



<li>Wyndham Village</li>
</ul>



<p>Outside of The Interchange and Sewer Tunnels, the remaining four areas are all outdoors. They feature an assortment of POIs, NPCs, enemies, hidden bunkers and underground areas, and mines. To explore one of the biomes inside out, you’re looking at several hours each, quite easily.</p>



<p>The Interchange is the basis of the story, whereas the Sewer Tunnels are an efficient way of getting from area to area.</p>

<p>Each main biome is split into several locations of interest. If you need reference points or reminders, we’ve put together a handy table showing you every key area and where they are.</p>
