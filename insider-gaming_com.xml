<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, and Capcom is letting players know what they can expect if they have Sony’s best PlayStation console.</p>



<p>In a post on the Japanese PlayStation Blog, game director Akishi Nakanishi discussed how Resident Evil Requiem will play on the PlayStation 5 Pro (PS5 Pro).</p>







<h2 id="h-ps5-pro-gets-an-optimized-experience">PS5 Pro Gets An Optimized Experience</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2026/01/27/20260127-requiem-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nakanishi revealed that</a> PS5 Pro users will be able to turn ray tracing on and off. With ray tracing turned on, players will be able to play Resident Evil Requiem at 4K resolution at 60 frames per second (FPS). </p>



<p>Should you be on a monitor that supports higher frames, you’ll be able to take advantage of rates up to 120 FPS. Nakanishi said that there will be an average of 90 FPS on the system.</p>







<h2>What Is Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the long running horror franchise. The new game follows FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she’s tasked with investigating a number of strange deaths at the Wrenwood Hotel in Racoon City. It’s the same location where her mother, Alyssa Ashcroft, was killed eight years prior. </p>



<p>It also seems the return of Leon Kennedy who has to look into incidents that have been linked to scientist Victor Gideon. The game’s events are set roughly 30 years after Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.</p>



<p>The game releases on February 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-dr-disrespect-not-invited-highguard-debunk/</link>
            <guid>1416856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The internet’s social corners are ablaze following a recent claim from Dr Disrespect that he was invited to play Highguard alongside Wildlight Entertainment in Los Angeles. The ‘Two Time’ posted an image on social media of an ID card from the recent event and directly stated he’d taken ‘the Lambo to LA’ to play Highguard.</p>



<p>Even though it took literal seconds to figure out Dr Disrespect’s image was a fake, likely manufactured by the same folks who make his streamer art, some have <strong>boycotted Highguard </strong>because of this impossible collaboration.</p>







<h2 id="h-dr-disrespect-fakes-highguard-invite">Dr Disrespect Fakes Highguard Invite</h2>



<p>On January 24, Dr Disrespect posted an image on social media of his desk, some streaming and gaming equipment, and an ID card that marked him as an attendee to the recent Highguard event in Los Angeles. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was a staging ground for Wildlight to showcase the all-new shooter in full to a wide audience of streamers, creators, pro gamers, and influencers, and some folks believed that Dr Disrespect also went.</p>



<p>When the image cropped up on social media, it took some who <strong>were </strong>in attendance mere seconds to debunk the image, simply by showing their own, legitimate passes, and pointing out the inaccuracies. But that wasn’t enough for the detritus of those social circles that avoid using logic and reasoning to solve something cryptic.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many took to those same social circles to slam Wildlight for associating with a creator with Dr Disrespect’s reputation. Anyone even remotely interested in the creator space knows about the recent controversies that the scandalous streamer found himself embroiled in over the last couple of years.</p>



<p>Now, the Creator Manager for Highguard at Wildlight Entertainment, Chin, has <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a definitive comment</a> on social media, further debunking the image:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey there! I’m Chin, the Creator Manager for Highguard / Wildlight and I can confirm DDR was not invited to any Highguard event past or present, and the badge was not an official badge.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, no, Dr Disrespect did not jet off to Los Angeles to play Highguard with everyone else. He is <strong>streaming </strong>the game as this article is being written, but that’s the closest to it he’ll ever be.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-battle-pass-free-war-chest/</link>
            <guid>1416853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t have a new live-service game without a Battle Pass, and Highguard doesn’t advertise a properly labeled Battle Pass, to an extent. This guide covers how to get a free War Chest and how it relates to Highguard. </p>



<p>Everyone gets the ick at the mention of a Battle Pass due to the negative connotations. However, if something is free to play, it’s going to have a Battle Pass, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-file-sizes-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> complicates things with its War Chest system.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-a-battle-pass">Does Highguard Have A Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get playing. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard has a fully fledged Battle Pass system under the guise of a War Chest.</strong></p>



<p>Same thing, different name. A War Chest is the name for the game’s Battle System. It has the Pages system that Fortnite and others have adopted in recent years, allowing you to have more freedom in how you accumulate Highguard rewards.</p>



<p>Each reward requires so much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-currencies-how-many-are-there-how-to-earn-how-they-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard currency</a>, and they include the usual slew of live-service cosmetics: Skins, weapons makeovers, customizable player profile items, and more. Subsequent War Chests will presumably require real money or acquired in-game currency, but not the first one.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-free-war-chest-in-highguard">How To Claim Free War Chest In Highguard</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Generous. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to go into the Highguard Store, click on War Chest, and claim your free Battle Pass.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick step-by-step guide on what to do:</p>



<ol>
<li>Load up Highuard.</li>



<li>Go to the main menu.</li>



<li>Make sure you’re on the tabs at the top.</li>



<li>Cycle across to <strong>Store</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>Inspect War Chest</strong> in the corner.</li>



<li>Claim the War Chest.</li>



<li>You now have a free Battle Pass for Highguard Episode 1.</li>
</ol>



<p>The first War Chest has a total of 44 items to claim. Goodies vary in terms of rarity, and they’re spread across ‘4 Chapters.’ You need to play matches and rack up a serious amount of Vigil Tokens—which are used in exchange for the rewards found in the War Chest.</p>



<p>It’s expected that future War Chests will follow a similar format, unless there’s stern opposition from the Highguard community.</p>



<p>Will you endeavour to complete the first-ever Highguard War Chest, AKA Battle Pass? Or do you think the rewards are a complete waste of time and not worth the effort?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The marketing train is in full swing for WWE 2K26. Not only have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-king-of-kings-edition-cover-features-triple-h/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various editions</a> of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game been revealed</a> in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent days</a>, but it’s now known when the game will release as well as some of the platforms.</p>



<p>According to known <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/wwe-2k26-switch-2-plateformes-date-de-sortie-ce-que-lon-sait-60917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Billbil-kun</a>, WWE 2K26 will launch on Friday, March 13. According to the report, the game will release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2. </p>







<p>Insider Gaming can corroborate the Switch 2 plans. The game is also expected to be a game-key card, should you get the physical version of the game on the system.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE 4:27pm ET: </strong>Billbil-kun has confirmed to Insider Gaming that it IS coming to PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-last-gen-and-pc-status-remain-unknown">Last Gen and PC Status Remain Unknown</h2>



<p>There was no confirmation regarding the game’s availability on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. There was also no mention of WWE 2K26 on PC in Billbil-kun’s report.</p>



<p>Last year’s was available on the platform, but it was treated as a last-gen version of the game, meaning it didn’t include The Island. Also like</p>



<p>As far as what to expect from this year’s game, Insider Gaming was the first outlet to exclusively report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CM Punk will be the feature superstar</a> for the game’s Showcase Mode. WWE 2K26 will also see the addition and return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four match types</a>, including a highly requested return.</p>







<p>The game will also feature the draft in Universe mode, intergender matches in MyFaction, shopping carts to use during matches, an overhauled reversal system, and more.</p>



<p>Pre-orders for WWE 2K26 open on January 30. More information and impressions on the game are expected to come in February after the invite-only creator event. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-currencies-how-many-are-there-how-to-earn-how-they-work/</link>
            <guid>1416802</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a common trend in multiplayer games to have numerous currencies, and Highguard appears to be no different. As soon as you load into the game, you’ll see a selection of small symbols at the top right of your screen, indicating how much of each currency you own. </p>



<p>The thing is, when you’re loading into a new game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> for the first time, the whole experience can be overwhelming, and the last thing you want to figure out is which currencies can be spent where, let alone how to earn them!</p>







<p>Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has you covered, as in this guide, you’ll find out everything you need to know about Highguard’s various currencies. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-currencies-are-in-highguard">How Many Currencies Are In Highguard?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There are already plenty of bundles in the store. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are three currencies in Highguard, and each one has its own unique purpose. </strong></p>



<p>The currencies in question are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Highguard Gold</li>



<li>Warden Credits</li>



<li>Vigil Tokens</li>
</ul>



<p>As is often the case, these currencies have their own rules: each one can only be spent in certain ways, they cannot be interchanged between one another, and they’re all earned in their own unique way. </p>



<p>But don’t worry, there’s no need for confusion, as Insider Gaming have broken down each currency for your convenience.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-gold-explained">Highguard Gold, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The bundles don’t come cheap. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard Gold is the premium currency of Highguard. It is used to purchase War Chests and Store Cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The main way to earn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-highguard-launch-day-content-maps-content-weapons-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> Gold is through direct in-game microtransactions, with the prices shown above in GBP. As things stand, there are no other ways to earn the currency.</p>



<p>It’d be great to see it available through other means in the future, either via War Chests or perhaps even Ranked rewards, as plenty of other live-service games offer their premium currency as in-game rewards. Until then, though, if you see something you fancy in the store, you’re going to need to pull out the wallet.</p>



<h2 id="h-warden-credits-explained">Warden Credits, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Some simple cosmetics are on offer. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warden Credits are used to purchase cosmetics from the Trading Post, an in-game store that rotates its stock weekly.</strong></p>



<p>The Trading Post is similar to the Store, except it offers a smaller variety of cosmetics that can be earned without the need for microtransactions. That’s because Warden Credits can be earned in-game, either by completing challenges or simply playing games.</p>







<p>However, if you’re managing to accrue a lot of them, be warned, as Warden Credits are capped at 10,000. Once you hit this upper limit, you’ll stop storing them in the bank, so be sure to spend them!</p>



<h2 id="h-vigil-tokens-explained">Vigil Tokens, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Similar to a battle pass. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Finally, there’s Vigil Tokens. These are used to purchase items in War Chests, which are packed with various cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The primary way to earn these Vigil Tokens is simply by playing matches. The more you play, the more you’ll earn, so it’s a great incentive to reward regular players with some high-tier cosmetic items.</p>



<p>Similar to the Warden Credits, though, there’s an upper limit to how many you can hold onto. 3,000 is the maximum amount of Vigil Tokens you can have at one time, so once again, be sure to spend them when you get them!</p>

<p>Highguard is finally here, and after a long month of waiting and speculating, we finally know what the game is about. Not only do we know how the game plays, but we also know what it’s launching with, and it’s a whole lot of content. </p>



<p>For live-service games like Highguard intends to be, it’s important to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep content pouring in</a>. However, if there isn’t enough to start with, then players won’t have anything to get hooked to.</p>







<p>It doesn’t seem like Highguard will have that issue, as there’s a wealth of content to explore at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-wardens-amp-mounts-available-for-highguard-launch">All Wardens &amp; Mounts Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who is your pick? Image by Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are eight Wardens to choose from, each with their own abilities and skills, as well as three different Mounts. More are scheduled to come with future content updates.</strong></p>



<p>It looks like there’s a nice variety of Wardens to choose from in Highguard, with five playstyles seemingly catered for with their classes. There are three Assault and two Defensive Wardens, making them the most common class at launch.</p>



<p>The eight Wardens available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Warden Name</th><th data-align="center">Warden Class</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Redmane</td><td data-align="center">Destruction</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Condor</td><td data-align="center">Recon</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Atticus</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kai</td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mara </td><td data-align="center">Support</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Una </td><td data-align="center">Defensive</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Scarlet</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Slade</td><td data-align="center">Assault</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The three Mounts available at launch in Highguard are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Horse</li>



<li>Panther</li>



<li>Bear</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-maps-amp-bases-available-for-highguard-launch">All Maps &amp; Bases Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Explore before the sword falls. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five maps to play at launch for Highguard, with a roster of six Bases to select from each match.</strong></p>



<p>Wildlight Entertainment describe the Maps and Bases very distinctly. The Maps are more open-world environments full of loot and gear to collect, whilst the Bases are smaller, typical FPS-style areas that offer more close-quarters combat. It looks set to offer diverse gameplay scenarios, and it’s notably different from other titles in the genre.</p>







<p>Here’s all five Maps available at launch in Highguard: </p>



<ul>
<li>Dustline</li>



<li>Kingdom</li>



<li>Rivermark</li>



<li>Summit</li>



<li>Vesper City</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-weapons-available-for-highguard-launch">All Weapons Available For Highguard Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A solid selection. Image by Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ten Primary Weapons are available at launch in Highguard, with three Raid Weapons up for selection too—and don’t forget your Melee Axe!</strong></p>



<p>That makes a total of 14 weapons in Highguard, with plenty more bound to arrive across the year. It’s a simple but healthy selection that should hopefully see balancing not become an issue so early in the game’s lifecycle. </p>



<p>Here’s all 14 weapons available at launch in Highguard:</p>
