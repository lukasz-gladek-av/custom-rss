<p>The Nintendo Switch helped the Japanese company to rebound spectacularly after the WiiU’s underwhelming tenure. The hybrid console has sold millions in hardware and software and is responsible for some of the highest-reviewed titles of all time. But I think it’s high time the Nintendo Switch 2 scoots its way into 2025.</p>



<p>I’ve always been a “PlayStation” guy, ever since I was a kid. I’ve had the odd Game Boy and DS, but they were fleeting and flirtatious moments—outside of excessive Pokémon&nbsp;binges. I missed out on Metroid, the best Mario games, Zelda, etc, you name it. This all changed the day I decided to invest in a Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>As a proud Switch owner, I’ve spent the last few years catching up, and I think the Nintendo Switch is a monstrous marvel. However, it feels like it’s outstayed its welcome—despite the addition of the OLED line—and I want something new to play with.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-nintendo-switch-has-has-a-good-run">The Nintendo Switch Has Has a Good Run</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Simple and superb. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s get the obvious downer out of the way—<strong>the Nintendo Switch isn’t very powerful and never has been</strong>. This hasn’t been much of a problem for its colorful and cartoony, first-party titles though. Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 3, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-super-mario-mario-kart-sets-announced-for-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart</a> 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-super-smash-bros-stages-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> have sold a couple of hundred million copies between them, and they aren’t games designed to stretch a console to its limit—<em>maybe</em> for the Switch.</p>



<p>The optimized performance and sheer smoothness of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom feel like a minor miracle. But most games can’t hit 60 FPS, and performance varies from title to title—even if the unit is docked. The Switch has reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 146 million units</a>—apparently making it the third-best-selling console behind the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS—but consumers deserve the best.</p>



<p>I may come across as entitled, but after years of enjoying crispy 4K HDR, 60 FPS gameplay on my PlayStation 5, I want the same for the Switch. I didn’t want to do this, but Pokémon&nbsp;Scarlet and Violet was the final straw. What should’ve been Game Freak’s magnum opus, turned into a performance PR nightmare. I bought Pokémon&nbsp;Scarlet on day one, and it doesn’t matter how many times Sprigatito bats its precious eyelids at me, I can’t ignore the ugliness of Scarlet and Violet’s choppy frame rate, endless bugs, and lackluster performance across the board.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s array of exclusives is second to none. This is highlighted by the returning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> in 2025, and a new 3D Mario would benefit massively from a Switch 2. First-party content isn’t an issue for Nintendo and never has been. However, one of Nintendo’s biggest problems could be solved by a Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-third-party-isn-t-bouncing-enough">Nintendo’s Third Party Isn’t Bouncing Enough</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I count two pixels here. Credit to IGN’s Mortal Kombat 1 For Switch Review.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you have exclusives selling like hotcakes, I get third-party isn’t much of a concern. I do find it puzzling Nintendo is happy to overlook this segment of the market though. Many third-party titles never see the light of day on Switch, and this is presumably due to technical limitations.</p>



<p>Those that do release have to make serious reductions. Take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-switch-hate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 1 on Switch</a> and the image of Johnny Cage above. 2023’s fighter is an unbelievable beat ’em up on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with some of the most lifelike graphics and rapid response times. Its Switch port is a shell of its next-gen contemporaries with laughably long load times, blurry graphics, and a huge reduction in textures and performance.</p>



<p>On the other hand, bigger open-world titles don’t perform too badly on Switch. Hogwarts Legacy is still quite rough around the edges but manages to hold up, and The Witcher 3 miraculously plays well—again, at the expense of huge graphical and performance-related downgrades. It’s less a case of “if it can,” and more “should it?” It earns Nintendo more money, but these are titles deserving to be experienced as they were intended.</p>



<p>If the Nintendo Switch 2 can improve its performance, even more consumers might favor the portability and dual accessibility of the Switch 2 over a PlayStation or Xbox. More sales mean revenue and happier shareholders. The next console is rumored to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced before April 2025</a>—possibly to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-releasing-march-2025-rumor-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in March 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Providing Nintendo nails it, the long-awaited follow-up could eclipse its younger sibling, and eventually become the top-selling Nintendo hardware in history.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch’s run is one of the most successful and prolific in gaming history. But are you ready to see what Nintendo has in store with the Switch 2? Which potential titles and franchises would benefit the most?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[More People Play PvE in Tarkov Than You’d Think]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-people-play-pve-in-tarkov-than-you%E2%80%99d-think.1073175/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games introduced PvE to Escape from Tarkov a few months back, and it was a divisive decision that was met with mixed reviews. Many hardcore players claimed it was stripping ‘the point’ out of Escape from Tarkov, while the more casual players welcomed the change with open arms – once they’d <strong>bought </strong>the mode, of course.</p>



<p>In the Tarkov community, playing PvE is somewhat stigmatised. It’s often met with jibes from the more skilled players claiming that it’s ‘the easy way out’, or something similar. However, in a recent revelation, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov highlighted just how many people play PvE – and the number will surprise you.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-even-stevens">Even Stevens</h2>



<p>During a recent Tarkov TV stream, Nikita – the head of the studio at Battlestate Games – got onto the topic of PvE player numbers. It has long been thought that PvE gamers represent the minority in Escape from Tarkov, and while that’s true sometimes, it was proven by the numbers that things balance out over time.</p>



<p>Nikita said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the start of a wipe, 15 – 20% of players choose PvE, and 80% go for PvP. However, as the wipe progresses, the player ratio becomes roughly 50/50%.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the ‘wipe’ hits Tarkov – as it did a week ago – hundreds of thousands of players come flooding back to see what’s new and to kickstart an all-new playthrough, taking on the early-game tasks once again. However, the player count dwindles over time, as do other elements like viewership.</p>



<p>It can become stagnant within a month or two, with many players drifting off as the power players become established. Before long, it’s seen as being ‘too late’ to start the wipe, given that you’d be coming in as a fresh player against high-level opponents with the best weapons and armour.</p>



<p>The endgame loop also gets tiring for those who make it there as quickly as possible. Once the core tasks are completed and all the boxes have been ticked, it’s an endless grind of daily and weekly challenges and fruitless PvP battles.</p>



<p>The answer? It’s PvE.</p>



<p>By playing PvE, you access a more balanced playing field – perhaps an <strong>easy </strong>playing field. It’s a great introduction to Escape from Tarkov’s maps, modes, and mechanics, and in PvE, all you’re missing is real-world opponents. Aside from that element, everything else is effectively identical.</p>



<p>As the wipe goes on, 50% of Escape from Tarkov’s players gravitate towards PvE, and that’s a huge figure. Are you one of them? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose is available for free as the latest giveaway game on Epic Games on PC. It follows on from a giveaway that featured Kingdom Come Deliverance, and it’ll be replaced on January 9 by Turmoil – so get it while you can.</p>



<p>In 2019, Hell Let Loose dropped to a solid reception, presenting players with one of the grittiest and most grounded WW2 experiences in modern gaming.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-war-is-hell">War is Hell</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hell-let-loose-03f036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hell Let Loose</a> is the latest free Epic Games title, available now through January 9.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most heart-pounding FPS titles you’ll ever play, and it’s perfect with friends. It’s a hyper-realistic WW2 title featuring real theatres of war and iconic battles, and at the heart of the game sits a slew of real-world weapons, items, vehicles, and tactics.</p>



<p>Here’s a trailer for the game to give you an idea of what you’re getting into:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="HELL LET LOOSE | The Eastern Front Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3hLu58KXg8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>This is the last giveaway of the festive period for Epic Games, but it’s not the last giveaway, period. As usual, the platform provider will go on to reward users with free games on a regular rotation, and that’s where Turmoil comes into play on January 9.</p>



<p>For now, you’re free to explore Hell Let Loose and all it offers. Fair warning before you invest, though – it’s best played with a microphone for communications, many players treat it way more seriously than your average shooter, and it’s <strong>hard as nails</strong>. In most cases, you’ll die to a single, unseen shot from a treeline somewhere as you power across the battlefield.</p>



<p>Have fun!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Top Counter-Strike Betting Tips]]></title>

<p>Betting in Counter-Strike has been a major factor of the game’s incredible growth, especially since the introduction of skins to CS:GO. The betting scene in Counter-Strike has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone through many changes</a>, but there’s still plenty of opportunities available to those (of legal age) who want to play.</p>



<p>These tips for betting on Counter-Strike aren’t going to tell you the teams or players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-bet-on-counter-strike-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can reliably bet on</a>. Instead, these tips will go over the best practices for betting on Counter-Strike, so that you can play safely and responsibly.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-tips-for-betting-on-counter-strike">Best tips for betting on Counter-Strike</h2>



<h3 id="h-bet-responsibly">Bet responsibly</h3>



<p>Playing responsibly when betting on Counter-Strike should be considered a rule instead of a tip. Gambling and betting can be fun, but it can also be addictive and costly if you don’t play smart. </p>



<p>Here are some essential guidelines for betting responsibly on Counter-Strike, or any game.</p>



<p><strong>Never bet more than you’re comfortable losing.</strong> This is the golden rule of betting. Placing large wagers that promise large payouts can be tempting, but if things don’t go your way, you could end up losing too much.</p>



<p><strong>Learn proper bet unit size.</strong> Knowing how much to bet is crucial to playing responsibly and sustainably. To do this, you’ll need to establish your bankroll.</p>



<ul>
<li>A bankroll is the amount of money you set aside to bet with for a specific amount of time. This can either be for a season, a month, or even a year.</li>



<li>Your bankroll determines your unit size, which is how much you bet with. For example, if you have a $100 bankroll set aside for a month, your unit size should be $1 or $2.</li>
</ul>



<p>The type of bet you place will influence the unit size you use. On a relatively safe bet with lower odds, you should bet one or two units. But for more higher risk wagers, like multi-leg parlays or longshot bets, you should be betting fractions of a unit.</p>



<h3 id="h-take-advantage-of-all-the-sites-available">Take advantage of all the sites available</h3>



<p>There are a number of websites that offer the opportunity to bet on Counter-Strike. These sites consist primarily of esports-focused sites where you can bet on professional match outcomes, and skin gambling sites. </p>



<p>Regardless of which kind of betting you’re more interested in, here are some tips for making the most out of all the sites available.</p>



<ul>
<li>Compare sites to find the best odds. When betting on Counter-Strike matches, differing sites may offer better or worse odds for the outcome you’re betting on. Taking the extra time to find the site with the best odds is worth the reward if your be hits.</li>



<li>Take advantage of sign-up/deposit bonuses. If you’re just getting into Counter-Strike betting now, there are number of sites that will offer bonuses for signing up or placing your first deposit (sometimes you’ll need a promo code). Make sure you read the full details before depositing, but taking advantage of a bonus should reward you with some additional funds.</li>
</ul>



<p>With any site though, make sure it’s a reputable, trustworthy site before you sign up or do anything else. </p>
