<p>It makes sense that other people want to capitalize on the success of Schedule 1. The indie title continues to eclipse all expectations and is one of the most successful games of 2025. Its creator has now commented on other games copying its title, and also given a hint toward a console port.</p>



<p>The days and weeks are going by, and Schedule 1 is showing no sign of slowing up. The player base is reveling in the chance to deal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drugs</a> and show up thugs. An ongoing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-rival-drug-dealer-simulator-says-there-is-no-lawsuit-amid-review-bombing-investigation-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation</a> can’t stop it, and with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new updates adding a Pawn Shop</a> and more value-adding features, it’s hard not to love Schedule 1 right now.</p>



<p>Other companies feel this way as they’re using its name. Schedule 1’s developer has taken to X to address the ongoing movement, and also given hope to PlayStation and Xbox fans.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It might not be on a computer screen forever. Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Tyler_TVGS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tyler1</a> is the main developer at TVGS—the maker of Schedule 1. This is the company’s first game, and they probably didn’t expect this level of success.</p>



<p>On April 11, Tyler took to X to comment on a recent trend concerning the game: “Hi everyone, As you may be aware, there have been some games on the PlayStation store appearing over the past few weeks with the name ‘Schedule I’ in them. Just confirming these are not affiliated with me in any way.”</p>



<p>You get a lot of ‘smaller’ games appearing on the PS Store in the same fashion as Steam. It can be easy for games to slip through the cracks. But as Schedule 1 isn’t on PlayStation, it gives other games (with the name) a chance to be on there. Whether they get to keep the name remains to be seen. But Tyler1 also commented on Schedule 1’s platform status and plans.</p>



<p>“I’d love to port Schedule I to console when the game is at the right stage for that, but I will announce it to the Schedule I community well before it happens,” he says.</p>

<p>Search volume for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 console port</a> is high. The people want it, the people need it, and it’s clear TVGS wants to make it happen. We’ll keep on top of this to see if a Schedule 1 console port does eventually happen.</p>

<p>Balatro creator and developer LocalThunk has praised Blue Prince as one of the best games he’s ever played.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Thunk <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1910361969288225080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>, “Blue Prince is already one of the best games I’ve ever played and I still feel like I’m scratching the surface. Released today but lucky me I’ve been playing it all week (perks of the job)”</p>



<p>“Get a journal, a pen, and buy the game already,” he continued. </p>



<p>Blue Prince is developed by Dogubomb and see’s the player explore a mysterious manor with shifting rooms called Mt. Holly. </p>



<p>“In&nbsp;Blue Prince, you embark on a genre-defying experience, filled with a unique mix of mystery, strategy, and puzzles that weave together to create an unpredictable journey. Will your explorative steps lead you to the rumored Room 46?” the game description reads.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/will-we-finally-get-a-state-of-decay-3-release-date-at-the-xbox-games-showcase.1161504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was announced just yesterday the the next Xbox Games Showcase is set for June 8, and there’s one game that I’m keeping an eager eye open for. I’ve been waiting to hear something about the State of Decay 3 release date for the longest time, and this could finally be when we find out what’s going on.</p>



<p>Presently, the game doesn’t even have a <strong>release year</strong>. The running rumour is that State of Decay 3 will be released in 2026, but Undead Labs and Xbox Game Studios haven’t confirmed a thing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-me-to-the-apocalypse">Take Me To The Apocalypse</h2>



<p>State of Decay 3 is long overdue, in my book. I’m a huge fan of the franchise and adore the sandbox elements of picking a home and building it up while fighting with a band of permadeath survivors to outlive a zombie apocalypse. It’s everything I want in an end-of-the-world, undead epic.</p>



<p>In September 2024, Undead Labs revealed it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-2-end-support-undead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending support on State of Decay 2</a> to focus entirely on the sequel, which means the team will have had almost a year to get the game in shape by the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2025.</p>



<p><strong>Last year</strong>, the Xbox Games Showcase played host to a phenomenal new State of Decay 3 trailer, which I and many other fans lapped up.</p>



<p>We don’t know much at all about State of Decay 3, bar the fact that it’s coming. The new trailer that was released almost a year ago revealed a few tidbits, but it’s nothing that we didn’t already expect from the game, such as fearsome undead enemies, vehicular combat, and multiplayer mechanics.</p>



<p>I’d do malicious things to get my hands on the State of Decay 3 release date – hopefully, something is shown at the upcoming Xbox Games Showcase. It has been almost seven years since the last State of Decay game was released.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a new State of Decay game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
