<p>Season 1 is on the horizon in Black Ops 7, and the first season in the latest Call of Duty title is bringing a host of new content across all game modes, including Zombies.</p>



<p>Zombies in Black Ops 7 launched with two maps, the larger, story-based Ashes of the Damned map, with a smaller segment of the map, Vandorn Farm, used for the Survival mode, and the tally of maps is set to more than double in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>—along with the addition of new enemies and the return of content from other Black Ops titles.</p>

<p>As revealed in the latest blog post ahead of Season 1, which kicks off on December 4, Astra Malorum is the next story map in Zombies where players explore “an evil presence festering in the Dark Aether.”</p>



<p>The map features a new enemy, the O.S.C.A.R Elite Robot, a new Wonder Weapon, the LGM-1, and new traps, alongside the story quest and easter eggs to uncover.</p>



<p>For players grinding through Camo challenges and wanting a change of scenery from Vandorm Farm, Season 1 provides exactly that with Exit 115, another location from the larger Ashes of the Damned map, available in Survival from launch, with the Zorya Observatory following in mid-season.</p>



<p>Alongside the new maps, a slew of new and returning Ammo Mods will become available, including Light Mind and Shatter Blast, Field Upgrades, including Tesla Storm and Frost Blast, and the return of the fan-favorite Perk Mule Kick—all of which have their own Research to complete.</p>



<p>Zombies will also support the addition of seven new weapons, with some available at the start and others arriving mid-season, 11 new Weapon Attachments, while Directed Mode for the Ashes of the Damned story quest will also be available, guiding players through the necessary steps for completion.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Attack on Titan crossover is live with title update 1.1.6; however, the quest is only available for a limited time, until December 22, 2025. </p>



<p>The details about Assassin’s Creed Shadows have been less lately, with AC Mirage taking up the news in recent days. We recently learned the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossed 10 million players</a> thanks to the arrival of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-dlc-patch-notes-new-free-content-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valley of Memory DLC</a>. Now, we are receiving new content for AC Shadows as well, with popular manga and anime series Attack on Titan making its way into the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-attack-on-titan-crossover-will-add-new-skins-for-yasuke-and-naoe">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows’ Attack on Titan Crossover Will Add New Skins for Yasuke and Naoe</h2>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Attack on Titan crossover goes live on November 25 and will run until December 22. During this time, players can take part in a limited-time quest where they face a mysterious, power-hungry faction that has infiltrated feudal Japan and kidnapped a Titan Shifter. There’s a lone survivor with a dark secret who fails to rescue the Shifter and then recruits Naoe and Yasuke to help them out. </p>



<p>To unlock the AOT quest in AC Shadows, players will have to first unlock Yasuke as a playable character and then head to the Yamashiro region, North of Hanazo Tower. While playing the quest, players will unlock new banners and a statue for their hideout and will acquire a crystal katana for Naoe once completed. </p>



<p>Along with the quest, AC Shadows will also receive the Attack on Titan Dual Pack, which is inspired by the series’ universe. This pack includes new outfits, weapons, trinkets, and a new mount. Some of what we saw in the trailer showed Naoe wearing Mikasa Ackerman’s iconic costume, and Yasuke wearing a titan-themed armour. </p>

<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-third-story-drop-a-puzzlement">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Third Story Drop: A Puzzlement</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows title update 1.1.6 introduces the game’s third story drop, along with the Attack on Titan crossover. The new quest is called “A Puzzlement”, and it has been described as fun and humorous. It will feature Yasuke and Naoe engaging with two old acquaintances who are having a loud argument about a mysterious door in South Wakasa, and they have tasked the duo with figuring out how to open it. </p>



<p>The quest will have Yasuke and Naoe learning each other’s skills as well. Naoe will learn to perform her own spectacular version of Yasuke’s war-kick ability. Yasuke will learn to stealthily dispatch enemies non-lethally. Players will also finally be able to settle the debate as to who would win in a straight-up duel between our two protagonists. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Rockstar Games employee dismissals have dominated gaming headlines for several weeks. Now, a new report has revealed the Discord messages that are believed to have led to the termination of 34 Rockstar Games workers.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reported back in October about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Workers allegedly being fired to prevent union forming.</a> Since then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games has claimed that the fired employees were leaking information</a>. There have been protests since, and the company has since been hit with legal action over the firings.</p>



<p>But now, a new development has seemingly uncovered the actual Discord messages at the root of everything.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-games-allegedly-accessed-union-discord-server">Rockstar Games Allegedly Accessed Union Discord Server</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A dark period for Rockstar. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleMakeGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People Make Games</a> released an eye-opening video on November 24 titled: “The Messages Rockstar Saw Before Firing 34 Union Members.”</p>



<p>The reporter claims that they have “since spoken to a Rockstar insider, who has shared screenshots with People Make Games of what they believe to be the messages sent just a few weeks ago on that Discord server, which directly contributed to the firings of these 34 former employees. We also know how Rockstar got hold of these messages as well.”</p>



<p>According to People Make Games, the source is “not one of the fired workers” and isn’t even part of the union. The Discord server has apparently been around since 2022 and consisted of various Rockstar employees.</p>







<p>The reporter’s source claims that “They couldn’t recall a single example of any confidential game details being shared.” It’s said that the beginning of October 2025 saw Rockstar Games revise its policies pertaining to the company Slack—a messaging platform usually used by workplaces.</p>



<p>Various non-essential chats were removed, with the company claiming them to be a “distraction” and a source of “poor conduct”. </p>



<p>This “Slack purge” did not go down well. The union Discord server discussed these changes, with one individual saying: “I would really like to see the evidence for them being too much of a productivity hit. I can’t imagine it being worth the absolute dumpsterfire this will be for morale.”</p>



<p>It’s alleged that Rockstar’s Slack revision email was sent out after 5 PM—and employees can’t check their emails outside of work—and a second email about guidelines and conduct was also pushed. The emails were shared by people still in the office on Discord to inform other colleagues who hadn’t seen them yet.</p>



<p>“This led to one member of the Discord approaching studio management to express concerns about the discussions taking place,” the report adds. Additionally, “I’m told this either contributed to or kicked off an investigation into the Discord by the company, which does line up with the timings we now understand.”</p>



<p>The report claims it’s likely Rockstar did manage to access the union Discord server. Soon after, the whole world learned of the firings, with Rockstar presumably identifying individuals in the union chat who had broken guidelines, weren’t adhering to policy, and potentially attributed this to leaks.</p>



<p>You can see recreations of the Discord messages in the full video below.</p>
