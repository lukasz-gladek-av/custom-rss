<p>Microsoft’s plans for its new Muse AI technology for video games appears to be ready to move into full gear. In a recent interview, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the company is getting ready to start training its new AI system on a “catalog of games”.</p>



<p>Speaking on the Dwarkesh Patel Podcast—h/t to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-train-its-gaming-ai-on-a-catalogue-of-titles-soon-satya-nadella-says-and-then-start-playing-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>—Nadella says that the plan is to train the AI system on games so that it can actually start playing them.</p>



<p>“When&nbsp;Phil Spencer&nbsp;first showed it to me, he had an Xbox controller and this model basically took the input and generated the output based on the input. And it was consistent with the game,” Nadella said.</p>



<p>“That to me is a massive, massive moment of ‘wow’. It’s kind of like the first time we saw ChatGPT complete sentences, or Dall-E draw, or Sora. This is one such moment.”</p>

<p>As far as how this ability and training will help with game development and gamers, in general, Nadella didn’t go into any specifics. </p>



<p>According to Microsoft’s announcement of Muse, not only does it have the potential to assist with game development and accessibility, but it could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-technology-could-help-game-preservation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help with game preservation</a> as well.</p>



<p>The idea of AI in gaming continues to be a much discussed topic. Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-players-want-to-filter-out-games-that-use-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam users began requesting</a> the ability to filter out games that use generative AI.

<p>The debate around the use of generative AI in video games is one of the more hotly debated topics of the last handful of years. While some find the value in what it could mean to the development timeline of larger games, others are worried that it will lead to lower-quality games being released and talent artists and developers losing their jobs. It appears that Steam users are concerned about generative AI in their games as well, and they want to be about to know which games are using the technology.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/10/595140105668154379/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam forum’s suggestions</a> thread, a suggestion to allow players to filter out games made with generative AI has picked up steam—no pun intended—since it was posted earlier this month. </p>



<p>Said original poster AyeforScotland, “I don’t have any interest in playing demos from games that use Generative AI in their development. It would be good if an option was added to filter these games in the same way players can already filter Adult/NSFW content.”</p>



<p>In 27 pages of replies, as of publishing, it appears to be a feature that everyone is in agreement with wanting. And the reasons, while similar, have some specific variance.</p>



<p>“I don’t want to play a game nobody wanted to make,” one user responded. “I want to play things people made, who love what they’ve created.”</p>



<p>Said another: “All the AIs out there are trained on stolen labour. I’d rather not financially support anyone who’s happy to use them to produce games, and every demo download translates into financial support via Steam’s own algorithms.”</p>



<p>What do you think about being able to filter games based on whether generative AI was used or not?
