<p>It may have only launched with two days left in the month, but NBA 2K26 was the best-selling game in the United States (US) for August 2025. According to the latest data from Circana, which looks at sales information from August 3-30, NBA 2K26 only had two days’ worth of data yet still came out on top.</p>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m2op7adeyc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Following the latest</a> from 2K Sports was Madden 26 at number two. Rounding out the top five were Mafia: The Old Country, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and EA Sports College Football 26.</p>



<p>When looking at newly released games that made the Top 20, there were seven new entries. Aside from the four new games mentioned above, Gears of War: Reloaded, the EA Sports Kickoff Bundle that included both Madden 26 and College Football 26, and Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar all joined the list.  Even games like Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba: The Hinokami Chronicles 2, Helldivers 2, and Hogwarts Legacy re-entered the top 20 after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-26-was-julys-best-selling-video-game-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling out in July</a>.</p>



<p>Games that fell out of the top 20 include Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, F1 25, MLB The Show 25, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC 25, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Elden Ring, and Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>
