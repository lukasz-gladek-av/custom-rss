<p>Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem drop is live now, introducing new weapons, mounts, enemies, and more. </p>



<p>The developers of Minecraft have been churning out a lot of content for the game this year. We already received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-vibrant-visuals-happy-ghast-chase-the-skies-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vibrant Visuals and Happy Ghast</a> in June, and now, we are all set to receive Mounts of Mayhem, the next big content update for the title, which you can learn more about below.</p>







<h2 id="h-minecraft-s-mounts-of-mayhem-update-will-introduce-new-weapons-foes-mounts-and-underwater-exploration">Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem Update Will Introduce New Weapons, Foes, Mounts, and Underwater Exploration </h2>

<h4 id="h-mounts-of-mayhem-weapons">Mounts of Mayhem Weapons</h4>



<p>Starting with the weapons, Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem update will add a spear, which is excellent for both hand-to-hand and mounted combat. The weapon’s damage can scale based on the speed of the player. Lunge Enchantment is a new enchantment unique to the spear, which gives players a burst of speed with the jab attack. Moreover, the higher the enchantment level, the farther the player will be able to travel with their attack. </p>



<h4 id="h-zombie-mounts-and-enemies">Zombie Mounts and Enemies</h4>



<p>Then we come to Zombie Mounts, which are not only enemy mobs, but can be tamed to be your own mounts. Zombie Horses are the first; they are passive mobs, but are ridden by spear-wielding zombies. Get rid of them, and the mount is yours. Then we have the Zombie Nautilus, an underwater mob ridden by a trident-wielding drowned. Players will have to tame it by unseating the ride and tempting it with a pufferfish. </p>



<p>The next enemy mob in Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem update is Camel Husks. These are passive mobs, but are spawned with two riders, one with a spear and the other with a bow. What’s more, these mobs are immune to sunlight and will provide a daytime challenge to the player. </p>



<p>Lastly, Mounts of Mayhem will allow players to explore the underwater world of Minecraft in the best way possible. There are three types of mounts: the nautilus, zombie nautilus, and coral zombie nautilus. Each of them can be ridden and provides a speed boost while preserving the player’s existing air supply. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been one of the biggest years for Nintendo in a while with the release of the Switch 2. With two different Nintendo consoles to play games on, and another stellar line of new releases added to the catalog, your Nintendo Wrapped Year in Review for 2025 should make for interesting reading.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-nintendo-switch-games-to-gift-christmas-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> will be back with the 2025 Year in Review. This gives you a comprehensive rundown of all the games you’ve played this year, how many hours you sank into each, the types of games you played, and how many Blue Shells you’ve fired (the last one might be a slight exaggeration).</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-year-in-review-2025-expected-release-date">Nintendo Year in Review 2025 Expected Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So, how did you spend your year? Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Sometime in the third week of December—starting December 15—is when everyone should expect the 2025 Nintendo Year in Review.</strong></p>



<p>Sony seems to be the only company deadset on retaining a consistent Wrapped schedule! Xbox is all over the place, but we can get a rough idea, and Nintendo’s is also a haphazard do-whatever launch.</p>







<p>Nintendo’s 2022 Wrapped was on Tuesday, December 13. This seems quite normal, right? The 2023 stat wrap-up dropped on Friday, December 15. Lastly, the 2024 Nintendo Year in Review arrived before Christmas on Wednesday, December 18.</p>



<p>From this, we can see that Nintendo isn’t attached to a certain day of the week, nor a date. However, the most consistent aspects are that the Nintendo Wrapped always arrives a few days after PlayStation and Xbox, and it’s commonly in the third week of the month.</p>



<p>As of writing, you can presumably look forward to your Year in Review becoming available between December 15 and December 19. Insider Gaming will update this if something drastically changes, and Nintendo shocks everyone.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-nintendo-wrapped-2025-stats">How To Check Nintendo Wrapped 2025 Stats</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s A Go! Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>If the method is the same, all you need to do to check your Nintendo 2025 Year in Review stats is to click the 2025 link once it’s live, log into your Nintendo account, and check out your stats.</strong></p>



<p>Once you’ve done all of this, a plethora of numbers and facts await, and you can question your life choices and whether you need to get out more.</p>



<p>Stat comparisons are always fun. Don’t be afraid to share your end-of-year Nintendo stats with the rest of the IG community, which you can do via the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable source has leaked that Fortnite’s next big anime collaboration is with Bleach, and it’s set to arrive this season. </p>



<p>Fortnite has had several notable anime collaborations in the past, with big names like Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, Jujutsu Kaisen, and more coming to the island. What’s more, we already have one member of the Big 3 anime in the game; a second is set to be added shortly. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-bleach-collaboration-is-expected-to-arrive-this-season">Fortnite Bleach Collaboration is Expected to Arrive This Season </h2>



<p>The collab between Fortnite and Bleach was spotted by <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SamLeakss</a> and corroborated by HYPEX on <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1998589004590301445" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). HYPEX’s new post also revealed that the collaboration will include the song “Number One – Bankai”, the iconic soundtrack that has played several times during crucial moments in the series. </p>



<p>We still don’t know the details about what other content the Bleach x Fortnite collab will bring. If we go by the previous collaborations, then players can expect some new cosmetics for sure, and Bleach has a solid roster of characters, with some popular ones being Ichigo, Kenpachi, Byakuya, Kisuke Urahara, Aizen, Uryū, Yhwach, and more. </p>



<p>On top of that, most anime collaborations have introduced special abilities to the game. Dragon Ball Z introduced the Kamehameha, My Hero Academia brought Deku’s Smash and Todoroki’s Ice Wall, and Jujutsu Kaisen introduced Hollow Purple and the Straw Doll technique. With Bleach’s iconic Bankai song being added, we could get the Bankai ability, with players having to find their own Zanpakutōs on the island. However, this is just speculation. </p>

<p>Use these Geometry Dash monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Diamonds, Mana Orbs and other cosmetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does a combination of the PC classic, Dave and Guitar Hero sound like a fun experience to you? If so, you need to check out the exhilarating experience that is Geometry Dash immediately. Geometry Dash is a popular platformer where syncing your movements to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-music-codes-best-song-ids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">music</a> is of utmost importance. Players are required to guide an icon from one end of the map to the other, all while maintaining the rhythm and avoiding obstacles and other distractions. The game auto-scrolls to the side, meaning that the amount of time players have to make decisions is also quite limited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are 26 distinct levels that come standard in Geometry Dash, with each level having its own unique soundtrack. Another feature that makes Geometry Dash so popular among its players is the level editor. This allows users to create their own custom maps for the game, with the added bonus of being able to select the soundtrack for each level. For players looking to customise their gameplay experience by changing the player icon, there are vaults where this can be done – The Vault, The Wraith Vault, The Vault Of Secrets and The Chamber Of Time. This article provides players with all of the active Geometry Dash codes for each of these vaults.&nbsp;</p>
