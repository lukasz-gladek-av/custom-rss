<p>Escape from Tarkov’s eagle-eyed players have found a hidden map that is accessed via a transition on Shoreline. It’s called The Labyrinth, and it can be found by unlocking a new door in the basement of the Resort and delving down into a mysterious ruin behind a secret, newly-added bunker door.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-labyrinth-on-escape-from-tarkov">How To Find The Labyrinth on Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>To find The Labyrinth in Tarkov, you’ll need to load into a raid on Shoreline and head to the Resort. In the basement near the gym and swimming pool complex, a new door has been added, locked by a key that you’ll find while participating in the new Shadow of Tagilla task line.</p>



<p>The key is called the Knossos LLC Facility Key.</p>



<p>Once you get past that door, you’ll go down into the depths of the building to find a new bunker door that’s locked tight – but there’s a keycard that’ll get you in.</p>



<h3 id="h-where-to-find-knossos-llc-facility-key-in-tarkov">Where to Find Knossos LLC Facility Key in Tarkov</h3>



<p>Players have reported finding the Knossos LLC Facility Key in Tarkov in Shoreline. They’ve <a href="https://x.com/inari_akagane/status/1905349168496845008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picked it up</a> as loose loot just past the main entrance of the West Wing in the computer room on the desk. It has also been found in the small rooms behind the winding staircases in both the East and West wings. </p>



<p>Here’s a graphic from the <a href="https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Hidden_Layer?file=Hidden_Layer_Map_3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov Wiki</a> that will help you find the Knossos LLC Facility Key:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-where-to-find-labrys-keycard-in-tarkov">Where to Find Labrys Keycard in Tarkov</h3>



<p>Players have reported finding the Labrys Keycard, which you’ll need to get into The Labyrinth, on Tagilla and from the Hot Zone quest that you pick up from Ragman after completing the BTR Driver storyline. For completing this event, you get three Labrys Keycards, <strong>and </strong>you unlock the ability to buy it.</p>



<p>To complete Hot Zone, you’ll need to stash LL4 ballistic plates in a secret location on Reserve. This location is on the rooftop of Black Knight, next to a stack of pallets.</p>



<p>From Therapist, the Labrys Keycard will cost you 268,026 rubles, and from Ref, it’s 41 GP coins.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-complete-shadow-of-tagilla-in-tarkov">How to Complete Shadow of Tagilla in Tarkov</h3>



<p>There are three tasks to complete as part of the Shadow of Tagilla event in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>The first is a Ground Zero quest given by Mechanic called Shady Contractor. This will require you to find the Knossos LLC senior manager’s car and pick up their diary, returning it to Mechanic as soon as possible. It’s the black, crashed car outside the small, boarded up car dealership.</p>



<p>Once you’ve done that, you’ll unlock Needle in a Haystack. This is also given by Mechanic, and it unfolds across Ground Zero, Interchange, Streets of Tarkov, and Shoreline. To complete this, you just need to scout several locations:</p>



<ul>
<li>Courtyard park by the TerraGroup HQ on Ground Zero</li>



<li>Kart track on Interchange</li>



<li>Playground on Interchange</li>



<li>Playground near Concordia on Streets of Tarkov</li>



<li>Seaside construction site on Shoreline</li>



<li>Health Resort playground on Shoreline</li>
</ul>



<p>Finally, Hidden Layer will pop, and this task is tied to Shoreline <strong>only</strong>. To finish this task, you’ll need to find the Knossos LLC Facility Key, which I’ve mentioned above. This is how you’ll get into the Knossos LLC facility beneath the Resort. Remember that you’ll still need to get the Labrys Keycard if you want to access The Labyrinth, which is the Knossos LLC facility.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-labyrinth-in-escape-from-tarkov">What is The Labyrinth in Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p>When you get the key <strong>and </strong>the Labrys Keycard and travel to The Labyrinth, you’ll be presented with a mysterious bunker full of haphazard loop and lore, including a reference to a <strong>nuke </strong>triggered by the Cultists that you find in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<div><article><p><span>HOLY FUCKING SHIT IT’S REAL THE NUKE IS IN THE LABRYNTH BOYS WE WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG 
THE NUKE IS REAL </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#EscapefromTarkov</a></p></article></div>







<p>As the story goes, a nuke was detonated over Norvinsk, the region that houses Tarkov, to create an EMP that shut down electronics in the region, which helped to destabilise the area and create the ‘ground zero’ that we know and love exploring in this popular extraction shooter.</p>



<p>You’ll need to tread carefully as you explore The Labyrinth, as it’s filled with puzzles and booby traps, which haven’t yet been documented in maps or guides. Also, four other players can be exploring The Labyrinth at the same time, which means you’re potentially in for a tight fight.</p>



<p>The Labyrinth is available for both PvE and PvP players, which is surprising given recent events.</p>



<p>Also, as you work your way through The Labyrinth in Tarkov, you’ll eventually come face-to-face with the Shadow of Tagilla, a formidable boss that’s drastically unpredictable and very powerful.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3 takes players back home with the return of Verdansk, adding new movement adjustments, original game modes, weapons and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-verdansk-details">Warzone Season 3 Verdansk Details</h2>



<p>With the return of the popular battle royale map, the developers are adopting a back-to-basics approach. The map will now feature 150 players, and the original announcer is returning. Players will be able to shoot during freefall and should expect new infill and exfil cinematics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, with Verdansk, we see the return of the original supply box colours, floating loot, and the original armour satchel. Moreover, the original bus station inventory and the original buy station placement will be returned, too. Furthermore, the Original Armor Box, Deployable Cover, Heartbeat Sensor, Ammunition Box, Recon Drone, and Trophy System will also return.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-movement-adjustments">Warzone Season 3 Movement Adjustments</h2>



<p>Warzone Season 3 makes movement adjustments while keeping omnimovement as the foundation. Originally, the battle royale mode adopted the movement from the multilayer mode; however, the developers have realised that new adjustments are needed to make the gameplay more engaging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With season 3, the player movement speed will be scaled back. These adjustments will help players experience Warzone more in line with its early days. Moreover, the devs are changing omni-sprint speed scaling and slide friction to address the strength of strafe engagements while preserving the feel of sprint-strafe reloading and general movement.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-killstreaks-contracts-and-events">Warzone Season 3 Killstreaks, Contracts and Events</h2>



<p>Keeping the theme of bringing the originals back, Warzone Season 3 will see the return of Original Cluster (Mortar) Strike, Precision Airstrike, and UAV. Moreover, Contracts such as Original Bounty, Most Wanted, and Scavenger Contracts will reappear too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coming to events, players should expect the Original Fire Sale, Jail Break, Loadout Drop, and Restock events along with the Original Capture the Flag Gulag Variant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with Verdansk, players will see the return of another fan-favourite resurgence mode, Rebirth Island. Moreover, the following modes are returning for Verdansk: Battle Royale, Plunder Quads, and Call of Duty: Warzone Bootcamp. There are also some new modes to look out for:&nbsp; Battle Royale Ranked Play and Battle Royale Casual. More game modes will be released mid-season.</p>
