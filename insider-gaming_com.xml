<p>Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most popular multiplayer games in the world, boasting a community made up of millions of players. The ‘online portion’ of the game is thriving and continues to improve with time, but <strong>does Rainbow Six Siege have a campaign</strong>? Is there anything for solo players to do in Rainbow Six Siege?</p>



<p>As something of a live service game, Rainbow Six Siege is kept updated by Ubisoft, getting regular updates that keep the game alive and expanding. That’s all well and good, but what is there for people playing the game on their own? Is there a campaign in Rainbow Six Siege?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-siege-have-a-story-mode">Does Rainbow Six Siege Have a Story Mode?</h2>



<p>There is no campaign in Rainbow Six Siege – and there never has been. It was a development decision made early on by Ubisoft, with the team opting to create a multiplayer-exclusive game that was devoid of a story mode. It was seen as a strange move by some, but it ultimately paid off, making Rainbow Six Siege one of the best multiplayer games ever.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege doesn’t have a campaign, but it has plenty of missions to soak up. There’s also a spin-off title named Rainbow Six Extraction – that has a story to follow, but it’s leagues away from Rainbow Six Siege when it comes to a side-by-side comparison. </p>



<p>Many will argue that Rainbow Six Siege doesn’t <b>need</b> a campaign – it’s all about the multiplayer, and that’s what matters most.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rainbow-six-siege-solo">Can You Play Rainbow Six Siege Solo?</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has a series of offline missions called ‘Situations’ that you can explore without any other player helping you out. In the solo play portion of the game, you can access various zones with any Operator in the game, picking your loadout and taking on a series of missions based on the game’s multiplayer map pool.</p>



<p>It’s a great way to learn the game’s ropes, mechanics, and maps – but it’s not a replacement for multiplayer. That’s where Rainbow Six Siege truly shines.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege keeps going from strength to strength as Ubisoft, the game’s developer, keeps pumping it full of meaningful content updates. With a broad esports ecosystem, millions of players, and a solid multiplayer platform, Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most valuable games in the business. It’s a seamless enough game, but <strong>does Rainbow Six Siege have cross progression</strong>?</p>



<p>For many modern multiplayer games, cross progression mechanics are pivotal to delivering a successful game. Many players are cross-platform gamers these days, which means they’ll likely play the same game on different platforms – PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, and Mobile. This is one of the most electrifying multiplayer titles in the industry, but does Rainbow Six Siege have cross progression mechanics?</p>



<p>Let’s answer that question.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-have-cross-progression-features">Does Rainbow Six Have Cross Progression Features?</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has seamless cross progression between every platform it exists on, ensuring players can recover their progress and keep up the fight no matter what platform they’re playing on. It’s done through the linking of a player’s Ubisoft account, which serves as the ‘middle man mechanic’ between these platforms. </p>



<p>There is a caveat though – certain statistics are shared on a limited basis. Three types of progress are only shared between Xbox and PlayStation or PC and Amazon Luna: Current Rank, Rank History, and Skill MMR. That means you’ll have a different skill rating on PlayStation compared to PC.</p>



<p>Aside from those elements, almost everything is available in Rainbow Six Siege on a cross progression basis. This is a feature that has existed since November 2022, and since then, it has been tried, tested, and approved by the community.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-siege-have-crossplay">Does Rainbow Six Siege Have Crossplay?</h2>



<p>As of 2024, Rainbow Six Siege has a fully seamless ecosystem, allowing players on any platform to play with anyone else. That means that if you’re a PC gamer, you can connect with your friends playing Rainbow Six Siege on PlayStation 5, and vice-versa.</p>



<h2 id="h-faqs">FAQs</h2>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-cross-progression-on-rainbow-six-siege">How to unlock cross-progression on Rainbow Six Siege</h3>



<p>To access cross-progression mechanics, you’ll need to be logged into the same Ubisoft account on the two (or more) platforms.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most electrifying shooters on the market, despite having been released way back in 2015. It boasts a community made up of millions of users, and year after year, Ubisoft keeps pumping the ecosystem full of content. It’s one of the top-most multiplayer titles in the business today, but <strong>is Rainbow Six Siege crossplay</strong>?</p>



<p>It’s one of the biggest questions prospective fans ask before they jump into the game: ‘Is Rainbow Six Siege crossplay?’ It seems that every multiplayer shooter on the market is being released with cross-platform mechanics written into them, but is Rainbow Six Siege one of them?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-rainbow-six-siege-cross-platform">Is Rainbow Six Siege Cross-Platform?</h2>



<p>In an update released in 2024, Ubisoft made Rainbow Six Siege fully crossplay compatible. This change came after years of limited cross-platform mechanics that restricted matchmaking between various platforms.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, PC players could only connect with those running the game on PC and Amazon Luna. On the other hand, console players could only connect with <strong>other </strong>console players – and not PC users. </p>



<p>Now, the entire ecosystem is wide open, and Rainbow Six Siege is fully cross-platform. It’s activated by default on PC (not on console) – but I’ll tell you below how to run off crossplay in Rainbow Six Siege.</p>



<p>It’s worth highlighting a minor point, though.</p>



<p>If you play Ranked on console, you’ll be able to join Ranked matches on PC (with crossplay enabled), but your MMR will be <strong>different </strong>to the MMR you secure on console. This is the only thing to watch out for.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-rainbow-six-siege">How To Turn Off Crossplay in Rainbow Six Siege?</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege crossplay mechanics exist, that much is obvious – but how do you turn off cross-platform in the game?</p>



<p>If you want to matchmake exclusively with players on your platform of choice, you’ll need to access the game’s settings menu, navigate to the ‘General’ tab, find ‘Crossplay Matchmaking’, and switch it <strong>Off</strong>. That’s all that you’ll need to do to connect <strong>only </strong>with just the players on your platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-faqs">FAQs</h2>



<h3 id="h-can-pc-play-with-playstation-on-rainbow-six-siege">Can PC play with PlayStation on Rainbow Six Siege?</h3>



<p>Yes, thanks to the new matchmaking mechanics, you can play Rainbow Six Siege with friends on <strong>any </strong>platform.</p>



<h3 id="h-is-crossplay-switched-on-by-default-in-rainbow-six-siege">Is crossplay switched on by default in Rainbow Six Siege?</h3>



<p>As soon as you start playing Rainbow Six Siege, you’ll have crossplay mechanics switched on, <strong>provided you’re playing on PC</strong>. If you’re a console player, you’ll have to manually switch on crossplay.</p>
