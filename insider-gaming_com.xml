            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of 2025’s biggest and most important titles is a remake—Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. It’s a full remake of MGS3, and the review embargo will tell us if it’s lived up to the original game’s legend, or if it’s fallen flat on its face in Tselinoyarsk mud.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid is an all-time franchise. Its stories still stand the test of time, and there are gameplay ideas that had they not been done previously would be unthinkable in 2025—although looking at the back of the game case would be slightly problematic in the digital era. I don’t think there’s a finer example of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-boss-fights-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MGS than Snake Eater</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater remake</a> is a fitting first reimagining. Even though Hideo Kojima isn’t at the helm of the project, we still expect this to be a hit. So let’s check out its review embargo details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Fans will hang onto the word of reviews. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Several sources have quoted August 22 as the game’s review embargo date, with a release time of 12:01 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Many outlets and critics already seem to have gotten their hands on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. You can see from Destin Legarie’s <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page that this is the case.</p>



<p>Destin is quoted as saying: “I’ve played Metal Gear Solid Delta on PS5 and PC. Embargoed for Friday, August 22nd, 2025 as 12:01am PT. Coverage beyond me fanboying will be live at embargo.”</p>

Embargoed for Friday August 22nd, 2025 as 12:01am PT

Coverage beyond me fanboying will be live at embargo.</span></p></article></div>







<p><strong>Expectations for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater are sky-high, and I expect the reviews to follow suit with a Metacritic score in the region of 90-95.</strong></p>



<p>A telltale sign that Konami is confident about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is that review copies are already out weeks in advance. The other sign is the review embargo date being a week before launch. Companies only do this if they’re confident about their product.</p>



<p>I would suggest Konami is more than happy with the state of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. This is great news when you consider 2004’s original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater has a <strong>91/100 rating</strong> on Metacritic. As long as the remake builds upon existing greatness and adds some modern-day quality of life changes, it’s hard to see the score dropping below 91.</p>



<p>Using my reasoning, I don’t think a <strong>92 or 93</strong> score is out of the question.</p>



<hr>



<p>The wait for the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review embargo will be more excruciating than Naked Snake using CQC to battle a crab. Let me know what score you think the Snake Eater remake is going to score. Be sure to check out the Insider Gaming forum for more MGS discussions.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s release date is rapidly approaching, and we’ve got all the details on the exact start times for launch.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trophy-list-all-achievement-trophy-differences-in-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achievement and trophy list for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has already leaked</a>, raising excitement for the title, and there will be plenty more revealed as we edge ever closer to launch.</p>



<p>If you can’t contain your excitement and want to know how much longer you need to wait to dive into the adventure, we’ve got all the details on the release date and time in this guide. </p>







<figure><figcaption>Are you ready? Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>August 28 is the official release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, which will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>With the release window now rapidly approaching, there should be no delays for Snake Eater, and excitement levels are rising ahead of the remake of the classic from over 20 years ago. If things go well, this could provide the spark for other Metal Gear Solid games to receive the remaster treatment.</p>



<p>The remaster will stay true to the original story, with graphics enhancements and a better frame rate than the original. There’s also a remake of Snake vs Monkeys for those on PlayStation and PC, while Xbox players will be able to enjoy a brand-new creation, Snake vs Bomberman.</p>







<p><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be available from 4pm PT on August 28, according to the PlayStation Store listing.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/JP0101-PPSA15304_00-SNAKEEATERDELUXE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PS Store listing</a> provides the details we are using for this guide, although the timings are subject to change and, on occasion, they will be tweaked closer to launch. We’ll keep a close eye on any changes and update this guide accordingly, if required.</p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve provided a list of some of the most crucial time zones so you can see when Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater releases for you. Although not every time zone is listed, it should make it easier for you to work out the release time for you, if you are outside those listed.</p>

<p>Peak’s popularity continues to rise with almost two million sales last week during a sale on Steam, according to new data.</p>



<p>The title received a significant update recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-adds-cannibalism-in-its-latest-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding cannibalism</a> to the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peaks-first-major-update-adds-a-new-biome-items-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside a new biome</a>, complete with new items and mysteries to solve.</p>



<p>A 38% discount on Steam then went live on August 11, which is still running, propelling Peak to staggering numbers with almost two million sales in the week alone, putting the game on the cusp of 10 million sales overall.</p>



<h2 id="h-peak-approaches-10-million-sales-mark">Peak Approaches 10 Million Sales Mark</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Huge boost. Image via Alinea Analytics</figcaption></figure>



<p>New data published by <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/peak-sold-18-million-copies-last" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a> revealed the impressive numbers, with 1.8 million sales last week, pushing the title to 9.7 million copies sold overall. With the sale price still available, the 10 million mark should be surpassed this week.</p>



<p>Sales have pushed revenue to over $55 million, it’s added, and should Peak pass the 10 million sales mark, it will become the second budget indie title to hit the milestone in 2025, following on from R.E.P.O (16.8 million sales). Last week, revenues are reported to have been $6.9 million.</p>



<p>Those numbers gave Peak the accolade of being the highest-selling title on Steam last week (August 11 to 17), with charts showing the huge rebound in sales numbers for the title, which had seen week-by-week sales steadily decrease since release.</p>



<p>Impressively, Peak sold over 550,000 copies on the weekend alone, while the launch of the Mesa Update on August 11 also brought legacy players back to the game, resulting in a boost to concurrent players.</p>



<p>Is Peak one of the best games to release in 2025? Should it be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3332/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression-on-xbox-playstation-pc-cross-platform-status-explained.1272846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hell may not have frozen over, but the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X|S is rapidly approaching and shows that nothing can be ruled out. If you want to know whether the release on the platform includes cross-progression, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<p>Due to be released on Xbox on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-helldivers-2-release-on-xbox-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, though there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-have-no-plans-of-putting-it-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no plans to bring the title to the Game Pass service</a>, Arrowhead Games’ title is one of the biggest releases of the summer for the platform and shows a major shift in approach from Sony, which published the title.</p>



<p>If you’ve already played Helldivers 2 on PC or PlayStation and want to know whether you can transfer your progress and any unlocked content to a different platform, like Xbox, we’ve got a full explanation on the feature.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression">Does Helldivers 2 Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Arrowhead Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Helldivers 2 does not support cross-progression between platforms, and any unlocked content is only available on the existing version.</strong></p>



<p>An<a href="https://arrowhead.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12517679456156-Does-Helldivers-2-have-cross-progression-Can-I-transfer-my-stuff-to-another-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> FAQ published by Arrowhead</a> in July, it was confirmed that any progression, including limited-time content, cannot be transferred between accounts. It was also confirmed that accounts cannot be merged.</p>



<p>This means, for example, that Xbox players will not be able to show off any content from earlier seasons in Helldivers 2, with any unlocks before the Xbox release being unavailable on the platform. However, you also can’t share your account between PlayStation and PC either.</p>



<p>Although cross-progression is unavailable, crossplay support is offered between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, so you can play with friends regardless of their platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-cross-progression-be-added-to-helldivers-2">Will Cross-Progression be Added to Helldivers 2?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that cross-progression will be added to Helldivers 2, as Arrowhead stated there are “no plans to implement cross-progression at this time.”</strong></p>



<p>While you can never say never, it’s clear that cross-progression is not a priority for the development team, and if the stance were to change, it would likely take a lengthy amount of time for the feature to be implemented.</p>



<p>There could be additional demand for cross-progression following the launch of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X|S, particularly as many players may have opted to purchase the game on PS5 or PC due to the previous unavailability on Xbox. </p>



<p>Do you want to see cross-progression added to Helldivers 2? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Will There be Another Battlefield 6 Open Beta?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/will-there-be-another-battlefield-6-open-beta/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/will-there-be-another-battlefield-6-open-beta.1272843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 community is now without BF6 content again. Two weekends of betas have seen you all rack up millions of eliminations, building destructions, and more. So let’s see if EA and Battlefield Studios are planning another Battlefield 6 beta before the game’s release window.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> was a limited testing phase for BF6. Early indicators were good, but all this did was make the BF community feverish to try it out for itself. The first chance arrived with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-early-access-to-the-battlefield-6-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access Open Beta</a>. Another couple of days passed, and it was time for worldwide destruction. </p>



<p>This couldn’t have been more fitting as the BF6 beta destroyed all expectations, the game blew up, and Battlefield 6 destroyed CoD with over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 concurrent players</a> in the betas. With the Weekend 2 beta now finished, we need to see if you get one more chance to play before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-going-to-be-more-battlefield-6-betas">Is There Going to be More Battlefield 6 Betas?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It was a good run. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 Comms page suggests that there will be no more Battlefield betas, and the next time you get to play BF6 is when the game comes out.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been playing the BF6 beta at any point, chances are you’ve been keeping up with the Battlefield Comms X page. This has been a constant source of information since day one. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-dlss-dlaa-not-working-issue-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLSS and DLAA updates</a> to general bulletins on matchmaking, it has provided up-to-date details.</p>



<p>On August 18, it posted what appeared to be a farewell message on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> for BF6 beta testing:</p>



<p>“Thank you all for playing throughout these Open Beta weekends. You made this truly special for us as you captured flags, controlled sectors, blew holes in buildings, charged into combat, nailed vehicles with RPGs, dove into fire to resurrect a teammate, sniped from different angles, pushed the line forward in tanks, and circled the battlefield in aerial combat. You truly showcased the huge variety of action-packed gameplay that is coming in Battlefield 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-battlefield-6-come-out">When Does Battlefield 6 Come Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 is due for release on October 10, and this is likely the next time you get to play BF6.</strong></p>



<p>Unless something catastrophic happens between now and October 10, I think it’s a case of waiting a while until the full launch, as there won’t be any more betas. Battlefield Labs testing lasted many weeks. Thousands of hours were accrued during the Open Betas, too. I would hazard a guess that Battlefield Studios has accumulated all the data and feedback it needs.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Servers Closing Down Soon

The playlist options and game servers for Open Beta Weekend 2 will begin closing down in 1 hour at 12:00 UTC. Once the shut down starts, you’ll be able to continue to play until your match ends.

Thank you all for playing throughout these Open Beta</span></p></article></div>
