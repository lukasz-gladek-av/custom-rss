<p>A medieval massacre awaits in Half Sword. The innovative physics game wants you to maim, and blood will be the price of glory. In terms of Half Sword’s actual price and how much it costs, that’s where this guide enters the fight.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming described Half Sword as ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hilarious-medieval-combat-early-access-half-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most hilarious medieval combat sim</a>.’ If you’ve not seen it yet, you need to. Thousands of you have already begun your crusade to lop off limbs and put down your enemies like dirty dogs, courtesy of the free demo.</p>



<p>Eventually, Half Sword will be available to buy, and this is where you need to know its cost and price tag.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-sword-price-explained">Half Sword Price, Explained</h2>

<p><strong>It’s been confirmed through the Half Sword Discord that the combat game will be under $30 when it launches in early access, with a discount at launch.</strong></p>



<p>There isn’t a more concrete price tag at the moment, but the faq section in the Half Sword Discord has clarified some price details:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Price is still TBA. It will be less then $30 and the first two weeks of EA will feature a discount.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You’ve got a brief window to get early access for a more bank account-friendly price. The Half Sword Discord is extremely active with thousands of players, and the development team provides updates regularly. There’s every chance there will be a full price tag update before launch; if not, everyone will find out together on release day.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-half-sword-have-microtransactions">Does Half Sword Have Microtransactions?</h2>



<p><strong>You might be pleased to hear that Half Sword will feature no microtransactions of any kind.</strong></p>



<p>Diverting back to the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1043854763189600337/1272470349245579396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">faq</a>, when addressing the question of “Will there be microtransactions?” it has a simple and blunt, one-word answer: “No.”</p>



<p>There might be some free extra content released after launch, or maybe fuller expansions (it is only early access, though), but it’s confirmed there will be no microtransactions.</p>



<p>Half Sword easily looks like one of the most promising and fun games of 2026. The concept looks brutal, and the price tag isn’t going to give your wallet a headache.

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Proposes 200 Job Cuts At Paris Headquarters]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/</link>
            <guid>1416454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> is already looking at cutting jobs, just days after its announced company-wide restructuring.</p>



<p>According to a new report, Ubisoft is proposing cutting up to 200 jobs at its Paris headquarters. These jobs would be filed under a Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) that allows employees to come to a “mutual termination agreement.”</p>



<p>Ubisoft currently employees 1,100 people at its Paris office.</p>







<p><strong>“In line with last week’s announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives, Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France,”</strong>&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft spokesperson said to IGN</a> on the matter. </p>



<p>Ubisoft says that this remains just a proposal at this point. A final decision can’t come until an agreement is made between the company and employees. It then has to be “validated by French authorities”.</p>



<p><strong>“The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide,”</strong> Ubisoft said.</p>







<p>It’s unclear exactly how many jobs could be lost across the entire company over the next two years. Based on past history, it wouldn’t be surprising to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see another 2,000 or more people</a> lose their jobs during that time span. </p>



<p>On January 21, Ubisoft announced that it was going through a company-wide restructure. These plans called for the cancelation of six games, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>. It also saw the company split into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five “creative houses”</a> that would oversee various Ubisoft franchises. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Headwinds Trailer ‘Leak’ Reveals Solos vs Squads Mode]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-trailer-leak-reveals-solos-squads/</link>
            <guid>1416388</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Headwinds, the first major ARC Raiders update of 2026, is set to drop tomorrow. It’ll introduce a new matchmaking option, a fresh player project, some hot new cosmetics, <strong>and </strong>probably a few new quests. Earlier today, the trailer for that update was ‘leaked’ early, with a Japanese Embark Studios social profile posting the short video ahead of whatever the intended drop time was.</p>



<p>The trailer was taken down, but not before users managed to capture the footage and circulate it on social media. Above all else, it reveals that a bizarre new ‘solos vs squads’ matchmaking option is coming into effect with Headwinds.</p>







<h2 id="h-headwinds-will-be-here-in-24-hours">Headwinds Will Be Here in 24 Hours</h2>



<p>Headwinds is an all-new update coming to ARC Raiders tomorrow. Embark Studios’ extraction adventure title suffered a little over the festive break with stagnation and some issues with cheaters and exploits, but now it’s all systems go. The team recently published a roadmap that covers four months of content, including tomorrow’s Headwinds update.</p>



<p>We’re not getting a new ARC Raiders map or large-scale enemy until <strong>April</strong>, but there’s still plenty on the way.</p>



<p>Per the ‘leaked’ trailer, we know that Headwinds is set to include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Solos vs Squads matchmaking mechanics</li>



<li>New map condition – Bird City</li>



<li>Project: ARC Trophy Display</li>



<li>New cosmetics: The Sandwalker set</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>The first item on the list was previously known as the ‘LVL 40+ Matchmaking Option’, which left players wondering what that might look like. Nobody predicted it would be a solos vs squads mode, but it’s certainly a place for the most capable players to strut their stuff.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, we can imagine that Sandstorm will be an offensive map condition that forces players indoors, much like Cold Snap did, while the Sandwalker set will be themed very much <strong>on </strong>that condition.</p>



<p>The ARC Trophy Display project will give players something to aim for over the next few weeks. It’s likely a construct that pops up in your Raider Den that gives you the option to display literal trophies from the ARC enemies you slay outside Speranza.</p>
