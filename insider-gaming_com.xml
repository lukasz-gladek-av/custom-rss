<p>One of the most popular, albeit controversial, skateboarders of all time is going to be in the next Tony Hawk game after all. According to The Nine Club podcast, Bam Margera will be in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 after all.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thenineclub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent episode</a> of the show, host Roger Bagley explained what happened to get Margera into the game after it was noticed at the reveal that he wasn’t part of the roster.</p>



<p>Bagley claims that the game was done and that Margera wasn’t going to be a part of it at all. Hawk himself then reportedly put his foot down to get him on the game’s roster.</p>



<p>“Tony called up Activision and was like ‘hey, we’re putting Bam in the thing’, and they were like ‘hey, we can’t’,” Bagley said. “He goes ‘no, you’re gonna do it’, and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/24/bam-margera-featured-tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> has since corroborated the claims, saying that Activision flew Margera out to Los Angeles recently to do motion capture work for the game. Prior to his, now likely, inclusion in the upcoming remake, Margera had appeared in seven Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater Games starting with the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 in 2001. His last appearance was in 2007’s Tony Hawk’s Proving Ground.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for comment on the claim and will update this story should a response be received. </p>



<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is set to release on July 11 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It’ll also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC.</p>

<p>Minecraft has been out for over 15 years, and many fans have questioned if the time was right for the game to finally go free-to-play. If you happen to be one of those fans, you’re not going to like the answer.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Minecraft executive producer Ingela Garneij said that neither Microsoft nor Mojang have any plans for the game to go the free-to-play route. </p>



<p>“Yeah, it doesn’t really work with the way we built it,” she said when posed with the question. </p>



<p>Garneij continued: “I mean we built the game for a different purpose. So monetization doesn’t work in that way for us. It’s a purchase of the game and then that’s it. For us it’s important that our game is available for as many people as possible. And so I think that’s a very core value that it should be accessible for everyone. It’s the best deal in the world.”</p>

<p>Minecraft first launched on PC in May 2009 before released a full 1.0 release in November 2011. It debuted on console when it released for Xbox 360 in May 2012 and is now available on every major platform.</p>



<p>Since its launch, the game has sold over 300 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time. The game, alongside its developer Mojang, was purchased in 2014 by Microsoft for $2.5 billion.</p>

<p>Just a week before the full Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event on April 2, Nintendo is expected to hold a separate event sometime this week. That’s according to well-known leaker Nate The Hate.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1904275415075606643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Monday, Nate The Hate said that he’s “heard there is a Nintendo presentation this week”. He added that he believes it will be on or around Thursday, and that “it’ll be a Direct”.</p>



<p>“I’m not 100% certain on the format at present,” he said.</p>



<p>Also unknown is what type of games will be shown during the event, if it happens. Will it focus exclusively on games releasing for the current Nintendo Switch, or will Switch 2 games be teased or shown as well?</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nintendo for comment on the claims, but the company won’t comment on rumor or speculation.</p>



<p>What do you think about a final Nintendo Direct before the full Switch 2 reveal next week? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
