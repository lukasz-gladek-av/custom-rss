            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new and somewhat bizarre post on social media, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov has asked his followers what should be done with Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform. The contentious mode has been a point of debate since surfacing in June 2024, and Nikita hosted a poll with three options, two of which were ‘make it free’ or ‘delete it’.</p>



<p>The poll surfaced on social media after Nikita responded to a post from a critic who ‘refunded Escape from Tarkov’ after discovering that the PvE mode <strong>was not free</strong> and is instead a paid-for bolt-on.</p>







<h2 id="h-and-our-survey-says">And Our Survey Says…</h2>



<p>The feedback on Nikita’s tongue-in-cheek poll is clear, and the bulk of Escape from Tarkov users either want PvE to be <strong>free </strong>or <strong>deleted entirely</strong>. At the time of publishing, 53.1% of voters (out of 17,000 votes) want PvE to be entirely free. That was supposed to be the case years ago when the concept first surfaced, but Battlestate Games went a different way with things.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The second-most popular option was ‘delete PvE’, which garnered 29.4% of the votes, assumedly from diehard PvP fans who believe that the PvE offering has long diluted what it means to be an Escape from Tarkov fan.</p>



<p>Nikita has been in the weeds with it recently and stressed in a new interview just a few days ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-ten-years-of-tarkov-miracle/">Escape from Tarkov is his life</a>, and he couldn’t imagine existing without the game. In our most recent episode <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-interview-tarkov-console-frustrating/">of Access Granted</a>, we sat down with Nikita, and he walked us through what it means to be an Escape from Tarkov developer.</p>



<p>Spoiler: It’s a mindset thing, and if you don’t have it, you’re not a Tarkov dev.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform isn’t going anywhere. Nikita said minutes after posting the poll that it’s all a big joke to poke fun at people complaining about PvE in the first place.</p>



<p>If anything, Tarkov’s PvE offering is getting stronger through 2026. There are some updates planned that will even introduce a PvE mode to Escape from Tarkov: Arena, so if you want to play <strong>that game </strong>but don’t want the stress of real players, you’ll be catered to soon.</p>







<p>Do you play Escape from Tarkov’s PvE mode, and if so, what do you think of it? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[8 Rare Fortnite Skins That Need to Return in 2026]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite has a staggeringly long list of skins introduced over the years, ranging from original creations to huge collabs, and some have become extremely rare heading into 2026 after a long wait for a return to the Item Shop.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has selected eight of the rarest skins that Epic Games should have near the top of the list to return at some point in 2026, so keep an eye in the Item Shop for these appearances.</p>







<h2 id="h-rarest-fortnite-skins-that-need-to-return">Rarest Fortnite Skins That Need to Return</h2>



<h3 id="h-travis-scott">Travis Scott</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Heavily-requested. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>There seems to be murmurs of Travis Scott’s long-awaited return to the Item Shop every month, but fans are still waiting for the Icon Series Outfit to return, a wait that has gone beyond 2,000 days.</p>



<p>August 2020 was the last time that the Travis Scott skin was available in Fortnite, an audaciously long time for such an iconic look and community-requested skin, but there’s high hopes that 2026 is the year of a return.</p>



<h3 id="h-kratos">Kratos</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Pray to the Gods. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Kratos Gaming Legends Series Outfit is regularly cited among the favorites that players are desperate to see return to the Item Shop, but the God of War giant has not made an appearance since March 2021.</p>



<p>2026 is a huge year for the God of War franchise, with murmurs of the next game in the series due to release on PlayStation in the window, and filming for the Amazon TV series set to begin, so it’s the perfect time for Kratos to return.</p>



<h3 id="h-reflex">Reflex</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Strange absence. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although perhaps not as eye-catching as some of the other skins on this list, particularly with the huge collabs waiting to be seen, the absence of the Reflex outfit from the Item Shop is staggering, and it stands as one of the rarest skins in all of Fortnite.</p>



<p>The Reflex skin last appeared in March 2019, which was only it’s second appearance in the Item Shop after an initial release in November 2018, and those limited appearances have made the outfit extremely rare.</p>



<h3 id="h-mike-lowrey">Mike Lowrey</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Bad Boys. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>An iconic face from the Bad Boys franchise, Mike Lowrey was initially introduced in Chapter 2, Season 7 in 2021, and made several appearances in the Item Shop that year, but has not appeared since.</p>



<p>All of the appearances of the Mike Lowrey outfit in the Item Shop came in the release year, but a reapparance of the collab skin could be on the agenda for 2026 as discussions about a new movie continue to ramp up.</p>



<h3 id="h-marcus-fenix">Marcus Fenix</h3>



<figure><figcaption>E-Day. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another Icon of the Gaming Series, the Marcus Fenix skin, quite frankly, has to return in 2026, in a year that is set to be huge for the Gears of War franchise with the release of Gears of War: E-Day, a prequel title set 15 years before the original game.</p>



<p>Themed around the older version of the beloved character seen in the latter games of the franchise, there could be scope for a new skin to tie into E-Day in 2026 but, even so, the existing Marcus Fenix skin needs to appear, with the last occurence in the Item Shop coming in December 2022.</p>



<h3 id="h-aloy">Aloy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Horizon. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s a bit of a trend existing for collabs in the Gaming Icon Series not appearing in the Item Shop regularly, which also extends to Aloy, the face of PlayStation’s Horizon franchise. Compared to others on the list, a last appearance in March 2023 pales, but it’s still too long of a wait for an iconic look.</p>



<p>The future of the Horizon franchise looks promising, with the next game in the series surely on the cards alongside a big Hollywood adaptation, and Sony may be holding off for future releases before allowing Aloy to feature again.</p>



<h3 id="h-lebron-james">LeBron James</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The King. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most famous sports players to have ever lived, LeBron James’ Fortnite skin has not been available since April 2023, and the return is eagerly anticipated due a different approach for the skin that provides unlockable cosmetics.</p>



<p>Purchasing the skin unlocks a series of Quests to complete, with two additional styles, giving players more bang for their V-Bucks when compared to other skins.</p>



<h3 id="h-leon-s-kennedy">Leon S. Kennedy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Permanent Resident. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>The iconic face of the Resident Evil franchise surely has to return in 2026, right? Given there’s a big release around the corner for the series in February, heavily rumored to have another appearance from Leon himself, it would be the perfect time for the skin to return.</p>



<p>Players have not been able to purchase the Leon S. Kennedy skin in Fortnite since April 2023, just a month after its initial release in March of the same year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lionsgate Confirms AAA John Wick and SAW Games In Development]]></title>

<p>For years, fans of the high-octane gun-fu franchise, John Wick, have been crying out for a decent game tied to the series. The nature of the film franchise almost writes itself as a video game, but despite a couple of low-budget titles, nothing has really emerged in the space.</p>



<p>During a recent earnings call, Lionsgate Chairman Adam Fogelson confirmed that a ‘AAA John Wick game’ is in development and will be officially announced soon. He also mentioned that a new ‘SAW’ game is also incoming, the first since 2010’s SAW II: Flesh and Blood.</p>







<h2 id="h-john-wick-game-could-be-coming-soon">John Wick Game Could Be Coming Soon</h2>



<p>The recent earnings call at Lionsgate gave way to a solid revelation, and soon, we’ll have an official announcement of an all-new John Wick game <strong>and </strong>a SAW project. In a snippet pulled from the earnings call, Adam Fogelson, Chairman at Lionsgate, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities. around John Wick and Saw and some others that we’ll be announcing soon.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/aaa-john-wick-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>It was further mentioned that Lionsgate has acknowledged the ‘increased interest’ fans have in adaptations of the popular franchises under its belt, like <strong>John Wick</strong>.</p>



<p>What’s not clear is what a John Wick AAA game could look like. It’s up in the air, and fans are eagerly debating the possibilities, such as an extension of John Wick’s story, played out by Keanu Reeves, or a unique, original story that allows players to create their own diehard assassin character.</p>



<p>Being frank, it’s most likely the latter possibility, as this would allow the developers much more creative freedom, both in terms of the story and the setting.</p>



<p>Fans then set about pulling apart the rest of Lionsgate’s line-up, surmising what other IP could be yanked into the video game world. One concept saw The Hunger Games emerge as an all-new battle royale game or a dystopian, post-apocalyptic epic of sorts.</p>
