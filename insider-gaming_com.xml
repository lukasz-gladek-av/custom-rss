<p>Marvel Rivals was released yesterday, and it wasted no time skyrocketing up the charts with reckless abandon. On Steam, the game managed to secure a whopping peak player count of 444,000 users, marking the game as one of the most successful free-to-play titles on the platform right off the rip.</p>



<p>That performance continued throughout the day, and going into the weekend, player numbers, streaming figures, and the social sentiment around the game continued to grow heading into the weekend.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is perhaps the most potent Overwatch competitor to ever surface – considering Deadlock isn’t here yet, anyway.</p>



<p>In this superhero-themed title, players are treated to the classic hero shooter elements found in and arguably popularised by Overwatch, but the entire roster is made up of instantly recognisable Marvel heroes. From Iron Man to The Punisher and from Groot to Storm, there’s a veritable plethora of performers for players to assume control of.</p>



<p>I <strong>hate </strong>hero shooters, but I’m pleased to say that, being a Marvel fan, Rivals has me hooked.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky year for live-service shooters, what with the loss of Concord and the impending shutdown of XDefiant, so it’s enriching to see a similar title emerge with such gusto into the gaming space.</p>



<p>The reviews <strong>could be better</strong>, but most of the negative press seems centred around Marvel Rivals not doing enough to distance itself from Overwatch, but that’s kind of the point of the game. It’s an alternative option and a competitor – it’d be tough to replace Overwatch if it wasn’t a lick like the game.</p>



<p>NetEase, the developer behind Marvel Rivals, has already revealed some innovative features that are going to help the game stand out. For instance, just days ago, the team stressed that season-based battle passes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-mechanic-change-monetisation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be time-bound</a>, so you’ll be able to unlock missed rewards long after the season has ended.</p>

<p>Myth returned to Twitch recently, with audiences welcoming him back after a lengthy hiatus. It was his first stream on the platform since June 2022, and it saw the popular content creator play Fortnite as OG was ushered back into the game.</p>



<p>His return to the site wasn’t the most successful resurfacing ever, with Myth netting a peak viewer count of just 19,500, prompting many to suggest he’s forever his profile on the platform. He did take the time to reveal why he was away for so long, though – and it’s because he was securing a bag from YouTube, of course.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-bucks">Big Bucks</h2>



<p>Myth confirmed mid-stream that YouTube paid him $4 million for two years of work on the platform. That’s alongside all the paid subscriptions and donations he’d have earned while streaming on the site. </p>



<p>To put that into perspective, xQc signed a $100 million deal to stream on Kick.com.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Since 2022, Myth has been exclusive to YouTube, on which he currently boasts a whopping 4.5 million subscribers.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many will say that Myth has ‘fallen off’ over the last year. In August, he announced he would be taking a lengthy break from streaming, and it was only yesterday that he resurfaced. In this game, you can become irrelevant <strong>very </strong>quickly, and plenty claim that the pause in producing content left a mark.</p>



<p>Back in February, the streamer was broadcasting to little more than 100 viewers, prompting fans to surmise what could be wrong behind the scenes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/otvandfriendsrumors/comments/1ah5i3r/seeing_myth_stream_to_193_viewers_yesterday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">platforms like Reddit</a>.</p>
