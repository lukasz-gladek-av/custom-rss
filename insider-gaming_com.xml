<p>Atomfall fits <strong>very nicely </strong>into my wheelhouse. It’s (kind of) a post-apocalyptic, semi-open-world adventure set in the rolling hills of Cumbria, England, and it’s riddled with combat sequences, stealthy escapades, and dense mysteries. I recently played Atomfall for just over an hour, exploring more of what is my most anticipated game of 2025.</p>



<p>My exclusive session took place a few hours into the game, so I had plenty of toys to play with, and I quickly found myself plunged into a stunning world fraught with danger, intrigue, and opportunity.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-atomfall-is-coming">Atomfall is Coming</h2>



<p>Atomfall has been described as ‘Fallout in the United Kingdom’, and that’s not far off the mark. It has post-apocalyptic vibes, roaming robots, mutated creatures, and a solid mix of factions. The world is dangerous and expansive, the survival elements are front and centre, and the game boasts a branching narrative that can be approached from multiple angles.</p>



<p>It also has skill paths, it suits a range of play styles, and the core of the story is set around a nuclear disaster.</p>



<p>I’ve had my eye on Atomfall since it was revealed, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at Gamescom 2024</a>, I had the chance to play an earlier build – and fell in love. This extended preview that I recently enjoyed was nothing short of sumptuous, giving me the freedom to explore a large area of the game and uncover some key secrets – which I won’t spoil here.</p>



<h2 id="h-atomfall-my-impressions">Atomfall – My Impressions</h2>



<p>From what I’ve seen, Atomfall is turning into a sharpened survival title with more than a few innovations. The world looks brilliant, combat feels satisfying, and the gameplay focuses nicely on a balance between open-endedness and dedicated investigations. It’s a mystery game at heart, and players are tasked with ultimately solving what happened in the world to cause this disaster.</p>



<p>There are multiple endings, which can be discovered by aligning with or turning against factions, but it all boils down to getting access to the Windscale Power Plant and finding out what happened – and dealing with it accordingly. That’s the gist I’ve got from my experience with Atomfall, anyway.</p>



<p>Along the journey, players must contend with rampaging raiders, twisted tribes, and some fairly ethereal enemies. It’s not all aggressive, though – there are plenty of friendly, generous folks out there in Atomfall, should you be willing to risk the wilderness to find them.</p>



<p>I had nothing but a good time with Atomfall. I love the pacing of the game, which is fairly slow but can quickly turn on its head when you get into a fight. It’s designed for the player to prioritise stealth and subterfuge over bold-faced combat, which is a refreshing change from the games I’m used to playing of late.</p>



<p>In the hour that I played, I didn’t experience any issues, and I found myself genuinely interested in learning about the events of the world around me through notes, books, and other scraps I could pick up to inform me about the game’s lore. There’s a lot to catch up on, and I’m <strong>intrigued and eager </strong>to learn more.</p>



<p>The set pieces are nice, the animations are clean, and some of the more technical mechanics, like the need to manage your stamina and inventory, present a fair challenge without being too finicky. </p>



<p>I can’t wait for more.</p>



<p>Atomfall will be released on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC on March 27.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-wwe-2k25">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements in WWE 2K25?</h2>



<p><strong>WWE 2K25 has a Chris Jericho-sized list of 66 PlayStation 5 Trophies and 61 Xbox Achievements. But if you’re on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, you only get 61 and 56 extra accomplishments respectively.</strong></p>



<p>This is because of The Island. A new game mode introduced in WWE 2K25—but it’s exclusive to PS5 and Xbox Series X. Meaning, if you’re on last-gen, not only do you miss out on The Island, you can’t get the five DLC trophies or achievements either.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield Releases Its First Community Update on Battlefield Labs Playtests]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-first-playtest/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-releases-its-first-community-update-on-battlefield-labs-playtests.1127925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-first-playtest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlefield Labs will have its first-ever playtest for the next Battlefield game today and with it, the developers have released the first community update.</p>



<p>The update is intended to keep the entire community updated on Battlefield Labs – even those not in the playtest. For the first test, Battlefield Labs will be testing the games Gun and Movement. If you’re not in the test, players can still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up to Battlefield Labs</a>. </p>



<p><strong>The first Battlefield Labs test update reads:</strong></p>



<p>We’ve continually evolved our gunplay and movement mechanics throughout the Battlefield series. Now, within Battlefield Labs, we’re focused on refining the best elements from past titles, modernizing them, and validating if they feel fun and rewarding, and have the right balance between intuitive control and dynamic combat.</p>



<p>We’re designing the combat experience to ensure players of all skill levels can enjoy our gunplay and movement systems. Our goal is to offer gameplay that rewards skill with precise weapon feedback and movement options for veterans, while providing an intuitive experience for new players to learn and enjoy.</p>



<p>For gunplay we’re exploring designs centered on helping you learn and develop skills and muscle memory through action, as weapons naturally signal their recoil direction. This feedback loop allows you to understand and adjust your aim, making it easier to handle different weapons. This system not only adds variety but also enhances each weapon’s unique feel and play style.</p>



<p>Movement is also deeply integrated with gunplay, as your actions and targets are all part of the same cohesive combat experience. We aim to make movement both feel intuitive and rewarding to move within the world and during combat, but also when playing against someone using both the gunplay and movement systems to their maximum potential.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-and-improved-for-gunplay-and-movement">What’s new and improved for gunplay and movement?</h2>



<p>Initially we’ll test select but important areas that create the foundation required to create a fun and rewarding Battlefield combat experience. We’re making focused efforts to create consistent and optimized millisecond-to-millisecond soldier combat, and we’ll share some key examples of changes that will be available during our initial playsessions.</p>



<p>We’ve reduced the time it takes for bullets to appear on your screen from when you press fire. This change decreases input delay, makes shooting feel more responsive, and helps you better track and hit moving targets.</p>



<p>We’re optimizing for a 60Hz tick rate, ensuring the game server more frequently updates the positions and actions for all players. This results in responsive gameplay across all platforms and inputs. You’ll notice more precise shooting and movement, enhanced damage feedback, and more accurate representation of other players’ positions and combat outcomes.</p>



<p>We’ve adjusted the recoil system to make the different weapon types feel unique when firing them. Through enhancements to gunplay recoil, camera shakes, and firing settles, each shot’s recoil direction now matches its gameplay angle. The weapon visually stabilizes the more accurate your handling is, making you feel like you’re actually firing and controlling it.</p>



<p>To evolve the moment system we’ve revamped animations and reintroduced movement features such as crouch sprint, combat dive and landing roll, and added visual indicators to make it easier to understand when movements such as vaulting or leaning are possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-feedback-and-validation">Feedback and Validation</h2>



<p>At this stage content within Battlefield Labs is pre-alpha, and playsessions take place within a closed dev environment focused on testing small chunks of a larger array of features. Some gameplay features are placeholder, work-in-progress and with bugs and performance not being representative of the final experience. However, even during this early stage of development you’ll get a good sense of our new design approach.</p>



<p>During our first playsession our teams will be validating the systems and stability of Battlefield Labs such as server performance, while participants will be able to familiarise themselves with what’s next for Battlefield through testing the gunplay and movement experience, focused on:</p>



<ul>
<li>Feel of the different weapon archetypes</li>



<li>Improvements to aim and control</li>



<li>Weapon balance and fun factor</li>



<li>Look and feel of movement</li>



<li>Moving and interacting within the map</li>



<li>Combat pacing</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-stay-tuned">Stay Tuned</h2>



<p>Lastly, a reminder that while our playsession will be within a closed environment, and we can’t invite everyone to every session, we’ll make sure to keep you informed on ongoing Battlefield Labs playsessions and learnings through these regular Community Updates.</p>



<p>We’ll be back in the coming weeks to talk more about our learnings from our first playsessions, as well as another feature focused Community Update.</p>



<p>Have you already signed up to the Battlefield Labs playtests? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;if you have any success.</p>

<p>It’s time for the cream of the crop. Balatro’s Legendary Jokers are the rarest and some of the most devastating. Getting a Soul Card is quite difficult and only happens every few hours of gameplay (unless you’re lucky), but you learn to savor a Legendary Joker if you get the chance to use one.</p>



<p>Take a look at the greatness each Legendary Joker holds.</p>
