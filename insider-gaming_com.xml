<p>During the State of Play event, Split Fiction, the new project from Hazelight, received a new trailer showcasing some of parts of the campaign.</p>



<p>Hazelight is the studio behind popular titles like A Way Out and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=it+takes+two">It Takes Two</a>, with the latter winning the Game of the Year award in 2019.</p>

<p>Continuing their established style, Split Fiction is a cooperative game featuring two protagonists, Mio and Zoe. The two are writers who specialize in distinct genres; one focuses on sci-fi adventures while the other creates fantasy stories. In the beginning of the game, they find themselves trapped within their own narratives.</p>



<p>With a diverse level design, stunning visuals, and highly creative gameplay, Split Fiction could be a serious contender for Game of the Year.</p>



<p>Split Fiction will be released on March 6th for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and the EA app. Players will also be able to invite a friend to play for free on any platform (with crossplay between PS, Xbox &amp; PC) using the Friend Pass.</p>

<p>During the State of Play, Build A Rocket Boy revealed two trailers for MindsEye, an ambitious action-adventure thriller helmed by Leslie Benzies, the former producer of the GTA franchise.</p>



<p>The game, which promises a high-level cinematic experience, is scheduled to be released in the summer of 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The MindsEye project began as part of the universe of Everywhere, a massive and experimental game developed by Build A Rocket Boy. However, due to its ambition, it became an independent title, focused on an engaging narrative experience with a lot of action elements. Check out the gameplay trailer below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game synopsis says the following:</p>



<p>“Introducing Jacob Diaz, a former soldier fitted with The MindsEye, a mysterious neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Fight to uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unchecked military power shape every encounter. Jacob isn’t the only one searching for answers, forces working in the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined. Get ready for intense combat – on foot, behind the wheel, and in the air – where every decision can mean the difference between survival and defeat.”</p>
