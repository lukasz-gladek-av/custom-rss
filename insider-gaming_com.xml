<p>One of the most asked-for changes to Call of Duty Warzone arrives with Season 03, which drops tomorrow, April 2. In this long-awaited update, console-based Warzone players will <strong>finally </strong>be able to switch off crossplay functionality in regular multiplayer matchmaking.</p>



<p>That means that they can remove any chance of connecting with PC players, which eradicates a fair portion of the user base that engages in nefarious practices like <strong>cheating</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> breaking down the Season 03 patch notes, it was confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In Season 03, we‚Äôre giving console players more granular options by separating the MP Ranked Play and Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play settings and adding a new Multiplayer-only setting for Quickplay, Featured, and Party Games matches.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that console players will be able to <strong>switch off crossplay in Warzone </strong>for regular multiplayer matches.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-warzone">How to Turn Off Crossplay in Warzone</h3>



<p>To switch off crossplay in Warzone on console, you‚Äôll need to navigate to the network settings menu and select ‚ÄòCross-Play Off‚Äô. This will lock your selection unless the following happens:</p>



<ul>
<li>If you play with a mixed-platform party, your settings will be temporarily adjusted to ‚ÄòCross-Play On‚Äô</li>



<li>If you play with at least <strong>one </strong>PC player, your settings will be temporarily adjusted to ‚ÄòCross-Play On‚Äô</li>
</ul>



<p>Once your party returns to a single platform, your settings will automatically update to reflect your original choice.</p>



<p>Activision has warned that locking your matchmaking mechanics to a single platform might negatively impact your queue times, but that‚Äôs a small price to pay for feeling a little safer while playing Warzone on console.</p>



<h3 id="h-when-does-the-new-warzone-map-come-out">When Does The New Warzone Map Come Out?</h3>



<p>If you‚Äôre eager to switch off crossplay and dive into Verdansk, the new Warzone map, you don‚Äôt have long to wait. It‚Äôll drop in Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 at 9 am PST / 5 pm BST.</p>



<p>It has been several years since Verdansk was last in Warzone, and it‚Äôs expected to be a resurgence of sorts (no pun intended) for the popular battle royale map.</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> how much of a W this crossplay decision is.</p>

<p>It was recently discovered that one of the most popular Warzone emotes is returning with the Season 03 update. It‚Äôll be tucked into the battle pass, so you‚Äôre guaranteed to unlock it if you play enough. If you were around during the peak of Warzone when Verdansk first existed, you‚Äôll recognise how humorous this emote can be.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs right ‚Äì <strong>the middle finger emote is coming back to Warzone</strong>.</p>



<p>But there‚Äôs a catch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crank-job">Crank Job</h2>



<p>The ‚ÄòCrank Job‚Äô middle finger emote was a fan-favourite when it first emerged in Warzone. It allowed players to rebel against their opponents one last time as they lay bleeding out on the floor. It was great fun when fused with killcams, which is why it rapidly became one of the most popular emotes in the game.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that the middle finger emote will return to Warzone in the Season 03 battle pass.</p>



<p>There‚Äôs a catch, unfortunately. </p>



<p>It has been mentioned that it‚Äôs a third-person variant of the Crank Job emote, which might eradicate any sense of whimsy attached to popping it once you‚Äôve downed an enemy. I‚Äôm willing to hold out hope that it‚Äôll be as funny as ever, but the third-person aspect might have ruined it a bit.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs what everyone‚Äôs favourite Warzone emote used to look like:</p>



<div><article><p><span>A 3rd Person Version of the ‚ÄòMiddle Finger‚Äô Emote is RETURNING in the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a><span> Warzone Season 3 Battlepass üò≠ </span></p></article></div>







<p>There will be plenty more to unlock in the Season 03 battle pass in Black Ops 6 and Warzone, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/r0-z3-skin-call-of-duty-controversial-paywall/">a new Roze skin</a>, the AMAX, and the HDR sniper rifle.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs no April Fool‚Äôs Day joke: Valve has dropped their latest Counter-Strike 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/529842339955343453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a> on March 31st, featuring a handful of new weapon skins and a ‚Äúclean up‚Äù Inferno and Train. It‚Äôs no brand new operation, but it‚Äôs a pretty sizable update to CS2 compared to others.</p>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-2-march-31st-update-new-changes">Counter-Strike 2 March 31st Update ‚Äì New Changes</h2>



<p>The CS2 weekly care package feature now includes three new weapon collections added to the drop list: Ascent, Boreal, and Radiant. The new collections have added ‚Äúover 70 new [weapon] finishes,‚Äù featuring a wide variety of styles. It doesn‚Äôt appear that players will get to choose which weapon collection their weekly care package skin comes from, but it does increase the variety of skins that appear.</p>



<p>New skins aren‚Äôt exclusive to just the weekly care package for this update. A new case and a new weapon skin collection have been added to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-the-armory-update-charms-battle-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Armory</a>. Players can acquire the Fever case from the Armory page for two credits. By purchasing a Fever case key, players can open their case for a chance at the AWP Printstream or get extremely lucky and open one of several Shattered Web knives in Chroma finishes. Players can also spend four Armory credits to get one random skin from the new Train collection. The ‚Äúlimited edition‚Äù item has also been swapped out, and players can save 15 credits for one of the XM1014 Solitude variants. This items will be removed from the Armory on Sunday, July 13.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for gameplay changes, Inferno and Train and have been hit with some ‚Äúspring cleaning.‚Äù Both maps now feature some ‚Äúcleaner surfaces, less clutter,‚Äù and a noticeably wider Banana section (B Main area) on Inferno specifically.</p>



<p>Any new skins in particular catch your eye? Let us know which one is your favorite in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
