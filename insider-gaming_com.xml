<p>According to the latest earnings release, the Nintendo Switch is now a step closer to the PlayStation 2 in sales, having sold more than 150 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/switch-worldwide-sales-top-150-86-million-super-mario-party-jamboree-tops-6-17-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, the Nintendo Switch sold 150.86 million units as of December 31, 2024, just 10 million shy of the best-selling video game console of all time, PlayStation 2. The 2017 console sold 4.82 million hardware units and 53.7 million units at this time. Interestingly, Nintendo has yet to beat DS’s sales numbers with the Switch, as the former has sold 154.02 million units in its lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-best-selling-first-party-nintendo-switch-games">Best Selling First-Party Nintendo Switch Games</h2>



<p>Nintendo also released its best-selling first-party Switch games, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe still leading the pack, selling 67.35 million units. The next three in the list feature Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, selling 47.44 million, 35.88 million and 32.62 million units, respectively. The last title in the top 5 best-selling games for Nintendo Switch is Super Mario Odyssey, with 29.04 million units sold.

<p>Nintendo also revealed sales numbers for its newly announced first-party games, with Switch Sports selling 15.74 million units. Newer games like Super Mario Party Jamboree and Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership have sold 6.17 million and 1.84 million units, respectively. Other recent games, such as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, sold 3.91 million units, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door sold 2.06 million, and Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD sold 1.80 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-revises-forecast-again-nbsp">Nintendo Revises Forecast Again&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Nintendo sold 9.54 million hardware units, a 30.6% decrease year over year. On the software side, 123.98 million units were sold, a 24.4% decrease year over year. Hence, the console manufacturers have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lowers-annual-forecast-after-switch-sales-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revised their financial forecast </a>for March 2025 again. This change was made “in consideration of the sales trend through the nine months ended on December 31, 2024.” The hardware and software unit sales forecasts have also been revised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new estimates for net sales are 1.19 billion yen, down from 1.28 billion yen. The operating profit forecast was decreased from 360 million yen to 280 million yen. The ordinary and net profit estimates have also changed, down from 420 million yen and 300 million yen to 370 million yen and 270 million yen, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Elden Ring Nightreign Details to be Released Next Week]]></title>

<p>Insider Gaming has learned that new Elden Ring Nightreign details are scheduled to be released next week, including a release date.</p>



<p>That’s according to source familiar with the games plans, who said that information will be released on February 12. It’s understood that the announcement will include media previews and a final release date for the game, which is currently slated for the end of May.</p>



<p>For those out of the loop, the timing could make a lot of sense, too, as a recent rumor has also suggested that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play could be taking place in the same week</a> (although it could just be a coincidence). </p>



<p>But likely, the announcements and embargos are because of the Elden Ring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-will-have-a-network-test-starting-february-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign network test</a>, which takes place on February 14 – 17, which is undoubtedly going to see the games contents leak online. So it would make sense for FromSoftware to get ahead of the them with official announcements.</p>



<p>Announced during The Game Awards 2024, Nightreign is a cooperative experience that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can only be played solo or in a trio</a>. FromSoftware has already confirmed that the game cannot be played as a duo.</p>



<p>Elden Ring’s Game Director Junya Ishizaki clarified why such a decision was made, ““The reason that we went with a three-player focus was that we wanted to retain that sense of accomplishment you get from battling a boss together or from conquering a map together and that sense of enjoyment, but we wanted to recreate that in a fresh way. And we felt like focusing on a three-player co-op experience would provide a brand new sense of accomplishment with it.”</p>



<p>The game is scheduled to release on the PlayStation 4, Play7sTation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

<p>Early details for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Set A2A expansion have started to trickle through. Not much is known about the anticipated next set, but Set A2A is reportedly a new mini-set to break up the pack-opening grind of Space-Time Smackdown and Set 3.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is not holding back when releasing new sets and promo cards. Genetic Apex launched first, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-mythical-island-themed-collection-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a> and it only took three months for the next big-time set in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space-Time Smackdown</a>. Tons of cards are available in packs with players desperate to catch ’em all.</p>



<p>Potential first details on Pokémon TCG Pocket Set A2A are already sifting through, so let’s see what’s happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a-rumored-release-date">Pokémon TCG Pocket Set A2A Rumored Release Date</h2>

<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket Set A2A is set to release on February 28, according to leaks</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes from renowned and trusted Pokémon leaker <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@CentroLeaks</a> who has already leaked and gotten most of these insider tidbits correct since Pokémon TCG Pocket launched on Oct. 30, 2024.</p>



<p>They posted to <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1885731258719748246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> on February 1 about upcoming content for the free-to-play mobile title: “<strong>The next themed booster pack (A2a) releases on February 28th.</strong>” This might come as a surprise to players as Space-Time Smackdown was only released on January 30—giving players less than a month to focus solely on Set 2.</p>



<p>However, there’s a big reason why this leak could be correct, and why Set A2A could be so soon—<strong>Pokémon Day is February 27</strong>. </p>



<p>Set A2A would coincide nicely with the annual celebration of all things Pokémon. We take all this information with a pinch of salt for now, as we have to where leaks are concerned. But @CentroLeaks is usually spot-on about its information. This means you haven’t got all that long until the next mini-set drops. You might need to start saving Pack Hourglasses sooner rather than later!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a">What To Expect From Pokémon TCG Pocket Set A2A</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket Set A2A is potentially a themed booster pack, and the “A” after its number suggests it’s another mini-set in the same vein as Mythical Island.</strong></p>



<p>If true, it’s likely to have around <strong>80-100 new cards</strong> or so. Mythical Island introduced 86 new cards to Pokémon TCG Pocket, but because of how bunched-up releases are, it could be even fewer this time. We’ll have to wait and see what Creatures Inc. and DeNA have planned.</p>

<p>Each new set’s theme is a guessing game after Space-Time Smackdown shook up the system. What do you hope to see in Set A2A? Who will be the star of the show for the next Pokémon TCG Pocket expansion?</p>
