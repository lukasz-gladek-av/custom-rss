<p>Whether you are on PlayStation 5, PC, or Xbox Series X, here is everything you need to know about the cost of Blue Prince and whether the game is free.  </p>



<p>Game prices are a hotly contested topic at the moment. Nintendo fans were shocked when it was revealed that Switch 2 games cost $80 instead of $60, as seen on the first Switch console. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo defended the decision</a> by arguing that it was due to the game’s value to players. </p>



<p>Additionally, physical Switch 2 games cost more than digital and will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost up to $98</a> when converted from Euros. This is, of course, in addition to the console itself, which is expected to cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$450</a> or more. Playing video games has always been a rather expensive hobby, but not all titles are increasing in price, as is the case with Blue Prince. </p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/BluePrince" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dogubomb community manager</a>, <strong>Blue Prince costs $29.99 / €29.99 / £24.99 on PlayStation 5, Steam, and Xbox.</strong> </p>



<p>Players can purchase the game digitally on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/blue-prince/9PFRTPRQ569Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Store</a>. Blue Prince will not be available physically, and there is only one edition, meaning there aren’t any pre-order bonuses or early access. </p>



<p>Blue Prince will not be available on the Epic Games Store or GOG at launch. Dogubomb revealed that the game will be Steam Deck compatible, but that won’t be until a later date. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-blue-prince-free-to-play">Is Blue Prince Free to Play?</h2>



<p><strong>Blue Prince is not free to play</strong>, but it is available as a day-one release on PlayStation Plus Extra and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. </p>



<p>An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription costs $19.99 a month, and it will set you back $14.99 a month to become a PlayStation Plus Extra member. </p>



<p>Blue Prince isn’t the only game coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-playstation-plus-game-catalog-games-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Plus in April</a>.

<p>Don’t get your hopes up for Titanfall 3 just yet. After a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/titanfall-3-is-almost-complete-says-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak came out suggesting</a> that Titanfall 3 is “almost complete” along with a number of planned features, one prominent journalist has publicly reported that none of the leaked information is accurate.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XsBHGnG9LQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Breaking News</a>, Jeff Grubb shot down the claims by Apex Legends leaker Osvaldatore. </p>



<p>“This isn’t real,” Grubb said. “I’m sorry. It’s not real.”</p>



<p>Grubb then went on to talk about Respawn having a small team that is “probably messing around with games that have titans in them”.</p>



<p>“Does he ( Titanfall 1 director Steve Fukuda) have something like a prototype that has titans in it? I would guess so,” Grubb added. “I don’t know for sure, but I would certainly assume that that is a safe thing to think.</p>



<p>“Now, is that going to get announced in 2025 and released in 2026? No way.”</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-2025">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase Announced For June 8, 2025</a></h6>



<p>He then touched on the fact that EA has been on a trend of canceling various games at Respawn. Those cancellations include Titanfall Legends which was a “previous version of Titanfall 3”.</p>



<p>“Do not expect an Unreal Engine 5, single player campaign Titanfall 3 with a full multiplayer suite,” Grubb said while saying he hated being the one to rain on the parade. “I’m not sure where this is coming from…don’t get your hopes up for Titanfall anytime soon.”</p>



<p>Do you think EA and Respawn will ever release a Titanfall 3? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1835/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
