<p>The first script draft for the Sleeping Dogs film adaptation is finished, according to its actor and producer.</p>



<p>Released in 2012, Sleeping Dogs has become quite the cult classic. Following an undercover police officer in Hong Kong, players explore an open world with parkour abilities and martial arts. Despite positive reviews, low sales led to the series being dead in the water. However, Hollywood has gotten its hands on it, now reinvigorated by MCU’s Shang-Chi actor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-adaptation-and-sequel-mentioned-by-simu-liu/">Simu Liu</a>, who’ll star as protagonist Wei Shen. Now, according to the actor himself, it’s farther along than we thought.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1979664278459388314?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simu Liu’s Twitter/X</a>, the actor posted two pictures, with one being of his sleepy dog, Chopa. The other image was of the official Sleeping Dogs script. In the caption, shown above, it seems it has been completed and likely sent in for feedback. Interestingly enough, the name of the writer is blocked, so it could be a surprise new addition or director. Still, after scripting is casting and, eventually, filming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While out of the blue, it’s good to know Sleeping Dogs is proceeding well with an adaptation. In the past, Donnie Yen of Rogue One fame was set to bring it to Hollywood, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-movie-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nothing turned out</a>. Fortunately, Simu Liu has been very vocal about his desire to make it happen, even producing it himself. While Sleeping Dogs didn’t sell well for games, it may now get another chance with Hollywood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A live-service Halo game may be in the works at Halo Studios, one reliable insider claims.</p>



<p>If you know Xbox, you know Halo. As a beacon for the FPS genre, the sci-fi series has been going on since 2001’s Combat Evolved. With the upcoming 25th anniversary coming up and the Halo World Championships next week, the hype for more Halo is huge. Halo Studios themselves confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-halo-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ll see something new</a> revealed there, likely the Combat Evolved remake. However, according to a credible YouTuber, we may actually see another new project, this time in the live-service genre.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-studios-may-release-a-live-service-halo-title-in-2026">Halo Studios May Release a Live-Service Halo Title in 2026</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dWoH0Pa0E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a video</a> from Halo Youtuber Rebs Gaming, who previously leaked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Virtuos co-development</a> for Halo CE, a new entry in the franchise will be revealed soon. The game, which will be live-service, is expected to drop next year, meaning two Halo games could come out then. Rebs says their source told them it will be similar to Fortnite, though they don’t know if it’ll feature Battle Royale. No other information was provided, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>As previously mentioned, a new Halo-focused showcase event&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-studios-new-deep-dive-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced</a>&nbsp;for the Halo World Championship on October 24th, 2025. The deep dive has been hyped by Halo Studios ever since last year. With the Halo CE remake all but confirmed, a new spinoff would be welcome news to fans. Even more so, having two new titles in 2026 makes for one great anniversary plan. Either way, fans of the series may be in for a treat come October 24th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The DualSense V3 Doesn’t Have a Removable Battery, Despite Rumors]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dualsense-v3-battery/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-dualsense-v3-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-a-removable-battery-despite-rumors.1328659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite previous rumors that the DualSense V3 will have a removable battery, it has been debunked by tech reviewer and content creator Austin Evans.</p>



<p>In his latest video, the content creator looked at the latest PlayStation 5 Pro SKU, which was rumored to be bundled with a new DualSense V3 controller dubbed ‘V3. However, the latest revision of the controller certainly does not include a removable battery, although it is a different battery from those used in previous controllers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-dualsense-controller-might-have-removable-battery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original rumor of a detachable battery originated</a> from the Polish retailer PPE, so it’s entirely possible that the rumor was lost in translation somewhere, as almost everything else from their PlayStation 5 Pro and controller report was accurate.</p>



<p>That being said, a removable battery for the DualSense does make a lot of sense. Still, with the latest revision having not implemented it, it’s likely a feature we won’t see until the next generation.</p>



<p>You can watch the whole YouTube video from Austin Evans below, which, at face value, does show that the PlayStation 5 Pro has some minor changes. One of them is a reduction in the console’s weight – a change that has become a common theme in these revisions.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As for what’s next for PlayStation, well, all eyes are on its next generation, which will, somewhat obviously, be called the PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>In an exclusive report by Insider Gaming, we reported that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-playstation-6-is-planned-to-have-a-detachable-disc-drive-on-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6</a> is planned to feature a detachable disc drive, which was first introduced midway through the PlayStation 5’s lifecycle.</p>



<p>What do you think of the DualSense v3 not featuring a removable battery? Are you disappointed? Let me know what you’re thinking on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
