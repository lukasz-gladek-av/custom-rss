<p>PUBG was one of the first video games to popularise the battle royale format, and it’s still going strong all these years later. In fact, Update 40.1 has just released on PC, and it brings with it a host of new changes. </p>







<p>From map changes to gameplay updates, it’s a juicy patch that’s bound to shake things up. All of the changes made to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pubg-blindspot-platforms-xbox-ps5/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/pubg-blindspot-platforms-xbox-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PUBG</a> with Update 40.1 are listed below, alongside when they’ll come to console.</p>

<p>Update 40.1 for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pubg-blindspot-release-date-start-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/pubg-blindspot-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PUBG</a> makes a lot of changes to the game, but perhaps some of the more notable ones are the World Updates to Erangel. The ruleset is expected to return to normal, though there will be some lingering effects from Erangel: Subzero. Some new features have also been added to the map, such as Destructible Gas Tanks and multiple spawn changes to numerous items.</p>



<p>A new addition is PUBG Bridge, a new website that allows you view 2D match replays directly on the web. All you need to do is log in with your KRAFTON ID, and you’ll be able to view your match history from your linked platforms. </p>



<p>Console players, there’s something specially geared for you, too. A new Virtual Cursor system is finally coming to Consoles, allowing you to navigate the Lobby and menus much more easily. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-update-40-1-coming-to-pubg-console">When Is Update 40.1 Coming To PUBG Console?</h2>



<p><strong>Console players can expect the 40.1 Update for PUBG on February 12, eight days after it arrives on PC.</strong></p>







<p>It’s expected to launch at 1 AM UTC, but there will be an eight hour Live Maintenance window, finishing at 9 AM UTC. Once that update window is over, console players can jump right into all of the new content arriving with Update 40.1, and it’s all listed down below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Take-Two CEO has put fans’ minds at ease, revealing that they have “every reason to believe” GTA Online will continue after the GTA 6 launch. </p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6, the next mainline title for the wildly popular Rockstar Games series, is all set to release in November 2026, and the developers have recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-date-earnings-call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirmed the date</a> as well. However, with the new instalment on the way, players have been wondering whether the online services of the previous title will sunset after GTA 6’s launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-take-two-has-every-reason-to-continue-gta-online-support-once-gta-6-arrives">Take Two Has ‘Every Reason’ to Continue GTA Online Support Once GTA 6 Arrives</h2>



<p>During the most recent <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/bb6700ad-114c-4457-b4da-379bbd89053b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings</a> call, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick responded to an investor’s question about the support for GTA Online. Zelnick expressed strong confidence in the service’s ongoing support, stating that they have “every reason to believe” it will continue. He emphasized that the game has a “great community” that remains engaged, and noted that Rockstar has demonstrated how the title can remain relevant for years after its release, thanks to the high-quality additional content.</p>



<p><strong>Interested readers can check out Strauss Zelnick’s complete statement below: </strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“At the same time, I have every reason to believe we’ll continue to support&nbsp;GTA Online.&nbsp;There’s a great community that loves it, that stays engaged. And again, in this quarter, Rockstar has shown that when you deliver great additional content, despite how long GTA Online has been in the market, people show up.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA Online has been around for more than a decade and is still a top contender in the games industry. On Steam alone, GTA 5 is able to bring in more than 100,000 players daily, and that’s almost all thanks to the Online service. What’s more, it was just announced that GTA 5 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-has-sold-225-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 225 million copies</a> worldwide, and GTA Online contributed significantly to that as well. </p>



<p>In discussing the title, Zelnick pointed out that the Grand Theft Auto series has “vastly outpaced” their forecasts. This impressive performance can be attributed to a “recurrent spending growth of 27%,” driven by the latest update for GTA Online, titled “A Safehouse in the Hills.” This update introduced new mansion properties and marked the return of the game’s protagonist, Michael DeSanta.</p>







<p>In other news, GTA 6 marketing will begin this summer and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-marketing-to-start-this-summer-will-have-physical-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will have a physical edition</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-genai-has-zero-part-in-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GenAI has zero part</a> in the upcoming title.

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will be shown during Thursday’s Nintendo Direct event.</p>



<p>According to known leaker NateTheHate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix</a> is expected to show the game during the Partner Direct on February 5. He adds that it’s also possible that they’ll announce a release date for the game as well.</p>







<p><strong>“They will give it a release date and a brand-new trailer,”</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8B7axb3JMY&amp;t=3323s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. <strong>“Last week it was reported that Square Enix was targeting a summer release for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Switch 2 and Xbox. And to my understanding, that information is correct.”</strong></p>



<p>He then said that he thinks that the game will release sometime in June. </p>



<p>Of course, despite his track record with rumors and reports, it’s important to take the latest claims with a grain of salt.</p>







<p>The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-partner-direct-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takes place at 9am ET/6am PT</a> on February 5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a special day for this NYT Connections hints guide, because today is <strong>my birthday! </strong>It’s nice to celebrate in many ways, but today I’m welcoming my most recent trip around the sun by helping you solve today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Below, you’ll find the hints and solutions you need to get this puzzle completed as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Read on to learn what you need to know, and perhaps leave me a ‘Happy birthday!’ in the comments below!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #970:</p>



<ul>
<li>AMERICAN FLAG</li>



<li>BUMP</li>



<li>APPLE PIE</li>



<li>BUTT</li>



<li>BALD EAGLE</li>



<li>KNOCK</li>



<li>BASEBALL</li>



<li>RAM</li>



<li>JEANS</li>



<li>ANG</li>



<li>LAPIS LAZULI</li>



<li>BRUCE</li>



<li>OCEAN</li>



<li>CHRISTOPHER</li>



<li>SKY</li>



<li>SPIKE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Quintessentially American</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – When things are in your way</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Just like the group</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Lees of the film world</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 5:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-5-970">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 5 (#970)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– AMERICAN FLAG, APPLE PIE, BALD EAGLE, BASEBALL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BUMP, BUTT, KNOCK, RAM</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – JEANS, LAPIS LAZULI, OCEAN, SKY</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ANG, BRUCE, CHRISTOPHER, SPIKE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WD To Release A 100TB Hard Drive By 2029]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wd-100tb-hard-drive-2029/</link>
            <guid>1425487</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WD wants you to never have to by another storage device again. The digital storage company—also known as Western Digital—announced its new High Bandwidth Drive and Dual Pivot technology.</p>



<p>The Dual Pivot technology, <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/2026/2026-02-03-western-digital-accelerates-storage-innovation-for-ai-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WD says</a>, will add a second set of “independently operating actuators on a separate pivot and will deliver up to 2x sequential IO gain within a 3.5-inch drive.”</p>







<p><strong>“This differs from previous dual actuator designs that sacrificed capacity and required extensive customer software changes,”</strong> WD says. <strong>“Dual Pivot enables reduced spacing between disks, allowing for more platters per drive and higher overall capacity.”</strong></p>



<p>The High Bandwidth Drive will allow simultaneous writing and reading from multiple heads on multiple tracks. This technology, according to WD, will offer double the bandwidth of standard HDDs without any power setbacks. </p>



<p><strong>“The technology has a clear path to scale up to 8x bandwidth gains and is already in customer hands for validation,”</strong> they said.</p>







<p>With the new technologies, and others that continue to improve, WD has plans to scale its HDD offerings in a major way over the next few years. The company has already announced its 40TB UltraSMR ePMR HDD that will enter production in the second half of 2026. </p>



<p>After the 40TB drive comes a 60TB offering before moving to 100TB by 2029. </p>



<p><strong>“The result is unprecedented flexibility,”</strong> they say. <strong>“Hyperscalers and enterprises can adopt either technology on their own timelines with predictable capacity planning and seamless scaling – no forced technology transitions, no infrastructure disruptions, just continuous and accelerating capacity growth built on architecture they already trust.”</strong></p>
