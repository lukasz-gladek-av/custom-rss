<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2 will be released on April 8 across all platforms. It will bring improvements, bug fixes, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-title-update-1-0-2">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2</h2>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows development team has been working on this first batch of improvements since launch, and the changes in this update have been inspired by player feedback. Title update 1.0.2 for AC Shadows features several highlights, including selling and dismantling multiple items, the ability to reset mastery nodes, horse improvements, an Investigation Board shortcut and PS5 Pro enhancements. Check out all the new improvements and changes in the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2 below:&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-horse-improvements">Horse Improvements</h3>



<p>The first significant improvement from tomorrow’s AC Shadows update features changes towards the horse. Players can activate the pathfinder to enable Auto-Follow, and the horse will automatically follow the road to the destination. Also, horses are now quicker in cities, so players can glide through these areas much faster.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-mastery-nodes-reset">Mastery Nodes Reset</h3>



<p>Many fans will appreciate this change as it lets them fine-tune their builds according to their preferred play styles. Players can now reset Mastery Nodes for both Yasuke and Naoe, allowing you to test different play styles before finding what suits you the best. It also lets you explore all the game has to offer gameplay-wise.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-selling-and-dismantling-multiple-items">Selling and Dismantling Multiple Items</h3>



<p>This is an exciting update for players who have been hoarding resources during exploration. It will allow them to manage and utilize their surplus items efficiently. The new update will add an option to tag and sell/dismantle multiple items in shops or while dismantling gear at the Forge.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-investigation-board-shortcut">Investigation Board Shortcut</h3>



<p>One of the features of the new update will let you reach the investigation board faster than ever before. After the update is released, you only need to hold the ‘Options’ button for a few seconds to teleport to the Investigation Board. A single press will still let you open the inventory.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-ps5-pro-improvements-for-ac-shadows">PS5 Pro Improvements for AC Shadows</h3>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has received dedicated PS5 Pro improvements in Title Update 1.0.2. Firstly, PSSR support has been added, and players playing before the upcoming update must manually enable this mode through video settings. Also, the balanced mode will feature ‘Raytraced Specular,’ providing visual fidelity close to PS5 Pro Quality mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-other-improvements-in-new-ac-shadows-update">Other Improvements in New AC Shadows Update</h3>



<p>The upcoming update includes some miscellaneous improvements across the game; you can check them in the list below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>The Hideout framerate has been uncapped to above 30 fps in Performance Mode.</li>



<li>Boss fights have received improved balancing.</li>



<li>An issue where the pathfinder line appeared in photos taken in Photomode has been fixed.</li>



<li>Inconsistencies with the ‘Throw a Kunai at the closest enemy after an assassination’ perk when ‘The Tool Master Gear’ is equipped on Naoe have been fixed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Double Assassinations have been improved.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Naoe’s responsiveness, in some instances, has been improved.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-12-year-low-amid-company-uncertainty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s stock prices have continued to fall, hitting a 12-year low on both the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UBI-FR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paris Stock Exchange</a> and <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/market-stock/0NVL/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">London Stock Exchange</a>. As of the markets closing in the region, Ubisoft stock is trading under €9 for the first time since April 2013.</p>



<p>As of publishing, the stock is sitting at €8.80 after falling another 7.83% on Monday. At one point it sat at €8.27 before it rose back to the closing number.</p>



<p>The reasons for the continued drop of Ubisoft’s stock prices should be surprising to anyone who has followed the company over the years. Since April 2024, Ubisoft’s shares have fallen 62.9% from its 52-week high of €23.70 to the €8.80 it currently sits. The company’s shares fell under €10 back in late October 2024 when it was announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows would be delayed to 2025. However, it rebounded slightly back to over €14 per share not long after.</p>







<p>Fast forward to late March and early April, the company’s prices continued to gradually drop again. The big drop came, however, after Ubisoft announced it had reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a deal with Tencent</a> on a new subsidiary that would include the publisher’s three biggest franchises—Far Cry, Rainbow Six Siege, and Assassin’s Creed—and give Tencent a 25% stake in the new venture. After a slight uptick, stock prices fell from €13.15 on March 27, the day of the deal, to €10.70 in just three days of trading. Since then, the prices continued to fall to what they are now. </p>



<p>There’s also the global uncertainty surrounding a potential recession that has the entire market falling over the last handful days. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-energy-supercross-25-review-a-solid-return-to-the-track-that-falls-a-bit-short-of-the-finish-line.1157442/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/monster-energy-supercross-25-review-a-solid-return-to-the-track/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the first time in two years, Supercross fans have a new game in Monster Energy Supercross 25. A game built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, developer Milestone has taken what made the series fun in the past and worked to expand in ways to add to the longevity of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But just how much fun is the first official Supercross game since 2023? In many ways it’s the best Supercross game Milestone has ever put out. In others, it leaves a lot to be desired.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-energy-supercross-25-review">Monster Energy Supercross 25 Review</h2>



<p>Before diving into the modes, let’s talk about the gameplay. Monster Energy Supercross 25 is one of the more difficult racing games to get the hang of. But don’t let that scare you, that’s not a bad thing. Nor does that mean it’s not beginner friendly.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve never played a Supercross game before or it’s been years since the last one you touched, the settings available to you make it so you can have the easiest time of your life whipping around each track on your way to first place. Playing like that, however, quickly becomes boring, and you’ll want more of a challenge. And make no mistake about it, a challenge you will get.</p>



<p>From timing your acceleration out of a turn on a rain-soaked track to hitting the whoops in a way that keeps you from losing momentum, every single area on the track requires precision. I can’t begin to count the number of times I dumped my bike because I thought I could take a sharp turn like I was the world’s greatest racer. Fall after fall after fall in my first handful of races—I’m looking at you, Daytona—saw every opponent fly past as I watched my top 5 finish vanish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you get the hang of how each bike feels and reacts to your riding, you’ll find yourself improving in both control and speed. Nothing’s more satisfying than hitting a personal-best lap time on a track you’ve struggled with time and time again. Pair that with tracks that change on a lap-by-lap basis, and it makes success even more rewarding. That euphoric feeling you get after that first major win is something that’s hard to replicate in racers, and Supercross 25 does it well.</p>



<p>Without question, the franchise’s jump up to Unreal Engine 5 has not only improved the overall visual fidelity where the tracks and drivers look the best they ever have, but it’s helped the gameplay become the best it’s ever been. And it’s not even close.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presentation itself is similar to what it had been. The commentary you hear only comes in before and after a race while the actual race is focused just on the action at hand. It’s fine, but nothing to write home about.</p>



<p>Of course, there are a couple frustrations with gameplay such as hitting a jump and landing directly on the head of the rider in front of you only to bounce off and keep going. Or when you are racing hard and simply bounce off the side of the rider next to you without even a little bit of slowdown. It’s little things like that that can hurt the on-track immersion that Supercross 25 is going for. Thankfully, it didn’t happen enough to ruin the on-track fun.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Racing in the rain presents its own challenge.</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-an-unfulfilling-career">An Unfulfilling Career</h3>



<p>Where the fun does kind of take a back seat is with Supercross 25’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-energy-supercross-25-career-mode-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">career mode</a>. The mode you’ll likely spend the most time in, the premise is simple: start in the Futures and work your way up to the 450 series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the surface, it looks like there’s a lot here. There are rivalries, team goals to achieve, sponsorship opportunities, social media to track, and more. The problem is that it’s all surface-level material. There’s no real meat to the career mode bones here.</p>



<p>First, rider customization might be the most limited in any sport game. I get that you don’t really see their face as you race, but having a bit more freedom would’ve been nice to have.</p>



<p>All the mode feels like as you progress through is one where you’re just trying to impress a team enough to give you your next contract. You constantly are looking at what’s out there and what it would take for a specific team to be interested in you. Some might want you to win your races while others just want consistent Top 10 or Top 5 finishes.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption>Everything is centered around the career hub.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each season of your career is split up into Acts that ends in a Climax with a specific goal based on what’s happened in the prior races. It adds a bit of intrigue and breakup to a mode that could start to feel monotonous without it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another way your career is broken up is in the form of motocross races and even rhythm attack events. They help you increase your fan count, which builds up your notoriety, but I failed to see where it actually impacts what happens throughout your career. It didn’t seem to increase/decrease the likelihood of signing with a better team. All that mattered was the performance on the track. Even in my limited social media responses where I intentionally tried to be the biggest jerk I possibly could, it still didn’t negatively affect me enough to warrant changing my plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, the career mode just feels like something’s missing. Even upgrading your bike doesn’t feel as deep as it could. It’s just: choose your upgrade, wait, repeat.</p>



<p>I’m not saying I want a cutscene-filled story mode—I’m the furthest from a fan of that—but I would’ve liked more interaction with other drivers and more consequences. Any sort of poor performance on the track felt more like a bump in the road than anything to really be worried about. That takes out any potential drama that a career mode should include. There’s a solid foundation here for a truly great career mode, but this year’s isn’t it.</p>



<p>Outside of the career mode, there’s not much that will keep you busy aside from the one-off race weekends and a very barebones online multiplayer at launch. Multiplayer is expected to get updates post launch, but it’s nothing more than private lobbies and unranked races at the moment.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-energy-supercross-25-review-verdict">Monster Energy Supercross 25 Review Verdict</h2>



<p>As mentioned at the beginning, Monster Energy Supercross 25 is the best Supercross game that Milestone has put out in so many ways. The racing is rewarding as you get the hang of it, and the visuals are second-to-none. Unfortunately, the career mode leaves you just wishing for more to do with the rest of the game feeling quite empty.</p>



<p>For that, it’s tough to recommend it as a day one purchase unless you are a diehard fan yearning to get back on the track. If not, it’s a game worth playing for sure, just after it drops a bit in price or <a href="https://milestone.it/news/supercross-25/post-launch-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">planned DLC updates</a> add more to do outside of career mode and in multiplayer.</p>



<p><strong>VERDICT:</strong> WAIT</p>
