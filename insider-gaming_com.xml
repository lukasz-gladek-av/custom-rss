<p>According to new developments in the lawsuit between Krafton and the founders of Sunautica 2, the former’s CEO has been accused of using ChatGPT and discussing takeovers in Slack messages. </p>



<p>For those unaware, a lawsuit is currently underway between Krafton and the founders of Subnautica 2, in which the former has been accused of wrongful termination t<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-wanted-to-delay-subnautica-2-to-avoid-250m-payout-lawsuit-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">o avoid paying $250 million</a>, and the latter has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-developer-unknown-worlds-sues-former-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of abandoning the game</a> and rushing the release to earn the payout.  </p>



<h2 id="h-krafton-ceo-created-a-secret-task-force-called-project-x">Krafton CEO Created a Secret Task Force Called ‘Project X’ </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://in.ign.com/subnautica-3/246938/news/fired-subnautica-2-founders-claim-krafton-ceo-used-chatgpt-to-brainstorm-ways-to-avoid-paying-250m-b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, new <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/950200391/Public-Version-Plaintiff-s-Pre-Trial-Brief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal documents</a> reveal the ChatGPT accusations against Krafton CEO from the founders of Subnautica 2. The first claim states that Krafton CEO CH Kim was “frustrated” with the acquisition of Unknown worlds, and from his perspective, it was “a bad deal for Krafton — one under which [Krafton] can only be dragged around.” CH Kim was accused of discussing a potential takeover with CFO Richard Yoon on Slack. </p>



<p>The CEO was then accused of creating a secret task force called ‘Project X’, whose main goal was to “either make a ‘deal’ with the Founders on the ‘earnout’ or execute a ‘Take Over’ of Unknown Worlds. When the Founders refused to accede to Krafton’s demands, Krafton pulled the trigger.”</p>



<p>The legal document also states that CH Kim was informed by Maria Park,&nbsp;Krafton’s global head of corporate development, that “it seems to be highly likely that the earnout will still be paid if the sales goal is achieved regardless of the dismissal with cause.”&nbsp;The document then talks about Krafton’s CEO using ChatGPT “to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout,” and the AI advised him that it’s “difficult to cancel the earnout.”</p>



<p>The documents also mention Subnautica 2 being ready for launch, with many reports pointing to it. The Unknown Worlds playtest data in May showed that the game “met players’ expectations”. Krafton’s internal expert declared that the plan 2025 release is the “best”. Maria Park stated the game was ready for an August launch. Thiago Oliveria “penned an impassioned essay in favour of launching in August”. Krafton’s corporate designee “could not name a single Krafton employee who actually thought the game was unready for release.”</p>



<p>In other news, Krafton is offering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-pivot-ai-first-krafton-voluntary-resignations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staff voluntary resignations</a> after the pivot to “AI First”.

<p>In December 2025, 9 games will leave PlayStation Plus, including big titles like Battlefield 2042, Forspoken, and more. </p>



<p>PlayStation Plus is a subscription service known for providing online multiplayer access and a library of games for players to try. The library differs for the tier players are subscribed to, with three tiers to choose from: Essential, Extra, and Deluxe. We already saw the PS Plus Game Catalog add <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-new-games-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine new games</a> this month, and now a similar number will be removed next month. </p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-plus-will-be-removing-9-games-in-december-2025">PlayStation Plus Will Be Removing 9 Games in December 2025</h2>



<p>If you head over to the PS Plus page on your PlayStation 5 console, you will see that the Last Chance to Play section has been updated with several new titles. Battlefield 2042 is one of them, as expected, since we have seen all Battlefield titles leave the library every month since the release of Battlefield 6. Other big names are Forspoken, Grand Theft Auto III, and Sonic Frontiers, which I’m sure have many fans.</p>



<p>Interested readers can check out the complete list of games that will be leaving PlayStation Plus in December 2025 below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Battlefield 2042</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto III</li>



<li>Arcade Paradise VR</li>



<li>Sonic Frontiers</li>



<li>Forspoken</li>



<li>Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge </li>



<li>Firefighting Simulator: The Squad</li>



<li>Surviving Mars</li>



<li>Star Trek: The Bridge</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have never tried any of these games, I would definitely advise you to give some of them a shot before they are removed from the library. GTA III is a classic, Sonic Frontiers is a fun time, and Forspoken could be interesting to some as well. Each of their main stories requires around 20 or fewer gameplay hours and offers tons of side activities as well. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-playstation-plus-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption</a> will be coming to PlayStation Plus Game Catalog in December 2025. Additionally, PS Plus users can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-coming-to-playstation-plus-in-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download GTA 5 this month</a>.
