<p>Use these Effortless Tower monthly codes for October 2025 in Roblox to gain some much-needed Skips in the game, allowing you to ease past the levels that you get stuck at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Effortless Tower is one of the many obby (obstacle course) games in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-prison-pump-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>, where players are tasked with simply getting from one point to another without hitting any of the obstacles in the way. Although many obby games on Roblox tend to be quite challenging, Effortless Tower offers a more enjoyable difficulty, making it a better option for players looking simply for a fun experience. There are over 5000 levels in Effortless Tower, each offering a different kind of challenge. Some, however, can be too difficult to surpass for some players, and this is where the Skips that can be acquired through codes come into the picture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players progress through the levels by simply moving around, jumping, and climbing, and each level is harder than the previous one. The game also offers players the option to teleport to the previous checkpoint with just a single clip, making it a very beginner-friendly gameplay experience.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>

Players are encouraged to make the most of this opportunity by redeeming the available codes quickly, as they can expire at any time.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bayonetta-director-feels-%E2%80%98unique-experiences%E2%80%99-matter-more-than-graphics.1332847/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The creator of Bayonetta, Devil May Cry, and more feels that unique gameplay mechanics are more important than graphics in action games. </p>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bayonetta-director-hideki-kamiya-says-pretty-graphics-alone-dont-do-much-for-him-a-good-action-game-needs-mechanics-no-other-game-has/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya discussed the progress 3D action games have made lately and what he feels is most important in the genre for players and developers. Kamiya has been at the forefront of action games for a very long time and has delivered some of the biggest games in the genre. </p>



<h2 id="h-hideki-kamiya-wants-to-see-unique-experiences-which-only-that-one-game-can-offer">Hideki Kamiya Wants to See Unique Experiences Which “Only That One Game Can Offer”</h2>



<p>Kamiya first spoke about how he approaches new games, revealing that he will work on creating “a unique gameplay mechanic that can only be experienced in that game.” He elaborated with examples of systems he developed for games like Bayonetta and Okami. Bayonetta had a Witch Time system that slowed time whenever the player dodged an enemy’s attack. Okami has the Celestial Brush system, which lets players “directly affect the game world by drawing.”</p>



<p>The Bayonetta creator explained that as a player, he wants to “get excited by the unique experiences which only that one game can offer”, rather than improved graphics.&nbsp;Kamiya then praised how far 3D action games have come. He first spoke about how there weren’t many 3D action games for some years, but recently there has been a surge in “a lot of stylish, combo-based action titles.” He concluded, stating, “It’s amazing to me that someone can just start making a game and end up with something of that quality.”&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam%E2%80%99s-new-personal-calendar-feature-helps-you-discover-new-games.1332763/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam’s Personal Calendar will help players discover new and upcoming games through a schedule of upcoming releases and personalized recommendations. </p>



<p>Personal Calendar is a store feature that will be available as a Steam Labs experiment. This will allow the company to gather feedback and make more improvements to this tool. It will show players not just recently released games but also upcoming games, and it has been filtered down to a collection that Steam believes the player is most likely to be interested in.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-steam-s-personal-calendar-work">How Does Steam’s Personal Calendar Work?</h2>



<p>Explained in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/507342099205587494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, this new Steam tool will find players with similar playtime to the user and then look at the games they have been adding to their wishlists. The system will also look at the games the player plays the most (relative to other players) and spend most of their playtime in.&nbsp;Which means that the games and demos players put in for a few minutes won’t be recorded; only those they sink their teeth into will matter.</p>



<p>Steam’s Personal Calendar system will be retrained daily to incorporate the latest data. It has a new calendar view that lists soon-to-release titles, filters them to the set we recommend most for you, and maps them across time so you can see them at a glance. This view will also include the player’s wishlisted games. However, the Calendar is weekdays-only, since very few games are released on weekends, and they needed as much space as possible to show upcoming games. </p>



<p>There are some customisation controls, including the ability to filter by tag and adjust the number of results. Also, the page will filter games based on your&nbsp;store content preferences, such as Early Access titles, ignored products, ignored tags, and the general level of mature content.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new announcement confirmed that Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition will no longer release for the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025 and has been delayed to 2026. </p>



<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition’s development has been struggling slightly on Nintendo Switch 2, with the recent Gamescom 2025 demo not doing it many favours, as players pointed out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-struggles-on-nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">substantial framerate drops</a>. It seems that’s why the developers want to take more time before they deliver the final product. </p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-release-pushed-to-2026-date-still-unconfirmed">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition Release Pushed to 2026, Date Still Unconfirmed</h2>



<p>The announcement about the delay comes through a post on the official Elden Ring <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post states that development for the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition is moving “wholeheartedly toward release”; however, they have decided to delay the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments.” The developers have apologized to the players for the delay and thanked them for their patience and support. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>While development on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> Tarnished Edition continues wholeheartedly toward release, we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments. </p><p>We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support. <a href="https://t.co/TsLrhAWIGc">pic.twitter.com/TsLrhAWIGc</a></p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Overall, it’s a sound decision to delay the launch of the Elden Ring: Tarnished edition, as the game was genuinely suffering from very real performance issues. Players have reported framerates dropping to as low as 15 fps, while doing “the most simple stuff,” and when players “get to the outside world, and the framerate just tanks.” The added time will help developers to work towards optimisation and provide a more solid build for release. </p>
