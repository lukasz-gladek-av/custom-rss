            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/levi-retires-from-league-esports-and-pivots-to-content-creation.1357603/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent video uploaded to YouTube, iconic Vietnamese League of Legends pro player, Đỗ “Levi” Duy Khánh, announced his official retirement from active competition. He cited wanting to spend more time on himself and start a family, and suggested he can’t do that while he continues to compete professionally.</p>



<p>Instead, Levi will step away and focus on content creation and streaming, continuing to contribute to the League of Legends scene by broadcasting content to the hundreds of thousands of followers he has amassed over the years.</p>











<p>Levi has been competing in the League of Legends space more or less since the game’s esports scene blew up. He’s been a solid player since 2013, and in his recent farewell video, Levi explained that League was ‘the answer’ to what he wanted to do with his life.</p>



<p>He would go on to become known as one of the most effective junglers in League of Legends.</p>



<p>In his video, Levi said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I hope that, in the future, I’ll be happier, smile more, and continue to be with you all. It’s time to say goodbye to the professional League of Legends Levi and welcome the beginning of the streamer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the Pacific region, especially, Levi is something of a legend, and he’s arguably the best player to ever emerge from Vietnam.</p>



<p>Here’s Levi’s full farewell video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Mình chính thức giải nghệ" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8GVw842VlpE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Like many other retired esports competitors, Levi will now turn his attention to content creation:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I love streaming. Even while I was competing, I spent a lot of my free time streaming and interacting with everyone. I love making people laugh. I’ll still play League of Legends and watch official matches.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-age-estimation-feature-users-concerned/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-adding-new-%E2%80%98age-estimation%E2%80%99-feature-that-has-users-concerned.1357600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Roblox is taking another step into the realm of child safety by setting up an age estimation feature that <strong>must be used </strong>before users can chat to anyone within the ecosystem, it has been revealed. From December, users worldwide will be forced to complete an age estimation process if they want to use Roblox to message any other player, but not everyone is pleased.</p>



<p>This is because the age estimation is being achieved via an AI-supported platform called Persona. Users will need to upload a picture of themselves, which is then analyzed by AI, and subsequently placed into an ‘age group’ that remains inherently restricted.</p>



<h2 id="h-good-not-great">Good, Not Great</h2>



<p>The Roblox Corporation has been closely scrutinized over the last year or so, with several significant lawsuits being filed against the company because it does not do enough to protect children using the platform. It has been claimed numerous times that Roblox is a breeding ground for predators, and even Chris Hansen came out to make a damning documentary against the ecosystem.</p>



<p>The latest ‘safety standard’ will see Roblox introduce an age estimation process that will start being deployed as early as next month.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent release</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re unlocking chat and age-appropriate experiences for our users by requiring them to complete an age check through Facial Age Estimation or ID verification<sup>1</sup>. Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become&nbsp;Trusted Connections&nbsp;with people they know.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It begins in regions like Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, but by January, the rest of the world will be pulled into the optional age estimation check. If you want to chat on Roblox, you <strong>must </strong>verify your ‘age group’.</p>



<p>The Roblox Corporation explained how this will work:<br></p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of our ongoing consultations with child development experts, we’ve defined common-sense limits on who can chat together on Roblox. After users complete the age check process, we will inform them of their assigned age group: Under 9, 9-12, 13-15, 16-17, 18-20, or 21+. Users will be able to chat with those in their own age group and similar age groups, as appropriate.</p>



<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Elisa (estimated age 12):&nbsp;</strong>Elisa has access to chat with users aged 15 or younger in Experience chat. All users 16 or older are prevented from initiating or engaging in chat with her.</li>



<li><strong>Marcus (estimated age 18):&nbsp;</strong>Marcus has access to chat with users aged 16 or older and could add a younger sibling as a Trusted Connection, as long as they are 13 or older.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Roblox claims that more than 145 new ‘safety innovations’ have been deployed this year alone, but critics remain sceptical. This latest evolution has users concerned about uploading images of children to a platform powered by AI.</p>

<p>The recent Flank Invitational has been perfect for allowing fans of the Call of Duty League a glimpse at how pro players are getting to grips with Black Ops 7’s movement mechanics. The near-future title boasts wall-hopping, faster pacing, and a more technical theme that allows the movement kings of the COD League to really finesse their opponents.</p>



<p>In a recent clip that surfaced on social media, OpTic Texas’ Cuyler ‘Huke’ Garland was seen dunking on Envoy, Abuzah, and Neptune in a slick 1 v 3 that seemed effortless for the recent world champion.</p>

<p>OpTic Texas is moving differently in Black Ops 7, despite Shotzzy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-no-aim-assist-cod-world-champ/">having early concerns</a> about the game’s aim assist mechanics. This game facilitates slick, fast-paced movement, which fits nicely into the wheelhouse of these players.</p>



<p>Huke, especially, is having a brilliant time, with fans recognizing a callback to the Advanced Warfare and Infinite Warfare era of competitive Call of Duty, otherwise known as the ‘Jetpack’ era.</p>



<p>Here’s a clip that surfaced recently on Reddit showing Huke piecing apart a more than capable trio during The Flank’s Black Ops 7 Invitational tournament:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Months ago, Huke was a pivotal part of OpTic Texas securing back-to-back world championship titles, and even more recently, he was part of the squad that secured the top spot at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>Going into the CDL 2026 season, the OpTic Texas roster is looking <strong>white hot</strong>, and there are high expectations for the team in the coming months. Could this be a third consecutive COD League Championship for the organization?</p>



<p>Let me know what you think OpTic Texas’ chances are for a three-peat next season on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Midweek madness is here, and hopefully, your streak is persisting through it. The festive season is fast approaching, and you’ve got a lot more to focus on, I understand, but getting these NYT Connections hints and solutions down is important <strong>right now</strong>! With that being said, I’ve got the answers you need for today’s puzzle.</p>



<p>If you’re stumped, read on, as I’ve got the instant NYT Connections solutions for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-19">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 19)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #892:</p>



<ul>
<li>SQUAT</li>



<li>SHEPHERD</li>



<li>PIT</li>



<li>FALL</li>



<li>LUNGE</li>



<li>LEAD</li>



<li>SKINK</li>



<li>SOLID</li>



<li>HUSKY</li>



<li>CASK</li>



<li>DIRECT</li>



<li>COLONY</li>



<li>GUIDE</li>



<li>THINK</li>



<li>MASQUE</li>



<li>HEARTH</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>All straightforward descriptors for a compact, sturdy build.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Clear verbs meaning “to show the way” or “influence direction.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>“The Cask of Amontillado,” “The Fall of the House of Usher,” “The Masque of the Red Death,” “The Pit and the Pendulum.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each is a valid word formed from a body organ plus a single trailing letter.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 19.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-19-892">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 19 (#892)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– HUSKY, SOLID, SQUAT, THICK</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DIRECT, GUIDE, LEAD, SHEPHERD</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CASK, FALL, MASQUE, PIT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COLONY, HEARTH, LUNGE, SKINK</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 is Going Free to Play From November 25 for One Week]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-going-free-to-play-for-one-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-going-free-to-play-from-november-25-for-one-week.1357573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6, the latest ambitious shooter in the legendary first-person franchise, is preparing to go free-to-play for a week, starting November 25. In a recent blog post, Electronic Arts (and associated studios) revealed the free trial period that’s opening up for Battlefield 6, which will likely be accompanied by a considerable discount on the game as Black Friday surfaces.</p>



<p>This limited-time, restricted-scope offering will allow players to experience a fair chunk of Battlefield 6 without investing a penny in the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-free-trial-coming-soon">Battlefield 6 Free Trial Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a blog post on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-california-resistance-mid-season-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA website</a>, the Battlefield 6 free trial period was revealed by the team. It was promised that ‘more information’ will be published soon, but for now, we have a description of what the free trial entails:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From November 25 to December 2, ultimate all-out warfare is free** for everyone. Fight in intense urban combat on the streets of Cairo. Drop into iconic SoCal landscapes turned into battlegrounds on Eastwood and Blackwell Fields. Enter Battlefield’s iconic massive scale warfare in Conquest or Breakthrough. Go head-to-head destroying enemy cargo in Sabotage. Engage in pure high-intensity close-quarters combat in Team Deathmatch. This is your call to squad up. Make it count.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This free trial showcases Battlefield 6’s new mode, Sabotage, which was released in the latest update just days ago. Typically, first-person shooters like Call of Duty and anything else in that vein offer free trial <strong>weekends</strong>, so an entire week for Battlefield 6’s free trial window is obviously above and beyond.</p>



<p>It’s widely assumed that the progress you rack up during the free trial week will roll over into the full game, should you choose to upgrade at any point. In a week, you can grind the living daylights out of the game and unlock stacks of content, so you might be persuaded if a good enough sale goes live to accompany the trial.</p>







<p>In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/">Battlefield 6 review</a>, we said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s plenty of juice in the tank where the multiplayer platform is concerned, and Electronic Arts’ studios will keep it plugged full of content for a while.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-megabonk-nomination-withdrawal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-removes-nomination-for-the-first-time-ever.1357510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the first time ever, a nomination has been revoked from The Game Awards. The game in question, Megabonk, was disqualified with permission from the creator after a misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Since 2014,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-most-watched-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>&nbsp;have become a big celebration for the best of gaming each year. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, it’s become home to several big reveals and moments, especially for Game of the Year. With a year as big as 2025 was for games, the competition is sure to be worthy of watching. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nominations for the awards</a> came out earlier this week and had some snubs and surprises. However, it seems there’s already been a shakeup with one of the nominated games.</p>

<p>The situation unraveled after The Game Awards nominations earlier this week. Megabonk, one of the games’ up for Best Debut Indie Game, was a pretty popular title when it released. However, the creator, who, <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the Tweets</a>, goes by John Megabonk, asked to be removed from the nominations. As for why, he said the following:</p>



<p>“<strong>I’m withdrawing from The Game Awards. It’s an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately i don’t think it qualifies for the category ‘Debut Indie Game,’</strong>” the creator said. “<strong>I’ve made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game.</strong>“<a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603"></a></p>



<p>The category, Best Debut Indie Game, is reserved for those who’ve published their first-ever game as a studio, so those who have, even under a different name, shouldn’t count. Geoff Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990899068022005881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later posted on Twitter</a> that, after the creator’s comments, that <strong>Megabonk would be taken off the list</strong>. This now leaves&nbsp;Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, Despolete, and Dispatch as the sole nominees. While it is shocking to see, at least the creator was honest about the situation. Unfortunately, Megabonk was only nominated for the one category so, while they won’t be going home with anything this year, at least it was on a good note.</p>







<p>What do you think of Megabonk being disqualified from The Game Awards? Do you agree with the withdrawal? Did you think it could’ve won the category?
