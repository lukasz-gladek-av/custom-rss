<p>A recent Fortnite leak has revealed which Jujutsu Kaisen characters will be featured in the upcoming Wave 2 skins collection.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885794070682910998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, the Fortnite x Jujutsu Kaisen collaboration will feature three new skins for players to try out, including Ryomen Sukuna, Mahito and Toji Fushiguro. Sukuna is a no-brainer, one of the series’s most popular characters, and players will be excited to see this skin arrive. Toji Fushigiro is a new favourite from the anime series’ second season, and you can see the comment section of this post already raving about his arrival. Mahito, on the other hand, was one of the series’ main antagonists till the end of season 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the leaks are correct, Fortnite’s collaboration with Jujutsu Kaisen will provide players with new skins and cosmetics themed around season 2. The Wave 1 collaboration featured season 1’s Yuji Itadori, Satoru Gojo, Nobara Kugisaki, and Megumi Fushigiro as skins. Fortnite also featured some popular moves from the series as Mythics: Hollow Purple and Straw Doll Technique, which makes players wonder if the next collaboration will introduce new mythics or see the return of the existing JJK mythics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR has also provided an <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885409443933741111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">updated list</a> of collaborations for Fortnite, which features much more than Jujutsu Kaisen. In this update or upcoming ones, players might see Disney’s Avatar, a new Ironman skin, Off-White cosmetics, an AC Milan Collaboration, a Demon Slayer collaboration, a Pixar Cars collaboration, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite will receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-get-more-dc-collabs-after-multiversus-shutdown-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more DC collabs after the Multiversus shutdown</a>, according to a new claim. Also, the game is seemingly receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-red-hulk-falcon-and-superman-skins-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Hulk, Falcon and Superman skins</a>.

<p>A known Fortnite insider has claimed that DC collabs for Fortnite will increase after Multiversus has been shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR, known for Fortnite leaks and rumours, <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885376822830932335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke about</a> Warner Bros.’s “new tactic” for DC in gaming after Multiversus was discontinued. The insider revealed that due to Multiversus, DC had stopped collaborating with other games. However, since the title has announced its shutdown, its new strategy is to “double down on collabs with other games again,” this list includes Epic’s popular battle royale, Fortnite.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has always had DC skins, but the collaboration is nowhere near how they have partnered with Marvel, with the latter getting new skins with each new movie or series. Fortnite already has some iconic DC skins, such as the Joker, Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman (multiple variants of him), and other heroes and villains. However, players would like to see a Fortnite season themed around the DC universe, especially with James Gunn and Peter Safran’s new DCEU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multiversus <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-is-officially-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its official shutdown last week, with the game’s fifth season serving as the final update for the game. The last time to play Multiversus online will be May 30. After that, the game can only be accessed through the local gameplay mode, which allows you to fight solo against AI opponents or with up to three friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite Festival is seemingly bringing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-sabrina-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a> next season. Also, the game might receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-red-hulk-falcon-and-superman-skins-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Hulk, Falcon, and Superman skins</a> next. What are your thoughts on Fortnite receiving more DC content after Multiversus is shutting down?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
