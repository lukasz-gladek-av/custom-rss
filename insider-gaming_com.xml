            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps-plus-prices-are-rising-in-some-regions.1161816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps-plus-prices-rising-some-regions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The price of PlayStation Plus will increase in dozens of countries. As of the writing of this text, the increase in subscription value will be applied in South American countries, such as Brazil, as well as in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/ps-plus-price-hikes-strike-even-more-countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oceania</a> and certain Asian countries, including Malaysia, China, Singapore, and Thailand.</p>



<p>In South America, this increase has generated outrage on social media. It marks the second increase in subscription value in less than two years. PlayStation issued a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/20250410-psplus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vague justification</a>, claiming that all PS Plus tiers have become more expensive due to “global market conditions.”</p>



<p>Analyzing the new prices, it seems that PlayStation’s goal is to align subscription prices with those in the United States. The 12-month PlayStation Plus Extra, for example, is sold for $99.99.</p>



<p>Existing users in <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/br/aumento-preco-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brazil</a></strong> will now pay R$546.90 (a 12% increase), which is equivalent to $92.67. This price globalization movement disregards macroeconomic factors such as disparities in purchasing power and the differing levels of inflation in various countries.</p>



<p>Overall, the increases ranged from 8% to 21% among the different subscription tiers. It’s worth mentioning that the quality of the games added to the catalog has indeed improved in recent months. Notable inclusions include High On Life, Robocop: Rogue City, and the announcement of <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-playstation-plus-game-catalog-games-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a></strong> yesterday. Additionally, two games were released Day One on the service: Blue Prince, the indie hit of the moment, and Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage.</p>



<p>Currently, no information has been released about a possible PS Plus price increase in North America.</p>

<p>There’s a good chance you’ve never heard of Brown Dust 2 until recently. I certainly hadn’t, but trusty social media has managed to make Neowiz’s game—the publishers of Lies of P—go very viral for obvious reasons.</p>



<p>Sometimes you must tread carefully with a story, and Brown Dust 2 might be the very definition of this. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-full-trophy-list-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P</a> publisher Neowiz’s Brown Dust 2 is a gacha-based RPG, encouraging players to spend money on random spins to obtain incredible gear and desired characters. </p>



<p>The gameplay and graphics seem serviceable enough, but the characters serve as the centerpiece of recent social media attention. The game has blown up out of nowhere, and it’s not hard to see why.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.neowiz.com/game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Neowiz</a> has garnered a solid reputation in the last 12 months for being part of Lies of P. The incredible soulslike defied expectations to deliver a compelling and coherent action experience. A DLC follow-up is on the way in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-overture-prequel-announced-its-not-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P Overture</a>—with a full-blown <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-sequel-could-be-open-world-according-to-new-job-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a> likely to happen.</p>



<p>The company is also responsible for countless mobile titles, including Brown Dust 2. It might shock you to learn that Brown Dust 2 came out in 2023! But it’s only now that all eyes are on the RPG. Why though? Because of the Iron Monarch Wilhelmina.</p>



<p>The official YouTube announcement trailer for the character has an eye-popping description below the video: “Introducing our queen who’s become one with her tights!” True, tights were a popular fighting garment during the Middle Ages, so it’s not too farfetched-ish.</p>



<p>But Wilhelmina’s first few seconds of being shown to the world involve an extreme close-up of her derrière, followed by the character emphatically pulling on her tights and letting them slap against her skin. She juxtaposes this by comically taking her fighting stance and posing straight after.</p>



<p>The trailer also features several other Brown Dust 2 female characters. New skins are advertised for them, with poses, positions, and outfits that will make you aware of your surroundings very quickly. The <a href="https://x.com/BROWNDUST2_EN/status/1909895275902317020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">April 9 X reveal trailer</a> has already been viewed <strong>18 million times</strong> on X and counting, with the figure rising all the time.</p>
