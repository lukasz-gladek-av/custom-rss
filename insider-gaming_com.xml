<p>Valve has announced a brand new limited edition white Steam Deck OLED. It will be released on November 18, 2024, at 3 PM PST and will be priced at $670 in all shipping regions for the Steam Deck. The list also includes Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong via Komodo, as well as new customers in Australia.</p>



<p>The Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White features the exact specifications as the 1TB model, the only difference being the handheld console’s new white and grey encasing. The limited edition model will also have an exclusive white carrying case and a white microfibre cloth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Valve has revealed that the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White was manufactured in “limited quantities,” and the stock has been allocated proportionately across the available regions. Hence, the US, CA, UK, EU, AU, and Komodo regions will have individual availability. Moreover, to ensure that more customers can buy this limited edition console, purchases have been restricted to 1 unit per account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, to be eligible for the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White, you will need a Steam account that has made a purchase before November 2024. Lastly, this is a limited edition release, and Valve has explicitly stated, “We will not be making more of this particular design. Once we are sold out, we will be sold out.”&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-class-action-lawsuit-shutting-down-the-crew/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft shut down the servers for The Crew in March 2024, and this decision has not been well received by the community. While fans understood the removal of the multiplayer aspect of the game, they were frustrated that the single-player mode was also made inaccessible. Now, fans have filed a lawsuit against the publishers for failing to provide an offline mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/790913960/Crew-Lawsuit-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">court document</a> reveals that plaintiffs Matthew Cassel and Alan Liu have brought this class action against Ubisoft Entertainment S.A. and Ubisoft, Inc. on behalf of themselves and “all others similarly situated” for shutting down The Crew.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have accused Ubisoft of duping them in several ways. Firstly, they stated that Ubisoft “misled consumers by telling them they were buying a game, when in fact, all they were renting was a limited license to access a game.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have also alleged that Ubisoft “omitted material facts from the packaging and marketing” of The Crew. It was stated that Ubisoft didn’t mention that The Crew’s servers could be shut down at any point “without providing, at a minimum, an offline mode for consumers to continue to access the game they paid for”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, they bought physical discs, believing “The Crew itself was encoded onto physical disks consumers could buy or the digital files consumers could pay to download.” Instead, the game was on a remote server, and the physical disc acted as a key to access this server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs stated that when they purchased The Crew’s physical discs, they believed the game would be playable indefinitely without the risk of it being disabled. They also gave examples stating that Ubisoft had shut down online servers for games like Assassin’s Creed 2, Assassin’s Creed 3, and more in the past, but it patched an offline mode later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in the case of The Crew, even after the community backlash, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-feature-offline-modes-for-long-term-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a>, stating that offline features of other games from the Crew franchise (The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest) would be preserved. But the original The Crew was left out of the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have demanded a trial by jury and “the aggregate claims of all members of the proposed class are in excess of $5,000,000.00, exclusive of interest and cost” as this is a class-action lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a group of modders have announced their commitment to resurrect The Crew. Also, Rainbow Six Siege made more money than any other Ubisoft franchise.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-pubg-mobile-ranks-how-to-get-conqueror/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is no secret that PUBG Mobile is just as popular as its console version, PUBG: Battlegrounds. The game also has its very own ranked mode, which has a large number of players competing to climb through the system every day. But how easy is it to rank up in PUBG Mobile? Here is a list of all the PUBG Mobile ranks and how you can rank up to the top.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-pubg-mobile-ranks">All PUBG Mobile Ranks</h2>



<p>PUBG Mobile has its own set of ranks just like any other competitive game. However, a few of the game’s ranks are a bit different than the average shooter Battle Royale. </p>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in PUBG Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze</strong> (III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Crown</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Ace</strong></li>



<li><strong>Conqueror</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>PUBG Mobile’s final rank, Conqueror, is made up of the top 500 players in the server you play on, making it incredibly hard to reach. So, how does some a player get to Conqueror?</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-conqueror-in-pubg-mobile">How to Get Conqueror in PUBG Mobile</h2>



<p>Ranking up in PUBG Mobile, like any other Battle Royale, relies heavily on placement points. The longer you stay alive in a match, the more points you earn. Obviously, if you win a game, you will earn the most points. </p>



<p>But placement is not the only way to climb the ranks in PUBG Mobile. Kills are an essential aspect of ranking up in the game, as the more kills you get in a game the more points you end up with. </p>



<p>Even looting and getting assists will help you rank up in PUBG Mobile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-points-needed-to-rank-up">Points Needed to Rank Up</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the points needed to move up a rank in PUBG Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze:</strong> Below 1500</li>



<li><strong>Silver:</strong> 1500 – 1999</li>



<li><strong>Gold:</strong> 2000 – 2499</li>



<li><strong>Platinum:</strong> 2500 – 2999</li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong> 3000 – 3499</li>



<li><strong>Crown:</strong> 3700 – 4199</li>



<li><strong>Ace:</strong> 4200 – 4699</li>
</ul>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Conqueror in PUBG Mobile?</p>

<p>Halo Infinite has a bit larger ranked system compared to other video games, with quite a few levels within each rank. However, this just adds to the thrill of trying to rank up in the game. Here are all the Halo Infinite ranks and how you can hit the final rank, Hero.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-halo-infinite-ranks">All Halo Infinite Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in Halo Infinite in order from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recruit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Onyx</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hero</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Progressing through the ranks listed above is a bit different of a system compared to other games. Let’s break it down.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-progress-through-halo-infinite-ranks-and-hit-hero">How to Progress through Halo Infinite Ranks and Hit Hero</h2>



<p>Hitting Hero in Halo Infinite is no easy feat. There are quite a few different ranks you have to climb through before getting there. Each main rank is broken up into the following smaller ranks. Below is a list from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cadet</strong></li>



<li><strong>Private</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lance Corporal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Corporal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Staff Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gunnery Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lieutenant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Captain</strong></li>



<li><strong>Major</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lt. Colonel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Colonel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brigadier General</strong></li>



<li><strong>General</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s Military-styled system applies to all ranks except Recruit and Hero. To hit Hero, you must climb through the entire ranking system. To do so, all you have to do is play the game’s Ranked mode. </p>



<p>Losses will push you back in rank while wins and high-kill games will skyrocket you forward. Every player’s rank is also showcased on their individual profile, letting other players know just how good they actually are at the game.</p>



<p>Special events, like Double XP, do not count towards your rank progression, however. What’s even more interesting, is one’s rank does not apply skill-based matchmaking. You will be playing with random ranks as you progress through the game’s levels.</p>

<p>Looking to rank up in Street Fighter 6? The popular fighting game has dominated the video game market since its release back in 2023 and has quite an immersive ranking system. Here is a list of all the Street Fighter ranks and how you can climb them quickly. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-street-fighter-ranks">All Street Fighter Ranks</h2>



<p>Here is a list of every rank in Street Fighter 6 from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie</strong></li>



<li><strong>Iron</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>So, how does a player climb through these ranks to hit Master?</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-progress-fast-through-street-fighter-ranks">How to progress fast through Street Fighter ranks</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Every game has its own ranking system, some more unique than others, and Street Fighter is no stranger to uniqueness when it comes to its popular ranked system.</p>



<p>Here is how you can move up and down in the official Street Fighter ranked system:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie</strong>: Players get a win streak bonus. No LP loss on defeat.</li>



<li><strong>Iron, Bronze, Silver and Gold:</strong> Players get a win streak bonus. No league demotion. One-time rank-down protection.</li>



<li><strong>Platinum and Diamond:</strong> No win streak bonus. League demotion enabled. One-time rank-down protection.</li>



<li><strong>Master:</strong> No win streak bonus. No league demotion.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each rank consists of five smaller ranks that players will have to climb before moving to the next. One good game in Silver will not progress you immediately to Gold.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-hit-master">How to hit Master</h2>



<p>Climbing to Master in Street Fighter is no easy feat. In fact, quite a few gamers never even hit Platinum or Diamond. The game requires a heavy amount of dedication for those looking to make it all the way to the final rank.</p>



<p>With league demotions playing a factor in Platinum and Diamond, it can be easy to go backward when trying to achieve the rank of Master. You will have to consistently win matches if you want to make it all the way to the final rank.</p>

<p>During a recent Twitch stream, Matthew ‘Nadeshot’ Haag, former pro COD player and founder of 100 Thieves, inadvertently leaked his one-month earnings on the platform. In a split-second slip-up, the popular creator and co-owner of the top-tier esports organisation revealed that in a single month, he has made a whopping $238,146 on Twitch.</p>



<p>That’s the total accused from 399 hours of streams – the creator has effectively been running a non-stop subathon all month, which seems to be the go-to for creators wanting to make big bucks these days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-effortless-earnings">Effortless Earnings</h2>



<p>Nadeshot is a likeable content creator with years in the industry. From his beginnings as a professional Call of Duty player to the foundation of 100 Thieves, he has gone from strength to strength over the last decade or so. His recent foray into streaming has been a lucrative one, and right now, he’s making almost a quarter of a million dollars a month on Twitch.</p>



<p>From 399 hours of streaming in a 30-day window, the creator <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/nadeshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has amassed 47,505 subscriptions</a> and racked up a total of 58 hours of ad breaks. The bulk of his earnings has been made up of gifted subs, with the second most valuable earnings category being ad revenue.</p>



<p>Despite his success, Nadeshot isn’t pulling in a massive audience. His most recent bout of streams peaked at around 18,800 viewers, which has led many to question just how much money some larger creators like Kai Cenat must be making on Twitch.</p>



<p>Cenat, one of the most-watched streamers on the planet, pulls in a peak concurrent viewer count of around 170,000 users, earning tens of thousands of new followers per stream. He currently boasts a staggering 302,230 subs, compared to Nadeshot’s 45,761. I’m no good with numbers, but it stands to reason that Cenat is making <strong>millions of dollars </strong>every month on Twitch with ease.</p>
