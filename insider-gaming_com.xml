<p>The latest trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> highlights some gameplay changes and showcases a version of CM Punk that has never officially appeared in a video game.</p>



<p>During the WWE Royal Rumble event, a new gameplay trailer premiered for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461">WWE 2K26</a> video game. The trailer showcased the returning Inferno Match, the debut of the Dumpster Match, the return of the ability to stack tables, and the return of thumbtacks in WWE games for the first time since WWE Legends of WrestleMania in 2009.</p>



<p>Another key focus was the reveal of CM Punk’s Ring of Honor gear. CM Punk was shown in a square-off with his younger self. Ring of Honor is a promotion that launched the careers of wrestlers like CM Punk, Samoa Joe, and Bryan Danielson. The CM Punk model also featured his blonde hair from the early days of his career, from 2002 to 2003. This is the first time that this young version of CM Punk has been officially on display in a wrestling game.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>As first reported by Insider Gaming, the WWE 2K26 Showcase campaign features the career of CM Punk. It will also be narrated by CM Punk and tease some what-if matches that could have taken place had Punk not left WWE nearly a decade back in 2014.</p>



<p>CM Punk is also the cover Superstar this year. His first time on the cover since WWE ’13 back in 2012. That game also featured a spotlight on the WWE Attitude Era, as this game will. The WWE Attitude Era edition of the game will cost $129.99. See all game prices at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/" id="172964">this link.</a></p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>
