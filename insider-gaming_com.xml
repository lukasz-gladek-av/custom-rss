            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I fell in love with PIONER when it was released in early access on December 16, exclusively on Steam. It’s a post-apocalyptic MMORPG with serious potential, which is what I alluded to in my full review of the game. It has an unmistakable charm, despite being rooted in an irradiated, glum, and perilous world, fraught with mutants, bandits, and lethal anomalies.</p>



<p>PIONER was pieced together by GFA Games, a small studio with roots in the likes of STALKER and Metro. Recently, I had the opportunity to interview the studio’s founder and CEO, Aleksandr Nikitin, about the future of his game and why PIONER simply <strong>had to be </strong>an MMORPG, despite a troubling climate for the genre.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-post-apocalyptic-pioner-had-to-be-an-mmo">Why Post-Apocalyptic PIONER Had To Be An MMO</h2>



<p>Talking to Aleksandr Nikitin, I was curious to learn why PIONER wasn’t a single-player game, given that it’s the studio’s debut title, and soaring out of the gate with a PvPvE MMORPG seemed like one hell of a bold ambition. According to Nikitin, opting for the MMO format was a strategic choice as much as a creative one.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Single-player games can certainly be self-contained as complete works or replayable like a movie you can rewatch multiple times.</p>



<p>However, much like the difference between a movie and a TV series, MMOs have clear advantages: beyond delivering new content and expanding the world, we can develop the story in front of players and allow them to become a part of it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nikitin suggested that the choice to develop an MMO was an intentional one from ‘the very beginning’ of the studio’s foundations. From a rocky origin that saw the studio traverse a financial downturn, the COVID-19 pandemic, and an outbreak of <strong>war</strong>, GFA Games stayed true to the notion of making a stellar MMORPG for an eager audience.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have both large-scale content already in progress, and active development of new content for future patches and expansions.</p>



<p>If players say they want more raids and we see that this mode is statistically more popular than expected, we need to be ready to postpone something else and increase the priority of what players want, because we are making this game for them.</p>



<p>It is important to preserve our vision that brought players to us in the first place, and finding this balance is truly critical for an MMO.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-review-early-access-mmo-ambition/">my PIONER review</a>, I revealed how well the game works as an MMORPG title, and how it can be compared to something like Fallout 76. It’s grittier and more serious in how it delivers content, but it’s just as entertaining and is loaded with enough original content to keep players <strong>engaged</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gfa-is-aware-of-the-struggles">GFA is Aware of the Struggles</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PIONER looks fantastic on screen</figcaption></figure>







<p>The MMORPG space is a rocky, tumultuous one, and the sentiments of the genre ebb and flow. It was just a few days ago that we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ashes-of-creation-collapse-entire-intrepid-studios-laid-off/">Ashes of Creation</a>, an early access MMORPG that raised millions of dollars, implode as the entire studio was laid off.</p>



<p>Nikitin is wholeheartedly aware of that but is willing to compete with the downturn to create something special:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Even legendary giants like Lineage 2 and World of Warcraft are facing serious challenges right now. Next-generation giants like TESO, FF, and F76 are also going through a rough period, while AAA projects like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rust-director-offers-25-million-to-keep-new-world-alive/">New World</a> are simply shutting down.</p>



<p>The MMORPG genre truly struggles to survive and compete with session-based games.</p>



<p>In our view, the only viable path forward is to combine genres, taking their strongest elements and creating a mix.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s what GFA Games did with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-roadmap-revealed-ambitious-few-months/">PIONER</a>. It has arena-based elements like traditional multiplayer matches, some battle royale mechanics, the classic MMO vibe, and the post-apocalyptic action-RPG feel you get from games like Metro and Fallout. It’s an open-world construct with multiple maps, countless threats, and stacks of missions to solve, and progression is everywhere.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-pioner">What’s Next for PIONER</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a showcase of post-apocalyptic vibes</figcaption></figure>







<p>Nikitin was generous enough to give me a look behind the veil of what comes next for PIONER.</p>



<p>There are plenty of aspirations to go above and beyond at GFA Games, which is great news for anyone neck-deep in PIONER, but also for anyone curious about the game and wanting to experience it on other platforms.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have ambitious plans to lay the foundation for a console release, further develop the game’s story, and create new modules.</p>



<p>We plan to focus on developing and optimizing the in-game economy.</p>



<p>We also plan to delight players with new content that was not ready for inclusion in the intitial early access version but already has strong groundwork. This includes new locations such as Big Earth and Shadowlands, new world bosses, and a number of features that are only now beginning development based on player requests.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Throughout the interview, it’s clear how much Nikitin and his team value community feedback. That’s the gist that I got from the game when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-launches-again-new-trailer/">I was testing it</a> ahead of the early access launch and experiencing it <strong>after </strong>it dropped. It’s the <strong>only way </strong>to develop a game that only survives if people are actively playing it.</p>



<p>In my opinion, PIONER is an underrated gem of the MMORPG space that deserves way more attention.</p>

            <guid>1425367</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> has lost another veteran member of the Assassin’s Creed team.</p>



<p>In a post on social media on Tuesday, Luc Couture announced that he was leaving Ubisoft Montreal after 24 years with the company. According to Couture, the move comes due to his desire for a change.</p>







<p><strong>“Today was my last day at Ubisoft Montreal,”</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424588173462183936/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. <strong>“It’s been an incredible journey that lasted more than 20 years….During that time, I have learned a lot about game development, relationships and myself.”</strong></p>



<p>Couture continued, saying he was “in need for some change”. That will come in the form of joining a new studio that’s smaller and consists of “other veterans”.</p>



<p><strong>“Times are exciting,” </strong>he said. <strong>“So stay tuned!”</strong></p>







<p>Couture started with Ubisoft in 2002 as a level designer working on the Prince of Persia franchise. Eventually, he would move on to being a senior level designer and level design director on games like the Assassin’s Creed franchise, Watch Dogs 2 and Legion, Far Cry 4, and more. </p>



<p>His departure comes during a tumultuous time for Ubisoft. Not only is the company going through a massive restructure with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds or more layoffs likely</a>, but it’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-vote-to-strike-against-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing striking employees</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-union-ceo-yves-guillemot-resignation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls for CEO Yves Guillemot to resign</a> from his position.</p>



<p>The former head of the Assassin’s Creed series, Marc-Alexis Côté&nbsp;also left after two decades in September due to changes at the company. In Côté’s case, however, he claims <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he was forced out</a> and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-million-damages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suing the company</a> for $1.3 million. </p>



<p>What do you think of Couture leaving Ubisoft? Is this the start of an exodus of veteran developers and leaders leaving the company?

<p>Looting and shooting is the name of the game in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and there are plenty of places to find the best gear. Typically, you’re best off searching the high-tier loot zones, the areas outlined in red, but not a lot of people know that there are tons of hidden stashes littered throughout the maps.</p>



<p>These aren’t marked as POIs, and they can often appear unassuming, but these hidden loot spots can spawn numerous searchable containers—including weapon cases. It’s not always a guarantee, but if you’re passing by some of these places on your next raid, do yourself a favour and check them out.</p>







<p>Here are seven secret loot spots that you need to know about in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pve-mode/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pve-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>.</p>

</figure>



<p>To kick things off, load into Dam Battlegrounds and head to the North East part of the map. Here, you’ll see the bridge has collapsed; what you’ll need to do is run to the very end of the bridge—and drop off the edge.</p>



<p>That might sound like a death wish, or at least a twisted ankle, but tucked underneath the bridge inside the concrete is a secret room. If you slowly shimmy off the edge and spam your jump button as you’re falling, you should catch onto the ledge of the hidden room and be greeted with an assortment of searchable containers. </p>

</figure>



<p>You’ll want to stick around in Dam Battlegrounds and go to the Red Lakes. It’s a fairly open area, so be careful of any roaming Rocketeers or Leapers. What you’re looking for are the two ruins you can see pinpointed on the map above.</p>



<p>You can get inside one of them, and tucked away at the back, a weapon case can spawn. Additionally, just across the water are some more breachable containers, which have a chance to spawn some blueprints.</p>

</figure>



<p>To wrap things up in Dam Battlegrounds, you’ll need to head all the way to the South of the map. As is the case with most of these locations, this one isn’t a marked POI on the map, but you’ll want to head towards the electrical tower and work your way to its platform. </p>



<p>Here, you can find another weapon case, as well as a medical bag. It’s definitely one of the easier loot spots to find, but because it’s on the outskirts of the map, it’s often left untouched. </p>







<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Start here, but they’re scattered around. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><figcaption>Just across the road. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>This one’s easily missed. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Most hidden spots tend to have one or two weapon cases maximum, but if you go to Marano Station in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buried City</a>, there’s a chance you can find five! </p>



<p>To get started, go to the actual station. There’s a breachable door that can spawn a weapon case, and once you’ve checked there, use the train to climb onto the roof, where another one can spawn. </p>







<p>The next few are scattered around the station. One case can spawn in the nearby bus, whilst another can appear slightly East of the station, tucked next to a bench.</p>



<p>Finally, head over to the nearby Library POI and make your way to the roof. Up there, a weapon case can spawn on top of the ventilation shafts. If you’re incredibly lucky, all five could spawn, and you could walk away with a backpack full of guns.</p>







<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Be careful when breaching the door. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>On the back of a van. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>After five weapon cases, there’s still more to find in Buried City. Make your way to the Parking Garage, and go down to the lowest level. Breach the door, and you’ll see a zipline. Instead of going up, drop down onto the sand below, and you’ll find a hidden floor of the Garage.</p>



<p>Inside, you’ll find a variety of breachable containers, including numerous metal crates and hopefully a weapon case. Overall, it’s just a great loot spot, and it’s one you should add to your routine.</p>







<figure>
<figure><figcaption>You might need a Zipline. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Hidden in a vent. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>There are two ways to access this hidden weapon case on Spaceport: you’ll either need the North Trench Tower Key if you want to maximise the loot, or simply a zipline if you’re just after the case.</p>



<p>Either way, make your way to the very top of the North trench Tower, and look around for a vent shaft. You can climb inside, and you’ll hopefully see a weapon case hidden under the concrete lip. If you brought the Key with you, feel free to loot the rest of the Tower—there are plenty of containers to search.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Number 1. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Number 2. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>To wrap things up, load into The Blue Gate. Technically speaking, these cases are located in a high-tier loot zone, but they’re so commonly missed that it’s always worth checking. </p>



<p>The easiest way to get these cases is to find the zipline shafts on the surface, which are highlighted on the map above. Drop down and search atop the vents for the first weapon case. Next, look down, and on top of some piping for the second weapon case. And finally, all the way on the ground floor, next to the large yellow pipe, a third and final weapon case can spawn.</p>

<p>Remember that not all of these are guaranteed to spawn, but you should certainly keep an eye out for them in your next raid.

            <title><![CDATA[Anti-Cheat CEO Reveals The Desperate Truth Behind Cheating in Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/anti-cheat-ceo-desperate-truth-behind-cheating-in-games/</link>
            <guid>1425295</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever played a multiplayer game, the chances are you’ve brushed up against a <em>cheater</em>. If not in the conventional sense, then at least in the realm of someone doing something <strong>malicious </strong>to disrupt the entertainment of legitimate players. It’s a bigger problem than people realize, and it’s costing some developers millions of dollars to combat.</p>



<p>In recent years, the plague of cheaters impacting the many multiplayer games out there has become an increasingly complex issue. As cheat manufacturers become more intelligent, traditional firefighting routes are being overwhelmed, and it’s now up to companies like <strong>Play Safe ID </strong>to find alternate ways to push back against the onslaught.</p>



<p>I recently sat down for an episode of Access Granted with Andrew Wailes, CEO and co-founder of Play Safe ID, to learn about the shocking truth behind cheating in games, and how we might all be overwhelmed if something doesn’t change soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-old-ways-are-gone-and-cheaters-are-unstoppable">The Old Ways Are Gone, and Cheaters Are Unstoppable</h2>



<p>For those developing a multiplayer game, few things are more critical than securing a solid anti-cheat engine that <strong>genuinely </strong>prevents malicious players from surfacing – and <strong>punishes them accordingly </strong>if they do. It’s not a cut-and-dry topic, though, as it has been likened to fighting a multi-headed hydra at times.</p>



<p>In 2025, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov, the face of Escape from Tarkov, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheating-situation-nikita-speaks/">described it as a ‘never-ending battle’</a>. His game is an extraction shooter, and it’s one of the most commonly-targeted titles in the gaming space, because there’s money to be made via RMT (real-money trading).</p>



<p>When Embark Studios released ARC Raiders in October 2025, a similar concept surfaced. On social media platforms, groups surfaced promoting RMT circles, and where that exists, cheaters surely follow. If they can get into a game, secure some rare loot via nefarious means, and sell it on some pseudo black market, <strong>they will</strong>.</p>



<p>In a drastic turn of events, one popular streamer named ARC Raiders <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/">‘worse than Call of Duty for cheaters’</a>, and that’s saying something.</p>



<p>But why is the situation getting worse all the time? Is it because more people than ever are playing on PC and have easier access to cheats, or is it because our world is becoming increasingly technical and more gamers know how to break games with complex hacks?</p>



<p>According to Andrew Wailes, the CEO and co-founder of Play Safe ID, an anti-cheat and player protection company, the truth is much more concerning.</p>



<h2 id="h-hundreds-of-thousands-of-cheat-developers-are-out-there">Hundreds of Thousands of Cheat Developers Are Out There</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cheaters can often easily see everything.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Andrew Wailes joined me in the most recent episode of Access Granted to talk about the state of play for <strong>cheating in gaming</strong>. Play Safe ID is revolutionizing the space by ensuring <strong>accountability </strong>takes precedence, working directly with developers and publishers to foster stronger communities where cheaters simply cannot prosper.</p>



<p>When I mentioned the ‘cat-and-mouse’ concept of the cheat development industry, Andrew assured me I’d hit the nail on the head.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a company like Battlestate or Embark, or any studio. You’re really well-funded, you’ve got a really successful, lightning in a bottle game, you’ve maybe got twenty people working on DevOps, anti-cheat detection, stuff like that.</p>



<p>You’ve got Easy, or BattlEye, VAC, Punkbuster, whatever. You’ve got this suite of tools.</p>



<p>But no matter how hard you’re working and all of your employees are working, there are <strong>thousands, to tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands </strong>of developers who make way more money than any of your staff ever will for cracking this puzzle.</p>



<p>Cheat developers aren’t necessarily <strong>bad people</strong> or evil, they’re usually very intelligent software developers that like complex, ever-changing problems and they like making a lot of money from solving them. </p>



<p>It’s just a business for them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the words of Sun Tzu, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.” That’s the concept that Play Safe ID is working with, and Andrew has built a solid profile of the entities he’s trying to help eradicate.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There are so many cheat developers who are so smart and who have a much more vested interest in getting their cheats to work than the anti-cheat does to be reactive and defeat it.</p>



<p>It’s not even like it’s an even fight, where you have the same number of cheat devs fighting as the number of people working to defend it. You have an overwhelming force of people trying to generate these cheats and break the system, and a minority force trying to fight it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The modern go-to for anti-cheat companies is to use artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven tools to combat cheaters. But Play Safe ID recognizes that even <strong>they </strong>aren’t silver bullets or a catch-all solution to fighting malicious operators.</p>



<p>Wailes said, ‘Do you know who also has AI? The people developing the cheats, and now that they can iterate and test much quicker, much more aggressively… There is no easy solve to this.”</p>



<p>Play Safe ID wants to make people <strong>accountable</strong>, using a data-driven ecosystem to empower players to represent themselves more transparently. They use a zero-retention data system to identify players across a range of integrated games, and if they cheat and are detected and subsequently banned on one platform, <strong>they’ll be banned across the suite of games</strong>.</p>



<p>Some developers, like Gamepires (SCUM), have used Play Safe ID to generate <strong>protected servers </strong>populated <strong>only </strong>by players registered with the platform. It’s a way to guarantee only verified, detectable players are using those servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-play-safe-id-the-solution">Is Play Safe ID The Solution?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can Play Safe ID combat cheaters in games like Escape from Tarkov?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Play Safe ID is trying to innovate in a very tricky space. Talking to Andrew, I learned more about the most litigious organizations that are using the power of the courts to chase down cheat manufacturers, but dipping back to the hydra analogy, for every company shut down, two more surface.</p>



<p>In some countries, such as South Korea, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-issues-thousands-of-10-year-bans-to-clamp-down-on-cheaters/">cheating in video games</a> is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison or the imposition of a massive fine. Wailes labelled it ‘a great attack vector’, but stressed you need to also encourage <strong>personal accountability</strong> on the end user and not just on those building the cheats.</p>



<p>It might not be the <strong>ultimate </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/">solution to cheating</a>, but it’s a sorely needed implementation that’s set to make waves. Some huge updates are coming to Play Safe ID’s corner of the market, and the hope is that the company can make a large enough impact to bring about tangible changes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It seems the Nintendo Switch 2 price increase will be carefully considered with the surge in memory costs. </p>



<p>With the recent increase in memory costs, the industry has been concerned about a rise in hardware prices. We have already seen AMD <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase the prices of its graphics cards</a>, NVIDIA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-reportedly-no-longer-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinue some of its GPUs</a>, and the questions about console prices are looming. However, it seems we have somewhat of an answer for the Switch 2. </p>







<h2 id="h-switch-2-price-increase-will-be-carefully-considered-says-nintendo-president">Switch 2 Price Increase Will be Carefully Considered, Says Nintendo President</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://jp.reuters.com/markets/world-indices/TUUSCEPJHBPUHI4W2N5VLZTRAA-2026-02-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> report, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa recently addressed the effects of rising memory costs on the company and the pricing of the Switch 2 during the latest earnings call Q7A. He stated that Nintendo does not expect this cost increase to have a “major impact” on its performance in the current fiscal year.</p>



<p>Coming to the Switch 2 price increase, Furukawa stated that they will “carefully consider the matter while taking a comprehensive look at the state of adoption of the platform, current sales trends, costs, profitability, market environment, and other factors,” (translated by Google)</p>



<p>Talking about the current profit margin situation, Furukawa stated that the company doesn’t see it as a “major issue.” Their priority is to “popularize the hardware” and then try to improve profit margins by maximising software sales. </p>







<p>In other news, Nintendo’s earnings call yesterday revealed that Switch 2 remains the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-crosses-17-million-units-sold-to-remain-fastest-selling-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s fastest-selling platform</a>, and that nearly half of Switch game sales <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nearly-half-of-nintendo-switch-games-sales-are-phyiscal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were physical</a>. Additionally, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-partner-direct-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a> for the Nintendo Partner Direct tomorrow has finally arrived.

            <title><![CDATA[Nikita Confirms COR3 Isn’t Related to Escape from Tarkov or Battlestate Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-confirm-cor3-not-related-battlestate-or-tarkov/</link>
            <guid>1425289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On Sunday, the mysterious project that Nikita Buyanov is connected with, known as ‘COR3’, was unveiled with a first-look trailer. It has already been compared to ‘Escape from Tarkov in space’, which is a concept fuelled by similarities and some ‘easter egg’ nods in the one-minute trailer that the shrouded team posted this weekend.</p>



<p>Today, Nikita emerged on social media to quell the rumors, stating clearly and simply that COR3 is <strong>not </strong>connected with Battlestate Games <strong>or </strong>Escape from Tarkov. It might look similar in some ways, but it’s totally unrelated.</p>







<h2 id="h-cor3-is-not-escape-from-tarkov-in-space">COR3 is NOT Escape from Tarkov in Space</h2>



<p>Weeks ago, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio that makes Escape from Tarkov, started posting cryptic teasers and puzzles related to COR3. This <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cor3-first-trailer-revealed-shooter-tarkov/">secretive new sci-fi game</a> has emerged after what’s believed to be a couple of years of development, but all we’ve seen so far is that first-look trailer and an interactive website that boasts a little lore about the project.</p>



<p>Until now, nobody in the world except Nikita has promoted COR3. That was enough to assume that it’s a project <strong>away </strong>from Battlestate Games and Escape from Tarkov, but it took the man himself taking to social media to set the story straight to quash the questions.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nikita also confirmed (in a Russian comment translated by Grok) that Escape from Tarkov isn’t being abandoned, so he can work on whatever COR3 is. The ongoing development of Escape from Tarkov’s post-launch period continues, and there are expansions on the horizon, including the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-dlc-scav-life/">first major DLC, <strong>Scav Life</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-duckov-collaboration-confirmed/">a new collaboration</a> is preparing to surface between Escape from Tarkov and Escape from Duckov, a parody extraction title that has joined forces with Battlestate Games in the <strong>best way</strong>.</p>







<p>We still don’t know much about what COR3 is, but we have confirmation now that it’s <strong>not </strong>linked to Escape from Tarkov.
