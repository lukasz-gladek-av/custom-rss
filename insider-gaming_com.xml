<p>2026 is set to be a mammoth year for gaming, and Xbox Game Pass subscribers have plenty to look forward to with their subscription, as a host of new releases are dropping day one.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s approach of having all first-party titles available on the launch day with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription has proven to be a solid move, and there’s a stacked list of titles coming this year.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has identified them all, with details on the games with an exact release date, and a rundown of the other games coming in 2026 without a solid release date yet.</p>

<p><strong>MENACE – Feb. 5</strong></p>



<p>After a delay last year, MENACE’s early access release is set for February 5, 2026, and there’s already been a playable demo available for the tactical title that puts players in control of a strike force against an alien threat. The turn-based tactical RPG comes from Overhype Studios, the developer of Battle Brothers.</p>



<p><strong>High on Life 2 – Feb. 18</strong></p>



<p>High on Life 2, a sequel to the original title from Squanch Games, lands on Xbox Game Pass day one on February 18, 2026, putting a whole new arsenal of foul-mouthed weapons into the hands of players. </p>

<p>Japan is the host of Forza Horizon 6. The racing game is going back to its roots with its gameplay, but the series continues to evolve where accessibility and playability are concerned. Forza Horizon 6 platforms are an interesting one, so it’s time to check which consoles it’s coming to.</p>



<p>Hello, Horizon! Playground Games has its hands in many pies, but it’s hard to picture a time when the developer isn’t working on some type of Horizon content. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-revealed-at-tokyo-game-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6 was revealed at Tokyo Game Show</a>, and it made all the sense in the world, considering the game’s setting.</p>



<p>So, let’s start building toward the game’s big-time release with a breakdown of consoles and platforms.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-playstation-ps4-amp-ps5-status-explained">Will Forza Horizon 6 Be On PlayStation? PS4 &amp; PS5 Status, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Racing toward the finish. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s been confirmed that Forza Horizon 6 will be on PlayStation 5 consoles after launch, but there will not be room for a PS4 port.</strong></p>



<p>FH6 on PlayStation is two-fold: On one hand, there’s no last-gen port, but this was expected. Whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-coming-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6 is coming to PS5 post-launch</a> and won’t be a day-one game for PlayStation like other platforms.</p>



<p>Firstly, the 2025 Forza Horizon 5 PlayStation port only arrived on PS5, not PS4. It’s likely due to the PlayStation 4 just not having the power to process the size and seismic levels of polish the game features. With FH6 expected to be bigger and better, a PS4 port was never happening.</p>



<p>Secondly, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-playstation-5-release-window-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6 PlayStation 5 release window has been confirmed</a>, so we all know it’s happening. You just might have to wait a while.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-xbox-xbox-one-status-explained">Will Forza Horizon 6 Be On Xbox? Xbox One Status, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 being on Xbox is a no-brainer, but this time, the new Forza game is on Xbox Series X|S, and there will be no Xbox One port.</strong></p>



<p>This one might be a kicker. FH5 will likely be the final Forza game on Xbox One, as Microsoft has moved on and is only developing Forza Horizon 6 for the Xbox Series X|S. A day-one launch for FH6 on Xbox Series X|S is happening, so you can pre-order now, but Xbox One owners need to upgrade their console to play.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-pc">Will Forza Horizon 6 Be On PC?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Vroom. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There will also be a Forza Horizon 6 PC release alongside the Xbox Series X|S launch.</strong></p>



<p>PC players really do get the best of everything (If you ignore the endless performance issues). Forza Horizon 6 buyers can acquire it on launch day for PCs—if you meet the demanding specs.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-nintendo-switch-amp-switch-2-status-explained">Will Forza Horizon 6 Be On Nintendo? Switch &amp; Switch 2 Status, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Whereas some platforms get a mixed bag, it’s a big no for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 players with a Forza Horizon 6 release.</strong></p>



<p>The PlayStation and Xbox divide is almost non-existent now. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-2025-is-the-year-the-console-wars-ended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console wars are basically over</a>, but a line is drawn between Nintendo and everyone else. The Japanese company is an independent monster that can’t stop rolling in cash every year. There’s no reason for Mario or Zelda to come to Nintendo unless the company suddenly nosedives into an unimaginable crisis.</p>



<p>While many third-party games are on the Switch 2, you won’t find Forza Horizon 6 making the drive.</p>



<p>What do you make of Forza Horizon 6’s platforms? Is it a good thing that a PS5 port is coming? Is it also sad that the Xbox One is no longer considered?

<p>The upcoming Fable reboot is in ‘consideration’ for the Nintendo Switch 2, according to an Xbox insider. </p>



<p>Playground Games’ Fable finally received some gameplay <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-release-window-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday at Xbox’s Developer Direct</a>, along with a concrete release window. The title is releasing for Xbox Series X/S and PC, as well as the PlayStation 5, on release day. It seems developers may have another platform in mind, but it isn’t 100% confirmed yet. </p>







<h2 id="h-fable-on-switch-2-isn-t-100-but-there-s-a-chance">Fable on Switch 2 isn’t 100%, But There’s a Chance</h2>



<p>The claim about Fable being discussed for the Switch 2 comes from reliable insider Jez Corden. According to his recent post on <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2014463781250777444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the release “isn’t 100% definite for now, but under consideration for the future.” In one of the replies, Corden also added that currently, the decision is in “logistics” today, and the port is not in development right now. However, he speculates that the port will come through. </p>



<p>Playground Games has also spoken about how it is retaining Fable’s true spirit while adding much more player freedom. The three core pillars of the upcoming title are “Freedom,” “Fairytale,” and “Britishness,” and they establish Fable’s DNA. The developers also spoke about transferable skills from working on the Horizon series, with their expertise in open-world games among the biggest. Check out all the details from the developer interview <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-founder-on-preserving-fables-true-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>







<p>In other news, the upcoming Fable reboot will unfortunately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/theres-no-dog-companion-in-new-fable-and-even-devs-are-upset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not have a dog companion</a>. Additionally, the game’s new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-explains-fables-new-reputation-based-morality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reputation-based morality system</a> will reflect our own world.
