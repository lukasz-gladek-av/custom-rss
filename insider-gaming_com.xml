<p>Split Fiction is the spiritual successor to It Takes Two, and people are hyped. Hazelight Studios has cracked the co-op formula, and Split Fiction’s release can’t come soon enough for those seeking a tandem adventure.</p>



<p>I constantly advocate gaming needing more co-op games. The genre isn’t as dead as people think it is has plenty of titles supporting local and online co-op. You need to check the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest co-op games coming in 2025</a> to see this. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> is likely to be the standard-bearer for the genre moving forward.</p>



<p>Director Josef Fares looks to keep the art of co-op alive and further the genre wherever possible.</p>

<p><strong>Hazelight Studios is launching Split Fiction on March 6.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a> hosted an incredible ceremony celebrating all things gaming. Amongst the awards were a large volume of game announcements and trailers. Hazelight Studios director Josef Fares announced the much-anticipated follow-up to It Takes Two—<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have any Early Access or ways to sample the action early. You and I have to wait patiently until March 6 to see what new ideas and innovations come up.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-platforms">Split Fiction Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>It’s a pure next-gen launch for Split Fiction debuting on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>I’m shocked Split Fiction is skipping last-gen formats, to be honest. It Takes Two launched on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC at launch—offering a Switch port one year later.</p>



<p>Whereas Split Fiction is sticking to the most recent generation, and that’s it. I’d argue a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-nintendo-switch-2-direct-reveal-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> release could happen in the future. Nintendo’s newest console is rumored to be a lot more powerful, so don’t be surprised if the Switch 2 eventually gives Split Fiction a new lease of life.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-editions-amp-price">Split Fiction Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Split Fiction has an established recommended retail price of $49.99 or £39.99 for the Standard Editon—the only version of Split Fiction.</strong></p>



<p>Physical and digital editions of Split Fiction exist. An interesting note is the Standard Edition is the <strong>only way to play Split Fiction</strong>. There is no Deluxe Edition, Unbelievable Mega Ultra Deluxe Edition, or a Collector’s Edition. This is good news for players unwilling or unable to splash out on constant expensive upgrades.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve a huge fan of Hazelight Studios from the A Way Out days. How much are you looking forward to Split Fiction? Does EA have another bonafide success on its hands?</p>



<p>Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction gameplay</a> to wet your whistle in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-state-of-play-for-february-12/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sony has officially announced its next PlayStation State of Play event. Confirming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors</a>, the show will take place on Wednesday, February 12 at 5pm ET/11pm CET.</p>



<p>In its announcement on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, the company says that the show will be over 40 minutes long, and will feature “news and updates on great games coming to PS5.” </p>



<p>“The show celebrates a creative and unique selection of exciting games from studios around the world,” Sony said with no other details being given regarding what games will appear.</p>



<p>But aside from the small tease from Sony, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6qKJBGGFu6X4hNmi6GQP8C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a> that a brand new game from a brand new studio will be shown during the event as well.</p>

<p>As far as what else to expect, it’s unclear. With plans for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more Xbox games</a> to come to the PlayStation 5, the show could see another announcement of the next Xbox game to come to PlayStation. Halo and Gears of War are two of the bigger names making the rounds online, though there is nothing to confirm those being the next games to come. Two games that could also be shown are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a> and Death Stranding 2 as both are scheduled to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Like always, Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the show as it airs, including every announcement you need to know.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-side-quests-will-feature-flashbacks-for-yasuke-and-naoe.1105857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-side-quests/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows creative director recently revealed what players should expect from the game’s side quests, and it seems we might get some flashback sequences for Yasuke and Naoe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows creative director Jonathan Dumont recently spoke about the game’s world, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-will-adapt-to-the-character-you-are-playing-with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dual-protagonist system</a>, side-quests and more during an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-world-protagonists-jonathan-dumont-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a>. When asked about the content of the side-quests, Dumont explained three different types, “objective board or bandits”, “relationship-oriented”, and ones that are “hidden behind a couple of meditation mechanics”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows side-quests that are hidden behind these meditation mechanics are the ones that let you “experience the past” of Naoe and Yasuke. At the start of the game, players will not know who these characters are exactly, but with the help of these flashbacks, they will understand why they are here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objective board or bandits side-quests in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be familiar to players. You need to hunt targets across the world, and they each have different abilities and values. It will be interesting to hunt ninjas and samurais this time around. On the other hand, the relationship ones help players build bonds with different characters, recruit them, and explore romantic options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is receiving&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-prequel-manga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a prequel manga</a>. Also, the game&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has the largest file size</a>&nbsp;in the franchise’s history.&nbsp;What are your thoughts on Assassin’s Creed Shadows side-quests?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-will-adapt-to-the-character-you-are-playing-with/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’s Creative Director has revealed that the game will adapt to the character you are playing with.</p>



<p>Many have wondered how Assassin’s Creed Shadows can be played with two characters with distinct archetypes and backgrounds. What if someone wants to play with only Naoe to be stealthy throughout their experience, or maybe Yasuke to be as aggressive as you can? The developer has now revealed how the game will change according to the player’s preferences while having unique experiences for both characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-world-protagonists-jonathan-dumont-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-director-on-splitting-time-between-the-two-heroes-the-core-of-the-game-can-be-pick-your-character-and-the-game-adapts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Jonathan Dumont, the game’s creative director, spoke at length about how the dual protagonist system will work for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Dumont explained that Yasuke and Naoe are distinct in gameplay but “complementary” in narrative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the story and the world are experienced from “two different sides.” Naoe comes from a Shinobi background, and Yasuke is a stranger but nobility at the same time. Dumont said he likes how “both voices sound very different, in the sense that they look at the world a little bit differently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont added that both Assassin’s Creed Shadows characters will receive “individual introductions and then they get their own questline”. This means Yasuke can’t play Naoe’s personal quests and vice versa. However, “the core of the game can be pick your character, and the game adapts”, explained the creative director.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont also clarified that there might be “a couple of choices here and there”, which might make players wonder “what would happen with this character”, but he doesn’t think they are “missing out”. The developers don’t want to force players to “try to split the time”; players can decide whether to stick to one or balance it out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-prequel-manga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a prequel manga</a>. Also, the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has the largest file size</a> in the franchise’s history.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The WWE Universe is once again preparing itself for War (Games). The release of WWE 2K25 continues 2K’s annual take on professional wrestling. With the profession hotter than ever, the developer is looking to deliver a five-star show worthy of headlining any Wrestlemania.</p>



<p>WWE 2K25 welcomes new wrestlers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-features-revealed-including-new-game-modes-and-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">match types</a>, and more chaos than ever before. It mirrors real-life WWE in its sense of progression and scope. The Triple H-era of WWE is producing record gates, attendances, and social media numbers and the interest is sky-high. It feels like 2K’s WWE games have been going the same way.</p>



<p>Gameplay footage has already revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-cover-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover star</a> and a gargantuan amount of graps, and we love it. If you’re also looking forward to 2K25, let’s check out everything we know about its key details.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-release-date">WWE 2K25 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dirty Dom has had it coming. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>WWE 2K25 releases on March 14 for all players, whereas you can get your name on the card earlier on March 7 via Early Access.</strong></p>



<p>March 14 is the official worldwide launch of <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25</a>. This is when anyone with any edition can jump in. But Early Access is a chance for keen fans to flex their muscles (and wallet) by purchasing the Deadman and The Bloodline Editions. </p>



<p>Doing so entitles you to a lot more content, including special <strong>Early Access or WWE 2K25</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-platforms">WWE 2K25 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Steam AKA PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox X|S are the supported platforms available for WWE 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>2K has a habit of launching new titles on as many platforms as possible. While it probably means more work for the developer and gives it a harder time when it comes to optimization and balancing out what works and what doesn’t on old-gen, it’s an inclusive way to bring in as many new fans as possible.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, like another common trend in 2025, the <strong>Nintendo Switch misses out</strong>. The PS4 and Xbox One editions aren’t as equipped as the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC releases, but they can still handle a solid version of WWE 2K25. The Switch can’t though. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen if the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> can handle WWE 2K25 or future releases.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-editions-amp-price">WWE 2K25 Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>WWE 2K25 has a Standard Edition, Deadman Edition, and The Bloodline Edition to purchase. In order, you are looking at $69.99 or £64.99, $99.99 or £89.99, and $129.99 or £119.99.</strong></p>



<p>These are the RRP figures for each edition of WWE 2K25. If you’re going physical, you might be able to get the wrestling title cheaper elsewhere. Also, there is no super-duper Collector’s Edition or anything like that here.</p>



<p>Check out every edition and its price right here.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">WWE 2K25 Edition</th><th data-align="center">WWE 2K25 Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$69.99 or £64.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deadman Edition</td><td data-align="center">$99.99 or £89.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Bloodline Edition</td><td data-align="center">$129.99 or £119.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
