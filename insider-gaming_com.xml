<p>Activision has announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded will begin on Thursday, January 8. The mid-season update comes just over a month after Season 1 began on December 4.</p>



<p>With the start of Season 1 Reloaded, players will get new operators, modes, maps, and more. To celebrate the launch of the first Reloaded of the year, Activision has released a look at the multiplayer maps that will be available for all players.</p>







<p>In total, there are three maps coming—one brand new, one remastered, and one returning. </p>



<p>Starting with the brand-new map, Yakei is a small 6v6/2v2 map that sits “High above the neon-soaked streets, the rooftops of a dense Japanese city become the stage for betrayal.” Players will have to “navigate a labyrinth of ducts, vents, and industrial structures under an eerie night glow, where vertical combat and relentless pursuit turn every ledge into a fight for survival.”</p>



<p>The remastered map is Meltdown. Originally from Black Ops 2, Meltdown is a medium-sized 6v6 map that has a “classic three-lane design” through a nuclear power plant. </p>



<p>Lastly, Fringe is a returning 6v6 map from Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>What do you think of the maps coming in Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded? Leave your thoughts in the comments below, and stay tuned for full update details when they are announced closer to launch.</p>

<p>Dead by Daylight has announced its second collaboration with Stranger Things, with Chapter 2 arriving on January 27, 2026. </p>



<p>Behaviour Interactive’s popular co-op survival horror title, Dead by Daylight, is known to introduce collaborations with other franchises frequently. <span>Last year, we saw collabs with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-the-walking-dead-crossover-confirmed-reveal-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Walking Dead</a> and Dead by Daylight&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-announces-dead-by-daylight-collaboration/" target="_blank">enter</a> th</span>e world of Assassin’s Creed. Now, they have introduced a second collab with Stranger Things as the Netflix series comes to a close. </p>



<h2 id="h-dead-by-daylight-x-stranger-things-introduces-vecna-eleven-and-dustin">Dead by Daylight x Stranger Things Introduces Vecna, Eleven, and Dustin</h2>



<p>The new Stranger Things collab introduces the series’ most popular villain, Vecna (The First), as a New Killer. Vecna has two special abilities: Vine Attack, which creates a small area of effect on the ground, and The Upside Down &amp; Undergate, which allows the Killer to enter the Upside Down and navigate the map quickly and then return to the map with an Undergate attack. The character also comes with three new Killer Perks: Turn Back the Clock, Secret Project, and Hex: Hive Mind. </p>



<p>Then we have the two new Survivors, Eleven and Dustin. Dustin comes with three new perks: Bada Bada Boom, which allows him to trap a window for 40/50/60 seconds, Change of Plans, which enables him to transform a toolbox into a Med-kit, and Teamwork: Full Circuit, which allows him to repair faster and increase the size of the Good Skill Check zone. </p>



<p>Eleven also comes with three new perks in the Dead by Daylight x Stranger Things collab. The first is Extrasensory Perception, which enables Eleven to see auras in an expanding radius and use Elusive and Obvious. Second is We See You, which provides the character with one token when the Killer reveals their aura. Last is Teamwork: Soft-Spoken, which also helps repair faster and reduces generator repair noise.</p>



<p>Lastly, a new feature called Visual Terror Radius has been added, which animates the heart to match 3D heart behaviour and has its own Lullaby version. There are a lot more new additions which you can check out below: </p>
