<p>Mythical Island is the first proper Pokémon TCG Pocket mini-set since the title’s launch. It brings with it the second-ever booster pack for players to pull new cards, and we know its release date, as well as a bunch of cards revealed for the set.</p>



<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next expansion leaks</a> continue to be true. We heard weeks ago a mini-set was scheduled for the third week in December, and now we know what it is. Pokémon TCG Pocket Mythical Island is a fully-fledged mini-set not quite on the scale of Genetic Apex, but it’s easily the most significant collection of cards—outside of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-promo-a-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promo A</a> series.</p>



<p>The Mythical Island debut trailer gave us a huge glimpse into the set and what to expect.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Mythical Island set launches on Dec. 17.</strong></p>



<p>No official release time was given in the debut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUYHC2ReohA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island trailer</a>. So, expect a midnight rollout for the set in your region. Once it’s live, select the new booster pack, start ripping them open, and get building the newest set in Pocket.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-open-mythical-island-packs-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island">How to Open Mythical Island Packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island</h2>



<p>We don’t know for sure, but I imagine once Mythical Island is live, the <strong>advertised packs on the home page are going to change to reflect the new set</strong>. Meaning, you can press on any of the advertised Mythical Island packs, and it takes you straight to them.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if it still shows Genetic Apex packs on the home screen once the new set launches, try this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the home screen.</li>



<li>Press on any of the Genetic Apex packs to take you to the pack screen.</li>



<li>Choose “Select other booster packs” in the bottom-right corner to presumably choose Mythical Island.</li>



<li>Now, open Mythical Island packs!</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s hard to know fully what Pokémon TCG Pocket looks like when Mythical Island launches, so we’ll update this once we have a clearer indication.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-cards-in-mythical-island-set-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How Many Cards in Mythical Island Set in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>NetEase hasn’t divulged how many cards are coming in Mythical Island, but thanks to the debut trailer, we’ve identified at least <strong>15 new cards coming in the set</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s every card we think we’ve spotted in Mythical Island so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Aerodactyl ex</li>



<li>Blue (Supporter Card)</li>



<li>Dedenne (Full Art)</li>



<li>Dhelmise</li>



<li>Exeggcute</li>



<li>Larvesta</li>



<li>Leaf (Supporter Card)</li>



<li>Magmar</li>



<li>Marshadow (Full Art)</li>



<li>Mew ex</li>



<li>Morelull</li>



<li>Pikachu</li>



<li>Snivy</li>



<li>Tauros</li>



<li>Vaporean (Full Art)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-rarest-cards-in-mythical-island-set-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Rarest Cards in Mythical Island Set in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>So far, <strong>Dedenne, Marshadow, and Vaporean Full Art</strong> cards, along with <strong>Mew ex</strong> and <strong>Aerodactyl ex</strong>, are the rarest cards we’ve seen in the Mythical Island set.</p>



<p>More could still be announced, and the full set is likely keeping some secrets under its belt. We can all find out together once Mythical Island is live!</p>
