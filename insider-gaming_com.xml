<p>FromSoftware games are confusing at the best and easiest of times. Elden Ring’s huge popularity and mainstream breakthrough have meant that more eyes are on the company’s ambiguous storytelling than ever. If you’ve ever wanted to understand the nitty-gritty of Elden Ring, YouTuber VaatiVidya has explained all.</p>



<p>You might not have heard the name VaatiVidya, but if you’ve any interest in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-expansion-dlc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a>, you need to. The YouTuber has racked up over 3 million subscribers on YouTube and has become popular for their Elden Ring lore explainer videos. Well, that visual and audio content is now coming to the written medium in the form of a new (and somewhat pricey) book.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtube.com/post/Ugkxxl2QfRJDpRsk_HP0kzlQBg9jYy1PQU6D?si=9X2K9FGpqhQWFArG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VaatiVidya</a> used their YouTube channel to deliver a proud statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“So…I’m writing a book! An interpretation of Elden Ring’s lore. It’s my YouTube channel in physical form, and it’s called “Lore Bound”. Preorders are available at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=backstage_event&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTBNU0lNQkVOYmVHUGVRYTMxY1N6dmw4dWtLQXxBQ3Jtc0trc2wwX2FOUGtXTEwwblRKQS1sQXlXbmlHNDBnSXc1bHFfTy1GZU5HcGcyendQdG1MbHl0YjZISGo3dElHTzZBU3FkQjRIeEZMMnlxNDZWLXV3N0VNYkVpLXkxZGpKRDhLeHRwaFY3SmFTb2dhUEpSbw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tuneandfairweather.com%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://www.tuneandfairweather.com</a> This book will bind together everything I’ve learned from Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree, and Nightreign into one single volume. My old video scripts will be updated, new illustrations will be commissioned, and every effort will be made to ensure each page is clear and engaging.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From characters to areas of the land, the book will be an all-encompassing encyclopedia of Elden Ring lore, knowledge, and explanations.</p>



<p>Prices start at $42 for the softcover edition, reach $95 for the deluxe edition, and ask as much as $144 for the full bundle. If you have doubts about the content or the nature of the book, the ‘Lore Bound: Elden Ring Explained (free digital sampler)’ might pique your interest as it gives you a digital copy of one whole chapter—free of charge.</p>



<p>If you’re an Elden Ring fan, it might be worth purchasing. You must wait until at least Q3 2026 for the book, but it should be one of the most in-depth Elden Ring books and lore explainers to date.</p>



<p>Will you buy it? Is it the perfect gift for all ER fans?

<p>Sucker Punch has given you all the time to breathe. By now, you’ve probably finished Ghost of Yotei and need a fresh challenge, which is where New Game Plus comes in handy.</p>



<p>New Game Plus is a great way to extend the shelf life of any game. Moreover, it offers new challenges and usually adds extra options and features into the mix for good measure. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a>‘s sun isn’t setting anytime soon, and the November inclusion of New Game Plus will be a game-changer.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yotei is getting New-Game-Plus capabilities from November 24, and this isn’t all.</p>



<p>An official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/new-game-plus-comes-to-ghost-of-yotei-november-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Blog</a> revealed more bits, from New Game Plus to new gear and extra PlayStation Trophies. The original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-trophy-and-achievement-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei trophy list</a> was generous, but now you have an additional two trophies to fight for.</p>



<p>On top of this, New Game Plus behaves as it does in every game: Once you’ve finished the story, you can begin the adventure again from scratch, but your progress rolls over, and there’s a new, harder difficulty setting for the sadistic samurai in all of you.</p>







<p>Here are some other features that will feature in the New Game Plus update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New currency: Ghost Flowers (Used on a new vendor packing many cosmetics).</li>



<li>A new tier of upgrades for armor sets and weapons.</li>



<li>You can replay content from the main game.</li>



<li>New accessibility features, such as button remapping and fresh Photo Mode tweaks.</li>
</ul>
