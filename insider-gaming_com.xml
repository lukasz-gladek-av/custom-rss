<p>2K has shaken things up at the top of one of its developers. A new report has surfaced claiming that 2K Games has fired 31st Union president Michael Condrey after the poor response to Project Ethos.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, 2K made the move after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-games-project-ethos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s reveal</a> left players and critics, alike, underwhelmed. One preview from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-ethos-first-hands-on-impressions-of-2ks-new-roguelike-hero-shooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> last year stated, “It seems to fall short of delivering anything that’s truly genre-defying in either the roguelike or extraction shooter departments.”</p>



<p>In a statement to Kotaku, 2K says that Condrey is “transitioning” from the project and that the company is still “committed” to the game.</p>



<p>“We are grateful to Michael Condrey for the dedication, passion and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union,” a 2K spokesperson told the outlet. “Michael will be transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of Project ETHOS. We remain very committed to the forward path for Project ETHOS and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio.”</p>

<p>Condrey joined 31st Union in 2019 after leaving Sledgehammer Games, a studio he helped found in 2009. He has yet to make any statement on the change, or what’s next for his career. </p>



<p>Take-Two Interactive is scheduled to report its Q3 FY2025 earnings on Thursday, February 6 at 430pm ET.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is confirmed as the largest game in the franchise’s history, at a whopping 123.2 GB in size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows game size was revealed through its listing on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-shadows/id6497794841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mac App Store</a>. The title can be pre-ordered now for $69.99. Players will need macOS 14.0 or later and a Mac with an Apple M1 chip or later to play the game. The 123.2 GB file size is the largest in the franchise’s history, more than double that of recent instalments like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla or Odyssey, which needed around 50 GB and 45 GB only, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With such a massive file size for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players will expect Ubisoft to go all out on the game. The visual fidelity and attention to detail should be second to no past Assassin’s Creed title if the game size exceeds the previous instalments by that much. If you are wondering about Assassin’s Creed Shadows PC system requirements, check out the details <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Players should note that SSD storage with 123.2 GB of free space is mandatory for any preset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is an upcoming historical, open-world action-adventure by Ubisoft set in Feudal Japan. Players will experience this adventure through the eyes of 2 characters: Naoe, a shinobi Assassin and Yasuke, a legendary samurai. Both characters feature distinct playstyles. Naoe is more stealthy and agile, whereas Yasuke is the tank responsible for dealing the heavy blows. If you are interested in the game, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Mac on March 20, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ art book recently leaked online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-artwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on an 18+ website</a>, showcasing new art for the game. Also, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shaodws-censored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graphic content will be censored in Japan</a>. What are your thoughts on Assassin’s Creed Shadows Game size?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Iron Galaxy Studios—known for Rumbleverse and bringing The Last of Us to PC—has let go of 66 employees in what the company has called a “last resort”.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7292952527195516929/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, the studio says that it has been “making sacrifices” in order to keep its team together. Unfortunately, those efforts haven’t been able to keep things sustainable leading to the moves being made.</p>



<p>“It has been our hope that we could emerge from this long winter alongside all the teammates who have come to work with us over the years,” they said. “Today, we’re making the unfortunate announcement that we have run out of room to maneuver amidst this slow recovery.</p>



<p>“Today, Iron Galaxy is parting ways with some of our developers and support staff. In total, we have reduced our employee base by 66 people. This was a means of last resort for us. It’s a measure we do not take lightly to enable our long-term survival.”</p>



<p>The latest employment numbers put Iron Galaxy Studios at <a href="https://www.builtinchicago.org/company/iron-galaxy-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">270 employees</a>. The 66 employees account for nearly 25% of the companies workforce. </p>



<p>The studio says it’s still “committed to serving” its partners in game development. They are also going to look for “new ways to support” the industry.</p>



<p>“At this moment, our focus is on our teammates who have begun a journey toward their next role,” they added. “We thank them for working with us. We’ll be doing everything we can to support them in the search for the next phase of their careers.:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-might-provide-%E2%80%98real-energy%E2%80%99-for-fc-and-madden-says-ea.1101177/</guid>

<p>EA recently stated that franchises like Madden and FC might find ‘real energy’ on a platform like Nintendo Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-madden-and-fc-might-find-real-energy-on-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, EA CEO Andrew Wilson was asked whether Nintendo Switch 2 is a platform they are focusing on during a recent earnings call. Wilson replied that a new console arriving in the marketplace is a “benefit” for them as it allows them to “acquire new players.” Wilson added that EA’s franchises have “typically” performed well on Nintendo’s platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EA CEO then discussed some of their most popular franchises, EA FC and Madden, stating that products like those could “find real energy” on the Nintendo Switch 2, “as they have done in the past.” Wilson also provided an example with The Sims and My Sims cozy bundle, explaining how it performed better than expectations, with “50% of all players” new to EA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EA revealed “nothing in our models at this juncture.” However, they expect that “anytime a great new console” hits the market, it will allow them to reach new players and communities, so they need an IP to benefit from that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EA Sports FC 24 is already available for purchase on the Nintendo Switch, and the next instalments of the franchise should arrive on the Switch 2. The fascinating addition would be Madden, as no games from that franchise have made it to Nintendo’s prized console. Also, it will be interesting to see if the platform can breathe new life into these franchises, as EA FC is struggling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, EA is working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-working-major-apex-legends-update-after-battlefield/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">significant Apex Legends update</a> that will arrive after the upcoming Battlefield, which is scheduled to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch before April 2026</a>. What are your thoughts on EA stating that Madden and FC might find ‘real energy’ on the Switch 2?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
