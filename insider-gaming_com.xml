<p>Console gaming revenue fell 3.9% year-over-year (YoY) thanks to a 14% YoY drop by premium paid games. This according to the 2025 PC and Console Gaming Report from Newzoo.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report</a>, which takes gaming data from around the world, Premium Games accounted for $19.9 billion in console gaming revenue in 2024. That was still good for 46% of the $42.8 billion in total revenue for year. However, it was the only business model to see a decrease on the platform.</p>



<p>Microtransactions made up 32% of console gaming revenue, pulling in $13.9 billion for the year. That was a 4.5% increase over 2023’s amount. Following behind were subscriptions, which grew 14.1% YoY with $6.9 billion in revenue. Lastly, DLC made up 5% of the total revenue with $2.2 billion. That 5% is still a 2.5% increase compared to 2023.</p>



<p>As far as what led to the growth in revenue for microtransactions and DLC, the report points to six games. On the microtransaction side, Fortnite, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and NBA 2K25 helped push the total up 4.5%. For DLC, it was Elden Ring, Diablo 4, and Destiny 2 leading the way. </p>



<p>Console gaming revenue came in slightly higher than PC, which pulled in $37.3 billion in 2024. It also saw a different trend as PC gaming revenue saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/58-of-pc-gaming-revenue-came-from-microtransactions-in-2024/">58% attributed to microtransactions</a>. </p>



<p>Newzoo’s projections have console gaming revenue predicted to grow to $47.3 billion in 2025 and all the way to $52.4 billion by 2027.</p>

<p>The Last of Us Complete Edition is now available on PlayStation 5 for $99.99. It was published today, following announcements from Naughty Dog that revealed a physical edition will be launching in July.</p>



<p>This is yet another re-release of the franchise that spans just <strong>two games </strong>but has managed to cover more than a decade of entertainment. I’m a massive fan, and this will be an easy purchase. And as you read this, I’m arranging my pre-order for the physical collector’s edition.</p>

<h2 id="h-back-in-the-apocalypse">Back in the Apocalypse</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_complete_ps5_collectors_edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snapshot blog post</a>, Naughty Dog wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Available today on the PlayStation 5 console, The Last of Us Complete allows players to experience both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II Remastered in one package. </p>



<p>The Last of Us Complete makes it easier than ever to experience the full story on PS5, whether you’ve played both entries, just one, or have yet to immerse yourself in the world of Joel, Ellie, Abby, and all of our characters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans with a little more dough in their pockets (and patience) can pre-order The Last of Us Complete Collector’s Edition for $109.99, exclusively from PlayStation. It’s an attractive version of the game that comes with an exclusive steelbook, comics, and lithographic art prints. </p>



<p>You’ll also get a ‘thank you letter’ penned by Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last of Us.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, the Collector’s Edition comes with physical discs <strong>only,</strong> and there’s no indication that it comes with digital ownership codes, which means if you’ve got a Digital Edition console, you’re buying this for the collectables, and those alone aren’t worth $109.99. </p>

<p>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era is set to release in early access Summer 2025. The release window for the game was confirmed during Thursday’s Triple-i Initiative showcase.</p>



<p>Alongside the release window announcement, developer Unfrozen released a new cinematic story trailer to set the stage for what’s to come for players.</p>



<p>“Tensions rise yet again,” the description reads. “The would-be protectors of Jadame clash their arms against one another, engulfing the continent in chaos and conflict. Reason is forsaken in the name of conquest and bloodbath. In the shadows, a malevolent force emerges, seeking to use this opportunity to claim dominion in the name of their master.”</p>



<p>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is the first new game in the franchise since 2015’s Might &amp; Magic Heroes 7. While it’s once again being published by Ubisoft, it’s the first in the series to be developed by Unfrozen. The game, though the eighth mainline title in the series, is a prequal that’s set before the events of the 1995’s original Heroes of Might and Magic.</p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-announced-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first revealed</a> at Gamescom 2024 and will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are two new adventures to sink your teeth into, each having 6 chapters to explore. For the base game, players can check out “To End an Ice Age”, and for the Tides of the Foscari DLC, they can play “Tides of the Foscari”.</p>
