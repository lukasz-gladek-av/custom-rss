<p>The official Forza Horizon 6 reveal was incredible. It showcased everything Playground Games has been working on for the Japanese-inspired sequel, and if you’re already revving up your car in excitement, it’s time to fill you in on Forza Horizon 6’s Xbox Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Is it safe to say that Forza Horizon 6 is the biggest racing game of 2026? It will take a lot to top it, and with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-forza-horizon-6-gameplay-footage-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay footage revealed</a> so far, it’s hard to argue. Playing it is a must, and with the confusion surrounding Xbox Game Pass in recent times, it’s brought FH6 into the spotlight.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-forza-horizon-6-releasing-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Forza Horizon 6 Releasing On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>

<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 will officially launch as a day-one Xbox Game Pass offering, meaning you’ll get it for free if you have the correct subscription.</strong></p>



<p>The whole Game Pass price increase controversy in 2025 raised big questions about future launches. These doubts have been dispelled about Forza Horizon 6, though, and you only have to look to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox</a> itself for the answer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Arriving for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, Steam, and day one with Game Pass Ultimate. Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Game Pass is more expensive now, but you’ll still be able to have access to certain full-price AAA games. There are still good times and games on the horizon (pun intended).</p>







<h2 id="h-which-version-of-xbox-game-pass-is-needed-to-play-forza-horizon-6">Which Version Of Xbox Game Pass Is Needed To Play Forza Horizon 6?</h2>



<p><strong>You need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to play Forza Horizon 6 for free.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not free, technically, but you understand the concept. It’s better than paying $60, $70, or $80. This does mean you need the most expensive version of the Game Pass model, and here’s how to get it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724#join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox website</a>.</li>



<li>Press to Join Game Pass.</li>



<li>An option will appear with three tiers.</li>



<li>You need to click <strong>Select </strong>under the <strong>Ultimate </strong>tier.</li>



<li>Complete your subscription.</li>



<li>Once Forza Horizon 6 debuts, you can download it and play it as part of XGP Ultimate.</li>
</ol>



<p>Knowing that Forza Horizon 6 is coming to Game Pass should make a lot of people happy. If you are a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, look forward to entering the new world of Horizon. Also, head to the Insider Gaming Discord Server and leave a message to say if FH6 is enough to get you to sign up with Game Pass. Conversely, pop a message down to say why it <em>isn’t </em>enough, if it’s the case.</p>

<p>A new Nintendo Direct for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has been announced for next week.</p>



<p>First revealed through the <a href="https://www.nintendo.today/en-US/contents/04020be1-e2e8-49eb-8282-a99fb58f27c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Today</a> app, this upcoming direct will take place at 9am ET/6am PT on Sunday, January 25.</p>







<p>It’s the second-straight Nintendo Direct event to specifically be about the movie. The last one took place on November 12, 2025, and gave fans a first look at the new trailer along with introducing Bowser Jr. and Rosalina to the film. </p>



<p>The next Direct is likely to give a new trailer, the reveal of new characters, and, possibly, the stars who voice them. There are rumors and leaks suggesting Yoshi will also be in the movie, but the green dinosaur has yet to be seen on camera.</p>



<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is the sequel to 2023’s Super Mario Bros. Movie. It’s currently scheduled to release in theaters on April 3, 2026. That’s almost three years to the day of the original movie’s release.</p>
