<p>Another virtual reality (VR) studio has been bitten by the layoff bug. Fast Travel Games, the developers behind titles such as  Cities: VR and Into The Radius, announced on Tuesday that it is laying off 30 people because of low game sales.</p>



<p>The announcement was made via a statement on social media.</p>



<p>“Due to lower sales than expected from our six game launches in 2024, in combination with a more uncertain year ahead for VR Games as a whole, we’ve taken the difficult decision to make 30 employees redundant at FTG,” Fast Travel Games’ statement reads. “These changes will affect mainly our Publishing, Marketing, and Admin departments, although the Studio will also be impacted as we consolidate down to one development team.”</p>



<p>They continued: “This is an exceptionally difficult decision, but we believe it’s necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company.</p>



<p>“Our focus now is on supporting all Fast Travellers through this challenging time. We’re grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to continue launching incredible games for our players.”</p>



<p>With the layoffs at Fast Travel Games, January has seen 21 studios either hold layoffs or shut down. The <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">total estimated jobs lost</a> as of writing sits around 700. The only bright spot at the moment is that, at this time last year, the games industry had already seen nearly 6,000 lose their jobs.</p>

<p>On the surface, Medieval Dynasty looks like the type of pump-and-dump indie game that studios toss out to earn a quick buck before moving on to the next project. But that’s utterly incorrect in this case, as developer Render Cube continues to impress with content update after update. The most recent release, Medieval Dynasty update 2.3, allows us to paint buildings, construct house presets, stack items, and so much more!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-medieval-dynasty-update-2-3">What’s New in Medieval Dynasty Update 2.3?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Right, so the house presets, economy tab, and item stacking are excellent additions that will make life in Medieval Dynasty ten times easier. But let’s be honest, we’re all here for the ability to paint our structures. We can have a brightly-colored town, ready to catch a trader’s eye or perhaps a wolf. It’s likely the latter.</p>

<p>Nintendo remains one of the largest and most popular gaming companies in the world. Known for its Mario, Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon franchises, Nintendo has become a household name over the last 40+ years. That’s why Nintendo’s quarterly earnings reports are closely watched by analysts, investors, and consumers alike.</p>



<p>It’s important to know when the next earnings report is, what time it starts, and how you can follow it live. These quarterly updates provide insights into Nintendo’s financial health, performance from its hardware and games, and general outlooks for the months ahead.</p>



<p>What is Nintendo’s current focus on the heels of recent game releases and the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement? Are there any concerns to address? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-nintendo-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next Nintendo Earnings Report Date?</h2>

<p>In its upcoming earnings call, Nintendo is likely to mention the Nintendo Switch 2, which was revealed in January.

<h2 id="h-what-are-earnings-calls">What Are Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often put out a press release and presentation with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>
