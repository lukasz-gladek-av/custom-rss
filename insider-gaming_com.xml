<p>The setting and time period of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series may have been revealed, according to a new report. Even more so, more information regarding the show’s development has emerged online.</p>



<p>Since 2007, the Assassin’s Creed series of games has been going rather strong, spanning eras of history with action-packed gameplay and gripping story. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ordered-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Netflix announced that it’s working with Ubisoft to develop a live-action Assassin’s Creed series. Multiple ones are apparently in the works, as revealed in the blog from July, but the biggest one just cast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actor Toby Wallace</a> as co-lead. Now, more information on <strong>the show’s setting has reportedly been revealed</strong>, and <strong>it’s one that fans have been asking for for a long time</strong>.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The report comes from <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-set-to-explore-ancient-rome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive from Nexus Point News</a>, which has previously leaked multiple game adaptations like God of War and Elden Ring. In the article, it mentions that sources have said what Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed’s setting will be: <strong>Ancient Rome</strong>. Specifically, <strong>the show is reportedly taking place between 54-68 AD</strong> during Emperor Nero’s reign. Both Nero and his mentor, Seneca, will be featured in the series. Filming is taking place in Italy, so it does line up there, if true. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the report says that Toby Wallace will be part of<strong> an ensemble cast</strong>, meaning there will be <strong>multiple leads</strong>. It’s important to note that <strong>Ubisoft and Netflix have not confirmed this news</strong>, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. Still, Ancient Rome has been asked for by fans for a long time. However, if true, it would mean players would likely not get to play in that time period like they’d hoped to. This would also mean that the show would feature an original story, which is a bit of a risky move. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see how the show shapes up.</p>







<p>What do you think of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed setting? Is Ancient Rome a good fit? If true, are you disappointed to not see it in the games? Is doing an original story worth it?

            <title><![CDATA[New Dead Rising Game Possibly in Development]]></title>

<p>A new entry in the <strong>Dead Rising</strong> series is <strong>potentially in development</strong>. Furthermore, a report details much of the game’s story and Hollywood setting.</p>



<p>The zombie genre has become quite dramatic over the years, with Telltale’s The Walking Dead and The Last of Us. However, one franchise saw the fun in the bloody mayhem of it all: Capcom’s Dead Rising. Released in 2006, the series has multiple spinoffs and sequels, upping the carnage with weapon building and bigger open worlds. A remake/remaster of the first game, titled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-guides-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, launched last year to much acclaim. Now, almost a decade since the last main entry, Dead Rising 4, it seems fans should gear up for a trip back to the zombie apocalypse with some familiar faces. </p>







<h2 id="h-hollywood-set-dead-rising-sequel-in-the-works-claims-report">Hollywood-Set Dead Rising Sequel in the Works, Claims Report</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, the outlet mentioned that a source shared information that <strong>Capcom is actively working on a new Dead Rising</strong>. The title, which has <strong>reportedly been in the works since 2023</strong>, would <strong>reunite players</strong> with <strong>Frank West </strong>and company in a new setting: <strong>Hollywood</strong>. The game’s setting would actually be <strong>in a large Hollywood set</strong> where the crazed director, the villain, traps everyone in to create the perfect movie. </p>



<p>In terms of the timeline, the report mentions it <strong>being a direct sequel to Dead Rising</strong>. If true, it would be set before Dead Rising 4. Many elements from the original title, like <strong>the camera and time limit</strong>, would <strong>make a return</strong>. The <strong>survivor system</strong>, used in most franchise games, would also be present, even taking a <strong>bigger role in the narrative</strong>. Unfortunately, the report does not provide any information on release or actual gameplay.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>no confirmation from Capcom regarding a new Dead Rising has been made</strong>, so <strong>take the news with a big grain of salt</strong>. Given how long it’s been since a fully new entry, it does feel like the perfect time to bring it back. Seeing as Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster did quite well, perhaps it served as a segue to the new title. Either way, it’ll be exciting to see whether we’ll see the wartime journalist anytime soon.</p>







<p>What do you think of a possible new Dead Rising game? Excited to see Frank West? How about the Hollywood setting? Which is your favorite game in the series?
