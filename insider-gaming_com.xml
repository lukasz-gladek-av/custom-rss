<p><strong>The Helldivers 2 x Halo ODST Warbond releases on August 26, with an official start time of 5am PT.</strong></p>



<p>The start time coincides with the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox, a seismic moment as it marks the first time a Sony title has made the jump to the rival platform. Naturally, that big move has been celebrated in style with the special Halo ODST Warbond, revealed by the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-x-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-arrives-august-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>.</p>



<p>For those in America, the Warbond will be available early in the morning, while those elsewhere in the world will have to wait until later in the day to jump in.</p>



<p>We’ve created the table below for easier viewing, which shows start times for the Legendary Warbond in Helldivers 2 in various time zones.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-division-2-was-%E2%80%98saved%E2%80%99-by-a-team-of-five-developers-%E2%80%98we-weren%E2%80%99t-supposed-to-exist%E2%80%99.1280397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft recently appeared at Gamescom to present the future of The Division 2, including the unveiling of ‘a big project’ that turned out to be The Division 2: Survivors. As the game approaches its tenth anniversary, more content has been lined up, but for a while, things looked a little sketchy for Ubisoft’s once-iconic third-person shooter MMO.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Palle Hoffstein, art producer at Massive Entertainment, revealed that a micro-sized team stumped up the courage to ‘resurrect’ The Division 2 when it was in a slump and content delivery had effectively ended, and the turnaround was something incredible.</p>



<h2 id="h-something-bigger-and-lasting">‘Something Bigger and Lasting’</h2>



<p>Ubisoft posted a timeline to social media on August 22, unveiling the immediate and long-term future of The Division franchise, including the string of expansions coming to The Division 2. The team also discussed The Division: Resurgence, an all-new mobile experience set at the heart of The Division’s <em>borderline </em>post-apocalyptic universe.</p>



<p>In a line of comments responding to that post, art producer <a href="https://x.com/Palle_Hoffstein/status/1959275482462953660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Palle Hoffstein revealed</a> how The Division 2 almost slipped out of reach, but a dedicated team of just <strong>five developers </strong>clawed it back from the zero-content abyss:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We had 5 people to restart Division 2. Five! What were we thinking? Ah that was fun.</em></p>



<p>When a few of us made a small team to resurrect TD2 I had zero interest in adding a year or two, just to sunset the game again. The goal, what we believed we could do, was to <strong>build something bigger and lasting</strong>. This is fun to see but there’s still so much more we want to do.</p>



<p>I figured the biggest challenge would be staffing and yeah. Studios plan staffing years in advance to keep everyone allocated and busy. We created a problem of being a team that needed positions filled that weren’t on anyone’s spreadsheet. <strong>We weren’t supposed to exist.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p><em><span>(</span>Thanks to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/ubisoft-allocated-5-devs-restart-the-division-2-build-something-bigger-lasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The Division debuted in 2016 and turned heads thanks to a solid marketing campaign and a great launch that plunged players into a desperate fight to reclaim New York from looters, shooters, and organized criminals. The Division 2 was released in 2019 and has become a staple of Ubisoft’s live-service lineup, even if things went wavy for a while.</p>



<p>Palle later revealed that when a 2024 crossover event that introduced Resident Evil to The Division aired, he might have been ‘the last person’ on the D2 team:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I might have been the last person actually on the D2 team, to launch the Resident Evil stuff. We were done. Then a few weeks later I was asked if I could do another apparel event for D2. Despite having no artists I said, “sure.” I assumed I could figure something out lol.</p>

<p>Ahead of Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2025 in September, PlayStation has announced its lineup for the expo. The convention, held yearly, has already shown promise this year with contributors like Capcom and Koei Tecmo showing up with huge games. Now, PlayStation has joined in on the fun with two of its biggest upcoming titles.</p>



<p>This is the company’s second year in a row showing up to TGS after being absent from 2020-2023.  Last year, the biggest games were Monster Hunter Wilds and the GOTY winner Astro Bot. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach also held a showcase, where a new trailer was unveiled. While no showcases are revealed just yet, the two titles on display are sure to make fans happy.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As of right now, only two brand-new titles will be available for attendees to play on the show floor. Those titles, according to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/sony-interactive-entertainment-announces-preliminary-tgs-2025-lineup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a>, are Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yotei and ARC System Works’ Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls. More games will be announced closer to the expo’s start on September 25th, 2025. </p>



<p>This marks the first public demo of Ghost of Yotei, which launches a week after TGS on October 2nd. Meanwhile, many fans at EVO got their hands on Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls, with many more when the closed beta comes on September 6th. Still, both games are some of the studio’s and are sure to make a splash with attendees.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/action_tps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam TPS Fest</a>, the multiplayer 5v5 shooter Last Flag released a surprise demo today. The fest, which celebrates Third-Person games with sales and demos, started today. While many demos were already available, like Star Wars Outlaws, Last Flag is one title nobody expected to see. </p>



<p>Last Flag, scheduled for 2026 for Steam (with console versions in the works), is a 5v5 multiplayer shooter by Night Street Games based on the infamous Capture the Flag mode. With a unique 70s art style and fun gameplay, it definitely stands out from other titles like Call of Duty and Battlefield. Therefore, the surprise release of a limited-time demo is sure to get some attention, especially after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-record-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s success</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-last-flag-s-free-demo-lasts-from-august-25th-to-september-1st">Last Flag’s Free Demo Lasts from August 25th to September 1st</h2>







<p>As per a press release, a free demo for Last Flag is available now on Steam for players to try. The demo will only be up for a week, ending September 1st. To get the demo, head over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721340/Last_Flag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Steam page</a> and download the demo. </p>



<p>With multiple characters to choose from, with a wide range of abilities, you’ll work together with your team to hide the flag and capture it. In addition, music for the game has been worked on by Dan Reynolds (Imagine Dragons), Grammy-nominated producer/writer JT Daly (Benson Boone), and Dave Lowmiller (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare). It seems like the perfect mix for players to create an unforgettable experience on and off the battleground.</p>



<p>Do you plan on playing Last Flag this week? If you have, how are you liking it? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>
