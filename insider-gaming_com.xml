<p>Monster Hunter Wilds sold 8 million units in the first 3 days of release, becoming the fastest-selling game in Capcom’s history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was released on February 28, 2025, and the game has been breaking records since the first day. The game brought in over 1.3 million players on Steam alone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within the first 12 hours</a> and is still managing to bring in more than 1 million players within the past 24 hours (at the time of writing). Their latest record, with 8 million sales in 3 days, has made Monster Hunter Wilds the fastest-selling game in the series and Capcom’s history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the announcement <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a>, the developers discussed what it took to sell over 8 million copies in such a short span of time. With the new instalment in the series, the developers wanted to take Monster Hunter to a broader audience. So, they conducted several global initiatives, such as appearing at global game showcases, hosting online beta tests, and hosting individual showcases to spread the word.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from the initiatives, the developers have also worked on several core aspects of the game that have helped Monster Hunter Wilds reach this significant sales milestone. Through the Forbidden Lands, players experience a new, dynamically changing open world where they can be in the harshest environment at one moment and then suddenly find themselves in a “rich natural environment teeming with life”. The game is also the first in the series to feature cross-play co-op, which helps more players across platforms enjoy the game together.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/runescape%E2%80%99s-developer-has-a-new-ceo-in-jon-bellamy.1124637/</guid>

<p>Jagex has announced a change-up at the highest level, with CEO Phil Mansell stepping down and being replaced by Jon Bellamy. Phil has been in the role of Chief Executive Officer at Jagex since 2017 but has been with the company for more than a decade. Jon Bellamy noted that he is excited to communicate his ‘broader vision’ for RuneScape soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-handing-over-the-baton">Handing Over The Baton</h2>



<p>In a press release, Phil Mansell expressed his sentiments at stepping back from the role of CEO at Jagex:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After an incredible 14 years leading RuneScape and 8 years as Jagex’s CEO, I’m stepping back and handing over the baton to Jon Bellamy. </p>



<p>Working alongside such a talented and passionate team, we’ve significantly grown the Company and player community, cementing Jagex as an innovator in community-driven games and genuine leader in this industry. </p>



<p>As the Company embarks on its next chapter, I am delighted to be handing over to a leader who I know cares about our games and business as much as I do – and I look forward to supporting him as he builds upon the strong foundations we’ve created.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bellamy echoed those sentiments:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a great honour to assume the leadership of Jagex and to help steward a game franchise that means so much to so many millions, myself included. I am also excited to get to work with the outstanding team, whom I know well from my time on the Board, to ensure our games continue to be the best in the world. </p>



<p>I plan to spend some time now with the team, reviewing our ambitions for Jagex, and plan to communicate my broader vision to the RuneScape community in the near-term.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mansell was most recently in the press following an awful proposal made by Jagex to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-ceo-addresses-recent-runescape-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overhaul the paid membership model</a>. It rankled with the community and was taken with an awful reception, and Mansell branded the proposal ‘clumsy and inconsiderate’.</p>



<p>He said that they had failed to think the proposal through from the perspective of a player, and the plans were ultimately scrapped.</p>



<p>Last year, Jagex was in talks regarding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-billion-dollar-buyout/">a potential billion dollar buyout</a>, but that conversation eventually faded out of the press.</p>

<p>All eyes are locked on Assassin’s Creed Shadows and its forthcoming review embargo date. This is one of the most important Assassin’s Creed releases ever, and the critical reception could have a huge bearing on the game’s success.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> releases in the middle of a crowded March 2025. It needs to fight off the popularity of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a> and its new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> release, and combat the physical forces of 2K’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>. Ubisoft has enough without worrying about other new titles.</p>



<p>Shadows is reportedly not getting delayed again and will release in March. An abundance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-releases-statement-on-assassins-creed-shadows-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadows leaks</a> has already shown many people the game and what it has in store. But for everyone else, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo is crucial.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-assassin-s-creed-shadows-review-embargo-date">Do we Know The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Review Embargo Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The date is crawling up to us. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Review Embargo Date is reportedly set for March 18—two days before the game’s official release date.</strong></p>



<p>In an exclusive Insider Gaming report, we revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft is confident about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ March 20, 2025, release date</a>. Our sources have also indicated “<strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows reviews will be live on March 18, 2025.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s fairly standard for review embargos to go live between two and five days before launch. It’s more concerning when a review embargo date is the day of the game or after launch. This is usually an indicator the developer and/or publisher isn’t happy with the product and therefore leaves the embargo until after players have bought the game.</p>



<p>Ubisoft looks to be assured, and we should be getting <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> 48 hours before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-review-embargo">What is a Review Embargo?</h2>



<p><strong>A review embargo is the earliest point where a publication can release its final review.</strong></p>



<p>In this case, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo is set by Ubisoft. Reviews can’t be posted before this embargo, and any that are likely need to be taken down and can cause complications between parties.</p>



<p>Review embargos have become a focal point of game launches in modern times. Players are eager to see, hear, and read reviews before they invest in a game. With Ubisoft’s mixed history with game launches—particularly Assassin’s Creed (look at AC Unity)—the early reception to Shadows could be make or break.</p>



<hr>



<p>If our information turns out to be incorrect, we will be sure to update this article. For now, you can start counting down the days until the Assassin’s Creed Shadows review embargo lifts. What scores will the RPG get? What average score will be enough for you to commit to a purchase? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-split-fiction-solo-co-op-multiplayer-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Split Fiction is an intertwining narrative from the creative mind of Josef Fares. It requires you to guide two unique characters from start to finish, but we’re here to see if you can only play the game in co-op or if solo play is permitted.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a> is firmly behind us now. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios has a new game called Split Fiction</a>. We’ve been treated to periodic trailers and footage since its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal at The Game Awards 2024</a>. Anyone familiar with It Takes Two or A Way Out should instantly feel at home with Split Fiction.</p>



<p>It has tons of mini-games and tandem gameplay sections, and requires teamwork to succeed. Many co-op games allow you to play with an AI partner, so let’s see if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> is the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-split-fiction-be-played-solo">Can Split Fiction be Played Solo?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A co-op boom is happening. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><strong>Split Fiction cannot be played solo and is a co-op title requiring a human companion.</strong></strong></p>



<p>This is how Josef Fares wants his games to be experienced. It Takes Two was such an emotional gut punch as you felt every story twist alongside a real player. A Way Out was the same, and Split Fiction continues this thematic direction by requiring two real-life players—not AI.</p>



<p>If you don’t believe me, check out the official <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/ea-originals-discussion-en/announcement--faq-split-fiction%E2%84%A2---launching-march-6-2025---pre-order-now/5037251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction FAQ</a>. Under the “Is it possible to play with an AI?” question, the answer states: “<strong>No, this is a co-op-only game uniquely tailored for two friends to play together.</strong>“</p>



<h2 id="h-will-split-fiction-add-solo-play-to-split-fiction">Will Split Fiction Add Solo Play to Split Fiction?</h2>



<p><strong>I think the chances of Split Fiction adding a solo option through a patch are slim-to-none.</strong></p>



<p>Again, Hazelight Studios’ previous work—A Way Out and It Takes Two—didn’t add this option. Given the official stance on solo play, it feels unlikely to be added in Split Fiction either. If you’re a fan of Fares and Hazelight games and want a solo-driven journey, all is not lost.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/02/13/josef-fares-split-fiction-interview-we-will-not-co-op-22554563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Fares said: “We will not only do co-op, we will definitely do other stuff with a Haze-like twist. We want to do something different like a twist… like what we did with the co-op. But co-op is great and, I mean, you can tell great stories and there’s so much to be explored there.”</p>



<p>Who knows where the studio goes once Split Fiction is wrapped up and in the history books.</p>



<hr>



<p>It Takes Two was a bona fide Game of the Year winner. It’s going to take a lot for Split Fiction to replicate its success, but it’s not impossible. Are you picking up Split Fiction as quick as a flash?</p>
