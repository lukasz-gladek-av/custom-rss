<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight’s reveal at Gamescom 2025 has ignited a wealth of excitement for the upcoming title from TT Games, and we’ve gathered everything we know about the release date.</p>



<p>Revealed as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next LEGO title from TT Games</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight impressed us during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, although some eyebrows have been raised with marketing stating that there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only seven playable characters</a> in the game.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty to be revealed about LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, and, if you want to begin your countdown to release, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-a-release-date">Does LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have a Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fire up the Bat Signal. Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, a precise release date for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has not been shared by TT Games.</strong></p>



<p>After being revealed at Gamescom, it’s understandable that players are keen to know exactly when they will be able to get their hands on the title, but there’s going to be a bit of a wait before those details become available.</p>



<p>In fact, don’t expect a precise release date to be shared this year, given the release window that has been issued is pretty broad.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-window">What is The LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Release Window?</h2>



<p><strong>TT Games announced at Gamescom, following the reveal of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, that the release window for the title is 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike many other games, no specific month or season for <a href="https://warnerbrosgames.com/article/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>‘s launch has been shared, resulting in a pretty broad window, but there are some trends that could be followed.</p>



<p>For example, Grand Theft Auto 6 is looming large in 2026 with a release date in May, and most, if not all, developers will want to avoid going head-to-head against the titan, giving it is expected to be one of the biggest gaming launches of all time.</p>



<p>Although LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was released in April 2022, that was an outlier in TT Games’ history, as, traditionally, releases have come in May/June or September/October/November.</p>



<p>In 2018, LEGO: DC Super-Villains was released in October, while in 2017, LEGO: Marvel Superheroes 2 was released in November. Going back further, LEGO Dimensions was released in September 2015, and LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham was released in November 2014.</p>



<p>Though that doesn’t clear the release window up exactly, it does mean that TT Games’ previous schedule suggests we won’t see LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight in the first half of 2026.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-pre-order/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-you-pre-order-hollow-knight-silksong.1278006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong is rapidly approaching a conclusion after a release date for the title was finally announced after years of waiting.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4</a>, bringing an end to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">years of development</a>, and the desire to get hands-on with the game is understandable, with our verdict being that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong is worth the wait</a>.</p>



<p>Now, players around the world are preparing for the launch and want to know if pre-orders are available, which we’ve got all the details for here.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-available-to-pre-order">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Available to Pre-Order?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ready? Image via Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> <strong>is not currently available to pre-order or purchase on any storefront.</strong></p>



<p>With the long-awaited release date of the title on the horizon, the desire to secure a copy of Hollow Knight: Silksong is understandable. However, for the time being at least, you’ll need to be patient for a little while longer for pre-order details to emerge.</p>



<p>None of the platforms where Hollow Knight: Silksong is currently available has pre-orders listed. However, those with an Xbox Game Pass subscription can add the title to their ‘Play Later’ section, which should pre-download the full game before release.</p>



<p>That will likely change as the release date of September 4 edges closer, so keep an eye out for pre-order details to emerge.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-preload-hollow-knight-silksong">Can You Preload Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<p><strong>Preloading Hollow Knight: Silksong is not currently available on any platform, though this will likely change as the release date approaches.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, storefronts do not currently have Hollow Knight: Silksong listed and available to purchase, which means that preloading the title is also out of the question for the time being.</p>



<p>The closest option to preloading currently available is through the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9n116v0599hb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft store</a>, which has a ‘Get Game Pass’ button beneath the title alongside a note that confirms the title is “coming soon to Game Pass.” If you already have Game Pass, clicking this option will provide details of your subscription.</p>



<p>Preloading Hollow Knight: Silksong in full should be an available option provided before the launch period, and, with less than two weeks until the title releases at the time of writing, it shouldn’t be a long wait.</p>



<p>Will Hollow Knight: Silksong live up to the hype and be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Developers Explain Matchmaking System After Player Criticism]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism.1277979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals developers have lifted the lid on the matchmaking system used in the title following a wrath of criticism from players.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, NetEase confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals does not use the controversial EOMM</a> matchmaking system and promised to explain how matchmaking works in a future video.</p>



<p>That video has now been shared, detailing the process of matchmaking and explaining why larger party groups of four-to-six players have been banned in higher ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-matchmaking-explained">Marvel Rivals Matchmaking, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots of detail. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the video <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1958627668536311945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter), it was explained that several factors are taken into account when queuing for matches, including team composition and your competitive score—the latter calculated by Base Points and Performance Points.</p>



<p>Base Points depend on the outcome of the match, your current competitive score, and the average competitive score of the enemy team. Performance Points, meanwhile, reflect how well you perform in the match, but this doesn’t just tally up stats from the game due to the variety of characters.</p>



<p>The longer you wait for a match, the broader the search will become. When fighting in a part, you’ll only fight against similar-sized parties.</p>



<p>Questions have been asked on why Rivals has not introduced role-based matchmaking to the game, and the answer is that it would result in longer queue times. Similarly, that’s why four-player and six-player teams at higher ranks have also been restricted in a recent update.</p>



<p>Check out the full video below.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’ve heard your feedback on matchmaking and ranking in Marvel Rivals, and your voices matter! </p><p>Check out our Lead Combat Designer, Zhiyong, as he shares our developer insights on the matchmaking and ranking system. </p><p>Watch the full video to see the systems behind the game! <a href="https://t.co/OmErw2WMgU">pic.twitter.com/OmErw2WMgU</a></p></div>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1958627668536311945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>

<p>The latest set coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket has leaked ahead of an official reveal, showing that the legendary beasts of Johto will be the main focus.</p>



<p>Leaks for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new set have been rather consistent and accurate, detailing what players can expect ahead of time before an official reveal takes place.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s A4a set, set to release next week, follows on from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-a4-card-set-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wisdom of Sea and Sky A4 set</a> released last month and is once again focused on the second generation of Pokémon.</p>



<h2 id="h-suicune-raikou-amp-entei-star-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-a4a-set">Suicune, Raikou, &amp; Entei Star in Pokémon TCG Pocket A4a Set</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a leaked trailer <a href="https://x.com/UniteVids/status/1958758609996714277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter), pack art featuring Suicune was ripped open to reveal a host of new cards, including Suicune ex, before a transition to a volcano environment where Entei ex appeared. Then, Raikou ex made an appearance.</p>



<p>The legendary trio will clearly be the stars of the new set, which could be the penultimate set before a big shake-up in Pokémon TCG Pocket that introduces Mega Evolution to the game.</p>



<p>Mega Evolutions’ arrival will mark the start of the second season in the game, potentially changing the rules and pushing the sets to ‘B’, though at this stage it’s merely speculation.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has teased a “big update” later this year, though, which aligns with suggestions it could reformat the meta and transition into the next stage.</p>
