<p>Battlefield 6’s Portal mode has been designed to make the game feel fresh “years after you first picked it up”. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Battlefield Portal was returning to the main series this year, and we finally got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-upgrade-players-build-own-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmation</a> during BF6’s multiplayer reveal. The new Portal mode puts the tools for creating in the hands of players, allowing them to craft custom and unique experiences. Now, developers have revealed the philosophy behind the Portal mode. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-portal-mode-is-for-players-that-want-to-do-more-than-completing-a-game">Battlefield 6’s Portal Mode is For Players That Want to Do More than Completing a Game</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-devs-explain-portal-map-maker-absolutely-essential-for-modern-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, UX director Alan Pimm revealed some new insights for BF6’s Portal mode. Pimm first spoke about how the developers are looking to improve the Portal from 2042. The mode had several “clever tools,” such as scripting your own AI, customising the mode to your preferences, and more. They realised that people want terrain options, where they can pick different bits and not just their modes, and also manipulate and play with them. </p>



<p>Pimm goes on to say that the new Battlefield 6 Portal creations can be certified as modes in their own right, such as a “locked weapons mode”. However, if players try to make an XP farm for themselves, they will be told, “Actually, you won’t get XP from this one”, along with other warnings in the Editor.  </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Pimm elaborates that players don’t want a game they can complete, they want to grow with it, evolve with it or “make their dreams come true”. Battlefield 6’s Portal mode was designed with one philosophy in mind: longevity. The developers want to make the game feel fresh, “years after you first picked it up”. </p>



<p>Pimm concluded, stating that some players play for only an hour, while others play for 8 hours straight. These tools will cater to all types of players, “listen to the whole community, and make it accessible to do as much as possible.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98battlefield-6-game-servers-full%E2%80%99-40-000-players-are-waiting-for-the-beta-to-start.1263375/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If this isn’t the biggest indication of how excited fans are for the Battlefield 6 beta to start, I don’t know what is. As I write this, more than 40,000 players are sitting in a queue to play the beta, being met with nothing more than a ‘Game Servers Full’ message on Battlefield 6’s title screen.</p>



<p>The number has skyrocketed in the last couple of hours, and it’s easy to see it hitting six figures soon enough. The first portion of the Battlefield 6 beta starts tomorrow, let’s just hope that the ‘Game Servers Full’ message disappears…</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-join-the-queue">Join the Queue</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is set to erupt this weekend as the beta welcomes millions of players (probably). From the multiplayer reveal last week to the countless leaks we’ve seen surface on social media in the last few months, everything is shaping up in Electronic Arts’ favor with Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Could this be the year it overtakes Call of Duty? The hype for Black Ops 7 couldn’t be lower right now.</p>



<p>If you open Battlefield 6 right now, you’ll be met with a message advising you: ‘Game Servers Full’. It’s not a representation of any technical error (I hope), but it’s more of a placeholder that’ll keep things contained and buttoned up until the beta goes live.</p>



<p>If nothing else, it’s entertaining to watch the number ebb and flow as more players attempt to open the Battlefield 6 beta, only to find it’s not live and they’ve got their timings wrong. Perhaps I need to get out more.</p>



<p>Here are a few handy resources if you’re sitting there and staring at the ‘Game Servers Full’ message:</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-wont-feature-at-upcoming-indie-world-showcase-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-won%E2%80%99t-feature-at-upcoming-indie-world-showcase-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new claim suggests that Hollow Knight: Silksong will not be featured during the Indie World Showcase this week, on August 7, 2025. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Nintendo recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-indie-world-showcase-for-august-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an Indie World Showcase for this week, and what surprised players was that the announcement came less than a week after their Nintendo Direct <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-july-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Showcase</a>. Many players got their hopes high, thinking they might get to see more of Hollow Knight: Silksong at this event, but new reports say otherwise. </p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-is-not-on-the-cards-for-indie-world-showcase">Hollow Knight: Silksong is ‘Not on the Cards’ for Indie World Showcase</h2>



<p>The claim about Hollow Knight: Silksong comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tuvr5j3HvXQ&amp;t=203s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SwitchForce</a> (via <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/08/06/nintendo-indie-world-leaker-says-hollow-knight-silksong-wont-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyNintendoNews</a>), the person responsible for leaking a Nintendo showcase for this week. In his new YouTube video, SwitchForce states that, as far as he is aware, Hollow Knight: Silksong is “not on the cards” for the upcoming event, and he doesn’t expect it to get the “Indie World treatment” as it’s grown far bigger than that. </p>



<p>SwitchForce notes that players will be able to see Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom, as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> will also be available there. He added that “a lot of the marketing has now shifted towards Xbox” for the upcoming title, and they will be “housing that demo for their upcoming portables at Gamescom. </p>

Additionally, a leaker has claimed that the game is expected to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-before-end-of-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before the end of Summer 2025</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The original Fallout was created as a sequel to EA’s 1988 title, Wasteland, Interplay’s former co-founder has revealed. However, they did all they could to avoid being sued by EA. </p>



<p>The original Fallout title came almost a decade after (1997) the first Wasteland game (1988), and both games had the same developers, Interplay. However, Wasteland was published by EA, and Fallout was developed and published by Interplay. Now, Interplay’s co-founder has revealed that many people are unaware that Fallout was a sequel to Wasteland. </p>



<h2 id="h-interplay-did-everything-to-avoid-being-sued-by-ea">Interplay Did Everything to Avoid Being Sued by EA</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-was-a-sequel-to-wasteland-says-interplay-co-founder-and-we-did-everything-we-could-not-to-be-sued-by-electronic-arts-after-the-devs-had-to-pivot-out-of-the-follow-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Brian Fargo, the co-founder of Interplay, revealed new details about Fallout and Wasteland during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjeRn2eA3y4&amp;t=2766s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mr.MattyPlays</a>. Fargo explicitly stated that a lot of people don’t know that Fallout “was a sequel to Wasteland.” Fargo explained that players are unaware of the story behind it, but “that’s why it went from tunnels and trolls and then we needed a system – mercenaries, spies, and private eyes – and then that’s how we got the skill-based system with Wasteland, and then that went to Fallout.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The former co-founder explains that while developing Fallout, even though it took heavy inspiration from Wasteland, Interplay did everything they could “not to be sued by Electronic Arts”. Fallout even had “your life ends in the Wasteland”, Fargo stated. However, he loves that the game has an origin story that he is very proud of, and he learned a lot from his time on the original Wasteland. </p>



<p>Fargo eventually did make sequels for the Wasteland series as the studio head at inExile Entertainment, with Wasteland 2 releasing in 2014 and Wasteland 3 releasing in 2020. </p>



<p>In other news, the Fallout: Bakersfield trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-bakersfield-trailer-reveals-insane-take-1997/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveals an insane take</a> on the 1997 classic. Additionally, Fallout 5 has reportedly been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-bethesda-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully greenlit</a>, according to a recent claim.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-platform-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-crossplay-cross-platform-status-explained.1263246/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded embraces unity and squad goals. With multiplayer available, implementing crossplay is a must, but it isn’t always easy. This handy guide has answers to all key crossplay and cross-progression questions.</p>



<p>The Coalition could have simply brought back Gears 1’s campaign, and that’s it. But no, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> has the campaign, co-op, and authentic multiplayer. It’s the complete package for one of the most beloved shooters of our time.</p>



<p>The second you mention multiplayer, the word ‘crossplay’ usually follows. Many games utilize crossplay, so let’s see if Gears of War: Reloaded is the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-crossplay-in-gears-of-war-reloaded">Is There Crossplay in Gears of War: Reloaded?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My brother. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Gears of War: Reloaded boasts complete crossplay functionality at launch, meaning you can hop into online campaign sessions and multiplayer matches with players from other formats.</strong></p>



<p>It really is the total package, isn’t it? The Coalition has confirmed through the official <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reloaded</a> website that the game has: “Crossplay across platforms, allowing you and your friends to squad-up wherever you play.”</p>



<p>There’s nothing wrong with you flying solo. However, if you desperately need allies to help you complete the impossible Insane difficulty, crossplay allows you to team up and take down Locusts without restrictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-cross-progression">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p><strong>Cross-progression is available for Gears of War: Reloaded, which allows you to transfer your save data across compatible platforms.</strong></p>



<p>We’re two for two so far in this guide! We defer to Reloaded’s official site once more on this one: “Jump from one platform to another and your campaign saves as well as multiplayer progression will come with you.”</p>



<p>This is two-fold:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can save your campaign progress on one format and resume where you left off elsewhere.</li>



<li>Your online multiplayer data you’ve accrued is also transferable across Reloaded’s applicable platforms.</li>
</ul>



<p>You’re not hindered by one platform. Let me explain more about that below for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-platforms-is-gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-compatible-with">Which Platforms is Gears of War: Reloaded Crossplay Compatible With?</h2>



<p><strong>Gears of War: Reloaded’s crossplay and cross-progression functions apply to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>You can buy and own Reloaded on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. In short, any save data on one console can be loaded on another or a PC. I know many of you own multiple platforms in this day and age, so it’s nice to see The Coalition fully embrace this.</p>



<p>Sorry to Nintendo Switch 2 owners, it doesn’t look like there’s any love for you guys right now.</p>

<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has everything and more. Is it an easy day-one purchase for you? What’s the first thing you’ll do when you get it? Let me know through the Insider Gaming forum.</p>
