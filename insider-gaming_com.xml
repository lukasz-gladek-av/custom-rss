<p>The first Battlefield Labs playtest will start this week, Insider Gaming has learned.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Battlefield Labs will have its first playtest to test “concepts and mechanics” on Friday March 7th. The playtest will be the first in EA’s new Battlefield Labs program, which was announced earlier this year. The first test is scheduled to take place for approximately two hours on the PC.</p>



<p>According to the email sent to participants, the test is in a “closed test environment” and recording, streaming, and and discussions about the game are strictly prohibited. But whether participants stick to such a confidentiality agreement remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Players can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still sign up to the Battlefield Labs</a> in order to try and gain access to future Battlefield playtests.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is said to be EA’s “most ambitious community development collaboration ever, where a select number of fans will step inside the war room.”</p>



<p>Its announcement saw hundreds of thousands of people sign up, with EA assuring players that no matter when you register, you’ll still be as equally eligible to be accepted as those who registered first.</p>



<p>The playtest comes as DICE and EA want to work more closely with the community after Battlefield 2042’s fumbled launch, which was poorly received by the community.</p>



<p>The next Battlefield title is scheduled to release later this year on the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Have you already signed up to the Battlefield Labs playtests? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;if you have any success.</p>

<p>The release window for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has seemingly been confirmed by one of the game’s voice actors. </p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, voice actor Khary Payton said that the current plan for the game’s launch is around Christmas time this year.</p>



<p>“We’re still working,” the Black Panther voice actor said. “We’re planning on 2025… We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I’m so excited.”</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-media-s-fault">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-medias-fault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman Canceled And Is It The Games Media’s Fault?</a></h6>



<p>A Christmas 2025 release is the most definitive information regarding the game that fans have gotten in some time. The game was first revealed during GDC 2024 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-revealed-along-with-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its name and first trailer</a> shown. Since then, however, it’s been quiet on all fronts as the game’s development continues.</p>



<p>Set in occupied Paris during World War II, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is based on the 2010 limited series comic Captain America / Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers. The story follows an alliance between Black Panther and Captain America as they work to prevent Hydra from coming into power. The game will allow players to control one of four main protagonists throughout, including Captain America Steve Rogers, Azzuri (Black Panther), the leader of the Wakandan Spy Network Nanali, and Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones.</p>



<p>Neither developer Skydance New Media nor publisher Plaion have commented officially on the game’s release date. Should the Christmas 2025 window be confirmed, it’s likely to happen sometime in the next few months as more gaming events such as Game Developers Conference 2025 and Summer Games Fest 2025 take place.</p>



<p>What do you think of a Christmas 2025 release window for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1721/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>In a new interview, the Russo brothers have said that they are open to developing video games tied to their Avengers movies.</p>



<p>The interview comes courtesy of <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, where the Russo brothers were pushing their latest project “The Electric State.”</p>



<p>In the interview, it was said that the Russos helped Netflix develop a mobile game based on Electric State with their media company AGBO and will be expanding with recent hire of Nifty Games vet&nbsp;Pete Wanat&nbsp;as president of interactive technology.</p>



<p>It was said that the company now plans to produce three large-scale transmedia projects based on original ideas, but are open to developing games tied to their upcoming Avengers films. This includes Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers Secret Wars.</p>



<p>“We would definitely be open to it,” said Joe Russo. </p>



<p>“Right now, what we’re doing is creating new IP. At AGBO, we want to tell new stories. We want to tell new stories with new characters and new worlds that people haven’t seen before. So Anthony and I and Donald are working together to build out new worlds. And we have three that we’re currently working on that the intention is, for every world we build to have the scale and depth of a “Star Wars” universe, but in a different genre. And then we’ll build materials around those new worlds. We’ll tell stories in different ways using different media in those worlds,” he continue.</p>



<p>So although it might be a ways off, the Russo’s are definitely open to having a games tied to the Avengers games and its upcoming movies.</p>

<p>Special Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake editions can make an already seismic release greater. The remake we never thought would happen is happening, and Activision is making sure to capitalize on it by releasing several unique editions. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remake</a> rumor is less a whisper and more a truth. While we’ve all been kept in the dark waiting and wondering, developer Iron Galaxy has been busy working on the remake. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-revealed-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and Pro Skater 4</a> will be reimagined in 2025, and you can customize your experience with different editions.</p>



<p>That’s why I’m here to hold your hand as we idly coast along on our boards and check out the scenery. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie’s Marathon Pre-Order Bonuses Have Been Found on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-pre-order-bonuses-have-been-found-on-steam.1125747/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bungie’s next game, Marathon, has reportedly had its pre-order bonuses uploaded to the backend on Steam.</p>



<p>That’s according to the SteamDB Discord server (and reported to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j3pv6f/marathon_preorder_cosmetics_found_in_steamdb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>), who noticed that that extra editions of Marathon and packages relating to pre-order bonuses were uploaded to Steam.</p>



<p>According to the information, such pre-order bonuses will include free Marathon skins that can be used in Destiny 2.</p>



<p>Such an update suggests that the game will be announced soon, and according to industry insider Jeff Grubb, he said in February that he believes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/">Bungie will reveal </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/"> in April</a>.</p>



<p>“Marathon wasn’t here because they’re probably going to do their own thing. Bungie does their own thing usually for Destiny. They’re going to adopt that same ‘we’re going to talk to our audience’ strategy this year as well. I think April [is] when we probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from a State of Play,” he said.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon was first revealed on May 24, 2023, with a teaser trailer revealing that the game would be a sci-fi PvP extraction shooter. </p>



<p>In June 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon’s gameplay loop</a>, including an experimental feature that would see players have an in-game timer controlled by their oxygen supply. </p>



<p>Marathon is scheduled to release in 2025 for the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to seeing more of Bungie’s Marathon? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
