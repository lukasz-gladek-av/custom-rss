<p>Fortnite has officially announced that their Messi collaboration skins will be released tonight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has released a new teaser titled ‘<a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1867571859518025748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Live the Legend</a>’, which revealed that new Messi and Lion-themed Skins will drop tonight, December 13. Messi seems to be able to transform from a Lion by using an emote featuring his iconic goal celebration.&nbsp;</p>

As revealed by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1867570715278684624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, The first is Streetwear Spark Messi, which features the Argentinian maestro in a hoodie and jeans. The other skin is Lionel Messi, featuring the World Cup winner in a football kit. Additionally, there are two Lion-themed alternative outfits, one in golden and the other in white.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s amazing to see myself represented in Fortnite. As a kid, I would never have imagined something like this. Football has always been synonymous with joy and connection, and now fans can live that experience through my very own skin in a way that transcends the pitch. I hope you enjoy it!”</p>
