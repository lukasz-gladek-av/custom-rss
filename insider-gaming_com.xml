<p>Bungie’s release date trailer for Marathon has leaked online, revealing a March 5, 2026, release. </p>



<p>After delays, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism controversy</a>, and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art director leaving</a> just months before the release window, it seems Bungie is finally set on the Marathon release date. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> by Sony back in November 2025, Marathon will release this year in March, as a new leaked trailer confirms. </p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-releases-on-march-5-leaked-trailer-confirms">Marathon Releases on March 5, Leaked Trailer Confirms</h2>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qgvybm/marathon_release_date_trailer_leaked_5th_march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Marathon’s release date trailer has leaked online, revealing new details. The trailer starts like most of their newer videos, blending gameplay and cinematics. Towards the end of the video, we finally get a release date revealed: “Coming March 5, 2026.” Pre-orders will begin when the trailer is officially dropped, and the Deluxe Edition will feature a ‘Midnight Decay Bundle’, two weapon skins, and additional content. </p>



<p>Leading up to the release, Marathon developers have provided extensive details about the upcoming Extraction Shooter. We already know about the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-pricing-battle-pass-details-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing, battle pass details, improvements</a> across the board, and more. Additionally, just last week, we received details on the archetypes, abilities, and customisations you can do with Marathon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-details-on-runner-shells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Runner Shells</a>. There is no confirmation yet on when the trailer for the release date will officially drop. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Marathon is an upcoming FPS, PvPvE survival extraction title from Bungie, which takes players to the world of Tau Ceti IV, where you get to play as bio-cybernetic Runners. The goals are to scavenge zones for valuable items while indulging in fast-paced PvPvE combat. The game also focuses heavily on customisation, allowing players to craft unique playstyles using existing runner shells. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Former Assassin’s Creed Boss is Suing Ubisoft for $1.3 Million in Damages]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-million-damages/</link>
            <guid>1409779</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Former Assassin’s Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté has filed a claim with the Superior Court of Quebec for $1.3 million in damages against Ubisoft.</p>



<p>The file comes months after Ubisoft announced that Marc-Alexis Côté <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-assassins-creed-has-left-ubisoft-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left the company voluntarily</a>, a claim which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Côté later denied</a>, stating that he was “asked to step aside” from the company. </p>







<p>In a lengthy LinkedIn post, Côté said, “Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it. The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.”</p>



<p>He later continued, “But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.”</p>



<p>The new report from <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CBC Radio Canada</a> states that Côté is now taking Ubisoft to court, claiming $1.3 million in severance pay and moral damages.</p>



<p>According to the report, Côté was told during a management meeting in late summer 2025 that Ubisoft’s new subsidiary with Tencent was looking to find a “Head of Franchise”, which was a position not offered to Côté. Instead, Côté was offered the position of “Dead of Production”, which would have seen him reporting to someone else.</p>



<p>The lawsuit states that in September, the position to lead a “Creative House” with abstract outlines was offered. After lengthy negotiations, Ubisoft reportedly asked him to make a decision on the changes, to which Côté formally demanded that the company pay him severance.</p>







<p>In response, Ubisoft reportedly told him not to show up for work as planned on October 13, and to continue his reflection period until the company responds to its formal notice. The next day, Ubisoft announced via a press release and internal emails that Côté was leaving his position voluntarily to&nbsp;<q>explore new opportunities</q>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, but did not receive one prior to publication. Should one be received, we will update the article.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo always keeps a careful eye on its branding and the face of its company, Mario. Even when collaborating with a partner like Sega.</p>



<p>Of course, the relationship between Sega and Nintendo is much different today than it was 30 years ago at the height of the console wars. As many know, Sonic, Sega’s mascot, was designed specifically to make Mario seem slow and outdated, so more players would gravitate toward the Sega Genesis home console. However, Sega left the console war in 2001 and, in later years, appeared alongside Mario in Super Smash Bros. games and in their own game, where Mario, Sonic, and many of their side characters from their respective franchises participated in Olympic sports.</p>







<h2 id="h-mario-can-t-appear-to-be-a-step-behind">Mario Can’t Appear to Be a Step Behind</h2>



<p>Ryoichi Hasegawa, a former Sega producer, worked on the Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games franchise. Now, he’s sharing a fun story that offers insight into how protective Nintendo is of its mascot.</p>



<p>He was recently interviewed by Adrian of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r6XcQF_pBI&amp;pp=0gcJCU8KAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arcade Attack Retro Gaming Network,</a> and during the interview, explained that Nintendo once was upset that Sonic’s foot was ahead of Mario’s in the key art for the Mario and Sonic at the Beijing Olympics video game</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“But there was one funny story. There was, of course, artwork of Mario, Sonic, and other characters standing on the field. Those artworks were used for the package, the instruction manual cover, and the cartridge label, and things like that. There was one small error. Sonic’s foot was in front of Mario’s foot. Nintendo demanded us to change the priority. I still remember that. We were like, ‘Oh my God! We have to change it, or there’ll be no deal.'”</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>That’s right, blast processing be damned! Mario will always be one step ahead. There were six games featuring the Mario and Sonic characters at the Olympics. However, the series has remained dormant since the 2019 release of Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.</p>

<p>Two minutes of in-engine footage of ZeniMax Online Studio’s cancelled Project Blackbird has leaked online.</p>







<p>The footage, which Insider Gaming can verify is legitimate, was used internally at ZeniMax to showcase the game’s lighting in Unreal Engine 4. You can see the two minutes of footage below:</p>

<p>Project Blackbird was cancelled by Microsoft in July 2025 as a part of Microsoft’s mass layoffs, which also saw other projects at the publisher cancelled.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources on Blackbird, the game was targeting a 2028 release date and had amazed Microsoft Gaming executives just months earlier during a presentation. As of the time of writing, Microsoft Gaming still haven’t given a reason as to why Blackbird was cancelled.</p>



<p>The game’s cancellation led to the layoff of some 300 developers and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/matt-firor-quit-zenimax-project-blackbird-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure of studio president Matt Firor</a>. </p>

<p>The live-action Legend of Zelda movie will stream exclusively on Netflix after its theatrical and home entertainment releases.</p>



<p>Very little is known about the Legend of Zelda movie, aside from the fact that it is slated to release in May 2027. However, as part of Sony Pictures’ Pay-1 licensing deal with Netflix, the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie will join Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse and the forthcoming quartet of Beatles movies, directed by Sam Mendes, in streaming exclusively on Netflix.</p>



<p><a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-and-sony-pictures-entertainment-enter-new-global-pay-1-deal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a press release, </a>Paul Littmann, EVP of Global Distribution at Sony Pictures Television, praised the partnership with Netflix and cited the new deal as the next step in that relationship.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our partnership with Netflix has always been incredibly valuable. This new Pay-1 deal takes that partnership to the next level and reinforces the enduring appeal of our theatrical releases to Netflix’s global audience. It also further underscores the strength of our independence and unique ability to create meaningful opportunities that benefit our creative stakeholders, consumers, and world-class partners.”</p>

<h2 id="h-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">What We Know So Far About the Legend of Zelda Movie</h2>



<p>In November 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-images-reveal-link-and-zelda-in-costume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official images</a> of Zelda and Link in the film were revealed. Bo Bragason will play Princess Zelda, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth will play Hyrule’s protector, Link. Filming began in 2025, but there’s still over a year until the actual release, and much remains to be learned about the casting, plot, and more. Recently, it was suggested that a star of the popular Apple TV series, Severance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zelda-movie-leak-impa-severance-actor-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">could be joining the cast.</a></p>







<p>2026 is also the 40th anniversary of the The Legend of Zelda franchise as a whole. In celebration, a new LEGO set is on the way.
