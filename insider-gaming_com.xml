<p>On social media, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, a senior team member at Pocketpair, revealed how he has been inundated with messages and propositions since the firm announced a publishing endeavour. Bucky, who was recently promoted to the role of Communications Director and Publishing Manager, was transparent in a recent post on Twitter (X).</p>



<p>He wrote, ‘I think I might have underestimated how much interest there would be.’</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Palworld’s developer, Pocketpair, revealed ‘Pocketpair Publishing’. At the same time, Surgent Studios, the creator of Tales of Kenzera, announced that it would be the first major partner of the publishing arm, working with the team to create a new horror game.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1882582384052457558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley revealed that within 15 hours of publishing the Pocketpair news, he’d received more than 1,600 connection requests, emails, and propositions from small developers wanting to work with the label.</p>



<p>On Twitter, Bucky shot up, pulling in several hundred followers just as the news broke.</p>



<p>In the comments under his post, Bucky was grilled on the nature of Pocketpair’s publishing initiatives, curious to know how involved the company would be with the developer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We give you money. You make game. </p>



<p>If you want help with marketing or something we’ll help out, but otherwise do whatever you want. </p>



<p>We’re giving devs the financial freedom to make games they want so they DON’T have to get wrapped up with stinky rule makers and bullies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed recently that Pocketpair Publishing is ‘100% self-funded’. In a statement, the company wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As a completely independent publisher, we are uniquely positioned to help developers create the games they want, free from the complications of dealing with third parties who may not have their best interests at heart. </p>



<p>Pocketpair and Pocketpair Publishing are beholden to no one. </p>



<p>We remain dedicated to making fun games, and we’re so excited to now be able to help others bring their own fun games to life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you want to work with Pocketpair Publishing, it’s as simple as <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/publishing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">heading to the website</a> and selecting ‘Pitch Your Game’.</p>



<p>Is this a huge win from Pocketpair, or do you see them falling prey to the very thing they’re trying to avoid? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Avowed will be released worldwide on February 18, slotting into an already busy month for the RPG genre. For a while now, prospective fans have been eagerly scooping up any tidbits of information about the game, and most recently, the discussion turned to how the game is laid out.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Xbox Wire, Obsidian’s developers sat down to talk about the lack of an open-world environment in Avowed. It’s very much by design and is a deliberate, strategic decision to encourage players to have e better experience overall.</p>

<h2 id="h-you-can-do-whatever-you-want">‘You Can Do Whatever You Want’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/24/avowed-choose-your-own-adventure-incredible-freedom/" rel="nofollow">with Xbox Wire</a>, Obsidian’s Berto Ritger, Carrie Patel, and Kate Dollarhyde walked readers through the nature of the ‘zones’ in Avowed.</p>



<p>This ambitious RPG isn’t an open-world game, but instead, it relies on a series of ‘denser’ regions locked behind borders that keep the pacing consistent and manageable.</p>



<p>During the interview, Dollarhyde – who works as a narrative designer – explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Pacing is really tough in open-world games.</p>



<p>You never know where the player is and what they’re doing at any given time. So having these zones that happen in sequence means we always know what content you’ve just come from on the critical path. Maybe not what side quests you’ve done, but we always know you’ve just had this core experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That sentiment was echoed by Ritger, region director at Obsidian:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s a good pacing mechanism.</p>



<p>We know roughly what you’ve done before you’ve gone to the next thing. It’s still a very open structure within those zones, where you can do whatever you want for the most part, but it’s not one contiguous area where you could be anywhere at any moment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Having smaller, more detailed regions or zones has enabled Obsidian to scope in and focus on delivering a more immersive, choice-driven experience for players. Even with the zones being scaled down from the open-world models we might be more used to in these grand RPG titles, we can still expect there to be plenty of meat on Avowed’s bones.</p>
