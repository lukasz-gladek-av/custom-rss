<p>It’s quite fun for something like Kirby Air Riders to be coming out in 2025, and we’ve got its full release date details, as well as news on its start times and when you can properly wait for the chequered flag to drop.</p>



<p>When you think of racing games on Nintendo Switch, you default to Mario Kart, without question. You might have to rethink this impulse with the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a>. It’s an unexpected sequel over 20 years in the making, and Kirby has decided to take to the track after a trip through a Forbidden Kingdom.</p>







<p>For all your much-needed Kirby Air Riders release information, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-kirby-air-riders-coming-out">When Is Kirby Air Riders Coming Out?</h2>

<p><strong>Kirby Air Riders is expected to release on November 20, barring any last-minute delays or complications.</strong></p>



<p>Switch 2 owners can get suited up and drive off on November 20. Nintendo games are usually very reliable, where release dates due to the company’s persistence in perfection. You never know in this day and age, so brace yourself for any late red flags to interrupt your plans.</p>







<p>You can play the game early, too, through the Kirby Air Riders Global Test Ride demo. It gives you a final chance to try out the game before launch, which will likely boost the game’s sales.</p>



<p>It’s expected there won’t be much DLC, and there might not be another sequel. So, expect a very full and jam-packed Kirby Air Riders to keep you occupied for a while.</p>



<h2 id="h-kirby-air-riders-start-times">Kirby Air Riders Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Like most Nintendo first-party games, we expect Kirby Air Riders to be added to the eShop at 7 AM PT on November 20. This is when you can download, install, and play Kirby Air Riders.</strong></p>



<p>This information comes from Nintendo itself. Again, not everything is iron-clad, and there could be some changes. We’d say to go on the assumption that the time is accurate.</p>



<p>That said, here are the Kirby Air Riders release dates and times in key regions.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Kirby Air Riders Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">10:00 AM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Grenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM—November 20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—November 21</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders.1354567/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first full day of Black Ops 7 is behind us. Its reception has been fairly mixed so far, but one thing that’s not up for debate is how Black Ops 7 has performed on Steam, especially compared to other big-time shooters right now, such as Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s release means Treyarch has had back-to-back launches. Black Ops 6 was quite the success, but Black Ops 7 isn’t being as warmly received. Criticism has come its way due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI Claims</a> and the fact that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-cant-pause-the-black-ops-7-campaign-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t pause the Black Ops 7 campaign, ever</a>.</p>







<p>With so many eyes on Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders, it’s fair to say Black Ops 7 isn’t the shooter in the spotlight like it wants to be.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-falls-way-short-of-arc-raiders-amp-battlefield-6-on-steam">Black Ops 7 Falls Way Short Of ARC Raiders &amp; Battlefield 6 On Steam</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A good start for some. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s break this down for you. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Battlefield hit a 24-hour release day peak of <strong>747,440 players</strong>, whereas ARC Raiders managed a more than respectable <strong>264,673</strong>.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is part of the whole ‘Call of Duty’ banner under SteamDB, making its numbers slightly inflated if anything. However, its 24-hour launch peak on November 14 hit a high of <strong>86,652 players</strong>.</p>







<p>It’s bad enough if you compare ARC Raider and Black Ops 7. When you do a direct comparison between Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7, you need to stop the count! Worryingly for CoD, Battlefield 6 is still regularly hitting 200-250K, and ARC Raiders is growing stronger—consistently breaking 300K.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the weekend might give Black Ops 7 a boost, but it remains to be seen by how much. Even with Season 1 expected to be the biggest ever, for a franchise that regularly scoops the award for best-selling game of the year, this year might be a rude awakening for Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Have you bought Black Ops 7? Or are you on either the Battlefield 6 or ARC Raiders hype train this year?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Given the history and prestige of The Legend of Zelda, a proper movie is something that’s needed. There’s also the biggest weight of expectation imaginable on its shoulders. So, anyone desperate for details on The Legend of Zelda movie might be interested to know that the first footage has reportedly leaked.</p>



<p>In 2023, we finally learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda was getting a movie</a>. It received a release date soon after, but it was inevitably <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a>—as all things are. After wondering where the movie had gone, it was rumored that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-filming-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movie had seemingly started filming</a> in November 2025. Not long after, secret footage surfaced.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-video-leaks-appear-online">The Legend of Zelda Movie Video Leaks Appear Online</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a tough ask. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/josh.and.pine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">josh.and.pine</a> has shared several videos supposedly showing the first The Legend of Zelda Movie set leaks.</p>



<p>The video shows Link on set (in full Green Tunic) speaking to the crew. Soon after, we cut to the actress playing Zelda—and it also reveals that she’s wearing a blue outfit closer to the Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom look. A horse is being prepared, and it’s clearly wearing a patch with the classic Zelda logo in the middle of it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCDMlDDq-q/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If that wasn’t enough to whet your appetite, another leak from what appears to be the sme set has also been revealed. This time, it looks like an actual scene is taking place. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tonyolsenfilm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tonyolsenfilm</a> shared the other video, and it’s an extension of the first clip, only this time Zelda is briefly looking around before speaking to another Hylian.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCALkNk0Nl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>There have been some suggestions that the footage is AI. However, the action isn’t consistent with the usual AI tropes, such as scenery inconsistencies, the weird AI effect some videos have, and there aren’t any abnormal occurrences in the footage. This could also be a setup leak to promote the film and gain publicity through alleged leaks.</p>







<p>Either way, unless we hear otherwise, this does look like the first-ever The Legend of Zelda Movie footage. The costumes look good—although this incarnation of Zelda might upset some fans—and we know that filming is likely underway!</p>



<p>Let us know what you think of the videos. Are you excited to see what a full-length, live-action The Legend of Zelda Movie looks like?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-length-mission-list/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-long-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-game-length-and-missions-list.1354549/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is available to the world and, with a new game mode unlocking after completion of the campaign, it’s natural to ask about the length and how many missions there are to complete—and we have the answer.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 makes some big changes to the campaign this year, introducing four-player co-op and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Camos to unlock</a>, giving players more to dig out from the experience.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering what the full length of the Black Ops 7 campaign is and want to know how many missions there are to churn through, we’ve got all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-long-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">How Long to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big names. Image via Activsion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Full completion of the main story in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign takes around five hours to complete, though this can be longer.</strong></p>



<p>If you are playing the campaign solo, completion time will be longer as progress will be harder and therefore slower. If you want to blitz through the campaign as quickly as possible, it’s highly recommended that you gather a squad to help push through the hordes of enemies more quickly.</p>



<p>Campaign completion will also take longer if you’re hunting down all of the Intel scattered in the game, or if you’re farming for the exclusive Camos. If you’re doing the latter, however, I recommend you hold off until you complete the campaign and unlock the Endgame mode.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-missions-in-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign">How Many Missions in Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 11 total missions in the Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign, not including the Endgame mode, which you will be automatically entered into for the first time when the campaign is complete.</strong></p>



<p>Each mission is unlocked periodically, fleshing out the main story, though it’s a bit of a fever trip jumping to different locations and years, so don’t worry if you’re struggling to keep up.</p>



<p>Many of the missions begin in an open-world environment in Avalon, but there are markers to follow so you won’t get lost.</p>



<p>A full list of the missions in the Black Ops 7 campaign is below:</p>



<ol>
<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Inside</li>



<li>Distortion</li>



<li>Escalation</li>



<li>Disruption</li>



<li>Collapse</li>



<li>Fracture</li>



<li>Quarantine</li>



<li>Suppression</li>



<li>Breakpoint</li>



<li>Containment</li>
</ol>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-server-capacity-tripled-for-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-games-has-tripled-escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-server-capacity-ahead-of-1-0-release.1354528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the biggest issues that plagues Escape from Tarkov players every time there’s a new update is server queues. The game suffers under the weight of incoming players, and those same players feel that burn. From lengthy queue times to network instability, Tarkov’s servers often crumble around a wipe or new major update.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has well and truly prepared for that ahead of the game’s 1.0 release, dropping later today. In an episode of Tarkov TV, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio, confirmed that Escape from Tarkov’s server capacity has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of the release.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-major-networking-issues-eliminated">Tarkov’s Major Networking Issues Eliminated</h2>



<p>It’s a huge time for Escape from Tarkov. The game is finally graduating from the beta state it has sat in for almost eight years, becoming a full release and landing on Steam, amongst other things. The super-sized update introduces a new map, a non-linear campaign, fresh weapons, and more than 1,000 bug fixes.</p>



<p>In the most recent episode <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/battlestategames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of Tarkov TV</a>, Nikita also confirmed that a huge investment has been made in the game’s server capacity and infrastructure, and that the server makeup has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of launch.</p>



<p>This was preceded by a tongue-in-cheek reference by Nikita that begged players not to ‘overload their servers, please.’</p>







<p>Every time a major update has hit the Escape from Tarkov ecosystem, it has led to massive server queues and instability, placated only by users inevitably drifting away because of those issues.</p>



<p>The 1.0 update of Escape from Tarkov arrives after more than a decade of development, which has seen the face of the spearhead extraction shooter evolve numerous times.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mark Rubin Said Ubisoft Did NOT Cancel Splinter Cell to Make XDefiant]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mark-rubin-splinter-cell-ubisoft-xdefiant/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-rubin-said-ubisoft-did-not-cancel-splinter-cell-to-make-xdefiant.1354525/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, it was suggested that Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was canceled before it saw the light of day. This tidbit came from Nick Herman, the co-founder of AdHoc Studio, the creator of the recent title ‘Dispatch’, starring Aaron Paul. Herman stressed that he left Ubisoft after the project was canceled and opened a new studio, AdHoc, in 2018.</p>



<p>However, Mark Rubin, who is best known as the executive producer on the failed arena shooter, XDefiant, took to social media to refute claims that his team was making Splinter Cell and was ordered to pivot and focus instead on XDefiant.</p>







<h2 id="h-splinter-cell-did-not-become-xdefiant">Splinter Cell Did Not Become XDefiant</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Mark Rubin stressed that a recent rumor published first by Bloomberg is <strong>not true</strong>. This rumor suggests that Ubisoft was working on Splinter Cell but ‘switched’ to XDefiant. Rubin categorically denies that it was the case, stating that they were working on a game for a year, but the team was ‘struggling to find the fun.’</p>



<p>He then pushed the point again that it ‘was NOT a Splinter Cell game.’</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1989545807247487122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full quote</a> from Rubin:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Saw the rumor from Bloomberg that we were working on Splinter Cell game before switching to XDefiant. I can say that is not true.</p>



<p>When I got to Ubisoft they had been working on a game for a year that was very ambitious but was struggling to find the fun. And it was NOT a Splinter Cell game. </p>



<p>I then canceled that one and let the team pitch any game ideas they wanted. There were some cool ones but I felt the scope/difficulty was too hard on some ideas so we stuck with an arena shooter and we found the fun quickly. </p>



<p>So no we didn’t pivot off Splinter Cell to make XDefiant. Now maybe they were thinking about working on Splinter Cell before I got there but it was never a thing while I was there. My experience with Ubisoft was they are very open to whatever the studio wants to do which is great but I do wish we could have used external engines.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-splinter-cell-ubisoft-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent claim from Nick Herman</a>, co-founder of AdHoc Studios, was that Ubisoft ‘stopped caring about’ the game the team was working on. Herman would leave around a year before Mark Rubin arrived in 2019.</p>







<p>Ubisoft is still working on a remake of the original Splinter Cell title, which is working with a reported release window of 2026.</p>

<p>Use these Warframe monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Weapons, Decorations, Glyphs, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warframe is a popular third-person online shooter set in a different solar system known as the Origin system. Having originally been released on both PC as well as console in 2013, Warframe has since captured the imaginations of thousands of gamers, with a dedicated player community existing even today. It received ports for the latest generation of consoles in the last few years, and even got an iOS version in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being a fully free-to-play game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warframes-switch-2-port-delayed-by-backlog-of-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a> boasts solid accessibility, with the fast-paced gameplay and combat experience also being praised by passionate fans over the years. Although Warframe, like most F2P games nowadays, does offer microtransactions, all of the key elements of the game can be earned by simply playing and progressing through the various modes and events. Some cosmetic items can even be claimed for free by players, using the various redeem codes that the developers release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lawsuit between Bungie and writer Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case, which revolved around possible copyright violations of Destiny 2 from Martineau’s work, has been going on for around a year.</p>







<p>Destiny 2 is one of Bungie’s biggest and most recent games, released in 2017. With several expansions, the free-to-play title is still going <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhat strong</a>. However, last year, a writer named Matthew Martineau <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-being-sued-for-copyright-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against Bungie for possible copyright infringement. His claim was that the company stole various narrative elements from his work for the Red Legion plot and The Curse of Osiris expansion. Surprisingly, the case survived Bungie’s dismissal and was on its way to court. Now, it seems it has been settled and over with.</p>

<p>Obtained by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, the lawsuit between Bungie and Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case has been dismissed and will not go to court. In a statement from the court filing, it says,</p>



<p>“The court having been advised that all parties have firmly agreed upon a compromise in this matter; it is ordered that this action be and is hereby dismissed as to all parties, without costs and without prejudice to the right, upon good cause shown, within sixty days, to reopen the action if the settlement is not consummated,” the order reads. “In addition, the court specifically retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement if settlement is not consummated within sixty days.”</p>



<p>However, if the settlement is not completed in 60 days, the case will go to trial. As it stands, though, a compromise has been made, and no legal action will occur. Without speculation, a settlement usually means both parties are at fault.</p>



<p>While the claims made by Matthew Martineau do seem a bit much, Bungie isn’t a stranger to copyright infringements. During the alpha of Marathon, the company was caught <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stealing assets</a> from artist ANTIREAL for several designs. After the controversy, the game was delayed and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet to be released</a>.&nbsp;</p>
