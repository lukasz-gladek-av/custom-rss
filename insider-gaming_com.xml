<p>The situation surrounding the recent closure of Ubisoft Halifax continues to get messier. Just one day after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/union-files-legal-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-studio-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing a legal complaint</a> with the Nova Scotia Labor Board, CWA Canada, the union representing 61 of the 71 employees let go by Ubisoft, revealed that they met with the company on Wednesday.</p>



<p>However, the meeting, they say, resulted in no progress.</p>







<h2 id="h-cwa-says-ubisoft-came-without-documents">CWA Says Ubisoft Came Without Documents</h2>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, CWA President Carmel Smyth said that the meeting on Wednesday morning was “disappointing”</p>



<p><strong>“Ubisoft came to the table with nothing,”</strong> she said. <strong>“No documentation proving financial distress, and no plan to find work at other Ubisoft operations or&nbsp;increase severance.”</strong></p>



<p>She added that they brought up the concern of those being out on parental leave being told that they wouldn’t qualify for the proposed two-month severance pay. But, instead of any progress towards a solution, Ubisoft reportedly told the union they will send their ideas on Friday.</p>







<p><strong>“It was frustrating,”</strong> Smyth said. <strong>“Their lack of preparation along with the fact that they gave no advance notice of the closure, makes us question their intentions and their commitment to treating people fairly.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We continue demanding real information, and to get the answers and the compensation you deserve after 10 years with this company.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the statements on the meeting, the union sent a release claiming that Ubisoft received nearly $1 billion (C$980 million) in government tax credit subsidies from 2020 through 2024.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment on where things stand and its view on the meeting. As of writing, multiple requests have gone unanswered. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-shutdown-month-after-launch/</link>
            <guid>1406167</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you were interested in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-mod-is-now-live-in-ealy-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently released</a> Bully Online mod, hopefully you were able to check it out because it’s been shutdown. </p>



<p>In a Discord post, it was announced that the Bully Online project was ending development and being taken offline “forever”. That means the server is offline, the source code has been taken down, and all account data will be deleted, among other steps. </p>







<p>As far as why it’s being taken offline, that wasn’t revealed. However, it was promised that Swegta, the Youtuber leading the project, will cover everything “in more detail” in a video about it.</p>



<p>“For now though, know this was not something we wanted,” <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the announcement</a> reads.</p>



<p>Bully Online was a mod that was officially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-announced-huge-catch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in October</a> and released in mid-December. It featured free roam, custom vehicles, role playing, and over 60 mini games for players to enjoy with others around the world. The mod was also released as an open-source project, allowing anyone with the skills and ability to add to it overtime. </p>



<p>Unfortunately for fans, however, that’s all come to an immediate stop and the <a href="https://swegta.com/online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website to view</a> the mod is now offline.</p>







<p>As mentioned, it’s not clear, as of now, what the reasons behind the shutdown are. That said, it could be assumed that it has something to do with the developers of the original game, Rockstar.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will add to this story once an official update on why the project was ended is made available. Until then, leave your thoughts down in the comments on Bully Online being shutdown, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hytale First Impressions: Move Over Minecraft, There’s a New King in Town]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-first-impressions/</link>
            <guid>1406095</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a long and winding road through development, which saw plenty of bumps along the way, Hytale is now in the hands of gamers around the world, and the first impressions are encouraging.</p>



<p>Hypixel Studios warned players before they jumped in that Hytale is still very much in an early access stage, with bugs and issues likely to be encountered, but, actually, my experience so far has seen no such problems. In fact, the release, so far, has been smoother than many full releases I’ve played in the past.</p>



<p>While it’s still very early in Hytale’s progression, and there’s plenty of changes to come in the future, the early impressions have blown me away, and I genuinely think that Minecraft could finally be knocked from its perch.</p>

</figure>



<p>The similarities with Minecraft are obvious, which should be no surprise given the game began as a modded server in the Mojang title, but as soon as I started to get to grips with the world around me, I quickly discovered that Hytale has a bunch of features players have been calling for in Minecraft for years.</p>



<p>When crafting, materials are pulled from nearby storage. It’s easy to stack and sort items in inventories quickly, and chopping a block out of a tree results in everything above it collapsing, which means there’s no annoying, floating blocks of leaves scattered across your world.</p>



<p>Those minor quality-of-life differences may not mean much to new players in the genre, but for those who have played Minecraft since the early days, it’s chalk and cheddar. However, this merely scratches the surface of what makes Hytale so impressive.</p>



<p>The world of Hytale is stunning, with star-filled skies bursting with colors and an environment that has more wildlife than a small zoo. From mice to bears, deer to foxes, Hytale feels alive, and it took me a moment to realise that yes, this was the base game, and I hadn’t downloaded any additional mods to increase the variety of wildlife around me.</p>



<p>Enemy-wise, there’s also a fair amount of variety, and I’ve been able to continue my hard work at nighttime in the game, safe from any threat of a horde of skeletons wandering onto my doorstep or a Creeper popping over to say hello and destroying all my hard work. While some may prefer a more threatening approach, I’ve found it to be the ideal balance for my playstyle.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-tip-of-the-iceberg">The Tip of The Iceberg</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More to come. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>The one thing I still can’t quite get my head around is the fact that we’re still in the very early stages of the game, and there’s much more on the horizon, including from Hypixel Studios and from all the talented modders who will look to add their own spin on the game.</p>



<p>Hytale’s modding support essentially gives creators a canvas to create whatever they want using the same tools that the game has been built with, opening the door to endless possibilities, and Hypixel itself has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed plans for additional content</a>, including proximity chat and new biomes to explore.</p>



<p>Updates are certain to come thick and fast during early access, and the game will continue to get even better. Considering the bar has already been set very high, it’s an encouraging sign, and the fact that as little as $19.99 can get you into the game right now is a breath of fresh air in a world where prices for games are going sky high.</p>



<p>It’s still very early days, but I’m already prepared to make a pretty firm prediction that I’m highly unlikely to ever play Minecraft again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best ARC Raiders Meta Guns—Tier List, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-meta-guns-tier-list/</link>
            <guid>1406092</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders offers some real variety with its weaponry, and it’s tough to fit all 21 guns into a tier list. However, some of the best guns are undeniably more meta than others.</p>







<p>In an extraction shooter like ARC Raiders, that’s no surprise, as a large gameplay incentive is to head out on raids in search of better gear and loot. After all, stumbling across a Bobcat is naturally more exciting than finding a Hairpin, but the lines begin to blur when different guns suit different purposes. </p>



<p>If you’re heading out on a raid and can’t decide which gear to take with you, then this guide has you covered. Here are the nine best guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-biggest-arc-raiders-features-we-want-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, as well as the complete ARC Raiders meta guns tier list. </p>







<p>Before delving into the list, it’s important to note that ARC Raiders has a strong variety of weaponry, and some simply suit very specific circumstances. The Hullcracker, for example, is an ARC killing machine, but you’ll be signing your own death warrant if you try to use it for PvP.</p>



<p>With that in mind, this list includes guns that are generally better than the rest in as many situations as possible—PvP, PvE, and everything in between.</p>



<h3 id="h-anvil">Anvil</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A monstrous hand cannon. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where better to start than with the Anvil? This hand cannon is arguably the <strong>best gun</strong> in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-insider-gaming-community-best-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, for a whole host of reasons: It’s available fairly early in the game, relatively cheap to craft and upgrade, and it hits raiders and ARC like a truck.</p>



<p>As if that wasn’t enough, the gun is reasonably effective at all ranges, though it works best during mid-range gunfights. It’s great to open fights with before charging in with a full-auto weapon, but if you prefer to play PvE, then it’s perfect to take down any ARC the game could throw your way. </p>



<h3 id="h-stitcher">Stitcher</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Basically a grey Bobcat. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Stitcher is one of the first guns you’ll encounter in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-tv-show-and-movie-ideas-being-pitched-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, but probably one of the last you’ll put down. It’s one of the cheapest guns to craft, and you don’t even need to look for a blueprint.  </p>



<p>Don’t let its cheap price fool you, though—the Stitcher packs a mean punch. You’ll find that it can hold its own against the most kitted-out raiders topside has to offer, but it doesn’t hurt to give it a light mag if you have one spare. </p>



<h3 id="h-tempest">Tempest</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The best assault rifle. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re looking for an old-fashioned Assault Rifle, then you’ll want to get your hands on a Tempest. This Epic-rarity weapon is one of the most reliable guns you can find in ARC Raiders. </p>



<p>It boasts some solid damage output, a very respectable magazine size, and even strong ARC Armor Penetration. That being said, due to its Medium Ammo usage, it’s best used against enemy raiders, but if some ARC happen to have you in a pinch, the Tempest can more than do a job. </p>



<h3 id="h-il-toro">Il Toro</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A cheap close-range shotty. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Simply put, Il Toro is one of the strongest guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-million-arc-raiders-players-wiped-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> purely because it is a shotgun. It doesn’t matter if its range is shorter than most or if it can be slow to fire compared to the likes of the Volcano; the fact of the matter is that at close range, Il Toro is king.</p>



<p>If you’re a raider who enjoys the PvP life, you’ve probably used one before, but if you haven’t, get your hands on one now. They’re incredibly cheap to craft, and it’s one of the easier Blueprints to get your hands on. </p>



<h3 id="h-kettle">Kettle</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The free loadout king. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>People seem to love or hate the Kettle, but it’s a little more nuanced than that. This single-fire Assault Rifle is again one of the earliest guns you’ll get in ARC Raiders, but at face value, it has low damage output, a very slow reload, and not even the best accuracy.</p>







<p>So why is it one of the best guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-pvp-heavy-map-just-got-more-intense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, then? Well, it can be fired fast, very fast. Although it’s not full-auto, the bullets will fire pretty much as quickly as you can pull the trigger, meaning it can even outclass some SMGs at close range. If you’re running a free loadout and get a Kettle, know that it’s the best chance you have of making it back to Speranza.</p>



<h3 id="h-renegade">Renegade</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The best long-range weapon in the game. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-is-offering-a-free-gift-for-crossing-12-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> isn’t all about close-range, as sometimes it’s best to keep your distance. If you find yourself picking enemies off from afar, then there’s no better gun to do it with than the Renegade. </p>



<p>Unlike the Ferro, the Renegade is a bolt-action Rifle that stores more than one bullet in the chamber, meaning you can rattle off shots one after another with ease. It might do less damage than other Rifles in the game, but that fire rate more than makes up for it.</p>



<h3 id="h-bobcat">Bobcat</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A handheld shredder. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Of all the guns on the list, the Bobcat is probably the most sought-after. The Epic-rarity SMG is pretty much just a souped-up Stitcher, with its improved fire-rate being the key difference. </p>



<p>Of course, there’s the elephant in the room—finding its Blueprint. Given its rarity, you’ll have to put a bit of work into making the gun a regular in your Stash, but if you’re interested in dominating PvP, then it’s well worth the effort.</p>



<h3 id="h-volcano">Volcano</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A semi-auto beast. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you enjoy Il Toro, then you’ll love the Volcano. For all of the former’s shortcomings, the Volcano makes up for them. A quicker fire-rate and higher damage make the semi-automatic Shotgun the champion of close-range combat.</p>



<p>However, there’s one major caveat—get a magazine mod on it as soon as possible. Thanks to the increased fire-rate and the base magazine size of four, you’ll find the barrel running dry much quicker than you’d like.</p>



<h3 id="h-venator">Venator</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The only downside is its magazine size. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’re probably seeing a Pistol and doubting that it’s one of the best guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trigger-nade-nerf-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, but it’s here for very good reason. The Venator is a favourite for many raiders out there, and for good reason, too.</p>



<p>This lightweight Pistol packs a serious punch, both thanks to its semi-auto fire-rate and due to the fact that it fires two bullets per trigger press. With that in mind, it melts through ammo, so you’ll want a fair bit of Medium Ammo in your pack. Level this bad boy up to Rank 4—you’ll never look back.</p>



<h2 id="h-complete-arc-raiders-guns-tier-list-all-guns-ranked">Complete ARC Raiders Guns Tier List—All Guns, Ranked</h2>



<p><strong>There are 21 guns in ARC Raiders right now, but only five of them make it into the S-Tier ranking. </strong></p>



<p>Here is the complete ARC Raiders gun tier list, with S representing the best in class, and D showcasing the downright rotten.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Tier</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Gun Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">S</td><td data-align="center">Anvil<br>Venator<br>Renegade<br>Bobcat<br>Vulcano</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">A</td><td data-align="center">Il Toro<br>Stitcher<br>Tempest<br>Kettle<br>Bettina<br>Ferro</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">B</td><td data-align="center">Osprey<br>Aphelion<br>Torrente<br>Jupiter<br>Burietta<br>Arpeggio</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">C</td><td data-align="center">Rattler<br>Hullcracker<br>Equalizer</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">D</td><td data-align="center">Hairpin</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
