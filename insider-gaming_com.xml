<p>Fortnite devs revealed in a new post that the Chapter 7 launch featured 10.5 million players and over 3 million tuned in across livestream platforms. </p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 for Fortnite is already live, introducing players to a brand new island where the battle bus has been destroyed, and players have been tasked to collect the missing parts. Before Chapter 7 launched, Fortnite held a Zero Hour event that brought swarms of players to the title. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-launch-had-over-3-million-players-tuned-in">Fortnite Chapter 7 Launch Had Over 3 Million Players Tuned In</h2>



<p>The announcement of the new player stats comes from Fortnite’s post on <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1994855116869116102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The post states, “Absolute Cinema: 10.5M of you joined us in-game for Zero Hour, and 3M+ tuned in across livestream platforms!” Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Zero Hour event, bringing millions of players, wasn’t a surprise as it featured a jam-packed event filled with collaborations. We also saw the likes of Playboi Carti, Hatsune Miku, and more. The end also featured an Avengers: Endgame type of event, where so many past collabs of Fortnite returned.</p>



<p>For those wondering about the new chapter, Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 introduced a brand new map called Golden Coast. You have to reach this map by using Storm Surf, as the Battle Bus is out of commission. The update also introduced new gameplay features, including the addition of self-revive, drivable reboot vans, turning into bosses, and more. </p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is reportedly looking to add a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-getting-gulag-mechanic-similar-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone-style Gulag mechanic</a>. Fortnite featured Quentin Tarantino’s ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dream’ Kill Bill chapter</a> last month.

<p>GTA 6 has the eyes of the world on it, from players to developers and publishers. It’s the biggest video game ever, and there’s no doubt about this. It’s been two years since Rockstar Games dropped a sacred piece of history on our laps with the GTA 6 reveal trailer, and no one’s been the same since.</p>



<p>The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> trailer debuted nearly two years to the day on December 5. Rockstar actually announced the trailer’s launch several days in advance, and it meant that everyone was locked in. We’re coming up to the trailer’s second anniversary, and it’s a moment of reflection on a long journey.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-trailer-1-turns-2-in-december">GTA 6 Trailer 1 Turns 2 In December</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Our time will all come. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s every chance Rockstar Games was going to drop GTA 6’s first trailer without warning. However, a leak beforehand forced Rockstar’s hand, and the company revealed the first trailer’s date in advance.</p>







<p>Vice City has never looked better than it did in Trailer 1. We also got our first glimpse into the mysterious new characters of Lucia and Jason. Eventually, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-2-is-live-featuring-jason-and-lucia/">GTA Trailer 2</a> <em>was </em>shadow-dropped, but it’s been two years since the record-breaking first trailer, and it’s incredible how little has been shown from the full game since—such as any discernible, official gameplay footage (not the leaks). </p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-1-allegedly-becomes-number-one-youtube-trailer-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 allegedly became the number one YouTube trailer of all time</a>.</p>



<p>We continue to wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-3-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Trailer 3</a>, and it’s amazing how ravenous the community becomes when so much as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-video-in-development-grand-theft-auto-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short in-development video of GTA 6</a> appears online!</p>



<p>The latest GTA 6 delay means it’ll be close to three years since Trailer 1 was announced. If you fancy a quick reminder of what’s coming, or feel a mini-wave of nostalgia close to Christmas, check out Grand Theft Auto 6’s reveal trailer here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 developers have made a very cryptic post that teases a new update for December 2025, which also falls during the game’s fifth anniversary. </p>



<p>Recently, CD Projekt Red provided us with some information on how they are laying the foundation for Cyberpunk 2, with plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-adds-50-new-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase the dev team</a> for the game by a tremendous amount by 2027. However, right now we are looking at the original title, Cyberpunk 2077, which seems to be getting more content 5 years after release. </p>



<h2 id="h-could-cyberpunk-2077-get-update-2-4-in-december-2025">Could Cyberpunk 2077 Get Update 2.4 in December 2025?</h2>



<p>No concrete details were revealed about Cyberpunk 2077’s new update in their latest post on <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1995500633277755416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter); however, they did mention some dates in cryptic messages for players to look out for. The new post includes the words “SECURE COMMS CHANNEL ESTABLISHED. STANDBY FOR INCOMING PRIORITY TRANSMISSION…” The post also includes an image of a calendar that lists Cyberpunk 2077 for December 10, Solomon Reed for December 12, and Songbird for December 29. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>SECURE COMMS CHANNEL ESTABLISHED. <br>STANDBY FOR INCOMING PRIORITY TRANSMISSION…</p><p>CYBERPUNK 2077 — 10.12</p><p>REED, SOLOMON — 12.12</p><p>SONG, SO MI — 29.12</p><p>END OF TRANSMISSION. <a href="https://t.co/3PcagdOjlt">pic.twitter.com/3PcagdOjlt</a></p></div>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1995500633277755416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>There are no other details in the post, and all players can do right now is wait for these dates to find out for sure what the Cyberpunk 2077 devs are cooking up. The game’s fifth anniversary arrives on December 10, 2025, so there’s a chance we’ll learn more on or before that date. Many players have been anticipating the announcement of update 2.4 for Cyberpunk 2077, which might introduce new features and content, and there’s a chance this is it. </p>



<p>In other news, Cyberpunk 2077 recently reached a huge new sales milestone, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-hits-new-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing 35 million copies sold</a>. Additionally, Cyberpunk 2 could feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2-could-feature-online-multiplayer-new-job-listing-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online multiplayer</a> according to a new job listing.

<p>Rockstar Games promised everyone a definitive Red Dead Redemption Remastered upgrade for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 consoles, and the release date is a defining day.</p>



<p>Recency bias would cause most people to pick Red Dead Redemption 2 as their favorite game. But many underestimate the impact and power of the original RDR story and gameplay. Yes, RDR 2 provided substantial upgrades, but the first game still has a certain charm that makes it worth replaying even now.</p>







<p>If RDR is something you want to play or you’ve never tried, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-owners-on-last-gen-consoles-are-eligible-for-free-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption Remastered upgrade</a> release date for all modern hardware should interest you.</p>

<p><strong>The Red Dead Redemption Remastered Upgrade for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and even Netflix, iOS, and Android launches on December 2.</strong></p>



<p>It’s an early Christmas present for all Red Dead Redemption fans. Rockstar Games might be busy with GTA 6, but the team is big enough to handle extra goodies—such as the remastered upgrade.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-red-dead-redemption-remastered-upgrade">How To Play Red Dead Redemption Remastered Upgrade</h2>



<p><strong>You need to own a copy of Red Dead Redemption Remastered to experience the free revamp for modern-day consoles and platforms, a <strong>GTA+ subscription,</strong>&nbsp;or download it via PlayStation Plus on December 2.</strong></p>



<p>On the one hand, the upgrade is free. Conversely, it’s only free if you already own Red Dead Redemption Remastered through one of the stated means.</p>



<p>Here’s what Rockstar says about the upgrade:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Current owners on PS4, Nintendo Switch, or the digital backward compatible version on Xbox One will be able to upgrade digitally for free. Anyone who owns the PS4 version can utilize previous PS4 save data to pick up where they left off, and Switch 2 players can continue with their previous save data from the previous Nintendo Switch console.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you are looking forward to playing the RDR upgrade, it includes the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>60 FPS.</li>



<li>Enhanced image quality.</li>



<li>HDR support enabled.</li>



<li>4K capabilities.</li>



<li>Nintendo Switch 2 owners get DLSS, HDR, mouse controls, and 60 FPS at high resolution.</li>



<li>Undead Nightmare DLC.</li>
</ul>
