<p>Remedy Entertainment, the creator of Alan Wake 2, released its financial results today, revealing that the game has sold over 2 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remedy revealed what actions it took in the second half of 2024 to help Alan Wake 2 reach the milestone of 2 million copies sold. The developers first released The Lake House expansion in October, which received a positive reception. In addition, players received a physical retail release for Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few months later, the developers provided a PlayStation 5 Pro update for the game, alongside other updates to improve the game’s quality across all platforms. Lastly, they released a physical Collectors Edition for enthusiasts in partnership with Limited Run Games. Thanks to these actions, Alan Wake 2 enjoyed long-term sales and recouped the costs incurred. Remedy “has started to accrue royalties” from the game’s sales towards the end of 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remedy also outlined <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=de036915-53b0-4bfc-8564-7ce4872914e5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its plans</a> for Alan Wake and Control, which are linked through the Remedy Connected Universe. The upcoming games in these franchises will be self-published, and growing and expanding them is the key focus for their future. The developers aim to “be a highly regarded creative studio with sustainable, significant commercial success” by the end of 2030.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-1896-developer-is-laying-off-15-of-its-work-force.1106607/</guid>

<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 developer Crytek announced today that the company will be laying off around 15% of its 400 employees.</p>



<p>Crytek revealed in a post on <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> that it is the latest studio in the industry to lay off employees due to “unfavourable market dynamics.” The developer will lay off around 60 employees across the “development teams and shared services.” The developer also revealed that since the next Crysis game was put on hold in Q3 2024, they are trying to move its workforce to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>



<p>Crytek stated that layoffs would be “inevitable” if the company had to move forward. They had already tried reducing costs and “cutting operating expenses,” but to no avail. To help the affected employees, the Hunt: Showdown developer will provide them with “severance packages and career assistance services”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crytek believes that Hunt Showdown: 1896 offers a “very strong gaming service.” Therefore, they are “fully committed to its operation” and will continue to “expand and evolve” the game with new content. The focus on their engine, Cryengine, will also continue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crytek is the latest studio to lose employees in 2025. We have already seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-suffers-more-layoffs-as-suicide-squad-support-winds-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-holds-more-layoffs-across-multiple-departments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-cuts-entire-behavior-development-team-as-part-of-new-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unity</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-layoffs-memo-to-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a>, and others lay off employees this year, and it seems this trend isn’t going to stop soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What do you think about Crytek’s decision to lay off 15% of its employees?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
