<p>Bungie has officially revealed Marathon, uncovering the core gameplay loop, operating model, and narrative concept. It’s a somewhat traditional extraction shooter that’s going to try to disrupt the genre by introducing unique social mechanics and an original art style that has started turning heads in the gaming space.</p>



<p>However, many have already written off Marathon, pointing out glaring flaws in the game’s reveal and the news and rumours that followed. It’s bold enough to try breaking into the extraction genre, but to do it with so many risky choices sitting front-and-centre is downright ballsy – or foolish.</p>



<p>Has Bungie already done everything wrong with Marathon?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-marathon">What’s Wrong with Marathon?</h2>



<p>As a <strong>game</strong>, Marathon looks just fine. The combat mechanics look entertaining, the impressions built off preview sessions are strong, and it’s backed by Bungie, a big-name, big-budget studio. But that’s the tip of the iceberg, and when you start digging deeper, the flaws surface quite rapidly.</p>



<p>Firstly, extraction shooters <strong>rarely survive</strong> in the open market. Escape from Tarkov is the only extraction game to have remained consistent over the years, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-will-compete-with-other-extraction-shooters-by-not-competing-interview/">Russian shooter’s market cap</a> is nothing short of overwhelming for newcomers.</p>



<p>It can also be argued that Bungie is late to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-explains-why-marathon-is-an-extraction-shooter/">the extraction shooter boom</a> with Marathon, but other developers are still <strong>trying </strong>to crack that nut. It’s battle royale games all over again, but more of <strong>those </strong>have survived their uptick than the smattering of extraction shooters that appeared in recent years.</p>



<p>It was revealed that Marathon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-marathon-be-free-to-play-pricing-explained/">will be a premium title</a> with a moderate price tag, which many have suggested is the wrong foot forward for Bungie. It has been said that ‘a game like this’ should be free-to-play with microtransaction support, and I’m inclined to agree. It’s hard to land sales for a game like this, given that it’s a niche genre and a never-before-seen IP (if we ignore the original game that debuted in 1994).</p>

</p></figure>







<p>On the subject of release, Marathon is contending with another big-budget first-person shooter, releasing on <strong>the same day as Borderlands 4</strong>. That game already has millions of fans around the world, and Borderlands is nothing if not loaded with quirks and a similarly unique art style, which could mean it’ll already outpace Marathon with ease.</p>



<p>The cacophony of mechanics and features wrapped up in Marathon are great, but it’s an overly complex way to present the extraction shooter genre, which at heart, is quite simple. You load up, you run a map, and you leave again – that’s it. Despite claiming to be super accessible, Marathon might be doing the opposite by putting up a convoluted learning curve.</p>



<p>With <strong>that </strong>being said, it’s too much of an arcade game for the hardcore extraction fans, and it’s likely too challenging for arcade shooter fans, so what exactly is Marathon’s target market? </p>



<p>I’m all game to give it a try, and I’ll go in with an open mind, but I’m worried about Marathon. It has been years in development at Bungie, and I just don’t want the team to fall flat with the project when it hits the market.</p>



<p>We’ll know more soon – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-access-marathon-alpha-closed-guide/">the closed alpha is on the way</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cod-devs-warzone-starting-point-verdansk-revival/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Verdansk has been turning heads since it returned to Call of Duty: Warzone almost two weeks ago. It saw player counts and viewership figures skyrocket to highs that hadn’t been seen for years, and it became the talk of the town far and wide. It was playing heavily into the nostalgia stakes, but that’s just what Warzone needed.</p>



<p>In a follow-up interview after the release of Verdansk (which hasn’t been seen since 2021), Activision’s developers spoke about the future of the battle royale platform. They’re insistent that Verdansk’s immediate success is ‘the starting point’ for a revival (or evolution) of Warzone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-inevitable-evolution">Inevitable Evolution</h2>



<p>Warzone was in a sticky spot before Verdansk came along. The game was tired, plagued by cheaters, and relatively unstable, but the sheer nostalgia value alone of Verdansk was enough to bring millions of players back. Activision went <strong>hard </strong>on the marketing campaign to make sure everyone knew the iconic map was coming back, and it has been a smash hit return thus far.</p>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, Pete Actipis, Raven Software’s game director working on Warzone, explained how this is the kick-off point for a grand evolution:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It has been pretty successful, and I think you can tell in the experience, right?</p>



<p>Like Etienne (Pouliot) said, we recreated Verdansk to be the best experience possible. But then we didn’t stop there.</p>



<p><strong>This is the starting point</strong>. It is not an anomaly for where Warzone is going.</p>



<p>We were very careful with crafting this experience this season, and the data is showing us that <strong>it’s been really successful and we just hope to keep that momentum going </strong>into the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also spoke about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battle-royale-multiplayer-casual-mode-where/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale Casual</a>, a new mode added alongside Verdansk that gives players a much lighter experience in Warzone. It’s not just here to stay but to <strong>grow </strong>as a mode:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The nice thing about this is, this is the first (revision) of it. It just went live and we’re going to look at the data, we’re going to evolve it over time to make sure it retains the design principles and spirit that we wanted it to have.</p>



<p>It’s still pretty new right now. I think it’s still giving players what they need in it right now, and we’ll just keep monitoring and evolving it. It’s a fun mode.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There was talk in the interview about the future of Verdansk’s narratives, which some eagle-eyed players have started picking up clues about in recent days. There is plenty of lore surrounding Verdansk, which unravelled across a couple of iterations a few years ago.</p>

<p>Verdansk returning to Warzone is a massive success story, but there is always the fear that the map will be removed or replaced in the rotation. Raven Software alleviated those concerns. </p>



<p>Caldera replaced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-prison-safe-locations-in-warzone-verdansk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> as the primary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/corsair-warzone-range-single-keycap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> map in December 2021 after a remarkable run that almost lasted two years. Since then, battle royale maps have typically been replaced after two years. For example, Caldera and Urzikstan survived two years before being shut down. </p>



<p>Al Mazrah was a rare exception and only made it one year. Verdansk is an interesting case, as the map launched in April, which is deep into the Black Ops 6 life cycle.<span> So, since&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-black-ops-7-details-have-been-leaked-by-a-playtester/" target="_blank">Black Ops 7</a>&nbsp;is coming soon, fans don’t know what that me</span>ans for Verdansk’s future. </p>

<p><strong>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Raven Software’s Warzone game director, Pete Actipis, confirmed that Verdansk will remain in Warzone throughout 2025. </strong></p>



<p>“We brought Verdansk back for a reason. It wasn’t just to bring it back for a season and kind of say goodbye to it again,” Actipis said. “A lot of effort went into it. So for the time being, Verdansk is sticking around, and this is just the beginning of the Verdansk 2025 journey, and then we’ll see how things go from there.”</p>



<p>This will be reassuring news to fans who have enjoyed Verdansk so far, and the success is undeniable. Verdansk’s return sparked a staggering&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-verdansk-return-call-of-dutys-player-count-jumps-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200% increase</a>&nbsp;in player count.&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision</a>&nbsp;reportedly took notice and is pleased with the positive results from the update, and Raven Software expressed similar optimism. </p>

<p>The devs plan to continue supporting Verdansk this year, and fans will not have to wait much longer for the next major update.
