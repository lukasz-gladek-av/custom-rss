<p>We’ve heard about Mortal Kombat content heading to Fortnite already. However, a new leak has pulled back the bloody curtain to reveal that March 28 potentially brings emotes, pickaxes, and skins to finish us (or anyone).</p>



<p>There was a time when I used to be shocked by Fortnite’s collaborations. It went out the window quickly once the likes of Kratos and Halo started dropping into Tilted Towers. Now, anyone who’s anyone can make an appearance—check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sabrina-carpenter-might-be-the-next-playable-fortnite-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a> dialog if you don’t believe me. </p>



<p>But there’s something surreal about the brutal nature of Mortal Kombat entering a new realm. Alas, after initial talk of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-mortal-kombat-mythics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat content turning up for a fight in Fortnite</a>, it’s reportedly the case.</p>

<p>Renowned leaker <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a> has dropped a finishing blow on the MK and Fortnite conversation. They posted to their official X channel about the nature of the content coming to the battle royale shooter.</p>



<p>They provided a bullet-point list outlining some of the key inclusions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Scorpion (MK3) Skin: 1.500 vbucks</li>



<li>Kitana (MK3) Skin: 1500 vbucks</li>



<li>Raiden (MK3) Skin: 1500 vbucks</li>



<li>Scorpion’s Flame Skull backbling: 800 bucks</li>



<li>Raiden’s Amulet backbling: 400 vbucks#</li>



<li>Raiden’s Staff pickaxe: 800 bucks </li>



<li>Scorpion’s Katana Duo pickaxe: included with the backbling</li>



<li>Kitana’s Steel Fan pickaxe: 800 bucks</li>



<li>Kitana’s Fan Bear: included with the pickaxe</li>



<li>Kitana’s Fan Fado emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>FLAWLESS VICTORY emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Toasty! emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Test your strength emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Guiding Staff Mark emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Raiden’s Victory emote: 300 bucks</li>
</ul>



<p>They finish by saying to expect the items on <strong>March 28</strong>. You can check out the full message here.</p>

<p>This may be the beginning of a fun and fatal partnership. Take the leaks with the usual punch of salt, but there’s every chance you can start preparing your best kombos to drop onto unsuspecting Fortnite players.</p>



<p>The Mortal Kombat collab isn’t the only rumored to be in the works: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-collaborating-with-dragon-ball-daima-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Daima</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-getting-a-kendrick-lamar-emote-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick Lamar</a> might be boarding the bus soon enough.</p>

<p>Fortnite might have another Dragon Ball collaboration in the works, and this time, it’s with the latest Daima series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As revealed by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1904609271561805956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Loolo_WRLD</a> on X (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-reportedly-getting-dragon-ball-daima-skins-collaboration-crossover-item-shop-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), “an ID related to a new Dragon Ball wave” has been spotted in the Fortnite files, and it seems it could hint at new Daima skins. Reliable leaker Spheshal_Nick has added more information, stating that he has also recently heard about this collaboration. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Daima is the latest addition to the popular anime franchise, and players would love to see characters from the series come to Fortnite Island. Daima features some of the most hyped characters of the series, such as Vegeta Super Saiyan 3 and Goku Super Saiyan 4. It also has new fan-favourite characters like Glorio, the Tamagamis, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has already collaborated with Dragon Ball in the past, with skins for Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Beerus, Goku Black, Piccolo, Cell, Bulma, Trunks, Android 17, Android 18 and Frieza present in the game. These characters also come with their own set of accessories and emotes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the cosmetics, Fortnite also had notable additions to gameplay for the Dragon Ball collaborations, including the Kamehameha and Nimbus Cloud (Kintoun) items in Battle Royale. They had also introduced a Dragon Ball Adventure Island where players could explore iconic locations from the series. It will be interesting to see if Fortnite receives additional themed gameplay for the alleged Daima collab.&nbsp;</p>
