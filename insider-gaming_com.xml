<p>Developer 34BigThings has released a new gameplay trailer for the upcoming Carmageddon: Rogue Shift.</p>



<p>Announced back in early <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/carmageddon-is-back-with-carmageddon-rogue-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 2025</a>, Carmageddon: Rogue Shit releases on February 6 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>







<p><strong>“Carmageddon smashes back with brutal roguelite vehicular‑combat mayhem,”</strong> the game’s description reads. <strong>“Adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on post‑apocalyptic zombie hordes. The legacy lives on, reinvented and unforgiving.”</strong></p>



<p>The game sees players go through a roguelite campaign with branching event maps, dynamic challenges and permanent progression between runs. There will be 15 upgradeable vehicles that range from tanks to hot rods with 13 weapon classes and over 80 perks to equip to your vehicle.</p>







<p>With it being a roguelite game, 34BigThings say that every run through the campaign will offer a “unique journey through a randomly generated graph.” There will also be branching patches, a variety of objections, and dynamic time of day and weather to make sure each run is different.</p>



<p>You can check out the gameplay trailer for yourself, below, and leave your thoughts down in the comments and over at the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Modding is a huge part of gaming, and instead of concentrating on the default content, Hypixel Studios encourages the community to download and install the best Hytale mods to make the game even more wild.</p>



<p>Some games actively discourage modding and do their best to avoid having the base game assets be manipulated in any way. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> is the complete polar opposite. Hytale wants you to mod, it wants you to create mods; whatever funky ideas are flowing around in your brainwaves need to be used to create fun and original content.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to mess around with Hytale and implement the best mods to make the game easier, better, or even more entertaining, this guide has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-8-top-hytale-mods-to-install">8 Top Hytale Mods To Install</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios and CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hytale has partnered up with <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CurseForge</a> to deliver official mods. The game’s long-awaited launch was accompanied by well over 80 mods to download and install. Insider Gaming has picked out our favorite ones so far, and keep checking back as the list is updated with new mods to add. </p>



<h3 id="h-advanced-item-info">Advanced Item Info</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is comfortably one of the most (if not <em>the </em>most) downloaded Hytale mods—and for obvious reasons. It tells you much more information about the items and materials you pick up. There’s a certain level of ambiguity when it comes to survival games about the resources you collect, leaving it up to you to decide what they’re for, or discover their main purpose(s). This mod eliminates a lot of the mystery and gets straight to the point.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/advanced-item-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Advanced Item Info mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-ymmersive-foliage">Ymmersive Foliage</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hypixel Studios and founder Simon Collins-Laflamme have been hard on themselves at times in the build-up to launch. It’s in early access, and the team has said that it needs a lot of work. It’s probably true, but the game’s early access launch looked spectacular. However, if you want to spruce and juice up the environment with extra color, depth, and detail, the Ymmersive Foliage mode does that in Hytale.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/ymmersive-foliage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Ymmersive Foliage mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-lucky-mining">Lucky Mining</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>A good way to think about this mod is like hacking away at a material in Fortnite. You get rewarded for consecutive good hits, and it’s kind of the same here. If you keep mining the same material in a row—Ores, in this case—you get more of it. It can make the grind easier, and stock up your inventory with enough Ore to start a new country.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/lucky-mining" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Lucky Mining mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-yung-s-hydungeons">YUNG’s HyDungeons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>This mod might not be for beginners, but if you fancy a devious dungeon-based challenge and upgrade, consider checking out the YUNG’s HyDungeons mod. It adds new dungeons with “procedurally generated dungeon instances.” You do need to hit 100 Memories first, but there will come a point where you can enjoy this fabulous mod.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/yungs-hydungeons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the YUNG’s HyDungeons mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-thorium-furnaces">Thorium Furnaces</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes, a good quality-of-life feature can go a long way. It doesn’t have to be a wild mod that breaks the game. The Thorium Furnaces mode adds 11 new furnaces, and they speed up the smelting process, saving a lot of time. The rarer the furnace, the faster it gets the job done, allowing you to go exploring quicker.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/thorium-furnaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Thorium Furnaces mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-wan-s-wonder-weapons">Wan’s Wonder Weapons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you are after a wild mod that is just plain fun, look no further than Wan’s Wonder Weapons. When you think of ‘Wonder Weapons,’ you might think of Call of Duty’s Ray Gun, but here, you get special weapons like the Maelstrom anchor, Frostburn sword, or Chromatic Cleaver—the final one looking like it was pulled straight from a unicorn. If a pickaxe or regular sword just isn’t cutting it, download and get yourself Wan’s Wonder Weapons.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/wans-wonder-weapons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Wan’s Wonder Weapons mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-ymmersive-melodies">Ymmersive Melodies</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can “Annoy your friends with custom melodies” using the Ymmersive Melodies mod in Hytale. Does more need to be said? If you’re <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-invite-friends-join-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing with friends in Hytale</a>, why wouldn’t you want to upload custom melodies to make them want to throw Wild Berries or Dark Feathers at you?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/ymmersive-melodies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Ymmersive Melodies mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-wayback-charm">Wayback Charm</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As we come to the home stretch, it makes sense to end with a mod that aptly takes you home. CurseForge says this about the mod: “The Wayback Charm is a magical tool that can help you find your way back home. Simply press the use key (F) while holding the charm, and you will be teleported to the nearest respawn point. Respawn points can be created using blocks like beds. If you do not have a respawn location, or the respawn location is considered invalid, you will be sent to the world spawn.” Sounds good, right?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/wayback-charm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Wayback Charm mod here.</a></p>



<p>Have your say on Hytale modding. Have you found any must-have lists that have been left off this list? If so, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let the staff know, as the mod might end up on this list!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Meta is scaling back its gaming presence with a round of layoffs. A report on Monday from the New York Times said that the company was set to let go roughly 10% of staff from the Reality Labs side of the company. </p>



<p>One day later, and it appears <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that those layoffs</a> have begun with a number of studios being hit. </p>







<p>Reality Labs, if you didn’t know, houses Meta’s Oculus Studios division. Oculus Studios is responsible for managing the various first party studios and teams that develop games for the Meta Quest VR headsets.</p>



<p>Two studios known to be impacted by the layoffs are Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games. In a <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Twitter</a>, designer Andy Gentile revealed that he had been let go. In his post, Gentile added that <strong>“It appears the entire Twisted Pixel games studio has been shut down. Sanzaru Games too.”</strong></p>



<p>Over on LinkedIn, Sanzaru senior level designer Ray West <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">also confirmed that Sanzaru</a>, along with “several Meta game studios” were shut down.</p>



<p><strong>“It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I’m really glad to have gotten to know everyone there,”</strong> he said.</p>







<p>Prior to the layoffs and studio closures, Twisted Pixel Games recently released Deadpool VR for Meta Quest 3. For Sanzaru, they developed the highly regarded Asgard’s Wrath and Asgard’s Wrath 2.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Meta for comment on how many jobs were lost and all of the studios hit as part of these layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>
