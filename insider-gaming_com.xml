<p>Pokémon is set to venture into a new generation following the reveal of Gen 10, Pokémon Winds and Waves, and, naturally, questions are emerging on whether players with a Nintendo Switch 1 will be able to play.</p>



<p>Revealed as part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Day, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the franchise, Pokémon Winds and Waves is the landmark tenth generation of the beloved franchise, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/game-freak/" id="95185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Freak</a> once again handling development.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for details on whether Winds and Waves will be available on the original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>

<p><strong>No, Pokémon</strong> <strong>Winds and Waves will not be available on the original Nintendo Switch console, with confirmation already available that it won’t be on the old-gen console.</strong></p>



<p>This should not come as a surprise, as Pokémon Pokopia is also not available on the original Nintendo Switch, although it can be played online with a friend who has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> via the GameShare feature.</p>

</ul>



<p>By the time Pokémon Winds and Waves releases in 2027, Nintendo will be several years deep into the next generation of console, and the original Switch will be slowly eased out of releases. </p>



<p>As the year progresses, you should expect to see more and more games not available on the original Switch, as Nintendo jumps into the next era.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-will-pokemon-winds-amp-waves-be-available-on">What Platforms Will Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Be Available On?</h2>



<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>Company has announced that Pokémon</strong> <strong>Winds and Waves will be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, developed by Game Freak.</strong></p>



<p>Pokémon titles have largely always been exclusive to Nintendo platforms, with a few exceptions for mobile releases. As such, it’s not surprising to see Winds and Waves limited to Switch 2.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/free-pokemon-legends-z-a-update-reveals-mega-garchomp-z-at-pokemon-presents-2026/" id="180871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Finally Adds Mega Garchomp Z</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Further details on Pokémon Winds and Waves exclusivity status on Switch 2 are expected in the months ahead, with it expected that the system requirements of the game will be much more powerful than the original console could handle.</p>



<p>Pokémon had a shaky release with Scarlet and Violet, which did not perform well on the original Switch console at launch, and from what’s been shown from Winds and Waves so far, the performance demands are significantly higher.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" id="177979">Bluepoint Studio</a> was recently shut down by Sony. A new report sheds some light on the studio’s closure, including the desire to remake Bloodborne and why that didn’t come to fruition.</p>



<p>The new report comes from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier of Bloomberg.</a> It was noted that following the cancellation of the live-service God of War game in January 2025, Sony was working closely with the studio to determine their next project. Also in early 2025, there was a pitch to remake Bloodborne. However, while they were told the numbers made sense, people familiar with the situation stated that FromSoftware didn’t want it to happen.</p>







<h2 id="h-bluepoint-studio-pitched-other-ideas">Bluepoint Studio Pitched Other Ideas</h2>



<p>The report also notes that Bluepoint pitched other PlayStation studios on developing new projects. One idea was a Ghost of Tsushima spinoff, but it was not approved. Other studios were said to be wary of allocating substantial resources to another team’s project, according to sources familiar with the situation.</p>



<p>It was also noted that when the God of War remake trilogy was announced without Bluepoint involved, some within the studio grew uneasy. One week later, it was announced that the studio was being shut down.</p>
