<p>Mythical Island is the first proper Pokémon TCG Pocket mini-set since the title’s launch. It brings with it the second-ever booster pack for players to pull new cards, and we know its release date, as well as a bunch of cards revealed for the set.</p>



<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next expansion leaks</a> continue to be true. We heard weeks ago a mini-set was scheduled for the third week in December, and now we know what it is. Pokémon TCG Pocket Mythical Island is a fully-fledged mini-set not quite on the scale of Genetic Apex, but it’s easily the most significant collection of cards—outside of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-promo-a-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promo A</a> series.</p>



<p>The Mythical Island debut trailer gave us a huge glimpse into the set and what to expect.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Just look at it. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Mythical Island set launches on Dec. 17.</strong></p>



<p>No official release time was given in the debut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUYHC2ReohA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island trailer</a>. So, expect a midnight rollout for the set in your region. Once it’s live, select the new booster pack, start ripping them open, and get building the newest set in Pocket.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-open-mythical-island-packs-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island">How to Open Mythical Island Packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island</h2>



<p>We don’t know for sure, but I imagine once Mythical Island is live, the <strong>advertised packs on the home page are going to change to reflect the new set</strong>. Meaning, you can press on any of the advertised Mythical Island packs, and it takes you straight to them.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if it still shows Genetic Apex packs on the home screen once the new set launches, try this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the home screen.</li>



<li>Press on any of the Genetic Apex packs to take you to the pack screen.</li>



<li>Choose “Select other booster packs” in the bottom-right corner to presumably choose Mythical Island.</li>



<li>Now, open Mythical Island packs!</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s hard to know fully what Pokémon TCG Pocket looks like when Mythical Island launches, so we’ll update this once we have a clearer indication.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-cards-in-mythical-island-set-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How Many Cards in Mythical Island Set in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>NetEase hasn’t divulged how many cards are coming in Mythical Island, but thanks to the debut trailer, we’ve identified at least <strong>15 new cards coming in the set</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s every card we think we’ve spotted in Mythical Island so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Aerodactyl ex</li>



<li>Blue (Supporter Card)</li>



<li>Dedenne (Full Art)</li>



<li>Dhelmise</li>



<li>Exeggcute</li>



<li>Larvesta</li>



<li>Leaf (Supporter Card)</li>



<li>Magmar</li>



<li>Marshadow (Full Art)</li>



<li>Mew ex</li>



<li>Morelull</li>



<li>Pikachu</li>



<li>Snivy</li>



<li>Tauros</li>



<li>Vaporean (Full Art)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-rarest-cards-in-mythical-island-set-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Rarest Cards in Mythical Island Set in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>So far, <strong>Dedenne, Marshadow, and Vaporean Full Art</strong> cards, along with <strong>Mew ex</strong> and <strong>Aerodactyl ex</strong>, are the rarest cards we’ve seen in the Mythical Island set.</p>



<p>More could still be announced, and the full set is likely keeping some secrets under its belt. We can all find out together once Mythical Island is live!</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s update Ver.2006.005.003.004.003 is live now. It allows players to access all stages when playing couch coop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, when players tried to play local multiplayer in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, they were restricted to one stage, The Hyperbolic Time Chamber. After the new patch, you can fight against your friends in all of the game’s 12 stages, allowing you to experience high-speed 3D battles with beautiful visuals and destructible environments.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-balancing-changes-in-new-sparking-zero-patch">Balancing Changes in New Sparking Zero Patch</h2>



<p>The new Dragon Ball Sparking Zero patch also features several character adjustments; check them out below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Android 19 and Dr. Gero’s amount of stamina and energy absorbed during a successful throw has been changed. Also, Dragon Dash, rapid ascend, and fast descent will consume energy when using these characters.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Cell 2nd can now throw-escape&nbsp;</li>



<li>Cooler’s transformation now recovers an increased amount of stamina.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Giant characters’ power has been reduced, and the time it takes to charge up smash attacks has been increased.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Great Ape Vegeta and Doctor Willow’s maximum health has been reduced.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Super Vegito’s Final Kamehameha has increased energy consumption and damage dealt.</li>



<li>Players can control the trajectory of Son Goku (mini)’s Quick Rush while charging.</li>



<li>Lastly, Mr. Satan’s Present Bomb has increased stiffness after activation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
