<p>GDKP runs are still banned in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/" id="830">World of Warcraft,</a> even if the player base thinks it’s a ridiculous and ineffective ban.</p>



<p>GDKP (Gold Dragon Kill Points) are types of raids in WoW that allow players to bid on loot after boss battles, and even though the highest bidder wins, the gold earned from the bids is then put into a pot and split amongst all players.</p>



<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft-players-want-gdkp-unbanned">World of Warcraft Players Want GDKP Unbanned</h2>



<p><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/in-game-advertising-services-channel-in-burning-crusade-classic-anniversary/2238861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blizzard </a>recently issued a statement on their forums, noting that the policy around GDKP runs has not changed in anniversary Realms in either North America or the EU. However, the statement also claims that players are not restricted from buying or selling game services for in-game, but boosting communities are not permitted.</p>



<p>For the most part, comments on the post suggest that the ban doesn’t actually work, with one user commenting, “Continuing to deny GDKP on Anniversary realms while refusing to admit that the economy is absolutely horrible and the ban has not given the results you claimed it would.”</p>



<p>Then, of course, there are the people who are extra intense about the news, such as one user saying, “Absolutely moronic. Give us back GDKP. Everyone who takes this game semi-seriously wants it back… Give us back GDKP or people will quit!” </p>



<p>Blizzard does remain steadfast in their decision, however. </p>
