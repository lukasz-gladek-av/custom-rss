<p>The setting and time period of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series may have been revealed, according to a new report. Even more so, more information regarding the show’s development has emerged online.</p>



<p>Since 2007, the Assassin’s Creed series of games has been going rather strong, spanning eras of history with action-packed gameplay and gripping story. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ordered-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Netflix announced that it’s working with Ubisoft to develop a live-action Assassin’s Creed series. Multiple ones are apparently in the works, as revealed in the blog from July, but the biggest one just cast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actor Toby Wallace</a> as co-lead. Now, more information on <strong>the show’s setting has reportedly been revealed</strong>, and <strong>it’s one that fans have been asking for for a long time</strong>.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The report comes from <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-set-to-explore-ancient-rome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive from Nexus Point News</a>, which has previously leaked multiple game adaptations like God of War and Elden Ring. In the article, it mentions that sources have said what Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed’s setting will be: <strong>Ancient Rome</strong>. Specifically, <strong>the show is reportedly taking place between 54-68 AD</strong> during Emperor Nero’s reign. Both Nero and his mentor, Seneca, will be featured in the series. Filming is taking place in Italy, so it does line up there, if true. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the report says that Toby Wallace will be part of<strong> an ensemble cast</strong>, meaning there will be <strong>multiple leads</strong>. It’s important to note that <strong>Ubisoft and Netflix have not confirmed this news</strong>, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. Still, Ancient Rome has been asked for by fans for a long time. However, if true, it would mean players would likely not get to play in that time period like they’d hoped to. This would also mean that the show would feature an original story, which is a bit of a risky move. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see how the show shapes up.</p>







<p>What do you think of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed setting? Is Ancient Rome a good fit? If true, are you disappointed to not see it in the games? Is doing an original story worth it? Going with an ensemble cast?
