<p>It has been announced that Crimson Desert, the upcoming open-world action title from Pearl Abyss, has been pushed back to Q1 2026. This news was announced during a recent earnings call and accompanied by a clear explanation.</p>



<p>The team at Pearl Abyss emphasized that the plans to showcase Crimson Desert at Gamescom will remain unchanged. Next week, the game’s open-world build will be rendered playable at Gamescom for the first time, and in September, the same demo will be available to explore at the Tokyo Game Show.</p>



<h2 id="h-unavoidably-delayed">‘Unavoidably Delayed’</h2>



<p>Talking on the delay of Crimson Desert during a recent earnings conference call, the Pearl Abyss team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Currently,&nbsp;<em>Crimson Desert</em>&nbsp;has been in the process of voice-overs, while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release. In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build. And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market.</p>



<p>The launch of&nbsp;<em>Crimson Desert</em>, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations. </p>



<p>We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was then stated that Crimson Desert has been given an ‘internally confirmed’ release window of Q1 2026. There will be a follow-up announcement in due course, unveiling a firmer launch date. It was stressed that Crimson Desert’s release date <strong>will not </strong>be revealed at Gamescom.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that Borderlands is a series famed for insane gun-toting action and explosive sequences. That has become increasingly true with each successive iteration, and 2019’s Borderlands 3, the most recent numbered release in the series, boasted ’87 bazillion guns.’</p>



<p>The number has been refined going into Borderlands 4 by the game’s art director, Adam May. He has claimed that this highly anticipated title will include <strong>30 billion possible guns</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-impossible-numbers">Impossible Numbers</h2>



<p>Borderlands becomes increasingly insane with each new release, but <strong>Borderlands 4 </strong>is heading to new heights with a new band of Vault Hunters, a seamless open world, and <strong>30 billion guns</strong>.</p>



<p>In a new super-sized interview piece <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4?s=09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Epic Games</a>, the Gearbox team uncovered various elements of Borderlands 4. The game’s art director, Adam May, stated that there are more guns than you’d ever believe possible.</p>



<p>This is achievable through procedural generation and by having a staggering base array of weapons right off the bat. From the various categories to the different ‘manufacturers’ iconic to Borderlands, and from the fire modes to the attachments, it’s easy to see how the list can quickly grow.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing how it works.</p>



<p>If you get a rifle and that rifle has one attachment different in the next iteration, that’s two weapons. If it then has a different elemental effect, that’s three. Let’s say you find another with a slightly different scope. That’s four weapons, and you’re still nowhere close to the variable potential of that <strong>one </strong>firearm; that’s how Borderlands 4 can tote these types of numbers.</p>



<p>May explained what goes into the creation of Borderlands 4’s weapons from an artistic perspective:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players have some recognition when they’re picking up a certain manufacturer’s weapon and have a rough idea of how it’s going to function.</p>



<p>It’s a back-and-forth with the design team and art team, making sure that visually things line up with how they’re supposed to work mechanically. If you want a real fast shooting weapon, you shoot for sleeker, more angular, more aggressive-looking shapes. If it’s shooting giant rockets every time, you want something that’s bigger and rounder and more bulbous.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Borderlands 4 will be released on September 12. Do you intend to give it a try and flick through some of those 30 billion guns? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been more than 15 years since League of Legends hit the market, fast becoming the number one MOBA and the world’s leading competitive game. It might seem bizarre to some, but after all this time, Riot Games is preparing to introduce a new WASD-based control scheme, after more than a decade and a half of using a point-and-click operating model.</p>



<p>This news was dropped in a recent update from Riot Games that included information about the future of the game. It was pointed out that this WASD control scheme will be introduced first in <strong>testing</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-these-years-later">All These Years Later</h2>



<p>In a recent 13-minute video shared to discuss the most imminent and important updates to League of Legends, Riot Games lifted the lid on a dramatic test that’ll allow players to use WASD to directly control their Champions for the first time.</p>



<p>The team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve found that a lot of new or returning players struggling with League’s controls early on. Click to move just isn’t the sort of control scheme they’re used to and it puts a lot of people off, including many that we believe would otherwise really love the game.</p>



<p>So, we’re introducing WASD as an alternate control scheme to help get new players to the fun parts of League faster and with less friction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed that WASD for League of Legends has been under development ‘for a while’. It’s all about allowing first-time players to have a more intuitive journey as they try to break into one of the more complex games on the market.</p>



<p>Riot Games endeavours to make both ‘point-and-click’ and WASD movement schemes fully functional across all game modes, including Ranked.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>For ‘the next few patches’, WASD will be introduced to PBE (Public Beta Environment), and it will evolve based on player feedback before drifting to other game modes across the full version of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another union is forming at Blizzard as developers from the company’s story and franchise development (SFD) team have voted in favor of union representation. Announced via the Communication Workers of America (CWA) website, the vote came “either by signing a union authorization card or indicating that they wanted union representation via an online portal.”</p>



<p>All workers will be members of CWA Local 9510 in Orange County, California with Microsoft already recognizing their union.</p>



<p>The union <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will cover those who work</a> on Blizzard’s in-house cinematics, animation, and narrative team who create game trailers, promotional videos, in-game cutscenes, and other narrative content for Blizzard franchises. It becomes the first group of its kind to form a union in the North American game industry.</p>



<p><strong>“After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I’ve seen all the highs and lows. For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability’s been fading,”</strong>&nbsp;Bucky Fisk, a principal editor and member of the organizing committee, said via release.&nbsp;<strong>“With a union, we’re able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone.”</strong></p>



<p>The new union joins the <strong>“nearly 3,000 workers at Microsoft-owned studios who have organized with CWA to build better standards across the video game industry.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“These workers are setting the standard for animation, cinematics, and storytelling across the video game industry, creating the breathtaking cutscenes, trailers, and other narrative content that fans have come to love across all Blizzard franchises. We are excited to have them join our union family,”&nbsp;</strong>CWA Local 9510 president Jason Justice said.</p>



<p>As of publishing, neither Activision-Blizzard nor Microsoft have made an official comment on the union.</p>
