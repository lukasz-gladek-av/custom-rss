<p>Masters of Albion, the new game from long-time developer Peter Molyneux has a release date. On Monday, developer 22cans announced that the game is set to launch on April 22.</p>



<p>The game will be available exclusively on PC via Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-masters-of-albion-is-a-reimagining">Masters of Albion Is A “Reimagining”</h2>



<p>First revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peter-molyneux-masters-of-albion-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a>, Masters of Albion is a <strong>“bold reimagining of the God Game genre.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Mixing strategy with simulation, town management and tower defence, the game takes you into the rich narrative world of Albion,</strong>” the game’s description says. <strong>“Starting in the undeveloped village of Oakridge, players will step into the body of a god, controlling the town and its citizens, building a small business and completing orders for various customers.”</strong></p>







<p>As mentioned, the game comes from Peter Molyneaux, the man credited with creating the Fable franchise, The Movies, Populous, and many more. Back when it was announced, the 66-year-old Molyneux mentioned that Masters of Albion was likely to be his last game because of his age.</p>



<p>In a release announcing the release date, Molyneux said that the new game owes a lot to his prior titles.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>“Masters of Albion is the culmination of my life’s work, a game that owes so much to titles like Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and Fable,”</strong> he said. <strong>“It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map.”</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Paramount Sues Warner Bros. Over Netflix Deal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-sues-warner-bros-over-netflix-deal/</link>
            <guid>1403743</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Paramount continues to put up a fight over the pending sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix. On Wednesday, the company announced it was suing Warner Bros. in a continuation of its attempt at a hostile takeover of the company.</p>



<p>The lawsuit comes just days after Paramount’s latest bid was rejected, again, by Warner Bros. Discover.</p>







<p>According to the lawsuit, Paramount claims that the Warner Bros. Discovery board misled shareholders and concealed financial analysis. In a <a href="https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-provides-update-warner-bros-discovery-shareholders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">letter to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders</a> announcing the suit, Paramount CEO David Ellison said that the company has <strong>“failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its “risk adjustment” of our&nbsp;$30 per share all-cash offer.”</strong></p>



<p>He continued, saying that shareholders need that information to <strong>“make an informed investment decision on our offer.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-why-paramount-is-fighting-for-warner-bros">Why Paramount Is Fighting For Warner Bros?</h2>



<p>On December 5, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was announced that Netflix and Warner Bros. Discover</a> were in an agreement to sell the Warner Bros. side of the company to the streaming giant as part of an $82.7 billion deal. The sale would include only the company’s streaming and studios assets, including all of Warner Bros. Games. </p>



<p>Netflix’s offer of $27.75 per share doesn’t include the cable channels. Paramount’s offer of $30 would be for ethe entirety of the company. That would put the value of the cable networks at just $2.25 per share if the value of the streaming and studio assets remained the same as the Netflix deal. </p>



<p>Since the agreement was announced, Paramount has continued to try and force a sale to them. Leading up to and after the announcement of the Netflix deal, Warner Bros. Discovery has rejected at least eight Paramount offers. </p>







<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery board has said that Paramount would need to offer more cash and less debt for it to be reconsidered.</p>



<p>As far as why Paramount would want Warner Bros., it’s a pretty obvious. Video Games aside, which even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-downplays-value-wb-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix called “minor”</a> in terms of the deal, includes rights to a number of brands and IPs such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“Our objective from the moment we approached WBD was for a collaborative negotiation and a successful transaction that would be a win for both companies, both shareholder groups and all stakeholders,”</strong> Ellison wrote. <strong>“We remain perplexed that WBD never responded to our&nbsp;December 4th&nbsp;offer, never attempted to clarify or negotiate any of the terms in that proposal, nor traded markups of contracts with us.&nbsp; </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Even as we read WBD’s own narrative of its process, we are struck that there were few actual board meetings in the period leading up to the decision to accept an inferior transaction with Netflix. And we are surprised by the lack of transparency on WBD’s part regarding basic financial matters. It just doesn’t add up – much like the math on how WBD continues to favor taking less than our&nbsp;$30 per share all-cash offer for its shareholders.”</strong></p>



<p>Both Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery have declined to comment on the lawsuit.</p>
