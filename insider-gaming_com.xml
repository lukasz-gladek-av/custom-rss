<p>Fans of Breaking Bad have spotted a legendary Easter Egg in Battlefield 6. The new Eastwood map has you battling all over a poor neighborhood, but one of the houses has a familiar food item.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-breaks-franchise-sales-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> will be adding lots of new content for the foreseeable future. Across seasons and mini-updates, BF 6 is going to be one stacked game when all is said and done. The new Eastwood map is an example of what EA and DICE are cooking up in the content kitchen, and it offers a lot of destruction and diversity.</p>







<p>Funnily enough, it also has pizza.</p>

<p>A Reddit user has spotted a loose pizza decorating the roof of one house in Battlefield 6’s Eastwood map.</p>



<p>They’ve pointed out the location on the map—admittedly, you might need a magnifying glass to see it—and if you head there, climb onto the house’s roof, there, you’ll see a full pizza. Breaking Bad fans will instantly know the reference.</p>







<p>In Season 3, Episode 2, “Caballo sin Nombre”, Walter White brings over a giant pizza to the White house. His wife, Skylar, answers the door and refuses Walter’s request to come into the house. Walter leaves in a fury and throws the pizza box at the garage door. In a million-to-one shot, the pizza flies out of the box and lands on the roof.</p>



<p>The famous moment became even more iconic when you realise it was a <em>completely unscripted moment</em>, and really was an act of pure chance that actor Bryan Cranston managed to frisbee a giant pizza onto the roof!</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 isn’t the first game to include the Easter Egg, but it’s hard to imagine anyone will ever get sick of seeing it.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Breaking Bad is heralded as one of the greatest TV shows of all time. Do you agree? Is it overrated? And what are you making of Eastwood?

<p>PUBG’s upcoming extraction shooter, Black Budget, has been officially revealed, with the first opportunity to play the game coming in a closed Alpha test next month.</p>



<p>Described as an “FPP-first experience,” PUBG: Black Budget expands on the popularity of the PUBG Battle Royale game, and it becomes the latest franchise to dip into the extraction shooter scene.</p>







<h2 id="h-pubg-black-budget-closed-alpha-sign-ups-open">PUBG: Black Budget Closed Alpha Sign-Ups Open</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Alongside the reveal of the game, a closed alpha test has been announced for next month, with sign-ups now open, and there are no NDA restrictions with the experience.</p>



<p>The closed alpha is spread across two weekends in December, with the first beginning at 1 AM PT on Friday, December 12, running up to Sunday, December 14 at 23:59 PT, with the second taking place a week later.</p>



<p>There are some limitations to involvement, with participation only open to those in North America, Europe, and Asia, but players involved will not be tied to an NDA and can therefore share images and clips, stream the game, and discuss their experience freely.</p>



<p>The closed alpha test is focused on “early-game systems, combat pacing, extraction balance, and player progression,” with players advised that, due to the game being in ongoing development, technical issues may occur.</p>



<p>Initial sign-ups for the closed alpha test are open on Steam, but players will also be able to earn a key through Twitch and Chzzk Drops once the first weekend of the test opens up.</p>



<p>PUBG becomes the latest title to venture into the extraction shooter space, following on from the success of titles like Arc Raiders, while Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 also features a PvE extraction mode.</p>

<p>EA and Activision are locked in a war to have the best military FPS in 2025 and beyond. Battlefield 6 has helped the franchise bounce back meteorically, and Black Ops 7 is another solid CoD game. You need an answer to decide which game is better and which you should buy.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-breaks-franchise-sales-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> emphasises destruction and immersion, whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-dark-ops-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is more arcadey and silky. Each game is a military shooter, but there are so many nuances that divide them. If you can’t decide which of the two to buy, Insider Gaming’s Battlefield 6 vs. Black Ops 7 showdown is about to begin!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-battlefield-6-or-black-ops-7-campaign-better">Is The Battlefield 6 Or Black Ops 7 Campaign Better?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Skibidi. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh boy, this is a fun one to start. On one hand, you have Battlefield 6’s campaign, which is a fairly cut-and-dry affair with the odd good mission and a handful of fun moments; on the other hand, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 has a skibidi toilet boss</a>.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s story is clear: A PMC wants to essentially destroy the world, and you have to stop them. Its characters aren’t too memorable outside of Haz Carter. You could argue Battlefield hasn’t had memorable characters since the Bad Company games. But some of the mission locations are gorgeous, and set us up nicely for electric multiplayer maps.</p>



<p>The BF 6 campaign’s runtime is short and mostly sweet; however, it would take another playthrough or two for everything to stick in the mind. The campaign actually gets good toward the end, but just as the narrative perks up, it finishes just as abruptly. It’s a good campaign, but nothing special.</p>







<p>Whereas Treyarch decided to take the gloves off, jump the shark, and build an observatory to see how many flying pigs it could spot. Black Ops 7’s campaign leans far too heavily into the supernatural and just plain weird. Black Ops 6’s Emergence mission was a delight the first time around, and was something that hadn’t really been seen before.</p>



<p>But Black Ops 7 has you bringing down nuke-sized machetes, controlling a friendly army of Zombies, and fighting a literal skibidi toilet boss. Also, the campaign takes a horrible twist by becoming the first-ever online-only CoD campaign, meaning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-cant-pause-the-black-ops-7-campaign-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t pause the game</a>. Your game can be interrupted by other people, updates, and other factors. The game’s conclusion also integrates into a new PvP <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-available-campaign-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endgame</a> mode. Black Ops 7’s campaign is a different one, but for all the wrong reasons.</p>



<p><strong>Winner: Battlefield 6</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-or-black-ops-7-multiplayer-better">Is Battlefield 6 Or Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Better?</h2>

<p>This decision might ultimately fall on what you’re looking for in an online shooter. Call of Duty is about quickfire dying and respawning gameplay. Frenetic and furious gunfights that arrive quicker than the last. Battlefield resembles Hollywood movies at times with its armada of vehicles, explosions, falling buildings and debris, and ear-piercing sound design.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 wipes away the bad memories of Battlefield 2042 and delivers a proper, modern BF game for the first time in a decade. It’s not perfect, as there are some question marks about the game’s launch maps being too small (for a Battlefield game). Some of BF6’s challenges were horrific at launch and had to be nerfed. The gameplay itself is incredible, and there’s so much variety in the game modes, types of gameplay, and EA is planning to keep the game supported for a long time to come.</p>



<p>Every game of Rush, Conquest, Breakthrough, or Escalation feels like a war. You have to work hard to win every match. One second you’re in an alley or small room having an engaging 1v1, the next you’re running through literal tank fire and enemy offense to revive your teammate so they can support you in claiming the objective that can claim victory. Helicopters fall out of the sky and crash through buildings, destroying them; maps become crumbly messes, and it’s almost <em>like </em>you’re on a battlefield.</p>



<p>As for Black Ops 7, it feels like another good Call of Duty multiplayer title. The gunplay feels crispy and smooth, and the launch maps feel stronger than the beta maps. There is some anti-boots-on-ground action, which can’t be ignored, but at least it isn’t full-blown like Black Ops 3. </p>



<p>The biggest checkmark in the game’s favor is the lack of SBMM (for the most part) and non-disbanding lobbies. These two features have been demanded for years. With Activision knowing the game might be in trouble this time around, the signal was raised, and Black Ops 7 made the two changes. This, too, isn’t perfect, with suggestions that some SBMM lingers when it shouldn’t. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-aim-assist-adjust-strength-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aim Assist</a> has been a debate that’s raged on in Black Ops 7, with adjustments being made.</p>



<p>Both games incorporate game modes that stray from the game’s main gameplay. Battlefield 6 has plenty of bite-sized maps for close-quarters Team Deathmatch and zone-capture game modes, and Call of Duty has some 20v20 maps for large-scale warfare. This is presumably a see-through effort on both parts to capture some of the opposing game’s audience. </p>



<p>Black Ops 7 still feels like a strong multiplayer game, but it doesn’t feel <em>that </em>different from Black Ops 6. Treyarch will be supporting the game with a ton of content in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> and beyond. If you’re looking for a traditional Call of Duty experience, that’s what you get with Black Ops 7’s multiplayer, though, if you want full first-person war-based theater, there’s a slight winner.</p>



<p><strong>Winner: Battlefield 6</strong></p>

<figure><figcaption>Undead delight. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>By extension, Warzone falls into Black Ops 7’s content pool, as does RedSec for Battlefield 6. They’re both free downloads, so you don’t technically need the full games to play them, but challenges, weapons, and progression intermingle between them all.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Warzone has faded in recent months since Verdansk’s relaunch. It’s still one of the best battle royale modes in the world, and has many more modes and smaller maps for classic CoD-style action. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-black-ops-7-warzone-coming-out-black-ops-7-warzone-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 and Warzone’s integration</a> will add a new Resurgence map, and welcome new changes and POIs for Verdansk. Warzone is an established brand and is a very accessible and fun add-on.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 debuted RedSec shortly after the game’s release. Fort&nbsp;Lyndon is the name of the BR map, and it’s only the beginning. BF 6 BR features an innovative circle that kills anyone who touches it AND damages you if it gets close. It also adds some nice BF touches, including map destruction and Tanks.</p>



<p>Gauntlet Mode is the only other real offering outside of BR. A series of rounds where teams are eliminated if an objective quota is not fulfilled. It’s definitely fun, inventive, and creative in its own right. Right now, RedSec is showing potential, but if you’re looking for a fleshed-out and established battle royale option, there’s only one victor.</p>



<p>Don’t think that another big factor has been forgotten in all of this: Zombies. As part of Black Ops 7, you get CoD Zombies. Since being launched with 2008’s World at War, Zombies have gotten bigger and bolder. BLOPS 7 has lots of launch content, and more maps and content are coming. Let’s also not forget about Dead Ops 4 Arcade as well!</p>



<p><strong>Winner: Black Ops 7</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-buy-battlefield-6-or-black-ops-7">Should You Buy Battlefield 6 Or Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p><strong>A conclusive answer is that Battlefield 6 is the FPS game you need to buy out of Black Ops 7 and BF 6.</strong></p>



<p>It rules 2-1 in this mini-content breakdown. Battlefield 6 edges out the campaign by virtue of Black Ops 7’s overt outlandishness, and Black Ops 7 offers a better overall package. The main area where everyone is going to invest hundreds of hours, though, is online multiplayer. You pretty much know what you’re going to get with CoD at this point, especially if you buy it each year. </p>



<p>Battlefield isn’t an annual release. You know you’re getting a good couple of years (at least) of free content out of BF 6. Whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-campaign-reportedly-set-in-north-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty is getting a new game in 2026</a>. Battlefield 6 offers more and still delivers punchy gunplay, along with an incredibly immersive military shooter that toes the line between the arcade nature of Call of Duty and the harrowing realism of Hell Let Loose.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is the game you should buy if you’re deciding between it and Black Ops 7.</p>



<p><strong>Overall winner: Battlefield 6</strong></p>



<p>If you’re thinking of buying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-pc/">Battlefield 6, here’s the cheapest way for you to buy it</a>. Or if you’re favoring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">Black Ops 7, this is also the cheapest way to buy the game</a>.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem’s producer has recently stated that we will see “some characters from the past series come in.”</p>



<p>Capcom’s next big title is Resident Evil Requiem, and they are going all in with the title. Recently, the developers revealed that they expect the upcoming title to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell better</a> than Resident Evil Village, and that its development began ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-says-resident-evil-requiem-development-started-way-before-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">way before</a>‘ Village. Now, we have been informed that Requiem’s returning characters and some additional details about the stalker enemy were revealed. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-will-have-returning-characters-but-don-t-over-expect-or-hype-it">Resident Evil Requiem Will Have Returning Characters, But “Don’t Over-Expect or Hype It”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Well Played</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-over-expect-or-hype-it-resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-teases-but-wont-say-who" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Resident Evil Requiem’s producer, Masato Kumazawa, was asked whether the title will have returning characters from Outbreak, as Grace is the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft. Kumazawa replied, stating that yes, “there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don’t over-expect or hype it.” They can’t promise anything right now, and the only thing that can be said is that “there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game.”</p>



<p>Regarding the stalker enemy, Masato Kumazawa revealed that it will be just a small part of the game, and that they have learned from the past how to balance the system. The producer added that the game is new, and the focus is more on how they can scare the player in many different ways. The developers are “trying to cover a whole lot of scenarios to make sure the players can get scared and experience the horror.</p>
