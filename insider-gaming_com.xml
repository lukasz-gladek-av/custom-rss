<p>Team BDS is the first organisation to qualify for the grand final at the Six Invitational 2025, which will unravel tomorrow in Boston. Following a solid run through the upper bracket, Team BDS has found a spot in yet another pole position and remains the favourite to win the event and claim the $1 million prize.</p>



<p>To get there, Team BDS had to throw the likes of Unwanted and FURIA into the lower bracket. Both of these teams now stand a chance of squaring up against Team BDS once again to deliver an age-old tale of revenge, but FaZe Clan could also surface in the grand final.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-long-left">Not Long Left</h2>



<p>Today, two matches will play out, the first being a clash between Unwanted and FaZe Clan. From there, the winner will play FURIA for a spot in the grand final. One of these three teams will face off against a dominant Team BDS, which finds itself in a grand final for the fourth time <strong>this season</strong>.</p>



<p>Last year, Team BDS secured the top spot at the inaugural Esports World Cup, earning a prestigious place in the gaming history books.</p>



<p>Team BDS has enjoyed a solid streak through the Six Invitational, which is one of the biggest and most valuable esports tournaments in the world. The squad topped the charts in the group stage, and as the team steamed through the playoffs bracket, it forced Unwanted, Spacestation, and FURIA into the elimination bracket after earning a bye thanks to group seeding.</p>



<p>This could be Team BDS’ first Six Invitational Win. Currently, every team in the running except FaZe Clan has never seen a grand final at the Six Invitational. Here’s a spread of the past winners of the Six Invitational:</p>



<ul>
<li>2017 – Elevate &amp; Continuum</li>



<li>2018 – PENTA</li>



<li>2019 – G2 Esports</li>



<li>2020 – Spacestation</li>



<li>2021 – Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>2022 – TSM</li>



<li>2023 – G2 Esports</li>



<li>2024 – w7m Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you think Team BDS can break through the grand final and lift the hammer in Boston? Right now, the team is <strong>guaranteed to win </strong>at least $450,000. Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Gray Zone Warfare’s developer, MADFINGER Games, continues to innovate and expand Gray Zone Warfare, one of 2024’s most impressive shooters. In April 2024, Gray Zone Warfare emerged to a positive reception, presenting a tactical shooter experience bursting with realism and intensity. It has since sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 1.5 million units</a>.</p>



<p>Recently, the team at MADFINGER revealed the next lineup of improvements and changes coming to Gray Zone Warfare. The first port of call for these changes is the game’s test server, but if all goes well, they’ll be deployed across the full game soon enough.</p>



<hr>







<p>Gray Zone Warfare is being pieced together with the community in mind, and stacks of feedback have been taken on board and actively considered by the developer. Last year, I was fortunate enough to catch up with MADFINGER’s CEO to ask him about the state of play for Gray Zone and the extraction shooter market in general.</p>



<p>While Gray Zone isn’t <strong>strictly </strong>an extraction shooter, it does have mechanics that align it quite nicely with the genre.</p>



<p>Here’s what MADFINGER is testing in the latest test server patch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Introduction of a ‘repair feature’</li>



<li>Easier progression to max vendor level</li>



<li>Better disconnect protection</li>



<li>Better item and body behaviour and physics</li>
</ul>



<p>The first feature on that list is the most widely requested note in the Gray Zone Warfare community. When implemented, it’ll allow users to patch up their equipment instead of paying a costly price to replace items. As you can expect, items can be repaired, but each successive repair will degrade the overall max quality rating of that item.</p>



<p>MADFINGER’s intent to strengthen disconnect protection in the game is also a nice inclusion. Many modern shooters feature this mechanic, and it means that if you disconnect while playing, you’ll load back up with the option to continue where you left off.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare has a solid development pipeline lined up, and the passion evident in MADFINGER is a wondrous thing. Have you given Gray Zone a try? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/level-zero-extraction-canned-two-weeks-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/level-zero-extraction-updates-canned-two-weeks-after-game%E2%80%99s-full-release.1110327/</guid>

<p>Level Zero Extraction has succumbed to one of the issues plaguing the wider industry. The developer behind the title – Doghowl – has taken to social media to announce that no further updates will be rolled out for this extraction shooter that emerged as a 1.0 release just two weeks ago.</p>



<p>Level Zero Extraction was shaping up as a tasty, alien-fuelled competitor to Escape from Tarkov, but now, the developer has stressed that the ‘relatively small team’ cannot continue to sustain the game from a financial standpoint.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-down-the-drain">Down the Drain</h2>



<p>Level Zero Extraction entered early access in August 2024, impressing players worldwide with an innovative take on the extraction shooter genre. In this game, players could assume control of ‘Mercs’ or fearsome aliens, loading into a raid and trying to loot their hearts out before successfully extracting again.</p>



<p>Like a few extraction shooters that came before, Level Zero Extraction failed to gain enough traction to sustain the title.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, just 10 people are playing the game on Steam, and the title’s all-time peak sits at just 2,601. That’s a paltry condition compared to competing titles like Hunt: Showdown and Dark and Darker, both of which were floating between 10,000 – 12,000 players at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/LevelZeroGame/status/1890367933810966719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the Doghowl team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, LZ:E has underperformed compared to our expectations. It’s no longer feasible for our relatively small teams to sustain the game from a financial standpoint. Therefore, it’s a hard but necessary decision to gradually wrap up support.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed that the servers will stay up and wipes will continue to happen, but no further updates will be applied to the game. Now, Doghowl looks to what’s coming next, with the team mentioning that it has plans to develop a new multiplayer title that’s based on a cooperative experience.</p>
