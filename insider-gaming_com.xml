<p>Video game hardware sales in the United States (US) slightly increased in November 2024. That’s according to the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ldljf4dap62o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>.</p>



<p>For November 2024, video game hardware spending increased by 0.3$ from $924 million (M) to $927M year-over-year. That’s a major change from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-fell-october-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October’s numbers</a> which saw a 23% year-over-year fall. </p>



<p>Unlike October 2024, where a decrease in sales was across the board, November was a bit different. Thanks to the launch of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro and its $700 price tag, the PS5 saw a 15% increase in overall spending. On the other side of things, however, the Nintendo Switch say a 3% year-over-year drop in sales while the Xbox fell 29%.</p>



<p>Going back to the PS5, the PS5 Pro made up 19% of the number of PS5 consoles sold in November while also accounting for 28% of the money. That’s a 12% decrease in launch month sales of the PS4 Pro, but a 50% increase in dollars. The PS4 Pro launched at $400 in 2016 compared to the aforementioned $700 of the PS5 Pro. </p>

<p>In total for 2024, hardware sales in the US have fallen 24% to $3.74 billion (B) from the $4.9B in 2023. In terms of general units, 2.4M consoles were sold in November 2024 compared to the 2.3M sold in November 2023. That brings the total number of consoles sold for 2024 up to 9.4M, down compared to the 11.7M sold by this time in 2023.</p>



<p>That said, accessories continue to perform better than a year ago. In total, accessory sales rose 4% in November year-over-year while the year-to-date numbers jumped 8%. According to the data, the PlayStation Portal remains the best-selling accessory both for November 2024 and the entire year.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-new-pre-wipe-event-cultists/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-pre-wipe-event-gives-cultists-marked-keys-and-100-spawn-rates.1064256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-new-pre-wipe-event-cultists/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has rolled out another pre-wipe event for Escape from Tarkov, introducing a 100% spawn rate (at night) for Cultists across their main maps: Shoreline, Customs, and Woods. The latest update has equipped many of these Cultists with Marked Keys, which as you might know, open doors to some of the most high-value locations in the game.</p>



<p>Most recently, players were tackling a pre-wipe event in Escape from Tarkov that required them to kill 30 enemies on the Factory map to unlock Kappa, one of the most sought-after items in the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kill-cultists-make-gains">Kill Cultists, Make Gains</h2>



<p>This latest pre-wipe event for Tarkov comes with the following description on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The losses of both PMC factions during night-time operations have increased. The old-timers believe that this is due to the pilgrimage of the so-called “witnesses” to their marked circles. </p>



<p>There are reports of many of those hooded people carrying marked keys. Despite the increased danger, PMCs are now preparing for night raids and taking advantage of the fact that Mechanic started selling NVGs at a great discount.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, the large maps that accommodate Cultists (so, not Ground Zero or Factory) will have a 100% spawn rate for the faction <strong>at night only</strong>. Also, Mechanic has massively discounted NVGs like the GPNVG-18, which is selling for just 43,000 roubles at the moment.</p>



<p>When you kill Cultists, you’ll have a solid chance of picking up a range of Marked Keys from their bodies, which you can then turn into some great loot. Bear in mind that you’ll be competing with thousands of other players to access these locations, though.</p>



<p>As expected, this pre-wipe event is only available for PvP players, because the game’s PvE mode doesn’t accommodate forced wipes, so a <strong>pre-wipe event </strong>doesn’t make much sense.</p>



<p>As a bonus, you can secure Cultist Knives and trade them with Mechanic for coloured keycards.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the next Escape from Tarkov wipe will arrive around Christmas. Are you ready? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
