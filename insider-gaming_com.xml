<p>Riot Games will reportedly establish an official Game Changers circuit in League of Legends this year. The establishment of a Game Changers scene will ideally women and players representing marginalized genders a viable path to the top tier of competitive LoL.</p>



<p>After the success of the endeavor in the VALORANT space, Riot is hoping to see similar results in their flagship title, League of Legends.</p>

<p>According to reports from both <a href="https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-to-launch-lol-game-changers-tournament-in-2025-for-marginalized-genders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dot Esports</a> and <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/articles/sources-riot-to-launch-first-ever-lol-game-changers-initiative-in-emea-starting-in-april/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sheep Esports</a>, Riot will establish a League of Legends Game Changers initiative in the EMEA region this year. The 2025 season will reportedly consist of two splits, with Riot also considering a LAN finals at the end of the second split.</p>



<p>Riot is reportedly looking to invite organizations that field teams in the LEC, the top European league for LoL. Both SK Gaming, G2, and Vitality currently field women’s rosters in LoL. Sheep Esports is reporting that “at least three existing LEC teams – none of which had previously invested in the [GC] scene” have explored roster options “contingent on the launch of a Game Changers initiative.” SK Gaming is also being considered as the host for online qualifiers that could begin in March.</p>



<p>In the VALORANT space, the Game Changers inititiative has been nothing short of a success. Just in the past month, two-time GC champions Shopify Rebellion became the first GC team to qualify for an official Challengers league. This occurred right after the team’s former duelist star, Ava “florescent” Eugene, became the first Game Changers player to compete in the international VCT leagues. The scene as a whole has also provided full-time competition and opportunities to its many players, and has done quite well in regards to viewership.</p>



<p>How exciting is the idea of a Game Changers scene for League of Legends?</p>

<p>The Classic Themes, released on the PS5s for PlayStation’s 30th Anniversary, will be gone on January 30, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right. Today might be the last time you will see and hear the classic tune and appearance you experienced every time you booted up your PlayStation 5. However, everything is not lost, as the console maker revealed they are working “behind the scenes to bring these special designs back in the months ahead.” However, that doesn’t mean that there are “plans to create additional themes in the future.” They are just celebrating the legacy of PlayStation hardware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering, for a limited time, players could choose between multiple different themes for their PlayStation 5: 30th Anniversary, PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, or PlayStation 4. These themes add special effects inspired by the console generation to the homepage and during the boot-up process, creating a nostalgic impact every time you switch on your console or scroll through the games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Themes were introduced on PlayStation consoles during the PS3 and PS4 eras, and players could change the backgrounds, sounds, and icon appearances for their home screens on the fly. However, since the PS5, PlayStation has decided to use dynamic game images as backgrounds and completely dropped the idea of themes. It was nice to have them back for some time, and players hope they return soon.</p>



<p>In other news, PlayStation has announced that the future of PS Plus games will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-focus-on-ps5-games-for-future-ps-plus-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focus on PS5 Games</a>.
