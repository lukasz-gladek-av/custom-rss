<p>Lots of enjoyment is to be had on PlayStation 5. Whether your kids beg for something new to play or could use a fun distraction, there’s no going wrong with the games on this list. There are also a few notable, kid-friendly PlayStation exclusives not to be missed. In no particular order, we’re compiling some of the best PlayStation 5 Games for children.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-ps5-games-for-kids">Top PS5 Games for Kids</h2>



<p>Look no further than this list for the best breakdown possible:</p>



<h2 id="h-1-astro-bot">1. Astro Bot</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Astro Bot is one of the highest-rated PlayStation 5 games of 2024 and probably the <strong>best </strong>game for kids on PS5. It features a wealth of worlds to explore, puzzles to solve, and obstacle courses to overcome. If you’re a PlayStation fan of any kind, you’ll adore digging through Astro Bot to find all the cameos and ‘guest appearances’, and there’s plenty of meat on these bones to keep children entertained for hours on end.</p>



<p>It’s a follow-on from Astro’s Playroom, and it’s one of our key picks for PlayStation 5 games for children.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-astro-s-playroom">2. Astro’s Playroom</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you already have, or plan on getting, a PlayStation 5 then you’ll have Astro’s Playroom already pre-installed on the console. This game is pretty short but it’s got huge appeal. Astro’s Playroom is more than a tech demo for the PS5. It’s a culmination of what Sony has accomplished with the PlayStation over the years. </p>



<p>In addition to featuring the DualSense controller’s unique capabilities, players can uncover hidden collectables that contain renderings of past PlayStation consoles, controllers, and accessories. A gacha machine, within the game, can also yield additional memorable goodies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-3-super-monkey-ball-banana-mania">3. Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Super Monkey Ball has kept the good times rolling for years, literally. Banana Mania will keep kids busy for hours. The game is a compilation of over 300 stages from the original Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2, and Super Monkey Ball Deluxe. </p>



<p>Whether you’re speeding directly to the goal, or collecting every banana for a perfect run, there’s no wrong way to enjoy these games. The DualSense controller’s motion controls make this one an easy pick. Kids can also customise their characters and play several minigames involving racing, bowling, soccer, and baseball.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-4-justice-league-cosmic-chaos">4. Justice League: Cosmic Chaos</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>When the kids have a superhero itch that needs scratching then Justice League: Cosmic Chaos is just the thing. Play as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman in a light-hearted action-adventure to stop the prankster, Mr. Mxyzptlk. </p>



<p>That is not a typo. It’s got simple combat but boasts lots of DC Comics Easter eggs, humour, unlockable outfits for the superheroes, and a dynamic levelling system.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-5-sonic-frontiers">5. Sonic Frontiers</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>When you gotta go fast in an open-world platformer, an obvious choice is Sonic Frontiers. It’s the first game in the Sonic series to truly go open-world. The Starfall Islands contain several action stages with their own challenges to complete. The real treat of the game is exploring the islands themselves. </p>



<p>Each has obstacle courses and some platform puzzles to solve. The only drawbacks are that the game has a tedious level-up system, a so-so combat system, and some texture pop-ins. But fun is always to be had when exploring up, down and all around Sonic’s surroundings.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">6. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>LEGO games are great picks for the best PlayStation 5 games for children. They’re easy to pick up and keep kids (and adults) of all ages preoccupied. Although a plethora of PS4 Lego games are forward compatible with the PS5, we’re specifically looking at Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. </p>



<p>The game features a startling 380 playable characters pulled from all manners of Star Wars medium Because the saga is within the subtitle, players can expect to visit many worlds and scenarios spanning the Prequel, Original, and Sequel trilogies. Kids can play as lightsaber users or blaster wielders alike. </p>



<p>The gameplay is also interwoven with random encounters like TIE Fighters swooping from the sky, Tusken Raider attacks, and dog fights with Star Destroyers.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-just-dance-2024-edition">7. Just Dance 2024 Edition</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If parents are reading this you may recall a little thing back in the day called “Now That’s What I Call Music” compilations. The Just Dance series is the closest equivalent to that. Modern-day musical hits and those from yesteryear are set against vibrant, colourful backdrops. </p>



<p>Chances are you know what a Just Dance game entails and it says so in the title. On-screen avatars perform the dance moves while the kiddos follow along. The smartphone Just Dance app will keep track of accuracy and kids hold it in hand. Put down the controller, turn the volume up, and dance.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-ratchet-amp-clank-rift-apart">8. Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is a third-person shooter action-adventure that guarantees a fun, entertaining story. This time around the conundrum is that Ratchet has accidentally opened a rift in the space-time continuum. With a lot of media nowadays covering multiple universes, kids can immerse themselves in this colourful adventure. </p>



<p>Dr. Nefarious is ever the comic foil, but now he is joined by his opposite, Emperor Nefarious who has assumed rule of his own galaxy. What’s more, is that he’s never been defeated, so go change that. Rift Apart is among the best PlayStation 5 games for children.</p>







<h2 id="h-9-kena-bridge-of-spirits">9. Kena: Bridge of Spirits</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Similar to Ratchet &amp; Clank before it, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is like you’re in control of a beautifully produced animated movie. In this action-adventure platformer, kids control Kena, a young spirit guide. Joining Kena in her adventure throughout her mystical world are small spirit companions called the Rot. </p>



<p>The Rot can assist Kena by carrying objects to solve puzzles, distract enemies, or assist in battles. Kena utilizes an enchanted staff for combat, exploration, and platforming. It may be on the short side, but exploring Kena’s beautiful world for upgrades and treasure hunting needs to be experienced by every PS5 owner.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-sackboy-a-big-adventure">10. Sackboy: A Big Adventure</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>One of the best PlayStation 5 games for children is a side-scrolling platformer similar to Super Mario Bros. Sackboy: A Big Adventure can be compared closely to Super Mario 3D World regarding its gameplay structure. However, this time around, Sackboy’s moveset has expanded to best suit a new way of play. </p>



<p>Flutter jump, roll, dive, and slap everything in your way. The generous customization features of LittleBigPlanet carry over into Sackboy. There’s no end to the hysterical cosmetic decorations. Whether platforming solo or together, Sackboy keeps the smiles coming.</p>



<h2 id="h-11-minecraft">11. Minecraft</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>You can’t talk about the best PS5 games for children and <strong>not </strong>name Minecraft. This classic, decade-old game is a staple for any child looking to game from a young age. It promotes healthy learning and exploration, and it’s one of the best games for new players who are just starting to explore a controller.</p>



<p>In Minecraft, you and your kids can explore an infinite open world, build whatever you can imagine, and go on an adventure that only ends when you’re ready for it to. It’s the best-selling game of all time for a reason.</p>



<h2 id="h-12-overcooked">12. Overcooked!</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>For kids who enjoy cooperative play, Overcooked is a cooking simulator with a cartoony flair. Prepare yourselves though, you have to work through the laughs to become an ultimate chef. The gist of Overcooked, and its sequel, is preparing dishes by following onscreen instructions. It’s not as simple as lading soup into a bowl. </p>



<p>Some dishes will require cooking and preparing food to order such as managing temperatures, chopping vegetables, and preparing the plate. The real challenge is doing this against a time limit and setting time aside to clean dishes for the next order.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-13-moving-out">13. Moving Out</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another fun cooperative simulator, Moving Out is not unlike Overcooked in its gameplay style. As you would expect, kids have to move household amenities like couches, fridges, and microwaves out of the house and into a moving truck. It’s not that quite simple, however, as there are hazards that can disrupt your progress. </p>



<p>Almost like Home Alone traps, players have to be wary of fires, icey flooring, and ghosts. Fortunately, for the kiddos who need to dial back on the difficulty, Moving Out has an Assist feature that can remove stage hazards and increase the time limit.</p>







<h2 id="h-14-hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged">14. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Racing games are plentiful but here’s a newly released suggestion. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is a great improvement on the shortcomings of its predecessor. This sequel contains beautifully stylized racetracks that are set against home backdrops. The racetracks you can only dream of building in your house are fully realized in video game form. </p>



<p>Whether racing as miniature muscle cars, bikes, or big rigs, each with its own specifications,&nbsp; Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is one of the fastest racing games you can get your hands on.</p>



<h2 id="h-15-crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled">15. Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another racer that is gushing to the brim with content, Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled is a must-have for any racer. No pun intended but developer Beenox went the extra mile with this reimagining of the original Crash Bandicoot kart racer. Nitro-Fueled brings back all the racetracks from that game plus additional racetracks from the Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Tag Team Racing games. </p>



<p>It got a lot of flak at launch for its use of microtransactions after promising there would be none. Online multiplayer is not as populated as it used to be, but the single-player story experience is solid. By this point,t it shouldn’t hurt the bank either.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/m80-acquires-beastcoast-and-throws-manchester-r6-major-champs-out-in-the-cold.1053627/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/m80-acquire-beastcoast-rainbow-six-team-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>M80 has moved to acquire Beastcoast, adding the likes of Dota 2 and Pokémon-focused esports to an already stacked roster. The organisation will now cover these games in addition to Rainbow Six Siege, Counter-Strike 2, and VALORANT, but the move hasn’t been completed without a few upsets.</p>



<p>The losers of this deal are represented by Beastcoast’s former Rainbow Six Siege team, which claimed a victory at the BLAST R6 Major in Manchester, England earlier this year. They’re now left without an organisation to represent at the Six Invitational 2025, which is fast approaching.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-last-minute-change">Last-Minute Change</h2>



<p>M80 posted on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>M80 is pleased to announce we have acquired Beastcoast and their esports and media businesses. Excited to welcome them to the M80 family!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June, Beastcoast and Cloud9 partnered in the Rainbow Six Siege space ahead of the Esports World Cup. It didn’t turn out to be too fruitful a partnership, given that the team failed to qualify for the EWC, but it was also a very short-lived one. Per the <a href="https://m80.gg/article/m80-acquires-beastcoast-moves-into-dota2-pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official statement released by M80</a>, some key staff members are being pulled over from Beastcoast, but it’s bad news for some:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of the acquisition, M80 will absorb several of Beastcoast’s esports operations – including a top team in DOTA 2 – one of the largest Pokemon media businesses in gaming, and key staff, including CEO Grant Zinn. </p>



<p>In his new role at M80, Zinn will serve as Chief Business Development Officer, where he will support M80’s expansion and double-down on fandom in exciting, but underserved esports like Pokemon and fast-growing regions like South America.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The core trio that represented Beastcoast – Hotancold, SpiriTz, and Gaveni – has been left out in the cold following this move. They’ve resigned to stay together and add a couple of new players to their squad, but they currently have no banner to fly at the Six Invitational, which takes place in Boston in February.</p>



<p>Previous members of the Beastcoast roster, dfuzr and Gunnar, have unknown futures ahead of them.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Beastcoast beat Team BDS in an unlikely finish in Manchester to secure the trophy at the BLAST R6 Major, the first such win for the organisation in Rainbow Six.</p>
