<p>Use these Roblox Creatures Of Sonaria monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash, new signature looks, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ever dreamt of soaring through the skies like one of the massive dragons from Game Of Thrones? If so, then Creatures Of Sonaria is a game that you need to check out immediately. Creatures Of Sonaria is a popular survival RPG experience on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-letter-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> where players take on the roles of various mythical beings. Although many Roblox games tend to be quite basic and generic in their gameplay, Creatures Of Sonaria is a welcome change to that frustrating trend. With a highly immersive world full of secrets to explore, this game has something for every kind of player.&nbsp;</p>







<p>To start, the Creatures Of Sonaria map is absolutely massive, featuring various terrains and atmospheres. Simply exploring every nook and cranny of the map will take players plenty of time. Another element of the game that makes it highly immersive is the fact that there are over 300 playable creatures. Not only that, but each of these beings also has its own individual abilities and unique traits, making the gameplay experience highly customizable. There’s also a solid Gacha system in the game, which players can use to get new and powerful beasts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steam continues to be one of the best places to play games in 2025, and there’s an almost endless list of titles to enjoy, making it hard to find the best games.</p>



<p>Whether you’re on the hunt for your next source of multiplayer mayhem, an expansive single-player adventure, or a little bit of everything, Insider Gaming has listed the best games to buy on Steam, or gift to loved ones, in 2025.</p>



<p>Don’t forget to check out our other <a href="http://also, there should always be a link near before getting into the lists to the Holiday 2025&quot; tag hub: https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holiday 2025</a> gift guides here!</p>







<h2 id="h-best-pc-games-to-buy-on-steam-2025">Best PC Games to Buy on Steam 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The episode superhero adventure is arguably one of the best titles to release in a generation, putting you right in the mix of an Invincible-like story. Taking control of Robert Robertson, leading a pack of wannabe supervillain-turned-heroes seeking to be reformed, Dispatch’s eight-episode arc initially released weekly, but is perfect for playing in bulk, just like a binge watch of your favorite series.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re yet to join the fight to defend democracy, where have you been? Helldivers 2 continues to shine as one of the best titles available on Steam, and the fact Xbox players joined the fight earlier this year means there’s even more crossplay fun to be had. While the game has regular updates like other live-service titles, the huge benefit is there’s no expiration to the Battle Passes, and plenty of ways to earn free credits.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The extraction shooter has made a quick impression since its release last month, standing as one of the best-reviewed games this week. Playable solo, or in teams up to three, one of ARC Raiders’ biggest strengths is the unpredictability every time you jump into the game, as you never know who you will come across. With ongoing support, ARC Raiders is here for the long haul.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>After the much-maligned Battlefield 2042, EA has come back swinging with Battlefield 6, arguably the most successful title to release this year. While the solo campaign is entertaining, nothing beats the huge multiplayer battles on the ground and in the air, with naval combat expected in the future. If there’s any year to skip Call of Duty for something else, it’s this one.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s been seven years since Red Dead Redemption 2 was released on consoles and while it took a while longer to get to Steam, it still stands as one of the best games money can buy, and the current price has been slashed. Winner of over 175 Game of the Year awards, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the perfect game to tide you over until the release of Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 set the gaming world alight when it initially launched in 2023, clinching a well-deserved Game of the Year award, and the Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure is rated five stars on Steam to this day. Your choices along the way shape your adventure, meaning you’ll have a different experience on every run.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-palworld">Palworld</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Initially released in January 2024, Palworld caught the eye. and the ire of Nintendo, with its release, and has received several updates since, including some big collabs. With an array of Pals to capture, expansive base-building mechanics, and the ability to permanently trap humans in a small sphere for eternity, what’s not to love?</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Despite turning four this year, Forza Horizon 5 still stands as the best racing game on the market, a title likely to be held onto until the release of Forza Horizon 6 next year. While racing is the name of the game, there’s plenty of other things to do, including exploration, stunt jumps, and listening to one of the best soundtracks available on any game on the market.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Black Ops 7 undoubtedly has its issues, but there are some major perks to the game. The biggest among them is Zombies, which is just as good, if not better, than Black Ops 6, with an expansive easter egg to complete on the initial map, along with more content on the way. There’s also intense multiplayer action and a frankly bizarre campaign to complete, which can be done solo with up to three other players.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Celebrating its tenth birthday next year, Stardew Valley continues to be one of the most-played titles on Steam and retains a five-star rating on the platform after a decade. Put in control of a run-down farm, players are tasked with bringing it back to life, growing crops and rearing animals. There’s also a mine to farm resources, a host of romance options, and plenty more secrets hidden away.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243639/world-of-warcraft-midnighttm-goes-live-march-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blizzard announced</a> that World of Warcraft: Midnight will be released worldwide on March 2, 2026, at 3 PM PST—which means that for some players in the world, the release date will be in the morning of March 3.</p>



<p>While there is still a little while to wait to enjoy everything that Midnight has to offer, players who have purchased any edition of the expansion can secure Housing Early Access next week, from December 2.</p>



<p>With the release of ‘The Warning’ Midnight Prologue content update, players who have purchased the Midnight expansion can join a neighborhood, choose a house, and begin customizing their new home during Housing Early Access.</p>



<p>Those without Midnight purchased can begin to add to their Housing collection through activities and achievements, however, which will be waiting for when you pull the trigger on the expansion and are ready to settle down into a humble abode.</p>



<p>Housing Early Access won’t provide everything there is to offer, however, with the available items described as a “limited selection before the full suite of options arrives with the launch of the expansion.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 7 Will be Released Earlier Than Thought, It’s Claimed]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite is gearing up for this weekend’s huge end-of-chapter event, bringing an end to The Simpsons mini-season with a huge battle featuring collabs from throughout Chapter 6, and it seems downtime could end sooner than expected.</p>



<p>The Zero Point event in Fortnite takes place on Saturday at 2 PM PT, with Chapter 7 expected to kick off the following day, November 30. However, it’s claimed that the start date will be earlier.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-reportedly-releasing-november-29">Fortnite Chapter 7 Reportedly Releasing November 29</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big deal. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>While the standard practice for major Fortnite updates is downtime beginning at 2 AM ET, which was expected to be the case with Chapter 7’s launch on November 30, players could be back in significantly earlier than that date.</p>



<p>Reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1993774545241858172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> states Chapter 7 will be released on November 29, “just a few hours after the live event.” While there’s no specific time mentioned, that could mean as much as 12 hours before downtime was expected to begin.</p>



<p>There are, however, some caveats to this, and even if the information is accurate, it would all depend on everything running smoothly in the deployment of Chapter 7.</p>



<p>Downtime for a new Chapter is often longer than the usual turnover for seasonal updates in Fortnite, and there’s a larger amount to deploy—including an entirely new map and POIs, NPCs, weapons, vehicles, and more.</p>



<p>That means there are even more things that could go wrong and extend downtime, and even if Epic Games were to publicly announce a release time, it would still be subject to change.</p>



<p>What is known, however, is that content creators have already gotten their hands on Chapter 7 during an early access event, with full details set to be shared ahead of the launch—which could become a standard approach for Epic Games, with a similar early access event ahead of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>
