<p>It has been confirmed that Geralt of Rivia <strong>will indeed appear </strong>in The Witcher 4, but everyone involved is NDA’d out of their minds and can’t say exactly in what capacity he’ll surface.</p>



<p>It was just a few days ago that Doug Cockle, the veteran voice actor behind Geralt, confirmed that he’d ‘been slapped’ by CDPR for commenting about appearing in The Witcher 4. Now, CDPR itself has confirmed that Geralt will appear in the upcoming title, which was unveiled this week at The Game Awards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-path">On The Path</h2>



<p>In the first trailer for The Witcher 4, a few seconds were reserved right at the tail end for a line from Doug Cockle in true Geralt form. It referenced staying on ‘the path’ that Witchers follow, and it commented on this being the beginning of a new saga.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 will star Ciri in a leading role, which shouldn’t come as a surprise to the franchise’s truest fans. It has always been about Ciri, after all – it was <strong>expected </strong>that she’d take up the mantle of ‘The Witcher’ in this all-new game from CDPR.</p>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-and-that-is-indeed-doug-cockles-voice-in-the-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, CD Projekt confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Geralt will appear in the game, but we don’t want to spoil his role precisely. You’ll have to wait to learn more for now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the end of Blood and Wine, the final expansion for 2015’s The Witcher 3, Geralt effectively retired to a vineyard in Toussaint. What he’s been doing since then is anyone’s guess, but it’s now assumed to be canonical that Ciri took up the silver sword and went Witchering in his place. </p>



<p>In the trailer for The Witcher 4, we see an empowered Ciri consuming potions and using signs, which means she’s undergone the Trial of the Grasses, at the very least.</p>



<p>Perhaps Geralt of Rivia will appear in The Witcher 4 in a similar role that Vesemir served in The Witcher 3, as a wise old mentor.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to own a 1/2 scale replica of The Witcher’s Ciri of Cintra? Well, thanks to Pure Arts, you can now do just that – but it’ll set you back $3,000.</p>



<p>Recently, the high-end collectables company unveiled a brand-new Ciri statue (nice timing), and it stands almost four feet tall. It’s limited to just 500 pieces and it’s arguably the most detailed statue I’ve seen in my entire life.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll invest in the ultimate Ciri statue?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unreal-detail">Unreal Detail</h2>



<p>Pure Arts’ Ciri of Cintra statue is nothing short of mind-blowing.</p>



<p>For $3,000, you’re getting a ‘hyperdetailed’ statue with glass eyes, individually punched synthetic hair, silicone skin, ‘real clothing’, and metal weapons. The team has assembled a design that uses real leather, hand-sewn elements, removable accessories, and a polyresin base for durability.</p>



<p>It weighs a whopping 14 kilos – 20.5 kilos if you include the packaging.</p>



<p>The statue depicts Ciri as she appears in 2015’s The Witcher 3, standing on a plinth alongside a piece of headgear (or perhaps <em>a head</em>) from one of the riders of The Wild Hunt. She’s midway through drawing her silver sword, looking intense and standing ready for a fight.</p>



<p>Pure Arts has also produced a similar statue of Geralt of Rivia. It’s almost the same size and weight as the Ciri statue, but the team has ramped up the detail on this one, individually implanting each beard hair on his face. It’s unparalleled, truly.</p>



<p>It’ll cost up to $300 to have these items shipped, and the Geralt of Rivia statue costs $3,499 for starters, so you’ll need to be prepared to part ways with a pretty penny to secure these figures.</p>
