            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This year, The Division celebrates its tenth anniversary, having emerged way back in 2016 as a solid post-apocalyptic MMO of sorts. It plunged players into a devastated New York City, torn apart by a viral pandemic and taken over by factions hellbent on twisting the city into their crime-fuelled playground.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft gave us an encouraging update regarding the future of the franchise, specifically targeting The Division 3, which is officially in production. Julian Gerighty, the game’s executive producer, said the game is ‘shaping up to be a monster.’</p>







<h2 id="h-the-division-3-could-be-the-biggest-game-in-the-series">The Division 3 Could Be The Biggest Game in the Series</h2>



<p>In a recent appearance on the New Game+ showcase, Ubisoft’s Julian Gerighty spoke about the past, present, and future of The Division. Last year, it was revealed that The Division 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/">was almost shuttered</a> until a dynamic team of five developers stepped up to ‘resurrect’ the game.</p>



<p>Now, the series is booming, and that includes the production of The Division 3, which is yet to be formally revealed by Ubisoft.</p>



<p>However, Gerighty had bold promises for the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it’s been announced. It’s <strong>shaping up to be a monster</strong>.</p>



<p>Within these walls at Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will have <strong>as big an impact as Division 1</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>From beautiful, cinematic trailers to a solid and original premise, the first Division game was released to a very positive reception almost a decade ago. It became a key pillar in Ubisoft’s portfolio and was expanded in 2019 with The Division 2, an evolution of sorts.</p>



<p>Fans of the franchise have long been calling out for an update regarding The Division 3, and while it’s only a small one, they finally have something to mull over.</p>

<p>Season One Reloaded has kicked off in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, bringing a new Fallout collab that includes a stacked Event Pass of rewards, though some are locked behind an additional purchase.</p>



<p>The Fallout collab in Black Ops 7 is widespread, with limited-time game modes, unique challenges, and items available to purchase in the shop, showing that the collab is not just about cosmetic items.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence about splashing out on the Fallout Event Pass, Insider Gaming has all the details on the price, the rewards available, and a verdict on whether it’s worth grabbing.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">How Much is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to earn. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Upgrade Track for the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is priced at 1,100 CoD Points, which works out at around $10 for the extra content.</strong></p>



<p>Splashing out on the Upgrade Track provides 10 additional rewards alongside the 10 free rewards in the Event Pass, most of which are cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">All Rewards in The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<p><strong>The Fallout Event Pass in Black Ops 7 comes with 20 rewards, 10 of which are available for free, with the other half limited to those who purchase the Upgrade Track.</strong></p>



<p>Free rewards in the Event Pass include two Operator Skins, a loading screen, XP Tokens, and a new base weapon, while the Upgrade Track includes a new Operator, alongside an additional Operator Skin, a finishing move, weapon blueprint, Emote, and more.</p>



<p>A full breakdown of the rewards available in the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is shown in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Name</th><th data-align="center">Type</th><th data-align="center">Event Pass</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Dweller</td><td data-align="center">Operator Skin</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Power Armor Maximus</td><td data-align="center">Operator</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Enjoy Your Stay</td><td data-align="center">Loading Screen</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Torch Blade</td><td data-align="center">Melee Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">1 Hour Double Weapon XP</td><td data-align="center">XP Token</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Minigun Teardown</td><td data-align="center">Finishing Move</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Power Powe</td><td data-align="center">Emblem</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Brotherhood’s Armanent</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Brotherhood’s Armament</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">1 Hour Double Level XP</td><td data-align="center">XP Token</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Maximus</td><td data-align="center">Operator Skin</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wanderer</td><td data-align="center">Operator Skin</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Brotherhood Launch</td><td data-align="center">Calling Card</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Smooches</td><td data-align="center">Sticker</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bobble-Head Bobble</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vault Boy</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Charm</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Power Armor Helm</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Charm</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vault-Tech</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Camo</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wasteland Buck</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sturmwolf 45</td><td data-align="center">Base Weapon</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Ghoul</td><td data-align="center">Operator</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass-worth-it">Is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>If you’re a fan of the Fallout TV Series, the Blacks Ops 7 Event Pass is worth the cost as it provides the best content from the major collab.</strong></p>



<p>Unlocking the Upgrade Track is the only way to obtain the Power Armor and The Ghoul Operator Skins, two iconic looks from the famed series, along with other eye-catching additions, including the Torch Blade Weapon Blueprint and Minigun Teardown Finishing Move.</p>



<p>The Free Track, meanwhile, features much smaller collab items, with the two Operator Skins not being characters from the TV series, and the other cosmetic items being much less eye-catching.</p>

<p>Quantic Dream has just announced that Detroit: Become Human has surpassed 15 million units sold in 2026. </p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human was released back in 2018 and quickly gained popularity in the community thanks to its cinematic storytelling and decision-based gameplay. We were recently informed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/detroit-become-human-sold-one-million-copies-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 1 million copies in two weeks</a>, thanks to a massive Steam discount that was instrumental in reaching a new milestone. </p>







<h2 id="h-detroit-become-human-reaches-massive-sales-milestone-in-2026">Detroit: Become Human Reaches Massive Sales Milestone in 2026</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466707/detroit-become-human-sales-top-15-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>, a <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2026/01/08/detroit-become-human-surpasses-15-million-units-sold-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Quantic Dream reveals that Detroit: Become Human has sold 15 million units worldwide across PlayStation 4 and PC. The report shows that the game has been steadily hitting new milestones since 2020, with 5 million units in that year, reaching 11 million units in the next 5 years. 2025 was an excellent year for the game, as it sold 4 million more units, bringing total sales to 15 million by January 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-about-detroit-become-human">About Detroit: Become Human</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human takes place in 2038, where technology has advanced so much that human-like androids can be found worldwide. Players get to play as three of these androids, each of which has different moral dilemmas and obstacles to overcome. The game places a significant focus on player decisions, where your choices not only shape your characters’ journey but also impact the entire city of Detroit. The game features “thousands of choices and dozens of possible endings,” so no playthrough is exactly the same, as the most minute decisions can have a significant impact on how the story plays out. </p>

<p>ARC Raiders developers have revealed that they are implementing significant changes and new detection systems to tackle the ongoing cheating problem in the game. </p>



<p>In recent days, ARC Raiders has been accused of rampant cheating, with a popular streamer stating that the “egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worse than peak Call of Duty</a>.” The developers have now acknowledged the issue and outlined their plan to resolve it. </p>

Embark Studios first acknowledged the discussion around cheating in ARC Raiders and informed players that they are taking this issue “very seriously” and are acting on the players’ feedback. </p>



<p>The dev team will be “implementing significant changes” to ARC Raiders rulesets and will deploy “new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters” in the coming few weeks. The process will include updating their anti-cheat system to improve detection and enforcement of bans. </p>



<p>Additionally, the developers will implement “client-side” fixes that will target the ARC Raiders ‘out-of-map glitch, which has become a massive pain in the title. Furthermore, the developers will also be adding changes that will help streamers, including tools that will “help mitigate stream sniping”. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-9-943/</link>
            <guid>1401313</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of another week, but before the weekend can land successfully, you need to complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Let’s keep that streak running and make 2026 your most profitable year in the puzzle challenge space! Below, I’ve outlined today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions, so you can get things wrapped up quickly.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #943:</p>



<ul>
<li>3 BALL</li>



<li>8 BALL</li>



<li>6 MAFIA</li>



<li>COUTH</li>



<li>CARDINAL</li>



<li>DEEP END</li>



<li>CHAINZ</li>



<li>FORTH</li>



<li>HEART EMOJI</li>



<li>LIMB</li>



<li>DIRECTION</li>



<li>LEST</li>



<li>SOLO CUP</li>



<li>THIN ICE</li>



<li>NON BLONDES</li>



<li>OAST</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Slang or casual terms for where you live.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Think about how something might sound.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>THands you might make at a card table.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Add “animal” after each</em> <em>word</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 9:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– 3 BALL, CARDINAL, HEART EMOJI, SOLO CUP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – 8 BALL, DEEP END, LIMB, THIN ICE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – 6 MAFIA, CHAINZ, DIRECTION, NON BLONDES</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COUTH, FORTH, LEST, OAST</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p><strong>Fortnite’s servers will be down for several hours for the January 9 update, and there’s no confirmed time for their return. However, previous downtime indicates how long the game will be unavailable.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, though the wait can be longer if any issues are discovered.</p>



<p>This means that servers should be back up after the January 9 update somewhere between 5 AM ET and 8 AM ET, so keep an eye on social media around these times to check if the servers are back online.</p>



<p>Once the servers are back online, make sure to have a look at the latest content on Insider Gaming for guides on all the major additions and tips to help you.</p>

<p><strong>The biggest additions in the January 9 update in Fortnite are the launch of a major South Park collab, introducing new cosmetics in the Item Shop and in-game content.</strong></p>



<p>A free Mini Pass will be available during the South Park collab, along with a makeover to the Wonkeeland POI, which is transformed into Cartmanland, and the addition of the Stick of Truth Mythic item.</p>



<p>The January 9 update will also bring a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-south-park-collab-will-include-limited-time-five-player-playlist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new five-player limited-time game mode</a>, while removing Winterfest content from the game, and there will also be updates to other game modes, including Blitz and Reload.</p>
