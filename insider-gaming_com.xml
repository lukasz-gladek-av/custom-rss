<p>NVIDIA has released a brand-new tech showcase for Resident Evil Requiem, offering players a glimpse of Raccoon City in action.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set to release next month on February 27, 2026, and the developers have been slowly revealing more information about the game as launch approaches. Recently, the director stated that the upcoming title will be ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-almost-like-having-two-games-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost like having two games</a>‘. Now, Raccoon City’s environment has been teased in a new NVIDIA showcase. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-s-raccoon-city-looks-and-feels-amazing">Resident Evil Requiem’s Raccoon City Looks and Feels Amazing</h2>



<p>The tease for Resident Evil Requiem’s Raccoon City comes through a new 4K Path Tracing &amp; NVIDIA DLSS 4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0mgOPbpagc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> uploaded by NVIDIA. The video showcases short clips of a cityscape that captures a dark, gritty vibe, perfectly aligning with Raccoon City’s aesthetic. In the footage, we see Grace walking through the city, and from the few seconds shown, it looks incredible. Interested readers can check out the video below: </p>

<p>Coming to the tech talk, Resident Evil Requiem has been optimised for a wide range of PCs ahead of its release, featuring path-traced effects, DLSS 4, accelerated performance, and enhanced image quality. Thanks to path tracing, the game will be able to render multiple shadows from multiple light sources, along with complex lighting effects such as reflections and refractions through glass.</p>



<p>Additionally, the game will also be available on GeForce Now at launch, allowing players to access the power of a GeForce RTX 5080 with DLSS 4 enabled. </p>







<p>In other news, a new claim stated that Resident Evil Code Veronica and Zero remakes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are scheduled for 2027 and 2028, respectively</a>. Additionally, Leon Kennedy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally received his official reveal</a> for Requiem at The Game Awards last month.

<p>A new Sony patent has surfaced called ‘Ghost Player’, which is AI tech that can not only guide the players who are stuck, but also play the games for you. </p>



<p>Sony is known to patent new tech years before it is actually released. We have already seen multiple patents for the DualSense controller that discuss <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-new-patent-reveals-a-controller-concept-with-conductive-ink/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introducing conductive ink</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-new-dualsense-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replacing the touchpad with a touchscreen</a>. Now, the new patent focuses on AI technology, which could enable the console to play the game for you. </p>







<h2 id="h-sony-s-ghost-player-ai-patent-talks-about-a-guide-mode-and-a-complete-mode">Sony’s Ghost Player AI Patent Talks About a ‘Guide Mode’ and a ‘Complete Mode’</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> talks about the new ‘Ghost Player’ AI tech patent for Sony, wherein an AI-generated player can either guide a player towards the solution or even complete the game for them. There are two modes, ‘Guide Mode’ and ‘Complete Mode’. The Guide Mode can seemingly create an AI-controlled version of Nathan Drake in a game like Uncharted and show the player how they can get past the level. In ‘Complete Mode’, the AI-controlled character will complete the entire section for the player. </p>



<p>Sony’s Ghost Player AI technology will be trained using existing gameplay footage online and will not require the developer to provide a pre-recorded character to play the game. The AI patent could serve as an upgrade to PlayStation’s existing Game Help feature, which offers hints, tips, images, and even video walkthroughs to guide players through certain sections. </p>



<p>However, players should note that acquiring a patent doesn’t mean the tech will be released; it could be years before we even see it in action, or it may not be released at all. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios is enjoying a rampant run through the extraction space since releasing ARC Raiders on October 30. The transformative, disruptive title has shaken up the genre and emerged as a stellar, best-selling game that has taken the world by storm. But it might not end with it being <strong>just a game</strong>.</p>



<p>The CEO of Embark Studios, Patrick Söderlund, recently revealed that multiple companies have reached out to pitch an ARC Raiders television show or movie. While he believes the IP would align quite nicely with alternate media, the studio is reluctant to do anything until they’re <strong>doing it right</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-would-arc-raiders-work-as-a-tv-show">Would ARC Raiders Work as a TV Show?</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GamesBeat, which was hosted while <strong>playing ARC Raiders</strong>, Patrick Söderlund&nbsp;and Nexon CEO Owen Mahoney spoke about all things extraction. They touched on the future of the game, how it came to be, and even offered some insider tips on dominating the game’s multiple maps.</p>



<p>During the interview, the topic of an ARC Raiders TV show or movie came up, and Söderlund&nbsp;explained that Embark Studios has been approached numerous times.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t tell you how many companies have reached out wanting to make a TV series and movie out of this IP.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then stressed that it ‘needs to be done in the right way’ and suggested it would ‘be fun to see’ ARC Raiders represented in that medium.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders is nothing short of a cinematic marvel. The world-building is unparalleled, and each raid topside goes hand-in-hand with a sense of unpredictability that few games can truly capitalize on.</p>



<p>Live-action adaptations of video games are exploding these days. From the success of The Minecraft Movie and Super Mario Bros. to the ongoing unravelling of Fallout and The Last of Us in television form, fans of these games are lapping up every adaptation that hits the market.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders would likely do phenomenally well as a television series written to tell the backstory of the ARC invasion and how the survivors make their way into and ultimately dwell within the relatively safe walls of Speranza.</p>
