<p>Epic Games has denied that gambling mechanics are being added to Fortnite in user-created experiences, despite their own explanation confirming their addition.</p>



<p>Leaks first emerged to state that “gambling” was coming to UEFN, which was confirmed in the latest patch notes, but there appears to be some confusion about the clarification of “gambling” in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-epic-games-denies-gambling-added-to-fortnite">Epic Games Denies ‘Gambling’ Added to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New addition. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Epic Games approached Insider Gaming to request a correction to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-adding-gambling-in-future-update-leaks-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our article about the addition of “gambling” in Fortnite</a>, stating that gambling is against the Fortnite Developer Rules.</p>



<p>Section 1.11 of the Developer Rules states that developers cannot “implement gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games,” which are “prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency.”</p>



<p>Additionally, section 1.15.5 states that “teach or prominently feature images or activities that are typically associated with real-world gambling, casino-style games, or games of chance that offer a prize, even if they are not directly simulating a gambling experience, are not permitted in any form.”</p>



<p>Epic Games explained that, instead, the addition is for “paid random items” and that developers must “disclose the actual numerical odds of what the player may receive before the player makes a purchase.” However, Epic Games denies that gambling and paid random items are the same.</p>



<p>Despite Epic Games’ arguments, the above still constitutes gambling. Any paid-for item with a chance of a specific reward is still gambling, just as loot boxes in other titles qualify as gambling.</p>



<p>This is confirmed by legal action in countries like Belgium, where the Belgium Gaming Commission <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43906306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned loot boxes in 2018</a> and declared the content to be “in violation of gambling legislation.”</p>



<p>This article will be updated if Epic Games provides any further details on the addition.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-middle-of-journey/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-is-%E2%80%98only-in-the-middle-of-the-journey%E2%80%99-says-sony.1349755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao has said that Sony believes the PlayStation 5 is only at the midpoint of its journey.</p>



<div><p>The quote came from Sony’s latest quarterly earnings call, where Sony CFO Line Tao revealed that the PlayStation 5 is currently only in the middle of its lifecycle. Tao said,</p><p>“Our view is that compared to conventional console lifecycles. Looking at the PS4 lifecycle, it seems to be getting longer and longer. Especially the PS4, which was launched in 2013, and it’s been over a decade since then, but there are many active users enjoying the console… So from that perspective, we believe that the PS5 is only in the middle of the journey, and we are really planning to expand it even further.”</p></div>







<h2 id="h-so-when-will-the-ps6-release">So, When Will The PS6 Release?</h2>



<p>Well, Tao’s comments are not actually suggesting that the PlayStation 6 is another five years away, instead, she’s suggesting that the console generation of the PlayStation 5 will bleed through during the PS5. Just like with the current generation with the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, we’re now only just seeing developers move away from the PS4 with its games.</p>



<p>So, in theory at least, the PlayStation 6 is scheduled to release likely in 2027 – 2028, with the PlayStation 5 continuing to be supported to around 2031 – 2032.</p>



<p>The support for the ‘past generation’ is simply because of economics, allowing developers to release on a much bigger market than they would if they just developed games for the latest generation. For instance, on PlayStation 6’s launch, which could sell 10-15 million units in its first year, it’s not an ideal market to solely release a game on. Instead, it’s much better to release on the PlayStation 6 (10-15 million units), plus the PlayStation 5 (likely 100 million units+ by 2027).</p>



<p>It’s why popular games such as Call of Duty still remain on past-generation consoles, simply because the platform still has a large number of players.</p>







<p>What do you think of the PlayStation 5 being in the middle of its generation? When do you think the PS6 will be released? Let us know your thoughts in the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-worlds-collide-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-worlds-collide-endgame-explained.1349752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is bringing a host of new adventures into the fray, but the mysterious Worlds Collide mode has raised questions among the community.</p>



<p>First emerging as a query following the start of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preloads for Black Ops 7 becoming</a> available, a download option for Worlds Collide was confusing, as it wasn’t abundantly clear what the download was for—unlike the options for Zombies and multiplayer, which are self-explanatory.</p>



<p>Fear not, though, as the answer is out there, and we’ve got all the details you need for Worlds Collide in Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-worlds-collide-in-black-ops-7">What is Worlds Collide in Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New adventure. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Worlds Collide is the name for the Campaign in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and specifically refers to the endgame mode available once the campaign is completed.</strong></p>



<p>Black Ops 7 features co-op with up to four players throughout the campaign, with a huge focus on replayability in the post-game when the main story is completed.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed by Activision</a>, the endgame mode is a new and shared experience “where the narrative continues to unfold.” It takes place on the Avalon map, with POIs from across Black Ops history, featuring discoverable intel, expansive skill tracks, and more.</p>



<p>Detailed in the Call of Duty blog, the endgame mode takes place after the conclusion of the 11 co-op campaign missions that make up the game’s story, and tasks players with exploring Avalon to find The Guild’s remaining Command Centers, while battling with exposure zones that are leaking a mysterious toxin into the city.</p>



<p>The area is expected to be the best place to grind for the exclusive campaign camos that are available for weapons in Black Ops 7, for the first time, which adds to the camos available in multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-worlds-collide-pvp-or-pve">Is Worlds Collide PvP or PvE?</h2>



<p><strong>Unlike Warzone, the Worlds Collide endgame mode is an entirely PvE operation, and there is no combat against other players.</strong></p>



<p>The mode is designed for one-to-32 players in squads of up to four, where players can choose to tackle smaller objectives individually in their squad, or combine with other squads to take down more difficult objectives.</p>



<p>Different areas of Avalon have different recommended Combat Ratings, providing varying degrees of challenge for players, but there are no PvP offerings available.</p>
