<p>Tom McKay has officially wrapped his time in the booth and on the motion capture floor as Kingdom Come Deliverance’s Henry of Skalitz. In a post on social media, the Warhorse Studios team shared the news that McKay has completed his work on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s DLC suite, which means that after almost nine years with the character, he’s <strong>finished</strong>.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to jump to the conclusion that there won’t be a Kingdom Come Deliverance 3, and if there is to be another game in the series, it won’t star Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<h2 id="h-henry-of-skalitz-is-done-with-kingdom-come">Henry of Skalitz is Done with Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>In a post on Twitter, the Warhorse Studios team shared a short video of Tom McKay walking into a large meeting area and being met with a round of applause from the entire squad.</p>



<p>As he approached, he put his hand to his heart and said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to do my best not to cry…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full post:</p>

<p>Recently, Tom McKay also <a href="https://x.com/thisistommckay/status/1959191623407165807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">called to a close</a> his Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 streams, which were being broadcast live from Warhorse Studios’ headquarters in Prague, close to where the Kingdom Come series is set.</p>



<p>During the recent Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom, Warhorse Studios announced Legacy of the Forge, the second story DLC for KCD2, which has now been on the market for more than seven months. There’s one final DLC lined up for KCD2, and it’s Mysteria Ecclesiae, which is most likely what McKay was working on before wrapping his time at Warhorse.</p>



<p>I’m hugely hopeful that there will be another Kingdom Come Deliverance title, as I’m a huge fan of the series and hold both the games and the actors in high regard. In 2024, I was the first person <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">to interview Tom McKay</a> regarding KCD2, and we had the opportunity to catch up again at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-kingdom-comes-tom-mckay-labels-game-success-a-fever-dream/">BAFTA Games Awards in April</a>.</p>



<p>What’s your favorite memory of Tom McKay’s performance as Henry of Skalitz? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft wants King employees to use AI on a daily basis. </p>



<p>According to a new report from mobilegamer.biz, employees at the studio behind Candy Crush were given a mandate to continually use AI for general tasks.</p>



<p>Sources <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-king-layoff-lawsuits-toxic-leaders-toothless-ethics-teams-low-morale-and-mandatory-ai-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told the outlet</a> that AI usage was <strong>“introduced by Microsoft as mandatory a while ago”.</strong> They say that in 2024, the goal was to have <strong>“70 or 80% daily usage of AI”</strong>. That goal was pushed to 100% for 2025, meaning that “every artist, designer, developer, even managers have to use it” daily.</p>



<p>King was one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studios hit hardest</a> by Microsoft’s round of layoffs back in July, with 200 people being let go. At the time, it was revealed via an internal memo that the studio was going to “unlock” more AI tools for productivity” and that many employees will be <strong>“replaced by the AI tools they built and trained.”</strong> Those tools include ones for narrative, testing, and level design.</p>



<p>As far as adoption goes, one source told Mobile Gamer that <strong>“AI adoption is very low apart from ChatGPT”</strong> and that even the leadership at King is skeptical of AI’s role in the studio.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to King and Microsoft regarding these claims. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Baby Steps is now the fifth game to get delayed due to Hollow Knight: Silksong. Just yesterday, indie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/demonschool-delayed-november-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG Demonschool</a> pushed its release date to November in order to avoid Silksong. Now, even a Devolver Digital-backed game is getting out of Hornet’s way.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Baby Steps is the newest game from Bennett Foddy, whose games QWOP and Getting Over It provided joy and frustration to players. The challenging gameplay was a hit with both YouTubers and streamers, so, naturally, the new ambitious Baby Steps has been on many people’s radar. Unfortunately, it seems you’ll have to wait a few weeks longer to play it.</p>

<p>Devolver Digital <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5apDFK64tI">released a video</a> earlier today announcing the delay of Baby Steps. The game will now release on September 23rd, 2025 instead of the slated September 8th date. In a not-so-subtle fashion, the protagonist is seen walking on a model of Hornet. As Silksong’s protagonist is Hornet, it’s obvious that the delay is, at least somewhat, due to Team Cherry’s highly anticipated spinoff.</p>



<p>Bennett Foddy’s Baby Steps joins five other indie titles pushed after Silksong’s surprise announcement last week. Those delayed games are as follows: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3314790/view/520848458437886253?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CloverPit</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/frogteam.games/post/3lwwege2ipc2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stomp and the Sword of Miracles</a>, <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aeterna Lucis</a>, Demonschool, and now Baby Steps. </p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is one of <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s most wishlisted games</a>, so it was likely that titles would avoid releasing next to it. However, due to it being September 4th, less than two weeks away, it’s caused a panic in the indie scene. As many developers have said, including Bennett Foddy before the delay, via <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aftermath</a>, gamers’ attention will all be on Silksong come next week.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-call-of-duty-skins-or-weapons-will-carry-over-activision-has-said-that-before.1281171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a reversal of plans, Activision has announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t allow weapons, operators, or operator skins to carry forward from Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>In a community update posted on Tuesday, Activision says that it has seen the discussion about “the identity of Call of Duty”.</p>



<p><strong>“Some of you have said we’ve drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded,” </strong><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. <strong>“That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.”</strong></p>



<p>The publisher continues to say that developers Treyarch and Raven’s “north star” is to bring players a true spiritual successor to Black Ops 2. Because of that comes the decision to remove carry forward options. The publisher says the decision was ultimately made in order make Black Ops 7 <strong>“feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</strong></p>



<p>Now, wanting to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-content-will-no-longer-carry-forward-into-black-ops-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep things authentic</a> to the new game is understandable, but there’s one problem: they’ve kind of said this before.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-this-isn-t-the-first-time">This isn’t the first time</h2>



<p>Ahead of the release of Black Ops 6, Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions#Content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced that content</a> from Modern Warfare 2 and 3 wouldn’t carry forward to the new game. At the time, they said that it was done to allow players to <strong>“experience the Black Ops universe the way it’s meant to be played.”</strong></p>



<p>Again, it’s understandable. But then, it only took a few months before Black Ops 6 became filled with operators and skins such as Beavis and Butt-head, Jay and Silent Bob, Stan Smith, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and more. All done in the name of, apparently, “keeping that signature Black Ops style.” </p>



<p>To give credit, reports did surface earlier this year that Activision was aware that certain skins <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-skins-make-game-look-stupid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the game “look stupid”</a>. Still, after that report, more skins like the American Dad crossover came out, continuing the trend.</p>



<p>Recently, our Tom Henderson wrote about Call of Duty executives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being worried</a> about the competition from EA’s Battlefield 6. Sources told Henderson that many at the top believe Call of Duty is “too big to fail”. While that might be true in a sense, it seems that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaction and interest</a> in Battlefield 6—along with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/this-made-me-pre-order-battlefield-6-fans-react-to-black-ops-7-gameplay-trailer/">the negative reactions</a> to the Black Ops 6 reveal—has changed some thoughts.</p>



<p>You’d like to think that Activision truly has listened to the community regarding the over-the-top nature of some of the operators and skins that have made their way to Call of Duty in recent years. But, then again, if these crossovers are going to continue to print money for Activision and Microsoft, how long until they pick up again with Black Ops 7? History suggests players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BlackOps7Skins-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t have to wait long</a> to find out.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-bloober-wants-to-conquer-the-world-again.1281147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team’s journey could easily be the plot of a Hollywood film. Since the release of Layers of Fear in 2016, the Polish studio has experienced a rollercoaster of hits and misses, often delivering titles that were met with mixed reactions from both players and critics.</p>



<p>But everything changed in 2024 with the launch of Silent Hill 2 Remake. Bloober nailed it—reviving one of the most iconic survival horror games with a fresh yet respectful approach. The remake’s success catapulted the studio’s reputation, establishing them as true craftsmen of psychological horror. Naturally, expectations for their next original IP, Cronos: The New Dawn, skyrocketed.</p>



<p>Thanks to an invitation from Bloober Team, I had the chance to play the first 30 minutes of the game during a hands-on demo at Gamescom 2025—and I couldn’t be more impressed.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-preview-meet-the-traveler">Cronos: The New Dawn Preview – Meet the Traveler</h2>



<p>In Cronos: The New Dawn, you play as the Traveler—a kind of soldier dispatched by an entity known as the Collective to a bleak future. Your mission? Travel back to 1980s Poland and rescue select individuals from a catastrophic event.</p>



<p>The opening moments are intentionally cryptic. Who are the Travelers? What is the Collective’s true role? And what exactly caused the event? The game throws these questions at you, trusting the narrative to unravel them gradually.</p>



<p>During my session, I came across several collectibles that added depth to the world and enriched the immersive storytelling Bloober is known for. Surprisingly, the combat reminded me a lot of <em>Dead Space</em>—in the best way possible.</p>



<p>The Traveler starts off equipped with a pistol capable of two firing modes: a standard shot and a charged blast that deals heavy damage and can interrupt enemy charges.</p>



<p>Ammo is scarce, so melee combat becomes essential. You can punch enemies to create space and escape quickly—especially since their reaction time is fast. One standout mechanic is “fusion”: if a living enemy reaches the corpses of two fallen foes, it can merge with them, becoming faster and more powerful. To prevent this, the Traveler can deploy a flame cylinder that burns bodies on the ground.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Deixar os inimigos se fundirem resulta em grandes problemas</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-intuition-and-isolation">Intuition and Isolation</h2>



<p>I don’t usually play survival horror games, but <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> made me reconsider—largely thanks to its smart level design. Exploration, environmental puzzles, and progression are all intuitive and never frustrating. With a bit of attention, even genre newcomers can navigate the world with ease.</p>



<p>The intuitive design is paired with a haunting sense of isolation. Cold color palettes dominate the environments, reinforcing the feeling of desolation. The world has ended—and chaos is all that remains. Complementing the visuals are eerie sound effects and a retrofuturistic soundtrack that blends synthetic tones with organic instruments.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-bloober-do-it-again">Can Bloober Do It Again?</h2>



<p>By the end of the demo, I didn’t want to stop playing. The immersive atmosphere, the unanswered questions, and the brutal, strategic combat left me eager for more. Based on what I played, Cronos: The New Dawn is shaping up to be another major win for Bloober Team.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we won’t need to wait long to see if the final game is great or not. <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> launches on September 5th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Davy x Jones HANDS-ON PREVIEW: A New Take on the Pirate Legend]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/davy-x-jones-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/davy-x-jones-hands-on-preview-a-new-take-on-the-pirate-legend.1281087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At Gamescom 2025, I had the opportunity to try out Davy X Jones, the latest IP from Polish studio Parasight, thanks to a special invite. Right from the start, it’s clear the team has a passion for reimagining legendary figures from human history—always with their own unique twist.</p>



<p>Their previous title, Blacktail, retold the tale of Yaga (yes, Baba Yaga) through Parasight’s narrative lens. In Davy X Jones, as the name suggests, we step into the boots of the infamous Davy Jones, who’s on a revenge-fueled quest against Blackbeard. After being killed, Davy’s head is separated from his body—creating a bizarre but brilliant duo of protagonists.</p>



<p>This split isn’t just for laughs (though the banter between head and body is genuinely funny); it also plays a key role in gameplay. The head performs specific actions, like devouring orbs that restore health, adding a clever layer to combat and exploration.</p>



<p>Speaking of combat, it channels the frantic energy of the DOOM franchise. Each of Jones’s arms wields a weapon—a bladed hook and a pistol. While the ranged mechanics felt solid, the melee system could use some refinement. At times, hits lacked impact. Thankfully, the game still has time to polish things up, thanks to the early access launch plan.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One thing that caught me off guard was the difficulty. You need to stay on the move constantly, dodging and parrying enemy projectiles—or you’ll be dead in a few hits. Sadly, the demo didn’t include any scenes with Abby, the whale-ship that serves as the game’s hub and crew management area.</p>



<p>Progression systems weren’t showcased either, so I didn’t get a taste of how character upgrades or gear improvements work. Still, I walked away impressed. Having played Parasight’s previous work, I can confidently say Davy X Jones feels more refined across the board—even in its pre-release state. I’ll definitely be diving into early access when it drops on August 28.</p>
