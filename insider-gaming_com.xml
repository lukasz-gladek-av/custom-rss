<p>Over the past four months, Polish game developer CD Projekt Red has hired over 50 new employees to work on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-wont-let-the-witcher-4-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> and other titles. The new entry in the iconic Witcher series is the only project currently in production, but CDPR has boosted the working numbers of almost all its other project departments.</p>



<h2 id="h-cdpr-has-been-increasing-the-size-of-almost-all-its-project-teams">CDPR Has Been Increasing the Size of Almost All its Project Teams</h2>



<p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/03/cd-projekt-group-presentation-fy-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> its earnings statement for the 2024 fiscal year today, highlighting the continuing success of Cyberpunk 2077 and the excitement built around The Witcher 4’s announcement. CDPR states that The Witcher 4 had the most watched trailer from The Game Awards’ slate of game premieres and had the most press coverage (measured in total article appearances and headlines).</p>



<p>Between the end of November (just a couple weeks before The Game Awards) and the end of this past February, CDPR brought on 57 new employees. 11 of those employees joined the already massive team working on The Witcher 4, increasing the total number to 411.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>However, the project that got the largest increase to its total size is the team working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-project-orion-2077-warm-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orion, the codename for Cyberpunk sequel</a> project. Over the last four months, that team increased by 20, growing from 64 to 84 employees. Prior to the start of this hiring wave, CDPR says they reached 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077 sold, and over 8 million copies sold of the critically acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion.</p>



<p>Fans shouldn’t expect the Cyberpunk sequel, or realistically any major CDPR release, anytime soon. The Witcher 4 is still in production, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-witcher-multiplayer-game-has-development-rebooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the multiplayer Witcher project known as Sirius</a> is still in pre-production, and the Witcher remake, the Cyberpunk sequel, and a new IP project codenamed Hadar are still in their concept phases. There are also some unannounced projects in the works, including one from Fool’s Theory, who are also working on the Witcher remake.</p>

<p>Moonshot Games, a studio under Dreamhaven, has revealed its brand new online multiplayer shooter Wildgate. Set to launch on Xbox Series, PlayStation 5, and PC later this year, Wildgate is a PvPvE crew-based first-person shooter that sees players travel into a vast area of space with the goal of capturing an ancient relic known as the Artifact.</p>



<p>The game features 20 player matches with five teams of four. Each team enters an area of space known as The Reach with a mission to capture the Artifact and make it through the Wildgate itself.</p>



<h6 id="h-preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year">PREVIEW: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wildgate Could Be The Multiplayer Game Of The Year</a></h6>



<p>Every match can take anywhere from 20 to 40-plus minutes to complete as you explore and fight through a map that features procedurally placed elements. You choose one of five available prospectors—each having different abilities and tools at their disposal—and board one of five ships that also have different specializations. From there, how you play is up to you and your crew. You can choose to look for the Artifact quickly and escape or build up your ship to destroy those also looking for the rare relic. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ships can be upgraded throughout the match with new weapons, shields, and more to make it withstand the harsh elements of the Reach. You also can find new gear through various points of interest you encounter on your journey.</p>



<p>“Wildgate was designed for anyone that’s ever wanted to go on a daring space adventure alongside a fearless crew,” Moonshot Games studio head Jason Chayes said via release. “Players are invited to work together and confront evolving cosmic threats – whether they’re mysterious hazards of the Reach – or presented by rival Prospectors.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, Wildgate will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC in 2025. There are plans to hold multiple playtests for players to get their first look at the game ahead of release. The first such playtest will take place from April 10-14 with <a href="https://www.playwildgate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">signups open now</a>.</p>
