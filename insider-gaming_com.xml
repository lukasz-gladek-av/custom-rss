<p>When Battlefield 6 launches, it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-bots-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected that AI bots</a> will be used to fill out matches should there not be enough players. In the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, however, AI bots won’t be everywhere.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the official Battlefield 6 communications team clarified how bots, or “AI soldiers” will work during the game’s beta.</p>



<p>“AI Soldiers are only present on the “Training Grounds” playlists within the Open Beta,” <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953431583223943500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the team said</a>. “This week is ‘Breakthrough Initiation’.</p>



<p>“Breakthrough Initiation is a playlist that allows you to experience Breakthrough alongside 15 other players, with additional AI Soldiers filling up the match thereafter.”</p>



<p>DICE says that Training Grounds playlists are available to “introduce people to the core elements of Breakthrough, and offer a smoother experience than a full lobby.”</p>



<p>“Additionally, you can experience Breakthrough without AI Soldiers by playing Breakthrough from the “Featured” playlist row,” they added. “Training Grounds is only available for the first 15 ranks, at which point it will disappear from the front end.”</p>



<p>Currently, Battlefield 6’s Beta is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-game-servers-full-players-queue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being filled by hundreds of thousands</a> of players ahead of the official start of the “open” portion on August 9. If players were worried about bots being a part of traditional matches, it appears that won’t be the case.</p>



<p>As mentioned, however, the game is expected to use bots to fill up lobbies should there not be enough players for a match. They can also be used, as DICE’s Jac Carlsson said, when creating a custom game mode in Portal that allows players to practice and improve at the game.</p>

<p>Starting today, Xbox Insiders who have enrolled in the PC Gaming Preview will find Gaming Copilot (beta) in the Game Bar for Windows PCs. </p>



<p>Gaming Copilot is a feature that helps players reach gameplay faster, sharpens their skills, and guides them through obstacles. The early beta version was previously available through the Xbox Mobile app, enabling players to access Copilot on a second screen. Now, select players have received an even more integrated experience. </p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The Gaming Copilot beta will track the player’s Xbox activity “to provide an experience centred around you”. Players can ask for help with the game they are playing, or with games they are interested in or want to discover. Additionally, you can also ask questions about your account, play history and achievements. </p>



<p>The Gaming Copilot widgets can be pinned to the screen and used through Voice mode. This mode allows players to use the feature while actively playing the game. Players can ask for tips or any other help without stopping the gameplay. All they need to do is select the ‘Microphone’ option in the Gaming Copilot widget, and the conversation can be continued seamlessly whenever the player is stuck. </p>



<p>Moreover, when the Xbox Insider asks Gaming Copilot for help during voice mode, it will take screenshots of the player’s gameplay to provide more helpful responses. This allows players to refer to events in the game as they occur, without needing a detailed description. </p>



<p>The Gaming Copilot (beta) is also available on Windows Handhelds for Xbox Insiders, albeit with limited functionality. The early preview is currently available only to Insiders in select regions. You can check out the complete list <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/06/gaming-copilot-beta-begins-rolling-out-to-xbox-insiders-on-game-bar-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>
