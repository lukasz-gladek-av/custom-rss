            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>CWA Canada, the union representing 61 of the 71 employees who lost their jobs last week when Ubisoft Halifax was shut down, have officially filed a legal complaint.</p>



<p>The complaint accuses Ubisoft of “shutting down its Halifax studio to keep out the union”.</p>







<p><strong>“It’s against the law to stop workers from joining a union in Canada, but the slap on the wrist employers often get is not enough to stop this,” </strong>CWA Canada President Carmel Smyth said in a release. <strong>“The penalty should reflect the reality of intentional corporate bullying.”</strong></p>



<p>Ubisoft has denied that the closure was related to its employees joining the Union. They <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim that the closure</a> had been in the plans <strong>“well before”</strong> the staff unionized. The France-based company said that the decision came as part of the company’s 24-month process to <strong>“streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-cwa-is-looking-for-from-the-board">What The CWA Is Looking For From The Board</h2>



<p>The CWA says that after the layoffs were announced, the union’s lawyers contacted Ubisoft to demand records and information related to the claim that the decision was done entirely out of <strong>“financial necessity”</strong>.</p>







<p>The union is requesting that the labor law be updated to give labor boards, like the Nova Scotia Labor Board, the ability to force employers to reopen for a year. They also request that employers either help find other work for impacted staff or pay laid-off workers three years’ salary. </p>



<p><strong>“Ubisoft took $12 million in taxpayer money from the government of Nova Scotia to nurture a generation of talent, and to build a tech industry,”</strong> Smyth said. <strong>“Now it’s walking away without so much as an apology.”</strong></p>

<p>The first handful of games coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog in January 2026 have been leaked ahead of the official reveal.</p>



<p>Known leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-premium-on-connait-les-titres-majeurs-de-janvier-2026-60850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Billbil-kun</a> has revealed the first six games that will be announced. </p>







<p>For PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, five of the games being added this month are Resident Evil Village (PS5 | PS4), Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5 | PS4), Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5 | PS4), A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5 | PS4), and art of rally (PS5 | PS4). </p>



<p>For Premium subscribers who enjoy classic games, the catalog will also see the PlayStation 1 classic Ridge Racer added. As mentioned in the report, both Ridge Racer 2 and Ridge Racer Type 4 are already available in the Classics catalog. </p>



<p>All of the games, per the report, will be available starting January 20. </p>







<p>While those six games are likely based on Billbil-kun’s track record, it should be taken with a grain of salt until the official announcement. It’s also unknown just how many games will be added to the library this month. The full reveal of the rest of the games is expected to happen on Wednesday, January 14. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Year In Review Finally Released For 2025]]></title>

            <guid>1405108</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two weeks into 2026, and Nintendo has finally released its Year In Review for Switch and Switch 2 players. </p>



<p>To access your Nintendo 2025 Year In Review, simply go to the <a href="https://year-in-review.nintendo.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recap’s landing page</a> and sign in with your Nintendo Account. From there, you’ll see stats such as the number of games you played, and the amount of time spent on the system.</p>







<p>In addition, you’ll find out the games you played the most, the types of games you favored, and a month-by-month breakdown of how much you played. </p>



<p><strong>“Your Nintendo Switch 2025 Year in Review has arrived,” </strong>Nintendo said on social media. <strong>“Check out not only your 2025 adventures, but memories from past years with your Nintendo Switch as well.”</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo joins other platforms like Steam and PlayStation with their “wrapped” or year in review features. The only one of the major platforms that didn’t release one for 2025 was Xbox. Microsoft skipped this year, reportedly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbbox-wrapped-not-coming-budget-constraints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to budget constraints</a>. </p>



<p>As far as why Nintendo waited so long to release this time around, that hasn’t been mentioned. Past versions came in the weeks leading up to Christmas, making 2025’s the latest one yet. </p>







<p>What did your Nintendo Year In Review reveal about your playtime on the Switch and/or Switch 2?
