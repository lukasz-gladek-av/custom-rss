<p>Pokémon has announced Pokémon Champions, a new title developed for mobile and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>The announcement was made during the Pokémon Presents showcase, where it was said that the title will be focused on Pokémon battles that “you know and love from core Pokémon games.”</p>

<iframe title="Pokemon Champions Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9t-KdSW5iHs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Pokémon Champions will be a multiplayer game where players can matchmake with others around the world.</p>



<p>GAME FREAK is said to be carrying out the planning for the project, while development will be handled by The Pokémon Works.</p>



<p>Players will also be able to connect with Pokémon HOME, meaning you’ll be able to use Pokémon from previous Pokémon games in Pokémon Champions.</p>



<p>No release date was announced for Pokémon Champions, but base on the announcement, it seems like it could be a ways away from release.</p>

<p>PlayStation has announced that the PlayStation VR2 will be getting a worldwide price reduction in March 2025.</p>



<p>Announced in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/27/a-great-new-price-for-playstation-vr2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, the PSVR2 will now start at a new retail price of $399.99 / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980.</p>



<p>For those whop want to purchase the Call of the Mountain Bundle, the recommend retail price will be $399.99 / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980. The bundle includes a PlayStation Store voucher code for Horizon Call of the Mountain, PS VR2 headset, PS VR2 Sense controller, and stereo headphones.</p>



<p>Announced in November 2022, the PlayStation VR2 started at $549.99 / €599.99 / £529.99 / ¥74,980, which was considered a hefty price at the time for a limited amount of games and the need to purchase a PlayStation 5 alongside it.</p>



<p>PlayStation points out that PSVR2’s catalogue of games is now better then ever, “With recently released hits like&nbsp;Alien: Rogue Incursion,&nbsp;Skydance’s Behemoth, and&nbsp;Metro Awakening VR, and exciting new game launches on the way including&nbsp;Aces of Thunder,&nbsp;Dreams of Another,&nbsp;Hitman World of Assassination, and&nbsp;The Midnight Walk, it’s never been a better time to jump into the action with PS VR2. Using the&nbsp;PS VR2 PC Adapter, players will also have access to browse, buy and play thousands of virtual reality games on Steam. Title release dates and regional availability may vary.”</p>



<p>The blog post continued, “In addition, with a recent update to PS VR2, it now supports low-latency hand tracking is now supported, which allows developers to create games that tracks a player’s hand position and movement through the cameras embedded on the PS VR2 headset. Through this new feature, players will be able to experience intuitive controls in supported games such as<em>&nbsp;</em>Waltz of the Wizard.”</p>



<p>Will you be buying the PlayStation VR2 at its new price point? Let us know down below and over at the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1705/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-platforms-editions/</link>

<p>The Little Nightmares 3 release window is locked in. A painful delay pushed a dagger into the heart of everyone excited for the innovative sequel. With Supermassive Games now at the helm, there’s a tangible sense of anticipation, and Little Nightmares 3 information is available already.</p>



<p>There’s a small pocket of repressed Little Nightmares trauma locked away in my brain. From my first run-in with Little Nightmares to the sequel, Tarsier Studios did a great job of making me feel trapped, defenseless, and helpless. Little Nightmares 3 looks like another mysterious and miserable meander through horror and hellacious hell, this time in the Nowhere.</p>



<p>Little Nightmares 3 was scheduled for 2024, but a delay impacted its debut. A new release window has been confirmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-little-nightmares-3-releases">Do we Know When Little Nightmares 3 Releases? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s going to be a scarily good time. Credit to Supermassive Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>An exact Little Nightmares 3 release date hasn’t been declared by Supermassive Games or Bandai Namco, but we know it’s scheduled to arrive sometime in 2025.</strong></p>



<p>May 31, 2024, was the day <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3 was delayed to 2025</a>. It was a dark day, and I shut myself in my room and sulked.</p>



<p>Both developer and publisher declared in a <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> they have been “Working hard towards delivering the best experience possible for the next entry in the franchise.” Here’s hoping we don’t have to wait too long for a concrete date.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-little-nightmares-3-platforms">All Little Nightmares 3 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Bandai Namco and Supermassive Games are giving Little Nightmares 3 a wider launch on PlayStation</strong> <strong>4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</strong></p>



<p>It always brings me joy to tell gamers a game is coming out on all platforms. No one misses out, everyone has a chance to get involved, and the title ultimately benefits. Little Nightmares 3 has a big chance to keep the series’ momentum moving in a healthy direction. </p>



<p>I’d also wager a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port could happen if Nintendo feels the need to cast its net out even further.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-how-much-little-nightmares-3-is">Do we Know How Much Little Nightmares 3 is?</h2>



<p><strong><strong>The Little Nightmares 3 price hasn’t been revealed yet, and the ability to wishlist the game is currently the only option.</strong></strong></p>



<p>We’re still on for a 2025 release, but the price is a mystery. It may be a case of leaving it until the final few weeks once an official release date is announced. If I use Little Nightmares 2 as an example, the first sequel retailed at <strong>$29.99 and £24.99</strong>.</p>



<p>I can see Little Nightmares 3 either sticking to this price point, or because of extra work, slightly increasing Little Nightmares 3’s RRP to <strong>$34.99 and £29.99</strong>. This is guesswork, but don’t be shocked if it ends up in this ballpark.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m ready for the new nightmares, are you? Will you be playing solo? Or are you grateful to finally have someone’s hand to hold through the visual hellscape unfolding before your eyes?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Killing Floor 3 Coming To Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-killing-floor-3-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-killing-floor-3-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1120254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-killing-floor-3-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Tripwire Interactive’s Killing Floor 3 is another bout of beautiful violence. Eviscerating Zeds and leaving them for dead is the name of the game—well, Killing Floor 3 is. If it’s your first time or you’re a returning fan, here’s the Xbox Game Pass status for the FPS title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a> is already testing the waters well ahead of time. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-announced-along-with-closed-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed beta</a> lets players see what’s new, what works, and what needs fine-tuning. The second installment was fun but had a penchant for repetition, and the third mainline release is looking to be the best yet.</p>



<p>Eventually, Killing Floor 3 will launch, and if it’s on Xbox Game Pass, this is a victory before we even play the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-killing-floor-3-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Killing Floor 3 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sir, this is a Wendy’s. Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Xbox Game Pass is not adding Killing Floor 3 to its collection of easily accessible games.</strong></p>



<p>You get access to hundreds of games if you’re a Microsoft Xbox Game Pass subscriber. Many of these arrive as day-one debuts on the Game Pass scheme. However, <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Killing Floor 3</a> is not a day-one addition as Tripwire Interactive and Microsoft don’t have an agreement for it to happen.</p>



<p>There’s no mention of Killing Floor 3 coming to Game Pass on its official store page. Nor has the opportunity been mentioned in any trailers, prerelease material, or press releases.</p>



<p>Titles associated with Xbox Game Studios are pretty much day-one Game Pass releases. Any other third-party titles are not guaranteed and it’s up to the two companies to come to an understanding. If not, the game launches of its own accord and it’s up to the publisher to drive sales. In this case, Tripwire Interactive is handling both development and publishing duties, so it’s up to them to generate interest and revenue for KF3.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-killing-floor-3-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Killing Floor 3 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s uncertain if Killing Floor 3 is coming to Xbox Game Pass at any point.</strong></p>



<p>The closest KF has come to Xbox’s Game Pass subscription service was in 2024 when Killing Floor 2 was offered as a “Free Play Days” promotion. Game Pass users were allowed to sample Killing Floor 2 for a few days. After this, the title went back to being another purchasable option on the Xbox store.</p>



<p>We’ll update this guide if Killing Floor 3 does come to Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<hr>
