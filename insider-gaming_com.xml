<p>Microsoft says that Xbox hardware sales have gone down 29%, leading to a roughly $113 million revenue loss year over year. The news comes after, earlier in October, the company increased <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the price of Game Pass</a> to much controversy.</p>



<p>Xbox, despite having some well-received titles recently like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-world-record-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and The Outer Worlds 2, has had a rough time recently. Massive cancellations of Game Pass and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/costco-has-reportedly-decided-to-stop-selling-xbox-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even removal from Costco</a> have not done well for the gaming team at Microsoft. Unfortunately, it seems like it has spread to its sales, as the company reports a 2% loss in total revenue.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-reports-notable-drop-in-sales-for-xbox-compared-to-last-q1">Microsoft Reports Notable Drop in Sales for Xbox Compared to Last Q1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Microsoft </figcaption></figure>



<p>In the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) Q1 report from Microsoft, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company revealed</a> that Xbox did not reach the same heights as it did last Q1 for FY25. Having made $5.621 billion last Q1, the gaming subcompany went down to $5.508 billion, losing around $113 million. This also marks a 2% loss in total revenue, which is not great, but not too bad. The press release does mention the drop, stating,</p>



<p><strong>“Xbox hardware revenue decreased 29% driven by lower volume of consoles sold,”</strong> the company said. <strong>“Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% on a strong prior year comparable with growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content, offset in part by a decline in first-party content.”</strong></p>



<p>It’s important to note that the mentioned 1% increase comes from splitting content and services away from hardware, showing how each specific subsector is performing.</p>



<p>Whether Xbox can regain ground from its loss remains to be seen. It recently announced that Halo: Campaign Evolved is coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>, continuing the company’s third-party movement forward. Xbox is planning a big year in 2026 with releases like Forza Horizon 6, Clockwork Revolution, and Fable. It’ll be interesting to see how it pans out and whether it can save face, regardless of how good its new games could be.</p>



<p>Overall, for Microsoft, the numbers aren’t bad as the company announced its operating income was up 24% to $38 billion while it saw a  12% total net income increase to $27.7 billion.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty League 2026 season is shaping up nicely now that the full schedule and running order have been revealed. Next year, the Call of Duty League will go to <strong>three countries</strong> in an unprecedented global tour that takes the CDL further than ever. It was also revealed that, <strong>thankfully</strong>, Control is being removed from the CDL rotation and will be replaced with an all-new mode.</p>



<p>Control was never awful, but the slow tempo, limited map pool, and tricky mechanics have long stood in the way of the mode being a complete success with fans of the COD League. It became suffocating during the 2025 CDL season when it was confined to just <strong>two maps</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-mode-is-replacing-control-in-the-cdl">What Mode is Replacing Control in the CDL?</h2>



<p>Control is officially being replaced after <strong>many years </strong>by Overload, a brand-new mode released alongside Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. In Overload, players are forced to contend with dynamic objectives, rapid respawn timers, wider map compatibility, and much clearer win conditions, all wrapped up in a mode that’s not too different from Capture the Flag.</p>



<p>The 2025 CDL season wrapped a few months ago, and now that it is dead and gone, so too is Control.</p>



<p>Despite being a staple of the COD League since 2018, the popularity of the mode declined, and quite drastically so in recent years. It was a mode that didn’t accommodate too much strategy, and it was ultimately something too repetitive to be hugely enjoyable</p>



<p>Overload goes the other way entirely, revealing positive results in tests and drawing nice feedback from the fans that’s sure to make it a winning formula when the CDL 2026 season goes live on December 5.</p>



<p>In some social circles, Overload has been dubbed ‘the most CDL-ready mode in years’, given that it perfectly accommodates the competitive flow that users expect from the COD League.</p>



<p>Do you think Overload will be a nice reset to the COD League formula going into the CDL 2026 season? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League’s grand reveal has just taken place for the 2026 season, and fans are immensely excited. The new season starts on December 5, and in the months that follow, the CDL 2026 season will greet fans in three countries. Majors are set to take place in the United States, England, and France, all wrapping up with a grand COD Champs event in <strong>Las Vegas</strong>.</p>



<p>Plenty of changes are coming for the new season, including the first 10-team Major, the return of Minor tournaments, and beefed-up Challengers opportunities at <strong>every LAN event in the season</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-cdl-2026-schedule-looks-insane">CDL 2026 Schedule Looks Insane</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/news/2026-season-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty League 2026</a> schedule is already running wild. It confirms my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-league-return-to-europe-and-uk-2026/">earlier exclusive reports</a> that the COD League is coming to the United Kingdom, as well as hosting a Major in Paris, France. It also confirms the placement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-champs-2026-hosted-faze-las-vegas/">COD Champs in Las Vegas</a>, which I exclusively revealed earlier this year.</p>



<p>Here’s the schedule for the 2026 Call of Duty League:</p>



<ul>
<li>Opening Weekend: December 5 – 7</li>



<li>Major I (Dallas, Texas): January 29 – February 1</li>



<li>Major II (DreamHack UK): March 27 – 29</li>



<li>Minor I: April 24 – 26</li>



<li>Major III (DreamHack Atlanta): May TBC</li>



<li>Minor II: June 5 – 7</li>



<li>Major IV (Paris, France): June 25 – 28</li>



<li>COD Championship (Las Vegas, Nevada): July 16 – 19</li>
</ul>



<p>Major III at DreamHack Atlanta will be a Pro-Am event, and the Minor tournaments will feature teams <strong>outside </strong>the core CDL structure, as will Major II in Birmingham, UK.</p>



<p>It has already been too long since the end of the last season, during which OpTic Texas claimed the top spot and won the first back-to-back COD Champs in Call of Duty esports history. The team would then go on to win at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, solidifying a spot in the history books.</p>



<p>The team is set to host Major I in Dallas, Texas, at the end of January – will the winning streak continue on home turf?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ai-cant-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-ceo-says/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ai-can%E2%80%99t-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-ceo-says.1338598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 hasn’t been released yet, but people are already asking about the franchise’s future. Specifically, how will AI change the development of Grand Theft Auto 7 and beyond?</p>



<p>During an interview this week in New York City, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick was asked about AI and its place in game development. While he’s not fully against the idea of AI, Zelnick remains skeptical about just how much it can and will help game development and general production. That includes making sure that what his company builds remains with the company. </p>



<p><strong>“We have to protect our intellectual property, but more than that, we have to be mindful of others,” </strong>Strauss <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told CNBC</a>. <strong>“If you create intellectual property with AI, it’s not protectable.”</strong></p>



<p>When talking specifically about Grand Theft Auto, Zelnick said even if there were no constraints on how AI can be used, it wouldn’t be able to produce what the team at Rockstar has been able to do.</p>



<p><strong>“Let’s say there were no constraints [on AI],”</strong> he said. <strong>“Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the Grand Theft Auto marketing plan? The answer is no. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“A, you can’t do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn’t end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as why, Zelnick said that AI is “backward looking”. AI productions, he said, can “feel new” because of the predictive models, and though there are things the data it’s built on can solve for, there are still areas that it simply can’t.</p>



<p><strong>“Anything that involves backward-looking data compute, it’s really good for that and that applies to lots of things,” </strong>Zelnick said. <strong>“What we do at Take-Two, anything that isn’t attached to that, it’s going to be really, really bad at.”</strong></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is currently scheduled to launch on May 26, 2026, for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. </p>
