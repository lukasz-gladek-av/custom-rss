            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/emiru-releases-damning-statement-after-twitch-assault-%E2%80%98this-is-definitely-my-last-twitchcon%E2%80%99.1328815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, videos surfaced showing a harrowing assault on Emiru at TwitchCon in San Diego this weekend. While participating in a meet-and-greet with fans, the prolific creator was approached by a man who forcefully embraced her, attempting to kiss her in front of a crowd that included security staff.</p>



<p>It was an event that has been lambasted by attendees and viewers, with Twitch’s management and security of the event coming under fire from numerous angles. In response to the event, Emiru, a cosplay and League of Legends streamer with two million followers, posted a lengthy statement berating Twitch and how the firm handled the assault.</p>



<h2 id="h-that-is-a-blatant-lie-emiru-says">‘That is a Blatant Lie’, Emiru Says</h2>



<p>Emiru was attacked by a man at TwitchCon, and while the Twitch leadership and social teams stressed the incident was handled professionally, Emiru had other things to declare that directly conflict with those claims.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full statement from Emiru</a> following the TwitchCon assault:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, the man who assaulted me was allowed to cross multiple barriers at twitchcon and even in front of another creators meet and greet to grab me and my face and try to kiss me. Fortunately he wasn’t able to, but a lot of people have pointed out it could have been a lot worse!</p>



<p>I’m obviously shaken up by what happened and it’s not the first time I’ve dealt with something like this, but to tell you honestly, I am a lot more hurt and upset by how Twitch handled it during and after the fact. </p>



<p>Like I said, I don’t understand how he was allowed to make it to me in the first place. The security in the clip who reacts is my own security (it’s true my favorite and usual security guard was banned for holding a stalkers arm to bring him to police, at a past Twitchcon)</p>



<p>However, there were at least 3 or 4 other TwitchCon security staff in the area who did not react and let the guy walk away, as you can see in the clip since they don’t even appear in the frame LOL </p>



<p>The woman who is walking me away is my own personal manager, and behind the booth, the only two people who were checking on me and comforting me were her and my friend. None of the Twitchcon staff came to ask what happened or if I was okay. </p>



<p>My friend who was present told me Twitch security were also behind the booth afterwards joking about how they didn’t even see what happened and immediately laughing and moving on to talking about something else.</p>



<p>So if no one was checking if I was okay or if I needed anything and they let the guy run away initially, I have no idea what anyone hired to keep the event safe was doing LOL </p>



<p>In Twitch’s statement they said that the guy was immediately caught and detained, I’m sorry but that is a blatant lie. He was allowed to walk away from my meet and greet and I didn’t hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because Twitchcon staff present thought it was a big deal. </p>



<p>I have a lot more I want to say but I will say it on stream later today instead of writing a book on here. </p>



<p>Thank you guys again, sorry you all had to see that. This is definitely my last Twitchcon, and it saddens me to say as a 10 year off and on attendee of Twitchcon, I think other creators should seriously consider not attending in the future. I did not feel cared for or protected, even bringing my own security and staff. I can’t imagine how creators without those options would feel.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some have compared the gravity of the event to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36506082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shooting of Christina Grimmie</a>, a YouTube star turned professional artist who was gunned down in Florida almost a decade ago during an autograph signing event. It’s impossible to know the intentions of some before it’s too late.</p>



<p>This video shows the moment Emiru was assaulted:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following Emiru being assaulted at TwitchCon, her fans took to social media platforms to hurl accusations and insults at Twitch for their handling of the incident, which has now been revealed as lacklustre at best.</p>



<p>TwitchCon continues to be a source of controversy and ill topics regardless of where it’s held or what Twitch does to keep it as secure as possible. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ve got any horror stories from this year’s TwitchCon event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of another week, but hopefully your streak has made it to the end, too! We’re looking at the latest NYT Connections hints and solutions in this guide, helping you to figure out the fastest way to solve today’s puzzle. It’s not so tough, but if you want to continue your streak quickly and get on with your day, you’ll want to scroll down.</p>



<p>Here are the top NYT Connections hints for today, October 19.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-19">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 19)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #861:</p>



<ul>
<li>SPINE</li>



<li>BUG</li>



<li>MARSH</li>



<li>FREAK</li>



<li>JACKET</li>



<li>SKORT</li>



<li>COVER</li>



<li>FALL</li>



<li>FLIP</li>



<li>WIPEOUT</li>



<li>LEAVES</li>



<li>TUMBLE</li>



<li>DOVER</li>



<li>CRUNCHY</li>



<li>WIG</li>



<li>SPILL</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Unsteady footing? These words all suggest sudden loss of control</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Parts of a book—or a tree</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>When emotions run wild…</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Odd mix, but think geography and fashion</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 19.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-19-861">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 19 (#861)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– FALL, SPILL, TUMBLE, WIPEOUT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COVER, JACKET, LEAVES, SPINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BUG, FLIP, FREAK, WIG</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CRUNCHY, DOVER, MARSH, SKORT</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon’s God of War TV Series Casting Call Has Leaked]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-god-of-war-tv-series-casting-call-has-leaked.1328797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A casting call for Amazon’s upcoming God of War adaptation has leaked online from one of entertainment’s biggest insiders.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s iconic God of War series has entertained players since 2005. Unfortunately, a Hollywood adaptation has never been successfully done or thought of. In 2022, Prime Video announced that the reboot titles would be brought to streaming as a show, with many of the game’s crew producing. Just recently, reports of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-filming-march-2026-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring 2026 shooting date</a> have surfaced, meaning production is getting into motion. Now, it seems one of the most anticipated parts is underway.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-tv-series-casting-call-leaked-details-characters-and-plot">God of War TV Series Casting Call Leaked, Details Characters and Plot</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to industry insider <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1979632388855779583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK</a>, notable for his credible movie leaks, Prime Video’s God of War is currently casting for the show. In particular, a casting call for several characters, including descriptions, is available and shows some insight into the show’s direction. We see what the team is looking for for Kratos, Atreus, and other parts. The exact descriptions can be found on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/141416746?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK’s Patreon</a> and on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1oa9013/god_of_war_tv_series_casting_call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a> dedicated to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the Reddit post theorizes which description matches which God of War character, it’s up in the air. Regardless, take the leak with a grain of salt, as always. Still, it’s interesting to note a few things about the casting call. First is the description for series regular Alexander, which sounds a lot like Odin. However, Odin only makes a full appearance in Ragnarok, meaning the show may not follow the games too closely. Another interesting bit is for Joshua, likely Atreus, it lists him as a ‘one-year series regular’. This likely means that the show intends to find another actor to play the part after the first season. Atreus, in the games, does grow up, but they kept the same actor, Sunny Suljic, the whole time. </p>



<p>Given Amazon’s God of War’s upcoming start date, it’s likely we’ll have casting by the end of the year. Still, knowing these descriptions, fans can come up with even better fancasts and speculate. A few weeks back, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kratos-actor-shortlist-outlined-by-movie-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actors for Kratos surfaced</a>, and while some may not fit the description anymore, actors like Dave Bautista and in-game actor Christopher Judge still count. </p>



<p>Are you excited for Amazon’s God of War show? Who do you think would make a good Kratos and Atreus? Any other good casting choices? Let us know in the comments and on the official Insider Gaming Discord!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first script draft for the Sleeping Dogs film adaptation is finished, according to its actor and producer.</p>



<p>Released in 2012, Sleeping Dogs has become quite the cult classic. Following an undercover police officer in Hong Kong, players explore an open world with parkour abilities and martial arts. Despite positive reviews, low sales led to the series being dead in the water. However, Hollywood has gotten its hands on it, now reinvigorated by MCU’s Shang-Chi actor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-adaptation-and-sequel-mentioned-by-simu-liu/">Simu Liu</a>, who’ll star as protagonist Wei Shen. Now, according to the actor himself, it’s farther along than we thought.</p>



<h2 id="h-simu-liu-gives-new-update-on-sleeping-dogs-film-adaptation">Simu Liu Gives New Update on Sleeping Dogs Film Adaptation</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1979664278459388314?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simu Liu’s Twitter/X</a>, the actor posted two pictures, with one being of his sleepy dog, Chopa. The other image was of the official Sleeping Dogs script. In the caption, shown above, it seems it has been completed and likely sent in for feedback. Interestingly enough, the name of the writer is blocked, so it could be a surprise new addition or director. Still, after scripting is casting and, eventually, filming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While out of the blue, it’s good to know Sleeping Dogs is proceeding well with an adaptation. In the past, Donnie Yen of Rogue One fame was set to bring it to Hollywood, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-movie-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nothing turned out</a>. Fortunately, Simu Liu has been very vocal about his desire to make it happen, even producing it himself. While Sleeping Dogs didn’t sell well for games, it may now get another chance with Hollywood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A live-service Halo game may be in the works at Halo Studios, one reliable insider claims.</p>



<p>If you know Xbox, you know Halo. As a beacon for the FPS genre, the sci-fi series has been going on since 2001’s Combat Evolved. With the upcoming 25th anniversary coming up and the Halo World Championships next week, the hype for more Halo is huge. Halo Studios themselves confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-halo-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ll see something new</a> revealed there, likely the Combat Evolved remake. However, according to a credible YouTuber, we may actually see another new project, this time in the live-service genre.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-studios-may-release-a-live-service-halo-title-in-2026">Halo Studios May Release a Live-Service Halo Title in 2026</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="New Details About Halo's Future! (Exclusive Report)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4dWoH0Pa0E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dWoH0Pa0E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a video</a> from Halo Youtuber Rebs Gaming, who previously leaked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Virtuos co-development</a> for Halo CE, a new entry in the franchise will be revealed soon. The game, which will be live-service, is expected to drop next year, meaning two Halo games could come out then. Rebs says their source told them it will be similar to Fortnite, though they don’t know if it’ll feature Battle Royale. No other information was provided, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>As previously mentioned, a new Halo-focused showcase event&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-studios-new-deep-dive-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced</a>&nbsp;for the Halo World Championship on October 24th, 2025. The deep dive has been hyped by Halo Studios ever since last year. With the Halo CE remake all but confirmed, a new spinoff would be welcome news to fans. Even more so, having two new titles in 2026 makes for one great anniversary plan. Either way, fans of the series may be in for a treat come October 24th.</p>
