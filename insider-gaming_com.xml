<p>Betting in Counter-Strike has been a major factor of the game’s incredible growth, especially since the introduction of skins to CS:GO. The betting scene in Counter-Strike has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone through many changes</a>, but there’s still plenty of opportunities available to those (of legal age) who want to play.</p>



<p>These tips for betting on Counter-Strike aren’t going to tell you the teams or players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-bet-on-counter-strike-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can reliably bet on</a>. Instead, these tips will go over the best practices for betting on Counter-Strike, so that you can play safely and responsibly.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-tips-for-betting-on-counter-strike">Best tips for betting on Counter-Strike</h2>



<h3 id="h-bet-responsibly">Bet responsibly</h3>



<p>Playing responsibly when betting on Counter-Strike should be considered a rule instead of a tip. Gambling and betting can be fun, but it can also be addictive and costly if you don’t play smart. </p>



<p>Here are some essential guidelines for betting responsibly on Counter-Strike, or any game.</p>



<p><strong>Never bet more than you’re comfortable losing.</strong> This is the golden rule of betting. Placing large wagers that promise large payouts can be tempting, but if things don’t go your way, you could end up losing too much.</p>



<p><strong>Learn proper bet unit size.</strong> Knowing how much to bet is crucial to playing responsibly and sustainably. To do this, you’ll need to establish your bankroll.</p>



<ul>
<li>A bankroll is the amount of money you set aside to bet with for a specific amount of time. This can either be for a season, a month, or even a year.</li>



<li>Your bankroll determines your unit size, which is how much you bet with. For example, if you have a $100 bankroll set aside for a month, your unit size should be $1 or $2.</li>
</ul>



<p>The type of bet you place will influence the unit size you use. On a relatively safe bet with lower odds, you should bet one or two units. But for more higher risk wagers, like multi-leg parlays or longshot bets, you should be betting fractions of a unit.</p>



<h3 id="h-take-advantage-of-all-the-sites-available">Take advantage of all the sites available</h3>



<p>There are a number of websites that offer the opportunity to bet on Counter-Strike. These sites consist primarily of esports-focused sites where you can bet on professional match outcomes, and skin gambling sites. </p>



<p>Regardless of which kind of betting you’re more interested in, here are some tips for making the most out of all the sites available.</p>



<ul>
<li>Compare sites to find the best odds. When betting on Counter-Strike matches, differing sites may offer better or worse odds for the outcome you’re betting on. Taking the extra time to find the site with the best odds is worth the reward if your be hits.</li>



<li>Take advantage of sign-up/deposit bonuses. If you’re just getting into Counter-Strike betting now, there are number of sites that will offer bonuses for signing up or placing your first deposit (sometimes you’ll need a promo code). Make sure you read the full details before depositing, but taking advantage of a bonus should reward you with some additional funds.</li>
</ul>



<p>With any site though, make sure it’s a reputable, trustworthy site before you sign up or do anything else. </p>

<p>The most expensive Counter-Strike skins ever have some massive price tags associated with them. Since the introduction of in-game cosmetics to CS:GO year ago, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-cs2-skin-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">value of this skin economy</a> has steadily grown, thanks to factors like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gambling</a> and the 2023 announcement of Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<p>The Counter-Strike skin economy is so large that it’s not contained to just the official Steam community market. Dozens of sites allow players to buy and sell skins. A few uniquely rare skins have fetched a very pretty penny, but one holds the record for selling for the most amount of money.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-most-expensive-cs-go-skin-ever-sold">The Most Expensive CS:GO Skin Ever Sold</h2>



<p>The most expensive purchase of a CS:GO skin ever occurred in April 2023, just a few weeks after Valve announced CS2. This announcement caused a spike in both renewed interest in the franchise as well as skin prices, leading to what appears to be the biggest purchase ever.</p>



<p>ZipeLCS, a long-time skin trader and co-owner of the Danish organization ECSTATIC, <a href="https://x.com/zipelCS/status/1647582159245385729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that they had sold <strong>a StatTrak Case Hardened “Blue Gem” AK-47 with four Katowice 2014 Titan Holo stickers for roughly $400,000.</strong> The transaction also included a Case Hardened “Blue Gem” Karambit knife that sold for an additional $100,000, roughly.</p>



<p>But what makes this AK valued at around $400,000?</p>



<ul>
<li>Case Hardened skins are more valuable if there’s more blue. The Case Hardened AK above features a “Blue Gem” 661 pattern, which gives it an incredibly rare shiny blue pattern.</li>



<li>It’s in Minimal Wear condition (second best next to Factory New).</li>



<li>The four Katowice 2014 Titan Holo stickers, the <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/top-20-most-expensive-csgo-stickers-in-history-1361385/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most rare and expensive Counter-Strike stickers</a>, were valued at roughly $60,000 each.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-the-most-expensive-cs2-skin-ever-sold">The Most Expensive CS2 Skin Ever Sold</h2>



<p>Just this past year, <strong>a StatTrak Case Hardened Factory New AK-47 with the 661 pattern was <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/counter-strike-2s-most-expensive-skin-sells-for-jaw-dropping-1-million-2762918/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> sold for more than $1 million</strong>, according to Dexerto. The seller claims to have rejected “multiple” offers at $1 million, placing the exact buy amount at somewhere between $1 million and $1.5 million.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While this AK appears to be the most expensive skin ever sold, it’s not the highest price ever listed for a skin. <strong>One player <a href="https://afkgaming.com/csgo/news/extremely-rare-csgo-knife-allegedly-costs-more-than-12-million-euros" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered to pay $1.5 million</a> in Bitcoin for a one-of-a-kind Factory New Case Hardened “Blue Gem” Karambit knife</strong>. For context, the one that sold for $100,000 above was Well-Worn. However, the owner of the skin was “not interested” and said that the offer was too low.</p>



<p>What’s the most you’d ever spend on a skin? And will the one-of-a-kind Factory New Case Hardened “Blue Gem” Karambit skin ever be sold?
