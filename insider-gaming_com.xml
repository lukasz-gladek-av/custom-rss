<p>In December, The Game Awards ended the 2025 showcase with a reveal of Highguard, an all-new first-person shooter. It prompted a wave of disappointment from gamers eager to see which title would land the prestigious finale spot in one of the most-watched gaming events ever made.</p>



<p>Highguard emerged, with the developers at Wildlight uncovering a confusing, overdone first-person arena shooter, and viewers went nuts, wondering why they’d paid so much to secure the drastically expensive slot. It turns out that Wildlight didn’t pay for that spot in The Game Awards at all.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-a-million-dollars-saved">Half a Million Dollars Saved</h2>



<p>In recent years, the cost of acquiring space to run a trailer during The Game Awards has skyrocketed, with the longest slots now having around a half a million dollar price tag.</p>



<p>When Highguard, a brand-new game with no marketing beat before (or since) surfaced in the final spot, viewers were dismayed. There were expectations of something impressive appearing, but Highguard came on screen as a hard-to-pin shooter that looked like many other games we’d already seen emerge (and often fail) in recent years.</p>



<p>It was quickly judged as bizarre, because there was <strong>no way </strong>this all-new studio would stump up the half a million required to land that final spot, right?</p>



<p>In a new post <a href="https://xcancel.com/PaulTassi/status/2012258185495650308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a> by Forbes’ Paul Tassi, it was stated that the developers at Wildlight Entertainment <strong>did not pay </strong>for that spot:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Have learned that Highguard did not actually pay for that Game Awards finale spot. Was just the show putting it there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments, Tassi’s followers surmised that Geoff Keighley, the host of The Game Awards, was so enamoured by Highguard that he offered the team the final spot. That rings true, given Keighley’s hype for the game in the closing minutes of the show.</p>



<p>However, many were quick to point out that, if anything, the reveal did the game more harm than good. There’s now an emotional angle stifling the game’s anticipation, with folks everywhere wishing something else had popped up at the end of The Game Awards.</p>







<p>Do you think Highguard is going to exceed (low) expectations and surprise everyone when it launches in just nine days? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The team behind Helldivers 2 planned to launch a new Warbond, Redacted Regiment, on January 20. However, Arrowhead Game Studios has indefinitely delayed the release after discovering an issue during final testing that failed to meet the studio’s quality standards.</p>



<p>The upcoming premium Warbond plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-warbond-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduce two new weapons</a> for players to use, as well as new Stratagems and cosmetics.</p>







<h2 id="h-arrowhead-game-studios-first-informed-the-helldivers-discord">Arrowhead Game Studios First Informed the Helldivers Discord</h2>



<p>While Arrowhead Game Studios did not specify exactly what went wrong during testing, they informed their Discord server that they would ensure the content was properly ready before releasing it to the public.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Greetings, Helldivers.</p>



<p>During final testing for the Warbond, we found a key issue that didn’t meet our standards for a release. We’re taking some extra time to get it fixed, so the Redacted Regiment Warbond is going to be delayed.</p>



<p>We’re sorry for the change in plans, but we want to make sure the update is actually ready for you before it goes live. Thanks for the patience.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Back in December, the studio confirmed that new Killzone-themed gear was headed to Helldivers 2 as a Premium Warbond. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-returns-as-a-legendary-warbond/">here</a>. In other news related to Helldivers, the team behind ARC Raiders revealed that they scrapped plans to make that game free to play because of Helldivers.

<p>The next Assassin’s Creed game has secured its Lead Scriptwriter, and it’s someone with a history of working on the franchise.</p>



<p>Christopher Grilli, someone with a history as the Scriptwriter for Assassin’s Creed Origins and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, and the lead writer for Assassin’s Creed Mirage, recently revealed on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christophergrilli_im-thrilled-to-share-that-im-starting-a-activity-7417934734485413889-FrRL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAGBVXOMBvz_qCqVv-uRJAvpCCT5UFNbGSog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> profile that he has signed on to be the Scriptwriter for the next game in the long-running franchise, code-named Hexe.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m thrilled to share that I’m starting a new position at Ubisoft Montreal as a Lead Scriptwriter on Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe. Incredibly grateful to be a part of this team and project,” he shared on January 16.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-everything-known-about-assassin-s-creed-hexe-so-far">Everything Known About Assassin’s Creed Hexe So Far</h2>



<p>In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming reported</a> that the game was in a relatively early stage of development and was expected to be released this year. It’s also believed this will be a more linear experience than other games in the franchise, and that the series will feature a female protagonist named Elsa with supernatural abilities.</p>



<p>The game takes place in 16th-century Central Europe during the Holy Roman Empire, and reports indicate developers plan to implement a fear system inspired by the Jack the Ripper DLC from Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>With the Lead Scriptwriter only now coming on board, it’s fair to suggest that the game is still a ways from release, but with someone with such experience on the team, it appears to be heading in the right direction.
