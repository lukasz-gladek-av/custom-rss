<p>McDonalds has ended part of the Pokémon promotion early in Japan after huge queues outside of its stores and immense food wastage.</p>



<p>Last weekend’s launch of the Pokémon promotion earned criticism from across the world, with scalpers buying up Happy Meals in bulk to receive the exclusive Pokémon cards in the distribution, and many then dumping the meals. </p>



<p>McDonalds sold out of the exclusive Pokémon cards within hours of the promotion starting, despite plans for the event to run for three days, and plans have now been updated for the upcoming week.</p>



<h2 id="h-mcdonalds-places-restrictions-on-happy-meal-purchases">McDonalds Places Restrictions on Happy Meal Purchases</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s over. Image via McDonalds</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0814a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a>, McDonalds apologized to customers and store staff, along with announcing restrictions on purchasing Happy Meals that prohibit purchasing more than three per group. If four or more are ordered, “we will refuse your purchase and cancel the order.”</p>



<p>This weekend’s promotion will go ahead, though the big difference is there will not be any Pokémon cards and, instead, toys will be provided, which should result in a decreased demand for those looking for profit.</p>



<p>On the topic of scalpers specifically, McDonalds stated it “does not tolerate the purchase of Happy Meals for the purpose of resale, or the abandonment or disposal of food.”</p>



<p>This is not a problem unique to McDonalds, however, as the Pokémon hobby has become embroiled with supply problems due to high demand, with widespread videos of people purchasing products in mass to sell at inflated prices.</p>



<p>Pokémon has maximized its printing process to counteract this issue, but there is little evidence of results so far and, with the 30th anniversary of the franchise next year, demand could be higher than ever.</p>



<p>Are scalpers ruining the Pokémon hobby? Should McDonalds refuse to distribute Pokémon cards again? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3311/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>With Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater slithering toward release, it’s the perfect time to learn about the differences between the remake and the original Snake Eater 3 title from over two decades ago.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 28</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater could revive the Metal Gear Solid franchise after a few years of dormancy following the disappointment of the last release, Metal Gear Solid Survive, in 2018.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for details on all the big differences between the original title and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, we’ve got you covered.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Blending in. Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-no-kojima-amp-shinkawa-involved">No Kojima &amp; Shinkawa Involved</h3>



<p>One of the biggest points to note is that the original creator, <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hideo Kojima</a>, and the original artist, Yoji Shinkawa, are not involved in the remake. However, the developer pledged to stay fully faithful to the original content.</p>



<p>While neither of the starring pair is on board, their original work will still shine through. With Kojima not on board, Konami’s internal studio, Konami Digital Entertainment, is developing the game, while Noriaki Okamura, producer of Metal Gear Survive and Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, and Yuji Korekado, creative producer of Metal Gear Solid V, are supervising.</p>



<p>Singaporean studio Virtuos also contributed to development.</p>



<h3 id="h-snake-vs-bomberman">Snake vs Bomberman</h3>



<p>While those on PlayStation and PC will be able to play through a remake of Snake vs. Monkey, a crossover with Sony’s Ape Escape that released with the original title, Xbox Series X|S players will have a brand new experience with a crossover with a Konami property, Bomberman.</p>



<p>Snake vs. Bomberman has been created entirely for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game, given that Sony probably wouldn’t want their Ape Escape franchise to feature on the rival platform. </p>



<h3 id="h-trophy-amp-achievement-changes">Trophy &amp; Achievement Changes</h3>



<p>Several changes have been made to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trophy-list-all-achievement-trophy-differences-in-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy and Achievement list</a> for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, marking one of the biggest differences for the game compared to the original. </p>



<p>Some Trophies have been removed entirely, while others have had their rarity changed. Others have been streamlined into a single Trophy or Achievement for achieving 100% of an objective, whereas previously they were broken down into separate objectives.</p>



<p>Minor adjustments include some changes to names and descriptions, though the core task remains the same.</p>



<h3 id="h-updated-graphics">Updated Graphics</h3>



<p>One of the biggest differences in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater compared to the original title is updated graphics, which is a given considering the original game released over two decades ago.</p>



<p>Expect the graphics to be in-line with recent AAA titles, showcasing the beloved game in a new light. While there are these visual changes, the core story remains the same, and no major adjustments have been made on that front.</p>







<p><strong>Given the original title released over two decades ago, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a must-play for anyone who adores the original title.</strong></p>



<p>Bringing the game into the modern generation provides the Metal Gear Solid franchise with an opportunity to attract new players, but those who are well-versed with the franchise will be crucial to the game’s success. If you want to see other Metal Gear Solid games receive a remaster, I’d highly recommend buying.</p>



<p>The good thing about a remake is you know what to expect with the story, so you won’t be disappointed or feel short-handed. Instead, use the game as a trip down memory lane to reminisce about your first experiences playing the original game.</p>

<p>The launch of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is rapidly approaching, and many questions still linger about whether the game is a remake, so we’ve got the answer.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">August 28</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims of a Nintendo Switch 2 launch</a> later this year, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater could spark a rebirth for the fan-favorite Konami franchise after years of dormancy for the series—and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trophy-list-all-achievement-trophy-differences-in-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophy list</a> shows big challenges await.</p>



<p>With fans having waited so long for a new Metal Gear Solid release, there may be some confusion about the remake status, but we’re here to clear up any confusion.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Here we go again. Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a fully fledged remake of 2004’s Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.</strong></p>



<p>Snake Eater is a fan-favorite for the franchise, as, while it was the fifth Metal Gear Solid game in the series, it was the first chronologically. As such, it is the first remake in the series and was chosen due to its time setting, which is set in 1964 during the Cold War.</p>



<p>The game will stick true to the original story that first played out over two decades ago, with the biggest difference being that neither Hideo Kojima nor original artist Yoji Shinkawa have been involved in the game’s development.</p>



<p>Snake Eater’s remake was first announced in May 2023, representing a shift in approach from Konami after the previous decision to move away from developing and publishing major third-party games. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the first title in the franchise to release since 2018’s spin-off title Metal Gear Survive.</p>







<p><strong>There has been no confirmation of any further Metal Gear Solid remakes, but the door is certainly open for them to take place if Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is successful.</strong></p>



<p>The decision to remake Snake Eater first provides Konami with the opportunity to tell the story of the franchise chronologically for the first time, which could mean that remakes for Metal Gear Solid 1 &amp; 2 are next in line. </p>



<p>However, speaking to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/19148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> in 2024, series producer Noriaki Okamura claimed remaking the first Metal Gear Solid would be much harder than Snake Eater, with the same difficulties for the second game. This is due to the fact both titles originally released on the MSX2 and Nintendo Entertainment System, meaning much more would need to be built for the ground up in a remade version.</p>



<p>There has already been a Master Collection for the series, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-had-a-pretty-rough-launch-so-konami-says-its-being-more-careful-with-vol-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Volume 2 confirmed to be in the works</a>, but these are not remakes and iinstead bundle several games in the series together.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[5 Best Non-FromSoftware Soulslike Games to Play in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-non-fromsoftware-soulslike-games-to-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-best-non-fromsoftware-soulslike-games-to-play-in-2025.1270824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FromSoftware is the undisputed master of Souls games, but they’re not the only company that makes stellar Soulslike experiences. Here are 5 Soulslike games not made by FromSoftware you should be playing in 2025.</p>



<p>Demon’s Souls and its spiritual successor, Dark Souls, started a revolution in gaming, which eventually turned into its own genre: the Soulslike game. But over time, this term has come to refer to games that were not made by FromSoftware but borrowed heavily from them.</p>



<p>Some of these games are only imitators, but others move the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/things-soulslike-games-must-stop-doing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslike</a> needle in new and creative ways, going on to become as celebrated as FromSoftware’s own games. Below, we’ll reveal the 5 best Soulslike games you can play in 2025 that were not developed by Hidetaka Miyazaki or the team at FromSoftware. </p>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Eve is an android sent to save Earth from vicious alien invaders. Image credit: Shift Up</figcaption></figure>



<p>There will be some that dispute Stellar Blade’s status as a Soulslike, but in terms of its overall gameplay loops, it absolutely is one. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-a-switch-2-port-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a> doesn’t conform to all of the conventions of the genre and strays from them at times, sometimes feeling more like Nier Automata or Bayonetta— and this is why it’s excellent.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is a great entry point for those who want to try Soulslike games, and even features some very challenging boss fights that would even make Malenia from Elden Ring blush. Rather than imitating Dark Souls, Stellar Blade simply takes inspiration from it and other action-adventure games, says a respectful “Thank you”, then blazes its own trail. </p>



<h2 id="h-lies-of-p">Lies of P</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lies of P: Overture features new combat styles and bosses. Image credit: NEOWIZ</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lies of P is a dark retelling of the story of Pinocchio, but this time, the puppet who wants to be a “real boy” needs to defend his creators against a robot uprising, all while weighing up the cost of honesty and deceit. It really shouldn’t work, but it does, and despite the game releasing in 2023, it’s still one of the best Soulslike games that wasn’t developed by FromSoftware. </p>



<p>While Lies of P was a highly original game, its gothic setting is eerily reminiscent of Bloodborne, a game that FromSoft fans are desperate to receive a remaster or sequel. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-headlines-augusts-free-playstation-plus-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P</a> scratches that itch and manages to be an excellent game in its own right. Its first major expansion is also coming in summer 2025, making the game relevant all over again. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-lords-of-the-fallen-2023">The Lords of The Fallen (2023)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lords of the Fallen is a worthy successor to Dark Souls. Image credit: Hexworks </figcaption></figure>



<p>The Lords of the Fallen is actually a sequel to another title called Lords of the Fallen that came out in 2014, and what makes this game so good is that this is truly one for the Dark Souls purists. Never mind Sekiro, Bloodborne, or Elden Ring, The Lords of the Fallen is a love letter to where the Soulslikes genre began.</p>



<p>The game pays tribute to Dark Souls by existing in a similar grimdark world where nearly everything wants to kill you, and is quite capable of it. Those who love Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls will feel immediately at home. But that’s not all, the game also allows players to move between the world of the living and the world of the dead, adding a mechanic that feels similar to old-school Soul Reaver games. </p>



<p>Some would call <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-friend-pass-crossplay/">The Lords of the Fallen</a> derivative, but what it’s really doing is providing Soulslike veterans with the thing we’ve been craving, something that can serve as a Dark Souls 4 surrogate. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan">The First Berserker: Khazan</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The First Berserker is one of the best Soulslikes not made by FromSoftware. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like Stellar Blade, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-bosses-in-the-first-berserker-khazan-how-many-bosses-are-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> is unmistakably a Soulslike game, but it also does its own thing and represents evolution rather than stagnation. Even on its normal difficulty, Khazan is a tough but rewarding adventure, but it also offers an easy mode for those who just want to enjoy the story, but test their mettle after mastering its mechanics, which is fair enough. </p>



<p>The First Berserker: Khazan isn’t trying to hide the fact that it’s inspired by games like Bloodborne and Dark Souls, but it’s also not afraid to lean into more arcade-style action like Ninja Gaiden. Its theme of Norse mythology also helps it to stand out in the increasingly crowded space, and in 2025, it’s easily one of the best Soulslike adventures that wasn’t designed by FromSoftware. </p>







<h2 id="h-wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Wuchang is the best Soulslike of 2025, so far. Image credit: Leenzee</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post-Elden Ring world, Soulslikes that use the old interconnected world system feel slightly antiquated, but that hasn’t stopped Wuchang: Fallen Feathers from being the best Soulslike of 2025 (as of August at least). Set in ancient China, Wuchang wakes up suffering from a dark malady that is slowly killing her, and with no memory of how she caught it. Desperate for answers, she picks up her blade and starts slashing monsters until a solution can be found.</p>



<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has more in common with games like Nioh, Wo-Long, and Black Myth: Wukong than Dark Souls, but the FromSoftware DNA is there. The game is probably the most difficult on this entire list, and even seasoned Tarnished warriors will find the game a serious challenge. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-longsword-build-wuchang-fallen-feathers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang</a> doesn’t have an invasion mechanic, if you die while touched by “Madness”, your own ghost will remain after death and then relentlessly hunt you down to kill you again.</p>



<p>Now that’s the sort of violent delight Soulslike fans appreciate. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/chris-hansen-roblox-plans-documentary-predator-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-catch-a-predator%E2%80%99s-chris-hansen-planning-roblox-documentary-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1270815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Roblox is facing an insurmountable wave of controversy at present, with child safety activist groups and ‘predator hunter’ organizations pummelling the game for not adequately protecting young players. The situation hit a new all-time high recently when the Roblox Corporation’s lawyers harangued Schlep, a creator who has directly influenced the arrest of several predators preying on Roblox players.</p>



<p>The Roblox ‘child safety’ scenario unfolded further in recent hours, with a claim surfacing that Chris ‘Have a Seat’ Hansen, the iconic face of To Catch a Predator, is planning a documentary to shed light on Roblox’s nefarious side.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-chris-hansen-making-a-roblox-documentary">Is Chris Hansen Making a Roblox Documentary?</h2>



<p>On social media, claims emerged from several prominent channels that Chris Hansen, the host of To Catch a Predator for <strong>many years</strong>, is preparing to create a documentary hand-in-hand with Schlep, the creator who was recently pursued by Roblox’s legal team.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Anything tied to Schlep is being destroyed by the Roblox Corporation as we speak, with players receiving bans just for having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-legal-notice-banned-predator-hunter-freeschlep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#FreeSchlep</a> written in their username or anywhere else on their profile. This trend comes despite users pointing out that nefarious and harmful games are still sitting in the Roblox library, despite countless reports from concerned users.</p>



<p>It’s a question of priorities.</p>



<p>The situation is skyrocketing as we speak. In recent days, it was revealed that Louisiana’s Attorney General <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/15/us/louisiana-roblox-lawsuit-child-protection-hnk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">had filed a lawsuit</a> against Roblox for allowing sexual predators to ‘thrive, unite, hunt, and victimize kids’ on the platform.</p>



<p>Congressman Ro Khanna of California has also taken action, <a href="https://act.rokhanna.com/a/save-roblox-petition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">starting a petition</a> to demand that the Roblox Corporation do ‘more to protect children, provide more support to parents, and strengthen law enforcement protocols.’</p>



<p>It’s hard to tell what will happen next in this ongoing debacle, but the team at Roblox isn’t helping things. Just days ago, it was claimed that Roblox might one day become the home <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-dating-someday-for-those-afraid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of a legitimate dating platform</a>.</p>



<p>It’s hard to believe how some of this is unfolding.</p>

<p>Game Science has teased Black Myth: Wukong’s attendance during the Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom. Fans saw this reveal and instantly jumped to the assumption that Black Myth: Wukong DLC is inbound and about to be revealed. The time is right, and the game drops on Xbox just one day after the Opening Night Live show.</p>



<p>It has been almost a year to the day since Black Myth: Wukong was released, and fans are <strong>hungry </strong>for more content.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-myth-wukong-at-gamescom">Black Myth: Wukong at Gamescom</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the Game Science team behind 2024’s Black Myth: Wukong teased a reveal:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Destined Ones, GameScience will be joining this year’s Gamescom Opening Night Live. The show kicks off at 8:00 p.m. (CEST) on August 19, and we look forward to seeing you there.<a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1956174001128268031/photo/1"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The core belief within the community is that a grand expansion is incoming for the game that turned heads in August 2024 when it proved to be one of the most successful additions to an already dense lineup of Soulslike games.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The post went hand-in-hand with a charming image showing fearsome monsters, calligraphy, and some ethereal elements. In the comments under the post, a user translated the visible script:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The extraordinary is ordinary in this world; ‘gods and devils’ often wear respectable attire.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Strangely, there’s a date on the image of August 20, 2025, the <strong>day after </strong>the Opening Night Live reveal will be shown. This has fans believing that a shadowdrop of sorts will take place, with Game Science revealing that Black Myth: Wukong DLC will be available almost instantly after the show.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is officially my most highly anticipated game of 2025. I can’t wait for it to be released in September, and you can bet your last dollar I’ll be picking up the Deluxe Edition. With that being said, I thought I’d take some time to explain all the Dying Light: The Beast pre-order bonuses and rewards, as there are a few that you can unlock.</p>



<p>Let’s take a deep dive into Dying Light: The Beast and learn about the Hero of Harran bundle and all the digital content and cosmetics you get for pre-ordering Dying Light: The Beast</p>



<h2 id="h-every-dying-light-the-beast-pre-order-bonus">Every Dying Light: The Beast Pre-Order Bonus</h2>



<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast pre-order bonuses include the Hero of Harran bundle, which comes with an exclusive Ultimate Survivor outfit, crossbow, and vehicle skin.</strong></p>



<p>The Hero of Harran bundle shouldn’t be missed, and fans of the franchise would be remiss to skip over the content, even if it’s ‘only’ in-game cosmetics.</p>



<p>Here’s everything included in the Hero of Harran bundle:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ultimate Survivor outfit</li>



<li>Harran combat knife</li>



<li>In Jade’s Memory pistol</li>



<li>The Follower crossbow</li>



<li>Castor Woods Patrol vehicle</li>
</ul>



<p>All pre-orders for Dying Light: The Beast will earn the Hero of Harran bundle free of charge.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-deluxe-edition-of-dying-light-the-beast">What’s in the Deluxe Edition of Dying Light: The Beast</h2>



<p>While every pre-order of Dying Light: The Beast secures the Hero of Harran bundle, buying the Deluxe Edition grants you so much more. As this is a digital-first release, everything is in-game or available separately on a digital basis, but that doesn’t take away from the quality of what you’re getting.</p>



<p>Here’s everything included in Dying Light: The Beast Deluxe Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>Official soundtrack</li>



<li>Wallpaper pack</li>



<li>Castor Woods tourist map (digital)</li>



<li>Castor Woods prepper bundle:
<ul>
<li>Roadhog vehicle</li>



<li>Castor Woods prepper outfit</li>



<li>Survivalist SMG</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Base game</li>
</ul>



<p>The Deluxe Edition is just $10 more expensive than the standard version of Dying Light: The Beast, so it’s a bargain and a very easy buy for fans of the decade-old franchise.</p>



<p>What version of Dying Light: The Beast will you be buying? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast is one of the most highly anticipated titles of 2025, and it’s set to be released <strong>very soon</strong>. This open-world, zombie-slaying epic has been dubbed ‘Dying Light 3’ by Techland, and in many ways, this major title kickstarts the next generation of the series. In this guide, learn everything about the Dying Light: The Beast release date and platforms.</p>



<p>I’m hugely excited for Dying Light: The Beast, which marks an evolution from 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human in many ways. I’ve been a fan of the franchise since 2015’s Dying Light turned heads, and Techland has worked hard to make the series a shining gem of the zombie apocalypse niche ever since.</p>



<p>Read on to find out when Dying Light: The Beast is coming out and how much it’ll cost when it does.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-dying-light-the-beast-coming-out">When is Dying Light: The Beast Coming Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast will be released on September 19 on <strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></strong></p>



<p>The game was originally intended to be released on August 22, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-delayed/">a delay was needed</a> for Techland to fully polish the game and make it the best zombie-slashing adventure possible.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast started life as an expansion to Dying Light 2: Stay Human, but Techland realized it was too big for that and needed to flex as a standalone title. For this game, Roger Craig Smith (the original game’s lead voice actor) returned to play the role of Kyle Crane, a fan-favorite protagonist.</p>



<p>The Beast will now be a full-fledged game with all-new mechanics, upgraded visuals and effects, and an original story that brings to life the future of Dying Light.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-pricing-structure">Dying Light: The Beast Pricing Structure</h3>



<p>As Dying Light: The Beast has plenty of meat on the bones, it’s coming out with a premium price tag:</p>



<p><strong>Standard Edition </strong>– $59.99 / £59.99</p>



<p><strong>Deluxe Edition </strong>– $69.99 / £69.99</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-early-access-for-dying-light-the-beast">Is There Early Access for Dying Light: The Beast?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no way to access Dying Light: The Beast earlier than the global launch</strong>.</p>



<p>Techland has arranged a neat Deluxe Edition for Dying Light: The Beast, but the bonus content you get includes digital collectibles and in-game cosmetics; there is no way to get early access to The Beast.</p>

<p>Gamescom is almost here, and Xbox has published an extensive list of games that will be revealed or expanded on during the Xbox at Gamescom broadcast slate. This is made up of two streams that will take place between August 20 and August 21, with the team broadcasting a stack of trailers, panels, and reveals <strong>live from Gamescom</strong>.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve outlined every Xbox game coming to Gamescom to populate the stream schedule. Enjoy!</p>







<p>Here’s how the first day of Xbox at Gamescom will work:</p>

<h3 id="h-how-to-watch-xbox-gamescom-streams">How to Watch Xbox @ Gamescom Streams</h3>



<p>The best places to watch the Xbox streams broadcast from Gamescom will be YouTube and Twitch. Ensure you’re watching the official channels to have the best chance of unlocking any live rewards:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a></li>
</ul>



<p>I’m fully expecting more to appear during these broadcasts, titles that aren’t necessarily being touted ahead of the streams taking place. Every year, Xbox invests <strong>a lot </strong>in Gamescom, occupying a vast section of the show floor and putting on one hell of a show. They’d be remiss to not have a few surprises up their sleeves.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wuchang-update-censorship-bizarre/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-implodes-following-bizarre-1-5-%E2%80%98censorship%E2%80%99-update.1270788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has only been a few weeks since Wuchang: Fallen Feathers was released, adding yet another Soulslike to the increasingly expansive array of titles in the niche. In that time, Wuchang has suffered, being plagued by stability issues at launch and facing the wrath of gamers in thousands of negative reviews.</p>



<p>In the latest debacle, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers’ 1.5 update has rendered fans furious as developer Leenzee ‘censors’ various aspects of the game, applies a nasty retcon, and skews some of the title’s more challenging sequences.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-with-wuchang-s-1-5-update">What Happened With Wuchang’s 1.5 Update?</h2>



<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers isn’t a terrible game, but it doesn’t do too much to differentiate itself from the slew of Soulslike games drowning out the industry these days. That’s <strong>one reason </strong>why it earned some negativity at launch, but the UE5-related performance issues (particularly on PC) didn’t help the situation.</p>



<p>Recently, Leenzee released the 1.5 patch for Wuchang, causing chaos and disappointing fans worldwide.</p>



<p>With a single line in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498329191821869869?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full 1.5 patch notes</a>, Leenzee made waves:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Added dialogs for some NPCs to complete some plots. We will further optimize the exhaustion animations in the future to improve the plot performance.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eagle-eyed Wuchang fans dove into the game after the 1.5 patch and discovered what that meant. Following the update, certain bosses can’t be killed and enter a state of ‘exhaustion’ after being defeated. Some have been reworked with new voice lines that alter the story, and other enemies in certain sequences (such as Ming Dynasty soldiers) won’t attack you at all.</p>



<p>This has caused one key chapter that was previously very difficult to become a breeze, further disappointing sadomasochistic Soulslike fans. </p>



<p>The situation was exacerbated by mods on the official Wuchang subreddit reportedly deleting posts complaining about the 1.5 patch. This has naturally caused the review stats for Wuchang to fall into the red once again.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, user Lance McDonald expressed concerns about <strong>why </strong>these changes were made:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By the way, it isn’t the Chinese Government that forced these changes, WUCHANG is quite pro-government, it’s to please fringe groups of nationalists. I don’t really understand the details sadly.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">lmao Liu Wenxiu just stands around exhausted after the fight now, no dialogue . By the way, it isn't the Chinese Government that forced these changes, WUCHANG is quite pro-government, it's to please fringe groups of nationalists. I don't really understand the details sadly. <a href="https://t.co/QdjMZQbX8W">pic.twitter.com/QdjMZQbX8W</a></p>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1956007542284268001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>It’s relatively easy to predict that Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will start falling to the wayside now, and that this will forever be a mark on Leenzee’s reputation. This was the first outing for the studio, and it certainly isn’t how you’d want to make a name for yourself.</p>
