<p>The 30th anniversary of Pokemon took center stage for a brief moment during Super Bowl 60.</p>



<p>An entire generation of kids who wanted to be the “very best like no one ever was” has grown into a population of adults who have taken different paths but share a love of Pokemon and fond memories of it.</p>



<p>That love was on display in a Super Bowl 60 commercial. Trevor Noah, Lady Gaga, Blackpink’s Jisoo, and more all named their favorites and spoke about why they have a love for the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-lady-gaga-s-favorite-is-jigglypuff">Lady Gaga’s Favorite Is Jigglypuff</h2>



<p>It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga is a fan of Jigglypuff. The Grammy Award-winning Superstar praised the fairy-type Pokemon for using her voice as a means of protection and self-defense. Gaga even noted that Jigglypuff has a 12-octave vocal range.</p>



<p>Trevor Noah remarked that his favorite is Psyduck. Noah praised Psyduck for its ability to change the world with its mind. He also said that every time you met a new one, it was like meeting a new part of yourself.</p>



<p>Charles Leclerc, Lamine Yamal, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and Young Miko also appeared in the ad, which ran for just over a minute.</p>

<h2 id="h-pokemon-turns-30">Pokemon Turns 30</h2>



<p>2026 is a big year for Pokemon. It has been 30 years since Pokemon Red and Blue launched on the original Nintendo Game Boy. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-2026-pokemon-presents/">Pokemon Day</a> falls on February 27 every year. </p>



<p>Each year, a stream hosted by The Pokemon Company sets the stage for the franchise’s immediate future. This year, fans expect the launch of the 10th generation of everyone’s favorite friendly monsters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Still Plans First-Party Xbox Handheld, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-still-plans-first-party-xbox-handheld-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>1429477</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As Microsoft continues to shape its vision for the future of the Xbox brand, it still plans to develop a first-party handheld device, even if “everything is an Xbox.”</p>



<p>In 2025, ASUS launched the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-ally/" id="2725">ROG Xbox Ally series </a>of handheld gaming devices. The two new devices were more powerful versions of the previously launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/asus-rog-ally/" id="629">ROG Ally systems,</a> designed to make it easier to access PC game launchers, including<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" id="1075"> Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>



<p>Still, a new <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-the-next-gen-xbox-2027-locked-in-most-ambitious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Jez Corden </a>notes that plans remain in place for a first-party Xbox handheld, even if the next mainline Xbox console is the primary focus for now. </p>



<p>The next-generation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131">Xbox </a>platform is touted as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft’s </a>boldest effort in the gaming space to date, even after a game-changing quarter-century. As such, they’re not committing to a firm launch date for the next home console yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-major-changes-coming-soon-to-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally">Major Changes Coming Soon to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally</h2>



<p>The report from Corden notes that Microsoft is testing a new NPU-driven highlights feature for the Xbox Ally X that automatically transforms gameplay clips into shareable videos. This feature is slated for a March 2026 release.</p>



<p>The next Xbox console is also set to take notes from the Ally X handheld by bringing multiple launchers, such as the Epic Games launcher and Steam, to the platform. Regardless of the hardware, the overall message remains the same: make Xbox accessible anywhere and everywhere.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-murder-man-concerned-about-missing-game/</link>
            <guid>1429474</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Robert Richens was apprehended by UK police last year for brutally murdering his former girlfriend. Recently, Richens appeared at Oxford Crown Court for sentencing, being sent down with a life sentence on February 6, 2026. In new footage captured by the police officers who brought Richens in, it was revealed that the killer had something else on his mind at the time.</p>



<p>In a clip that has gone <strong>viral</strong> in recent days, Richens was caught sobbing midway through being arrested, blurting out that he was going to ‘miss GTA’.</p>



<h2 id="h-callous-and-merciless-murder">‘Callous’ and ‘Merciless’ Murder</h2>



<p>In a report published <a href="https://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/news/thames-valley/news/2026/february/02-02-26/man-jailed-for-life-for-murder--abingdon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Thames Valley Police</a> in the United Kingdom, itwas confirmed that Robert Richens, aged 35, was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 16 years, for the 2025 murder of his former partner.</p>



<p>Per the report, Richens had called emergency services on the morning of May 30 and stressed that he’d accidentally killed someone. Upon investigation, it was found that his former partner, Rachael Vaughan, had been subject to a ‘sustained assault’ that had left her lifeless.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip that surfaced recently on social media, showing Richens sobbing and lamenting the loss of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A man in the UK was arrested for murder, and his only concern was that he’d miss GTA VI as he’d likely get life in prison. </p><p>The police officer replies “You’ve got ages for that” 💀 <a href="https://t.co/by2KVdbLkn">pic.twitter.com/by2KVdbLkn</a></p></div>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/2020303229091999969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In the video, a police officer casually asks what GTA he’s referring to, and when Richens simply said, ‘Six,’ the officer brushed it off, suggesting he ‘had ages’ until the game came out.</p>



<p>Richens won’t only miss Grand Theft Auto 6, but likely Grand Theft Auto 7 too, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rockstar-games/" id="1648">Rockstar’s</a> release cadence is anything to go by. While UK prisons permit games consoles, they’re only allowed older units that cannot connect to the internet, which includes the likes of the PlayStation 2 and original Xbox.</p>



<p>During sentencing, the judge labelled Richens’ actions as callous and merciless for the crime he’d pleaded guilty to.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS6 and PlayStation Handheld To Have Impressive Memory Specs, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-specs-playstation-handheld-impressive-memory/</link>
            <guid>1429471</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The latest round of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-6/" id="217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6</a> claims surfaced recently, alongside claims regarding the upcoming ‘PlayStation handheld’, dubbed Project Canis. In a series of posts on NeoGAF, reliable tech leaker, KeplerL2, divulged some tidbits about the upcoming next generation of PlayStation hardware, focused squarely on <strong>memory capabilities</strong>.</p>



<p>In the string of posts, KeplerL2 claimed that the PlayStation 6 could boast up to 30 GB of GDDR7 memory, using a specific configuration to fit it into the console. Elsewhere, the PlayStation handheld, KeplerL2 says, could have as much as 24 GB of LPDDR5X memory, putting it at least on par with the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X, arguably the most premium handheld on the market.</p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-6-and-playstation-handheld-claims-surface-again">PlayStation 6 and PlayStation Handheld Claims Surface Again</h2>



<p>It’s once every few months that we’re seeing fresh information emerge regarding the next generation of PlayStation hardware.</p>



<p>In April 2025, we had claims come <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from KeplerL2</a> that the upcoming PlayStation handheld won’t be as powerful as the PlayStation 5. In August, a fresh wave <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of technical specs leaked</a> for both devices, and in October, it was claimed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6 will be released</a> as early as 2027.</p>



<p>This new spate of information comes from KeplerL2 again, who has proven to be mostly reliable in the past for technical insights.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/amd-ceo-reveals-next-gen-xbox-could-launch-in-2027-%E2%80%94-ceo-says-semi-custom-soc-ready-to-support-launch-in-2027.1693009/page-9#post-271240975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a thread</a> on NeoGAF, KeplerL2 addressed a question around <strong>how </strong>Sony would ‘hit 30GB of GDDR7 with only 4GB modules on a 160-bit bus.’</p>



<p>Per KeplerL2, the tech titan would opt for 3 GB memory modules arranged in a clamshell configuration. It would reduce the memory bus but hit a higher memory speed overall and promote more bandwidth, as much as 640 GB/s (thanks to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/playstation-handheld-reportedly-with-24gb-memory-ps6-console-with-30gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">videocardz.com</a> for the breakdown).</p>



<p>Additionally, KeplerL2 suggested that a ‘good amount of memory’ for the PlayStation portable (‘PS6 handheld’) would be 24 GB, which is more or less the industry standard right now for top-tier handheld gaming devices.</p>



<p>As always, these kinds of claims or suggestions should be taken with a grain of salt until we have it from the horse’s mouth.</p>







<p>What do you think? Can you see the PS6 launching with almost double the memory capacity of the PlayStation 5? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 is introducing a new Ringside Pass, similar to battle pass systems in other games. Now, the gameplay designer, Cornell Gunter, explains the benefits fans can expect from this new addition.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> is set to release worldwide on March 13. This year’s game features the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273">several match types</a> to WWE video games. However, there are also many changes coming to this year’s game, including the introduction of a<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-will-the-wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-work/" id="174147"> new Ringside Pass</a>, which changes how unlockables work in the series.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-dev-says-ringside-pass-is-about-content-first-and-foremost">WWE 2K26 Dev Says Ringside Pass Is About Content First and Foremost</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/m935QSZHAfI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JustBryan,</a> WWE 2K26 gameplay designer Cornell Gunter praised the changes that the new Ringside Pass will offer. He notes that Ringside Pass Premium will offer day-one DLC. He also notes that the new system is strictly about content rather than time-sensitive releases. </p>



<p>While it is divided into seasons, none of the benefits are time-limited. If a player returns to the game after several months away, they will still have access to all premium content. Overall, there will be 120 reward items per season.</p>



<p>“I’m very excited to see what the reactions are by the end of the lifecycle. Because I think people are going to be very, very happy with what we are able to achieve and what we brought to the table with the Ringside Pass,” Gunter said.</p>

<p>Team Vitality has lifted the trophy at IEM Krakow, extending a phenomenal record over the last year or so and sending FURIA packing at the final post. The victory came after a hard-fought battle in the Tauron Arena in front of thousands of fans, but Vitality’s final streak through FURIA was a masterclass to behold.</p>



<p>Only the opening round on Mirage was of any use to the Brazilian side, stumping up a tough 11-13 finish that quickly went squandered in the subsequent maps. By the third map, Team Vitality was dominating 13-2, showing why it was worthy of that all-important trophy and the $400,000 prize.</p>

<p>In our earlier coverage, our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/iem-krakow/" id="3570">IEM Krakow</a> predictions had Team Vitality sitting pretty in first place, and it’s always nice to be validated by the result.</p>



<p>Team Vitality has pushed onwards and upwards with a monumental, award-winning streak that has left the team being regarded as one of the all-time greatest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/counter-strike/" id="482">Counter-Strike</a> rosters ever created. In the last year, the organization has edged into double-digit territory in terms of trophies raised, and this latest one, secured at the first IEM Krakow event, is more ammunition for the cabinet.</p>



<p>Before IEM Krakow, the team’s last win came at the StarLadder Budapest Major in December, which yielded a 3-1 win over FaZe Clan and a $500,000 prize.</p>



<p>Krakow seemed in the bag for Vitality throughout much of the tournament. For die-hard fans of the brand, this was only ever going to go one way.</p>

<p>More changes could be coming to Xbox Game Pass, per a new report.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" id="1075">Xbox Game Pass</a> is currently a cornerstone of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/xbox-series-x/" id="28">Xbox </a>business. This past October, the cost of the Game Pass Ultimate tier increased to $29.99 per month after the company added nearly 50 games and committed to over 75 day-one releases per year.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom Warren of The Verge </a>reports that more changes could be coming to the subscription service. One potential change is Microsoft experimenting with bundling additional third-party services with Game Pass subscriptions. Game Pass Ultimate currently includes access to Fortnite Crew, Ubisoft+ Classics, and EA Play.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft </a>is considering merging <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131">Xbox </a>Game Pass Premium, the second-tier offering, with PC Game Pass. PC Game Pass is currently $16.49 per month and only allows players to access games on PC, rather than through the cloud or on consoles.</p>







<h2 id="h-still-don-t-expect-changes-to-game-pass-in-2026">Still, Don’t Expect Changes to Game Pass in 2026</h2>



<p>Tom Warren also states that he doesn’t expect any changes to the service this calendar year. Not only did Xbox make significant changes in October, but Microsoft is still seeing growth in PC Game Pass subscriptions.</p>



<p>Regarding the future of Xbox,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-says-next-xbox-console-may-launch-next-year/" id="173908"> AMD recently stated that the next Xbox console could launch in 2027.</a> It’s been said that the next Xbox in-home unit would be a PC-console hybrid. </p>







<p>In 2025, the brand entered the handheld market with the ROG Ally Xbox devices. Learn more about those <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rog-xbox-ally-vs-rog-xbox-ally-x-differences-price-specs/" id="148540">here</a>.</p>
