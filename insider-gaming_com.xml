            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s almost time for another progression wipe in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, as the next Expedition Project deadline is fast-approaching. This mechanic allows you to reset your account, go back to square one, whilst earning some exclusive rewards, bonuses, and temporary buffs.</p>



<p>Of course, you don’t have to reset, but Embark Studios has updated the rewards and requirements, and it seems much more worthwhile when compared to the first one. It’s a big decision to make, so you’ll want to be well-informed.</p>







<p>Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has all the information you’ll need for ARC Raiders’ Expedition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project</a>, including the requirements, rewards, and when you’ll need to complete it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-arc-raiders-second-expedition">When Is ARC Raiders’ Second Expedition?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to get packing. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Expedition window opens on February 25, and departures take place on March 1, meaning you’ve got until the end of February to complete the Expedition Project.</strong></p>



<p>It might seem like you still have a good amount of time to complete the Project, but be warned, you’ll need a lot of different resources if you want to finish it. It’s best to start sooner rather than later, as you might wind up missing the wipe and regretting it.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-requirements-for-the-second-expedition">What Are The Requirements For The Second Expedition?</h2>



<p><strong>There are six stages to the Expedition Project in ARC Raiders, with each one having four requirements each.</strong></p>



<p>The items vary from materials to ARC parts, but the toughest stage is bound to be the fifth one, which requires you to sell 800,000 Coins’ worth of supplies! The Expedition won’t come cheap, but if you want to complete it, here are all of the Project’s stages:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Expedition Project Stage</th><th data-align="center">Expedition Project Requirements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 1: Foundation</td><td data-align="center">– 150 Metal Parts<br>– 200 Plastic Parts<br>– 80 ARC Alloy<br>– 15 Steel Springs</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 2: Core Systems</td><td data-align="center">– 35 Durable Cloth<br>– 25 Wires<br>– 20 Electrical Components<br>– 4 Cooling Coils</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 3: Framework</td><td data-align="center">– 4 Light Bulbs<br>– 30 Batteries<br>– 10 Shredder Gyros<br>– 1 Exodus Modules</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 4: Outfitting</td><td data-align="center">– 5 Frequency Modulation Boxes<br>– 5 Advanced Electrical Components<br>– 3 Ion Sputters<br>– 3 Leaper Pulse Units</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 5: Load Stage</td><td data-align="center">– 250,000 Coins worth of Combat Items<br>– 100,000 Coins worth of Survival Items<br>– 150,000 Coins worth of Provisions<br>– 300,000 Coins worth of Materials</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 6: Departure</td><td data-align="center">No donations needed, you’re ready for the Expedition</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-rewards-for-the-second-expedition">What Are The Rewards For The Second Expedition?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is it worth it? Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You don’t get direct rewards from the Expedition Project like you would from other Projects, as you’ll instead be rewarded with permanent and consecutive bonuses for your character.</strong></p>



<p>However, your rewards will vary depending on whether you completed the first expedition or not, as well as how many Coins you have when you depart, which can all seem a bit confusing. Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has broken it down in the table below, splitting the rewards into two tiers:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Rewards If It’s Your First Expedition</th><th data-align="center">Rewards If It’s Your Second Expedition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">The Patchwork Outfit (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">The Patchwork Outfit—Evolved (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Scrappy Cosmetics (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">Scrappy Cosmetics (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Expedition Indicator Icon (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">The Expedition Indicator Icon (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 12 Stash Spaces (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">+ 24 Stash Spaces (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 0-5 Skill Points (Permanent, dependent on player wealth)</td><td data-align="center">+ 0-5 Skill Points (Permanent, dependent on player wealth)<br>+ Catch up on missed Skill Points (Permanent, dependent on player wealth)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 5% XP Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td><td data-align="center">+ 10% XP Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 6% Scrappy Materials Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td><td data-align="center">+ 12% Scrappy Materials Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 60% Repair Value Increase (Consecutive Buff)</td><td data-align="center">+ 70% Repair Value Increase (Consecutive Buff)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The key thing to note regarding the Expedition rewards is the extra Skill Points, as they’re dependent on your Coin total when you depart on the Expedition. Each extra Skill Point is worth <strong>600,000 Coins</strong>, meaning you’ll need to have <strong>3,000,000 Coins</strong> to your name if you want all five Skill Points on offer. </p>







<p>If it’s your second Expedition, and you didn’t manage to claim all of the Skill Points from the first one, then you’re in luck, as there’s a way to make up for lost time. Those now have a value, too, as they’re worth <strong>300,000 Coins</strong> per Skill Point. If you want to claim all five of them, you’ll need an extra <strong>1,500,000 Coins</strong>; add that onto the original five Skill Points, and that totals a whopping <strong>4,500,000 Coins</strong>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Larian Isn’t Involved in the Baldur’s Gate TV Show, and They’re Not Happy]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/larian-not-involved-baldurs-gate-tv-show-not-happy/</link>
            <guid>1427908</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently revealed that HBO plans to produce a Baldur’s Gate live-action adaptation, helmed by Craig Mazin, one of the leads who has brought The Last of Us to life over the last few years. It has been confirmed that the show will continue after the events of Baldur’s Gate 3 and will feature the characters from the smash-hit 2023 game.</p>



<p>However, shortly after the news dropped regarding the show, it was confirmed that Larian Studios, the <strong>developer </strong>behind Baldur’s Gate 3, will have <strong>no involvement in the series</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-bucking-the-trend-and-not-involving-the-developer">Bucking the Trend and Not Involving the Developer</h2>



<p>Larian having zero involvement in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hbo-developing-baldurs-gate-series-from-the-last-of-us-showrunner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3 television series</a> is a bold move. From what we’ve seen already, developers of these popular games have had a direct input in the production of their live-action adaptations. For instance, Neil Druckmann is a writer and executive producer on The Last of Us, which surfaced in 2013 from Naughty Dog.</p>



<p>Similarly, the likes of Todd Howard (Bethesda Game Studios) have executive producer credits and deep involvement in the creation of Fallout, another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/">award-winning adaptation</a> that just wrapped its second season this week.</p>



<p>In recent years, one of the only examples of a developer <strong>not </strong>being involved in a live-action adaptation would be the Borderlands movie. Randy Pitchford, of Gearbox, revealed to Insider Gaming at Gamescom 2025 that he didn’t have any input in the movie and would have felt uncomfortable if he had.</p>



<p>On social media, the Director of Publishing at Larian Studios, Michael Douse, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019571113345396945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Except that we made it popular enough for it to be referred to as Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When prompted in the comments to confirm if Larian would ‘sue or something’, he simply said, ‘Not really.’</p>



<p>He then wrote a lengthy series of posts talking about Larian having some of the best video game writers in the world, explaining, ‘I genuinely don’t think anyone can trump our writers.’ He wrapped by saying, ‘Don’t abandon hope, but do expect the world. That’s the job.’</p>







<p>Do you think it’s a huge concern that Larian won’t be invested in the creation of a Baldur’s Gate 3 television show? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite February 2026 Roadmap: Love Legends Event, Collabs & More]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-february-2026-roadmap/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Regular new content drops continue to take place in Fortnite, and February 2026 is stacked, with Epic Games dropping a big teaser roadmap of what to expect.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/">Battle Royale</a> behemoth is in the latter stages of the current season, but a new Fortnite Festival season has only just begun. Additionally, updates are also coming to other modes, including Reload and Fortnite OG.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for all of the dates and new content coming in the Fortnite Roadmap for February 2026, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-complete-fortnite-february-2026-roadmap">Complete Fortnite February 2026 Roadmap</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to come. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite has plenty to add in February with the month-long Love Legends event, featuring new collabs, free rewards, and more.</strong></p>



<p>The Love Legends event kicked off immediately after the update on February 5, with the first major content coming the following day with the second wave of KPop Demon Hunter Skins. </p>



<p>Later in the month, players can expect new weapons and items in Battle Royale, along with the long-awaited return of The Seven.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the major additions coming to Fortnite in February 2026, as revealed by Epic Games. New announcements will be added regularly.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Fortnite Addition</th><th data-align="center">Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">February 6</td><td data-align="center">– KPop Demon Hunters Wave 2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 7</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour<br>– Pink Storm Shield</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 13</td><td data-align="center">– Nitemare Island Returns<br>– Cupid’s Crossbow</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 14</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 15</td><td data-align="center">– Fortnite OG Ice Storm Live Event</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 19</td><td data-align="center">– DeLorean Return<br>– Lantern Fest Reload Map</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 21</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 23</td><td data-align="center">– Return of The Seven<br>– New Item</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-there-more-coming-in-february-2026">Is There More Coming in February 2026?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Fortnite will definitely have plenty more to add in February 2026, including content added beyond February 23.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games’ reveal teaser only covered up until February 23 and the additions beyond that date will likely center around the long-awaited return of The Seven.</p>



<p>There will also be a significant build-up to the first seasonal change of 2026, with Chapter 7, Season 2 kicking off in early March.</p>



<p>Players should also expect further collab skins to drop in the Item Shop, as Epic Games is on a roll of major additions so far this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Where is Zero Build in Fortnite? Zero Build Removed Rumors, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite continues to drop regular updates, but the latest has caused some confusion, with some questioning whether the popular Zero Build modes have been removed.</p>



<p>Zero Build is a more accessible version of Fortnite’s popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> mode, removing all of the complicated build mechanics from the game, and it regularly attracts hundreds of thousands of players.</p>



<p>Tweaks in Fortnite’s February 5 update have raised some questions for Zero Build, but Insider Gaming is here to clear the air.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-is-zero-build-in-fortnite">Where is Zero Build in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Settings. Screenshot by FGZ</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Zero Build is found in the lobby settings for the mode,  the same area where options for Team Size and Squad Fill are located.</strong></p>



<p>Once the game mode you want to play has been selected, the option for Zero Build can then be toggled. Here’s a step-by-step approach to the full process.</p>



<ol>
<li>Log in to Fortnite as you normally would.</li>



<li>Choose a game mode with Zero Build available (Battle Royale, OG, Reload, Blitz).</li>



<li>In the lobby screen, select the options found above the yellow Play button, where it should currently say: Build, Solo.</li>



<li>In the pop-up screen, click where it says ‘Zero Build.’</li>



<li>Select any other options as you desire, including Ranked and Team Size.</li>



<li>Hit ‘Close’ to return to the lobby, with your changes saved, or press ‘Play’ to begin searching for a match.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-did-fortnite-remove-zero-build">Did Fortnite Remove Zero Build?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Fortnite has not removed Zero Build from the game, but there have</strong> <strong>been some changes to tidy up the lobby and mode selection screen.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite has evolved significantly since Epic Games initially released the title, regularly adding new game modes for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>Additionally, there’s far too much to keep track of when all the popular Creative modes are taken into account.</p>



<p>In the update on February 5, Epic Games made a big change to the mode select screen. However, Zero Build is still available across all major modes, including Fortnite OG, Reload, and Blitz.</p>
