<p>The voice behind Princess Zelda discusses the direction and expectations, or lackthereof, she was given during her audition.</p>



<p>Patricia Summersett has been the English voice of Princess Zelda since the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" id="2579">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> in 2017. Now, she’s opening up about the audition process, the direction she was given by Nintendo, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-summersett-was-given-bleached-script-ahead-of-casting">Summersett Was Given ‘Bleached Script’ Ahead of Casting</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-zelda-turns-40-voice-actress-patricia-summersett-reveals-hopes-for-the-future-and-clarifies-her-thoughts-on-link-and-zeldas-gorgeous-relationship" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Patricia Summersett explained that she was given a bleached script when first auditioning for the role. This means that she was given limited information about the role she was auditioning for and didn’t actually know she was attempting to provide the voice for one of gaming’s most iconic characters. </p>



<p>Summersett was given the description of Zelda as a younger teenage princess who is wise beyond her years. She was also told that the character had the weight of the world thrust upon her.</p>



<p>“Those were key things I’d gone into when I looked at the script, when I started to play around with my voice and decide what to do for that particular character,” she said.</p>



<p>Additionally, Summersett reveals that she’d also tried out for other roles in the game, one of which ended up being Urbosa.</p>







<h2 id="h-summersett-views-her-zelda-accent-as-hylian">Summersett Views Her Zelda Accent As Hylian</h2>



<p>As for Zelda having a British accent, Summersett revealed that it was not a note from Nintendo. Rather, it was a choice she made on her own.</p>



<p>“I schooled in London and so I thought something that sounds a little bit RP would make it heightened and put it into that kind of class system I was imagining for royalty. So I did that,” she said. “It’s a little more comfortable to say this is a Hylian accent versus just a particular version of a UK accent.”</p>







<p>Link and Zelda are coming to the big screen for the first time ever in 2027. Check out the latest on the Legend of Zelda movie at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" id="132081">this link.</a></p>

<p>NVIDIA’s CFO sets the stage for uncertainty about the company’s ability to grow in the gaming sector amid current memory shortages.</p>



<p>Currently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nvidia/" id="420">NVIDIA </a>is reporting record growth following its Q4 earnings for fiscal year 2026. However, as the company moves toward a heavy focus on AI and data centers, rather than relying on gaming for the majority of its revenue, the question has been raised about whether it will continue to grow year over year in the forthcoming fiscal year.</p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-cfo-cautions-investors-on-gaming-growth-uncertainty">NVIDIA CFO Cautions Investors on Gaming Growth Uncertainty</h2>



<p>During an investor call following the release of their quarterly earnings, NVIDIA CFO Colette Kress was asked directly if she foresees a continued pattern of year-over-year growth in the next fiscal year. </p>



<p>In response, she said that, as much as the company would love to have an additional supply of memory, they expect things to be tight for the next “couple of quarters.” Therefore, it’s still too early to tell.</p>



<p>“We do believe for a couple of quarters, it is going to be very tight. If things improve by the end of the year, there is an opportunity to think about what that is from a year-over-year growth [angle], but it’s still too early for us to know at this time, and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="h-nvidia-is-skipping-graphics-card-releases-to-focus-on-ai">NVIDIA Is Skipping Graphics Card Releases to Focus on AI</h2>



<p>It was recently reported that NVIDIA was opting not to release new graphics cards this year. This isn’t a concerted effort to focus on AI chips and datacenters due to the RAM shortage. Additionally, the company plans on cutting production of the current RTX 50-series graphics cards due to the shortage.

<p>NVIDIA reports unprecedented growth in its financial results for Q4 of the fiscal year 2026.</p>



<p>On February 25, NVIDIA announced its quarterly earnings for the quarter, which ended one month earlier. The company recorded revenue of $68.1 billion, up 20% from the previous quarter and 73% from this time last year. Also, total revenue for the fiscal year was $215.9 billion. That is a 65% increase from the prior year.</p>







<h2>Data Center Growth Skyrockets for NVIDIA</h2>



<p>As the AI boom continues to take shape, NVIDIA’s Q4 data center revenue was a record-setting $62.3 billion, up 22% from the previous quarter and 75% from last year. Their report attributes this growth to major platform shifts, specifically accelerated Computing and AI. Full-year data center revenue rose 68% to a record $193.7 billion.</p>







<h2 id="h-gaming-revenue-grows-for-nvidia">Gaming Revenue Grows for NVIDIA</h2>



<p>As for gaming revenue, Q4 saw a 47% year-over-year increase. Total gaming revenue for the quarter with $3.7 billion. However, while there was year-over-year growth, gaming and aipc revenue are actually down 13% from the previous quarter. That decrease is attributed to inventory naturally moderating following a season of strong holiday demand.</p>



<p><a href="https://incomeshares.com/en-eu/insights/nvidia-revenue-change-since-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jonathan Hobbs of IncomeShares </a>noted that back in 2020, gaming was the largest revenue driver for NVIDIA. However, data centers now account for 90% of NVIDIA’s revenue, signaling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-wont-release-a-new-graphics-card-this-year-as-it-focuses-on-ai/" id="174579">the concentrated shift to AI.</a></p>







<p>The AI boom, leading to a RAM shortage, continues to loom over the future of gaming. Currently, it is expected that gamers may not see the PlayStation 6<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-may-be-released-as-late-as-2029/" id="177026"> until 2029</a>. Even Microsoft does not want to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-not-committed-to-hard-2027-launch-for-next-xbox-its-claimed/" id="175153">commit to a 2027 launch window for its next console.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a new week, and it’s an important one! This is when you’ll see the 1000th NYT Connections puzzle land, so expect some interesting challenges to surface as the week goes on. Today, we’re one step closer to that milestone with #995, which is a neat one to start your week with.</p>



<p>If you’re coming out of a sweet weekend and preparing to start a busy work week, make sure you kick it off the right way with a spot of NYT Connections success. Below, you’ll find the hints and answers you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon’s Server Slam Didn’t Gain Traction This Weekend, But It Still Topped Some Titans]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-server-slam-traction-top-titans/</link>
            <guid>1450033</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon’s server slam started on Thursday, and within a couple of hours, hundreds of thousands of people had either downloaded it and started playing <strong>or </strong>started watching it on a streaming platform somewhere. It picked up pace, hit more than 143,000 concurrent players on Steam alone, and then promptly <strong><em>fizzled</em></strong><em>.</em></p>



<p>Within six hours, the peak dropped by 30,000 players, and by the following evening, it was peaking at <strong>half </strong>the original high. Many believed the weekend would yield some gains as players worldwide came off work and into Bungie’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98">Marathon</a>, but it wasn’t to be. That being said, the server slam still managed to top some titans on Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-could-go-either-way">Marathon Could Go Either Way</h2>



<p>Marathon didn’t make immense waves in the gaming space this weekend, but it still beat the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty/" id="32">Call of Duty</a>.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that these two titanic franchises have had their fair share of issues in the last few months. Black Ops 7 launched to a woeful reception and is suffering immensely at the hands of a disinterested community. On the other hand, Battlefield 6 continues to flounder amidst poor updates and a slow change cadence.</p>



<p>Marathon will be the ‘new shiny thing’ this month when it launches on March 5, marking Bungie’s long-awaited entry into the extraction shooter space. It’s going up against some monumental competition, especially in the form of both ARC Raiders and Escape from Tarkov, but tens of thousands of people have already gotten a taste of Marathon and (likely) want more.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4254230/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon’s server slam</a> product had a 24-hour peak player count of 76,437 users <strong>on Steam</strong>. This is how that stacks up against other, similar games on the platform:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARC Raiders – 227,765</li>



<li>Apex Legends – 201,571</li>



<li><strong>Marathon – 76,437</strong></li>



<li>Battlefield 6 – 71,861</li>



<li>Call of Duty – 52,575</li>



<li>Escape from Tarkov – 19,220</li>



<li>Destiny 2 – 11,623</li>
</ul>



<p>The discourse around Marathon has been pretty mixed. There’s enough positivity there for the game to enjoy a semi-decent launch, but only if Bungie can deliver a strong roadmap and rapid enough updates. The team has already been addressing the game’s biggest gripes, including concerns around the complex UI, the lack of PvP, and optimization issues on PC platforms.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Marathon is <strong>also </strong>going to be a game that lives or dies by its viewership, such is the life of extraction games. If the creators can get hooked, they’ll retain an audience and keep feeding people into the game, but if that doesn’t happen, Marathon will surely plummet.</p>



<p>In the opening hours of the server slam, Marathon secured a peak of around 301,000 viewers <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/407314011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitch</a>, and then, thanks to a huge push from popular streamers, it edged past that to hit 350,000 on Sunday, March 1. That was short-lived, though. The peak came at around 7 PM GMT, and by 10 PM GMT, only 70,000 people were watching the game.</p>



<p>It should be stressed that this isn’t a <strong>negative </strong>take of Marathon’s performance, as such. This is a game that could offer a sorely needed shake-up to the extraction genre, in a way that ARC Raiders managed to do in October 2025. It’s unique enough to leave a mark on the space, but the longevity of the thing is yet to be witnessed.</p>
