<p>A new public beta for Obsidian Entertainment’s Pillars of Eternity has been announced to test a mode fans have been asking for. Furthermore, it’s open to everyone starting on November 5th.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment has been in rare form in 2025. From Grounded to The Outer Worlds 2, the RPG-centric company has had quite the year. Fortunately, it hasn’t forgotten about its past, especially its Pillars of Eternity series. Inspired by Baldur’s Gate, the top-down RPG has gone on to have a sequel, Deadfire, and be the setting for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-so-far-about-avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> in Eora. One feature that fans of Deadfire got to try was turn-based combat, evolving the game’s stop-and-play style. After a tease this year, the team has announced that it’s coming to the original in beta form.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post from Obsidian</a>, it announced that Turn-Based Mode is coming to the original Pillars of Eternity. The mode, available via a public beta, is releasing on November 5th, 2025. You can see the gameplay in action <a href="https://youtu.be/_Mj6HObhD_8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">above</a>, but it seems the team wants to fix some of the snags it encountered during its incorporation into Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire. Combat feels a lot faster and accurate, which fans should enjoy. Luckily, if you want to test it out or change it, you can freely switch between regular and turn-based whenever. </p>



<p>For fans of Pillars of Eternity, this seems like the perfect time to return to the series. A third entry is unknown, as the previous two titles needed crowdfunding to come together. However, after Deadfire, Obsidian was bought by Microsoft, followed by The Outer Worlds and Pentiment. Perhaps this addition could lead to a franchise return? We shall see but, for now, this should do for fans and newcomers alike.</p>



<p>What do you think of Turn-Based Mode coming to Pillars of Eternity? Did you play the mode in Deadfire? Will you join the beta on November 5th? Would you like to see the series return?

<p>NetEase is closing one of its studios, just two years after it was first opened. </p>



<p>As per studio head Greg Street, Fantastic Pixel Castle will be shutting down as of November 17. It’s likely that the entirety of the staff at the studio will be made redundant.</p>



<p>“While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains,” Street said on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. “While we’d love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that’s at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there.”</p>



<p>Fantastic Pixel Castle was formed in 2023 by NetEase, and had been working on a triple-A fantasy MMO codenamed “Ghost”. Prior to heading Fantastic Pixel Castle, Street was a lead systems designer on World of Warcraft.</p>



<div><p>“To the literally dozens of people who reached out trying to help us raise capital, or through introductions to people who could, you humble me,” he continued. There is still a chance one of them works out, and it really only takes one. To our supporters at NetEase, thanks for taking a chance on us.</p><p>“For our team, I appreciate you coming with me on this journey, and let us hope we can continue to work together.”</p></div>



<p>The studio’s confirmed closure comes just weeks after Street first announced that NetEase was pulling funding from the studio. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_i-wanted-to-share-the-news-that-fantastic-activity-7382143103379587072-LfgX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">At the time</a>, he said that NetEase had been “gracious and supportive” while they looked for a new publisher. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase for a statement on what happened during efforts to find a new partner. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam’s most popular graphics card is an Nvidia GPU that was first released in February 2021. According to the latest Steam hardware survey for October 2025, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 is the most used card on the platform at 4.47%. </p>



<p>It’s a slight increase from the 4.41% share the card had in September.</p>



<p>Speaking of September, the month’s most popular card, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU, saw its share fall from 4.84% to 4.30%. It was still good for second.</p>



<p>Rounding out the top five for October were the GeForce RTX 4060, RTX 3050, and GTX 1650 at three to five, respectively. Interestingly enough, the GTX 1650 was released six years ago in April 2019. Even the GTX 1060, which Nvidia announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-ending-support-for-two-of-steams-most-used-graphics-cards-among-others/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was ending support</a> for earlier this year, still has a 1.95% share.</p>



<p>For those looking for non-Nvidia graphics cards, you have to go to ninth on the list for AMD Radeon Graphics to make an appearance. Intel’s Iris Xe Graphics, which has a 1.9% share, appears at 15.</p>



<p>You can check out the full survey results for yourself via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s website</a>, including where your GPU sits in the hardware survey.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Server Status—Is ARC Raiders Down Now?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-server-status-down-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-server-status%E2%80%94is-arc-raiders-down-now.1342351/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is an online-only game, and that naturally comes with some issues when the network falters. If you’re trying to get into ARC Raiders but are being met with a server queue, or if you’re being forced out of the game by a network error, you might want to know what’s happening and what the ARC Raiders server status looks like.</p>



<p>That’s natural – after all, you’ve paid to get the game, and it’s only fair for you to want your money’s worth! In this guide, I’ll help you understand whether ARC Raiders is down <strong>now</strong>, and if it’s not undergoing a severe outage, what you can do to figure out your ARC Raiders error or concern.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-arc-raiders-server-status">How to Check ARC Raiders Server Status</h2>



<p>Embark Studios has developed and published ARC Raiders in-house, but the team hasn’t provided a way to check the game’s server status. There are no <strong>official methods </strong>to check if ARC Raiders is having network issues.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean you’re out of luck. Here are a few ways you can check the server status of ARC Raiders:</p>



<h3 id="h-use-a-network-checker-service">Use a Network Checker Service</h3>



<p>If you use a service like <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DownDetector</a> or <a href="https://status.technobezz.com/arc-raiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBezz</a>, you can see if other users are pinging an error in ARC Raiders. If there’s a widespread issue preventing connections to the game, other gamers will go online to the sites and paint a perfect picture of where they’re having their problems.</p>







<p>If you’re on social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter (X), Instagram, or even in an ARC Raiders-related Discord server, you can run a search for the game’s server status or for any like-minded players sharing information about outages. It’s a little loose, but it works, as people often take to social media immediately when an ARC Raiders server issue starts.</p>



<h3 id="h-use-player-count-trackers">Use Player Count Trackers</h3>



<p>This is a <strong>very unreliable </strong>method to check the ARC Raiders server status, but you can use a real-time player count tracker service like <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. If the player count in the last few minutes has plummeted, it’s a clear sign that something might be wrong and that thousands of people are being kicked from the game or are failing to connect.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-fix-arc-raiders-network-error-is-arc-raiders-down">How to Fix ARC Raiders Network Error—Is ARC Raiders Down?</h2>



<p>If you’re stuck in an ARC Raiders queue or suffering under the weight of an error code, you don’t have to panic.</p>



<p>There are some general network fixes you can apply to try ‘working around’ the core problem impacting the ARC Raiders servers.</p>



<ul>
<li>Restart your router or modem to refresh your internet connection</li>



<li>Power cycle or restart your console or PC, and reopen the game</li>



<li>Verify your game’s integrity or reinstall it entirely (it’s only a small game; it won’t take long)</li>



<li>Disable any VPN or proxy services you have live</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re wondering how long the ARC Raiders queue is, well, you’re also out of luck. Embark Studios has implemented a server queue feature in ARC Raiders, but hasn’t given any indication as to how long the queue is when you’re in it.</p>



<p>If you’re suffering from any ARC Raiders server errors on any platform, let us know about it on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
