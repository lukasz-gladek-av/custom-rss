<p>Fallout is one of the most recognizable post-apocalyptic franchises in modern gaming. It has become a multimedia gem in recent years with the emergence of the live-series television show, and it boasts a lengthy lineup of titles that span almost a thirty-year history. </p>



<p>In 2004, Bethesda Game Studios acquired a license to develop Fallout 3, before purchasing the franchise outright in 2007. In the words of one of the most notable developers in the Fallout space, it wouldn’t be until Fallout 4 was developed and released almost a decade later that the team felt ‘comfortable’ with the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-comfortable-with-creation-in-fallout">Getting Comfortable with Creation in Fallout</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GamesRadar, Emil Pagliarulo, one of the Bethesda veterans who has driven the production of Fallout forward over the years, dropped a tasty titbit. He suggested that it took <strong>a long time </strong>for Bethesda to get comfortable with this legendary series, especially following the pivot that saw Fallout 3 become a transformative first-person RPG.</p>



<p>He suggested that buying the brand wasn’t enough for the company to feel as flexible and inventive as they might have wanted. In Fallout 3, it was all about paying tribute to what had come before, and it wasn’t until 2015’s Fallout 4 that the team felt more creative.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The big thing about Fallout 3 was it’s this transitional game. It was the first Fallout we had done. So we wanted to make sure we were really honoring the legacy of the franchise and those earlier games.</p>



<p>We owned it, but owning a franchise and an IP is different than feeling like you own it creatively.</p>



<p>I think by the time Fallout 4 came around we felt more comfortable with like okay, ‘we don’t have to be so reverential now, it’s not all nostalgia, we can create some new stuff.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thanks to <em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/bethesda-was-scared-of-making-fallout-3-but-by-fallout-4-it-had-chilled-out-we-dont-have-to-be-so-reverential-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> </em>for the interview quote.</p>



<p>Perhaps Emil is forgetting the creation of Fallout Shelter, which was released just before Fallout 4 and was a pretty innovative and transformative game in itself.</p>



<p>Fallout 3 is seen as being one of the greatest games ever made. It’s a treasure trove of a title that was expanded with stellar drops for months after the game launched, and even today, it remains a fan favorite title. Fallout 4, which is by numbers a better seller than Fallout 3, wasn’t received quite as well.</p>



<p>And in the middle of that, you have Fallout: New Vegas, seen by many as the best Fallout game ever made, which Bethesda <strong>published </strong>rather than developed outright. That accolade goes to Obsidian.</p>



<p>The wider community has mixed feelings about Bethesda’s ‘treatment’ of Fallout over the years. It’s expected that the next major release in the series, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-todd-howard-confirmed-fallout-5-details/">Fallout 5</a>, won’t surface for many years, and for now, Fallout 76 and Fallout Shelter are the only games in the series receiving substantial updates.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Quietly Ends Production of the Most Affordable Steam Deck]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valve-ends-production-affordable-steam-deck-lcd/</link>
            <guid>1389466</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve has undertaken a shake-up of sorts in the handheld gaming world, nixing production of the most affordable Steam Deck, the LCD ‘OG’ model. It was recently discovered by eagle-eyed gamers that Valve had silently posted a note on the <span>Steam Deck store page, referenc<strong>ing the end of production</strong>, with what was left representing the final stock of&nbsp;</span>the LCD model.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, we were able to add the 256GB LCD model to our basket, but who knows how many are left to purchase in Valve’s supply lines?</p>







<h2 id="h-oled-or-bust">OLED or Bust</h2>



<p>If you want a Steam Deck going forward, you’ll soon need to rely exclusively on the OLED model, which has an entry pricing point of $549 for the 512GB variant. That’s a fair reach over the 256GB LCD model, which boasts a price tag of $399 at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Of course, the OLED model is an improvement in <strong>many ways</strong>. It has a bigger, better screen, better networking capabilities, a larger battery, and a *<em>checks notes</em>* longer charging cable, amongst other things.</p>



<p>It comes as no surprise to learn that Valve is discontinuing the LCD Steam Deck, but many expected a cut-price deal to get rid of them, particularly amidst the ongoing Steam Winter Sale and the approach to the festive window. If stock is there to be cleared, then host a clearance sale!</p>



<p>Last year, when discontinuation plans started surfacing, Valve knocked 15% off the price before phasing out the 64GB LCD Steam Deck.</p>



<p>If you head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam’s storefront</a> and try to shop for a Steam Deck, you’ll see the small print:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Valve is moving on to bigger and brighter things, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/">recently revealed Steam Machine</a>, a hybrid device that’s supposed to be the perfect combination of a gaming PC and a traditional home console.</p>



<p>It’s slated for a 2026 release, but nobody has the pricing structure for the thing on lock just yet.</p>







<p>Are you hoping that the Steam Deck LCD model gets a price slash so you can scoop one without breaking the bank? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splinter Cell fans everywhere have been chomping at the bit for a new game in the series, but Ubisoft has left the franchise to stagnate for more than a decade. It’s getting to a point of desperation for some, especially with talk of the ‘Splinter Cell Remake’ floating around <strong>all the time</strong> with almost nothing concrete to back it up.</p>



<p>However, a recent announcement revealed that Sam Fisher is (kind of) back in an all-new way, emerging in the popular VR extraction shooter, Ghosts of Tabor.</p>







<h2 id="h-ghosts-of-tabor-x-splinter-cell-crossover">Ghosts of Tabor x Splinter Cell Crossover</h2>



<p>If you’ve ever wanted to experience the role of Sam Fisher from a VR-based perspective, now is your chance. In a new trailer uploaded by the Combat Waffle team, it was revealed that an official partnership with Ubisoft has brought Fisher’s iconic garb to the VR shooter.</p>



<p>The ‘Splinter Cell DLC’ allows players to <strong>become </strong>Sam Fisher, but elements like the gruff tones of Michael Ironside will be up to them to emulate.</p>



<p>Here’s what’s coming in the Ghosts of Tabor x Splinter Cell DLC:</p>



<ul>
<li>Karambit Melee Weapon</li>



<li>FN 57 Weapon Camo</li>



<li>MP7 Weapon Camo</li>



<li>Third Echelon NVGs</li>



<li>Third Echelon Tactical Kevlar Vest</li>



<li>Third Echelon Suit</li>
</ul>



<p>Why wait for a new game containing Sam Fisher to surface when you can dress up as him and go on a merry LARP in Ghosts of Tabor, which we once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghosts-of-tabor-tarkov-vr/">dubbed ‘Escape from Tarkov VR’</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the Splinter Cell DLC:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Ghosts of Tabor is available on Meta Quest, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957780/Ghosts_of_Tabor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC VR</a>, and PlayStation VR, and it’s widely considered one of the best shooters to occupy the VR ecosystem. It has been around for a couple of years, and the folks at Combat Waffle are constantly updating the title with fresh content and tweaks.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Farm A Fish monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Bait, Coins and much more.</p>



<p>Farm A Fish puts you in charge of your own underwater empire on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-universal-tower-defense-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>. Unlike typical fishing games where you simply catch and sell, this aquatic tycoon challenges you to build a thriving fish farming business from scratch. Starting with just a small pond and basic equipment, you’ll expand your operation by cultivating different fish species, each with their own requirements and profit margins. The goal is to build up your ponds, gather better gear and pets, and scale your fishing business to become the most successful fisher in the game.</p>







<p>Progression in Farm A Fish revolves around the game’s primary currency, Coins, which you earn from your fish ponds and spend on new pond expansions, worker upgrades, and special items. The value of your harvests depends on several factors including fish rarity (common to mythic), fish weight (heavier specimens fetch higher prices), and special mutations that can significantly increase a fish’s worth. Although Coins can be earned through regular gameplay by selling your catches and completing quests from NPCs, the fastest way to accelerate your progress is by redeeming promo codes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-active-farm-a-fish-codes">Active Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li>XMAS: 1x Christmas Bait</li>



<li>EARLY: 5x Food Scoop and 500x Coins</li>



<li>Wilco: 1x Wilco Cat and 1x Wilco Pond Skin</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-farm-a-fish-codes">Expired Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<p>There are no expired Farm A Fish Codes at the time of writing. All the released codes are still active and thus players will need to redeem them quickly before they expire.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-farm-a-fish-codes">How To Redeem Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Farm A Fish Codes Redemption Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like most Roblox games, redeeming codes in Farm A Fish is easy and rather simple. That being said, here are the steps for new players:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot Farm A Fish on Roblox</li>



<li>Then open the Store menu on the left side of the screen</li>



<li>Scroll down until you hit the Redeem codes section</li>



<li>Enter a working code in the text box</li>



<li>Click on Redeem button to claim your rewards</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-farm-a-fish-codes">How To Get More Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<p>Farm A Fish codes can typically be found through several official channels maintained by the game’s developer, Tetra Games. The most reliable source is the official Farm A Fish Discord server, where developers post new codes in the dedicated #game-updates channel whenever they release major updates or celebrate special events. This community hub is where you’ll often find codes first, sometimes even before they’re announced elsewhere.</p>







<p>Another great place to check is the official Tetra Games Roblox Group page, where the development team regularly shares news about the game, including promotional codes during milestones like reaching certain player counts or celebrating holidays. However, keeping track of all these sources can be time-consuming, especially since Farm A Fish codes don’t come with notifications when they expire. Therefore, we recommend bookmarking this guide in your browser, as it is regularly updated with the latest Farm A Fish codes and removes expired ones promptly to ensure you always have access to valid codes.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Endzone Strike monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including draws, ball skins and much more.</p>



<p>Endzone Strike fuses high-energy anime action with American football in a unique <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-pet-capture-adventure-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that’s taking the platform by storm. This isn’t your standard sports simulator – it’s a high-octane battle of special moves, character collection, and strategic team building. Players start with basic characters and limited abilities, then work their way up to fielding a squad of powerhouse athletes with flashy special attacks. Each match earns you Strike Points that serve as the game’s main currency. </p>







<p>These points are your ticket to recruiting new players through the gacha-style summoning system, upgrading existing team members, and purchasing equipment that boosts performance. While grinding matches steadily builds your team, the developers regularly release redemption codes on social media and Discord events that grant instant Strike Points, exclusive character skins, or limited-time power-ups.</p>
