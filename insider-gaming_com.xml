<p>Fortnite is seemingly going to collab with one of the most popular live-action series out there, Game of Thrones. </p>



<p>Collabs are something Fortnite is known for, and the developers have been cooking up some really cool ones lately. Some of the biggest ones we have seen lately are with The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simpsons</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kill Bill</a>, Back to the Future, and more. Now, it seems that Epic might have even more in store for us. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-game-of-thrones-is-in-development">Fortnite x Game of Thrones is in Development</h2>



<p>The news about the Game of Thrones and Fortnite collab comes from AdiraFNInfo on <a href="https://x.com/AdiraFNInfo/status/2024434171444101235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) and has been corroborated by reliable leaker, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2024434380031017202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>. The collaboration is expected to arrive “soon,” but the contents and scope of this crossover were not revealed. </p>



<p>Game of Thrones is a fantasy drama series by HBO, an adaptation of George R. R. Martin’s novel. It received widespread critical acclaim and spawned spinoffs such as House of the Dragon, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, and more. </p>



<p>Some of the most popular characters from the series include Jon Snow (played by Kit Harrington), Arya Stark (played by Maisie Williams), Daenerys Targaryen (played by Emilia Clarke), Tyrion Lannister (played by Peter Dinklage), and more. Players would also love to see the Dragons come to Fortnite as a part of this collaboration. </p>



<p>A lot of rumoured Fortnite collaborations have surfaced recently. We have been informed of crossovers with franchises such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-has-a-kingdom-hearts-collab-in-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vampire-diaries-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire Diaries</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, and others; however, none have been officially revealed yet. Some of the leaks that have been accurately revealed recently include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leak-reveals-the-office-collab-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-x-fortnite-collaboration-dropping-in-months-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch</a>. </p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem players will have plenty to do to fully complete the game, with a long list of achievements and trophies waiting to be ticked off.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> hit is one of the most anticipated titles of the year, with fans eagerly awaiting the latest entry in the franchise, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693">Resident Evil Requiem</a> has plenty to offer.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for every achievement and trophy available in Resident Evil Requiem, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>

<figure><figcaption>To-do list. Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem has a long list of trophies and achievements for completionists to churn through, some of which will require careful steps.</strong></p>



<p>By far the most challenging of the trophies is completing the entirety of the main story in under four hours, as well as completing the game on Insanity difficulty. For the rest, it all comes down to progression and exploration, with multiple playthroughs likely to be required.</p>



<p>The trophies and achievements shown below may include some that are hidden and secret, so this is your warning that spoilers may lie ahead.</p>

<p><strong>There</strong> <strong>are 49 achievements and trophies to collect in Resident Evil Requiem, including the coveted Platinum trophy on PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>While many of the achievements and trophies can be earned naturally through progression, others require specific attention. Additionally, it will more than likely require extra playthroughs to tick off every task on the list.</p>



<p>In terms of collectables, there’s plenty to find too, including all Mr. Raccoon memoriams, all BSAA containers, and every safe in the main story.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem is right around the corner, and there is a great demand for spoilers for the main story, so Insider Gaming can whet your appetite.</p>



<p>Releasing on February 27, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is the ninth mainline entry in the beloved series, putting players in control of Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy.</p>



<p>Anticipation is high for Resident Evil Requiem, but while some players are frantically trying to avoid every spoiler they can, others are actively seeking them out. If you’ve stumbled across this article, you’re probably in the latter group.</p>



<p><strong>Warning: This article contains a wealth of spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem. If you don’t want spoilers for the main story and the ending, check out some of the other articles you can read on Insider Gaming.</strong></p>







<h2 id="h-big-resident-evil-requiem-spoilers">Big Resident Evil Requiem Spoilers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Spoilers. Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>This is the final warning before a slew of Resident Evil Requiem spoilers, so this is your last chance to look away!</strong></p>



<p>Alyssa Ashcroft’s fate is cleared up with a full death scene, showing she has been killed by Victor Gideon. As shown in the trailers, he is the main villain of the story, alongside Zeno, who is a clone of Wesker.</p>



<p>The set-up for future games is significant, however, as Spencer makes a return. It’s revealed that Grace is actually Spencer’s daughter. While not officially stated that Alyssa was forced to adopt Grace, it’s implied, and Alyssa was put in charge of Grace’s care after his death.</p>



<p>Despite Spencer’s previous death, it’s made clear he was pulling the strings throughout Requiem, and the release of the cure to the virus was all part of his masterplan.</p>



<p>For completionists, there are two unlockable outfits, one for each character, and 12 unlockable weapons to find.</p>



<p>The majority of the major leaks come from <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-spoiler-thread.1438951/page-13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dusk Golem on the ResetEra forums</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-9-ending-spoilers-explained">Resident Evil 9 Ending Spoilers, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Resident Evil 9 has two possible endings, based on your approach in-game, with a ‘good’ ending, which is canon, and a non-canon ‘bad’ ending.</strong></p>



<p>In the good ending, Elpis, a cure for the infection, is released, resulting in both Grace and Leon surviving. The bad ending, where Elpis is destroyed, leads to Leon’s death.</p>



<p>Crucially, the good ending that cures Leon of his infection leads to him de-ageing and becoming younger, following in the footsteps of Jill. In this ending, Victor Gideon kills Zeno, preventing him from killing Leon.</p>



<p>In the bad ending, Gideon doesn’t appear at the end, and Zeno explodes Leon’s head. However, he also dies as the platform where they are standing collapses.</p>



<p>As mentioned, the ‘bad’ ending with Leon’s death is not <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630">Capcom</a>‘s ‘canon’ ending, and thus leaves the door open for the character to return in future.</p>

<p>A new post teases a focus on Generation 9 for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s next set. </p>



<p>We learned something about Pokémon TCG Pocket recently, with the devs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-has-no-plans-for-tcg-pocket-to-become-a-major-competitive-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirming to Insider Gaming</a> that there are no immediate plans for it to become a competitive game and that it will remain a side event at tournaments. Sticking to their guns, the developers have now teased the next set for the title. </p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-s-next-set-may-focus-on-gen-9">Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Next Set May Focus on Gen 9</h2>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/2024197224645660880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) of Pokémon TCG Pocket has posted a new video teasing Gen 9 for the next set. The video features people in costumes of the Gen 9 starters, including Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. Towards the end of the video, we are flashed with a date and time, February 19, 14:00 UTC. Many players in the comments section are theorising what this tease could be, while others are asking for other upgrades and features.  </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gen 9 Pokémon are primarily found in the Paldea Region, which was introduced in Scarlet and Violet. TCG Pocket currently features some Gen 9 Pokémon with a line for Sprigatito. However, we are yet to receive the Fuecoco and Quaxly lines. Players will have to wait for the official announcement to know for sure what this tease means for the game. </p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>

<p>Fortnite players across the world are locked out of the game on February 19 as Epic Games deploys the latest update to the title, meaning players are impatiently waiting for the Fortnite servers to return.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/epic-games/" id="87655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games</a> drops consistent updates to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battle-royale/" id="127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth seeing maintenance take place every few weeks, on average, and the latest update is expected to be the penultimate drop before Fortnite transitions into Chapter 7 Season 2 next month.</p>



<p>For all the details on when to expect Fortnite servers to be back up and everything coming in the February 19 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New additions. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite servers are down for several hours for the February 19 update, with no set time for a return. However, previous updates offer an indication of how long players need to wait.</strong></p>



<p>Mid-season updates to Fortnite typically result in downtime lasting for three to four hours, so Fortnite servers should be back online after the v39.50 update somewhere between 2 AM PT and 2 AM ET.</p>



<p>However, the exact duration of the downtime is variable, and it can be significantly longer if issues are discovered or if there is a larger patch to deploy.</p>



<p>Don’t worry, though, downtime definitely won’t be as long as The Blackout in 2019, where the game was completely unavailable for two days.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-february-19-update">What’s In The Fortnite February 19 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The major addition to Fortnite in the February 19 update is the start of the Lantern Fest event and new map in Reload, coinciding with the Chinese New Year.</strong></p>



<p>The new Reload map features teams of up to eight players, and the ranks for Reload will also be reset. Alongside these drops, expectr new cosmetic items and rewards to be distributed during the Lantern Fest.</p>



<p>Additional collabs are also on the horizon, with the expected debut of Solo Leveling, alongside further details on the upcoming Honkai: Star Rail and Looney Tunes collabs.</p>



<p>In the main Battle Royale, the return of the Delorean has already been revealed, and there should be a slew of details ahead of the imminent return of The Seven. Additionally, expect further hints on what to expect when Chapter 7 Season 2 kicks off next month.</p>
