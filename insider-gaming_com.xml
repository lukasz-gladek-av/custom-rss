<p>NetEase has cracked the live-service element with Marvel Rivals. We’re already looking ahead to Season 2 as everything the developer puts out is a win, so let’s see the early details to see what the developer is cooking up for the second season.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 2 is unlikely to be as big and as impactful as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>. The first season was the proper debut, we were still in the early days, and player counts usually tend to fall off as time goes on—no matter how good the game. Still, NetEase has Hulk-smashed it, and January 2025 saw its peak <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player count smash the 650,000</a> mark.</p>



<p>That being said, we need to look ahead to the future. The developer needs to keep its foot on the pedal and prioritize retention.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-2-expected-release-period">Marvel Rivals Season 2 Expected Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The saga continues. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NetEase hasn’t outlined an exact start date, but game director Guangyun Chen’s comments suggest Season 2 could start on April 4.</strong></p>



<p>Guangyun Chen said in an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a> that Season One is a “<strong>three-month-long journey</strong>.” Season 1 launched on Friday, January 10, so if we fast-forward three months (12 weeks), we land on <strong>Friday, April 4</strong>.</p>



<p>There are several factors to consider here though. Firstly, three months can mean January to April, so it’s not necessarily 12 weeks. It could be 13 or 14, so it’s logical conjecture for now. Furthermore, it’s quite common for projected dates to change by a week or two due to delays or rethinks.</p>



<p>I’ve seen countless live-service games delay seasons down the years, and Marvel Rivals is liable to suffer the same fate. Fingers crossed it doesn’t, but we will update you on the latest changes and developments.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-2-new-hero-leaks-amp-early-details">Marvel Rivals Season 2 New Hero Leaks &amp; Early Details</h2>



<p><strong>A ton of different leaks suggest Marvel Rivals Season 2 is getting two new heroes from a large selection of potential characters including various X-Men heroes and more.</strong></p>



<p>We know Marvel Rivals is guaranteed to get at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new heroes every three months</a>. Many names have been outed with leakers such as <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@X0X_LEAK</a> posting <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1872451730652422378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">messages on X</a> concerning heroes in the game’s files.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-x-men-characters-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X-Men characters have leaked</a>—thanks to datamining—and suggestions are that more high-profile names such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-claims-deadpool-and-more-are-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool</a> are Marvel Rivals-bound. On the other hand, more reports have come out saying NetEase is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-fake-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hiding fake heroes in game files to catch leakers</a>.”</p>



<p>It’s hard to say for sure if NetEase is doing this, but if they are, it’s an interesting move. For now, here’s every leaked name, and we’ll see if any of them appear in Marvel Rivals Season Two:</p>



<ul>
<li>Angela</li>



<li>Beast</li>



<li>Captain Marvel&nbsp;</li>



<li>Colossus</li>



<li>Deadpool</li>



<li>Emma Frost</li>



<li>Gambit</li>



<li>Hit-Monkey</li>



<li>Jia Jing</li>



<li>Jubilee</li>



<li>Locus</li>



<li>Modok</li>



<li>Nightcrawler</li>



<li>Paste Pot Pete</li>



<li>Phoenix/Jean Grey&nbsp;</li>



<li>Professor X</li>



<li>Rogue</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-marvel-rivals-season-2">What To Expect From Marvel Rivals Season 2</h2>



<p>We’re still weeks away from a Marvel Rivals Season 2 content roadmap or NetEase announcements, but it’s safe to assume we’ll get typical live-service content additions: <strong>New maps, heroes, game modes, and Events</strong>.</p>



<p>This is the kind of information we get more of—including leaks—closer to the time. But, it’s fun to speculate, and it’s easy to make educated guesses based on previous content and seasons.</p>



<p>New heroes are assured, as we covered above, but don’t expect the volume of characters we got in Season 1 as this is considered a one-off. New maps are about the most locked-in type of content for any new hero shooter season too.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-spring-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1’s Spring Festival and Clash of Dancing Lions</a> is an example of the type of events and content Rivals is adding in the future. With Seasons lasting three months, another event or two for Season 2 is a given. We’ll be filling in the blanks as we go on all of this and see if we can borrow Doctor Strange’s powers to see into the future.</p>



<hr>



<p>Details for Marvel Rivals Season 2 are vague right, granted. But it won’t always be the case, and we’ll update you as developments happen. But what do you want to see from the new season? What’s NetEase not getting right in the F2P shooter?</p>

<p>The Need for Speed franchise isn’t dead, it’s just dormant for a while. </p>



<p>EA has confirmed that  it has plans for Criterion Software—developers of 2022’s Need for Speed Unbound and other past racing titles—to return to the franchise in the future. For now, however, the sole focus at Criterion is the next Battlefield game as part of EA’s “Battlefield Studios” team.</p>







<p>“The Need for Speed&nbsp;team at Criterion are joining their colleagues working on Battlefield,” EA’s Vince Zampella&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told Eurogamer</a>. “As a company, it was important to us to take the last year to listen to our Need for Speed community and use their feedback to create content for Unbound.</p>



<p>“With an increased understanding of what our players want in a Need for Speed experience, we plan to bring the franchise back in new and interesting ways.”</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Confirms Battlefield Labs Community Testing Platform</a></h6>



<p>Based on the statement, it seems clear that there is no new Need for Speed in development in any way at the studio. That means, if and when it returns, fans are looking at years down the line for its release.</p>



<p>When do you think Criterion will return to developing Need For Speed? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2-caster-rages-at-liquid-player%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98inexcusable%E2%80%99-misplay.1098858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-caster-rages-at-liquid-players-inexcusable-misplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A color caster for Counter-Strike 2 found himself screaming at a pro player’s mistake, and had to walk away from the desk to cool off. The play and the caster’s reaction occurred at IEM Katowice, one of the biggest tournaments in the yearly CS2 circuit.</p>



<p>What ended up being a terrible series for the player was highlighted by this one unimaginably poor play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-you-doing">‘WHAT ARE YOU DOING?’</h2>



<p>During a match between Team Liquid and The MongolZ, a poor decision from Liquid player Roland “ultimate” Tomkowiak drew the ire of former player and long-time CS2 caster Chad “SPUNJ” Burchill. While defending the B site of Mirage in the pistol round, ultimate waited too long to pull the trigger, allowing a teammate of his to die before he himself got taken out. Both SPUNJ and his casting partner Alex “Machine” Richardson were quite frustrated, but SPUNJ let the full anger out.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250203_AcceptableTriangularAirGuitarThisIsSparta-j-dfX8zpT8v4JKDA_source.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>What ultimate was trying to do was to stay hidden until multiple enemies passed him, so that he could take them all down in quick succession. However, he waited too long to act, and the first player he let by ended up killing his teammate. By the time ultimate lined up the second enemy, the first one noticed him and quickly dispatched him.</p>



<p>Ultimate’s performance in the map prior was clearly a factor in SPUNJ’s outburst, as the Polish player had a <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/matches/mapstatsid/191534/the-mongolz-vs-liquid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0.5 K/D</a> in the first map of the series. Following the mishap, SPUNJ remarked that the play was “inexcusable,” especially considering that Liquid had a man advantage. The CS2 caster chose to walk away from the desk and out of the casting room for the second round. Both SPUNJ and Machine got back on track by the end of the third round though.</p>



<p>To make matters worse for ultimate, Liquid lost despite winning map one, and he ended with one of his worst stat lines ever. On a positive note, ultimate played better the next day versus MOUZ, and Liquid is still alive in Katowice.</p>



<p>Was ultimate’s play warrant that big of a reaction from the caster? Let us know what you think down below or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Sonic 3 recently surpassed Detective Pikachu to become the second-highest-grossing video game movie ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://screenrant.com/sonic-3-second-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-box-office-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a>, a report by <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Sonic-the-Hedgehog-3-(2024)#tab=summary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Numbers</a> reveals that Sonic 3 earned $462.5 million globally, with domestic and international box office earnings almost at par. Sonic 3’s latest numbers beat Detective Pikachu’s $450 million, which held the title of second-highest-grossing video game movie of all time until today. However, Sonic 3 is miles away from The Super Mario Bros. Movie’s earnings, which managed to bring in $1.36 billion globally, retaining the title of the highest-earning video game movie ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sonic 3 sees Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails join forces to confront one of their most formidable opponents yet: Shadow. Shadow is a fan-favourite character from the video game series, and excitement for the movie skyrocketed when Keanu Reeves was announced to portray the enigmatic character. The enhanced visuals and Jim Carrey’s outstanding performance as Dr. Eggman have also contributed to the film’s success.</p>



<p>With Sonic 3 becoming the second-highest-grossing video game movie of all time, players will expect more movie adaptations to be released in the near future. Just recently, a popular video game got greenlit for a movie adaptation, and fans are waiting in anticipation for its arrival. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-movie-confirmed-story-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sleeping Dogs movie</a> is now confirmed to be in production, with Story Kitchen, Square Enix, and Simu Liu bringing it to life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 has been confirmed, with the movie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-confirmed-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poised to release in 2027.</a> Also, a post-credits scene may have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked the new characters</a> arriving for Sonic 4.
