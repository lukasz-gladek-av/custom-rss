<p>The long-rumored StarCraft shooter looks set to be revealed this year. </p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a>, the StarCraft third-person shooter is “likely” to be revealed at BlizzCon 2026 in September.</p>







<p>“The headline for BlizzCon 2026 is most likely going to be&nbsp;StarCraft,” Corden writes. “It was&nbsp;previously reported that StarCraft is getting the third-person shooter treatment, and I confirmed these rumors true via my own sources a while back.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, rumors of this new game are nothing new. As far back as September 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-starcraft-shooter-in-development-at-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported</a> on this new title, which first came from Jason Schreier. It was mentioned as being in development in his latest book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725429/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future Of Blizzard Entertainment</a>, and former Far Cry head Dan Hay was leading the team.</p>



<p>No other details about this game are known at this point, but to hear it’s still moving forward has to be excited for fans of the franchise. Of course, this isn’t the first time Blizzard is attempting a shooter based on the StarCraft franchise. </p>







<p>Back in 2002, Blizzard announced StarCraft: Ghost, a stealth-action shooter. Eventually, the game was put on an “indefinite hold” in March 2006 before being canceled. </p>



<p>Overall, there hasn’t been a new release in the StarCraft universe since StarCraft: Remastered in 2017. The last new original release was StarCraft 2 in 2010.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mysterious Fallout Countdown Isn’t Related to Fallout 3 Remake, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-3-remake-not-linked-to-mysterious-countdown/</link>
            <guid>1399441</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re at all invested in the Fallout space, you’ll have heard about the ‘mysterious countdown’ that’s running on the Amazon Prime platform. It’s set to expire when the last episode of the Fallout TV show’s second season drops on February 4. From the moment the countdown popped up, fans have believed it to be counting down to a reveal of the Fallout 3 remake.</p>



<p>However, a new report from a notable source has suggested this <strong>is not the case</strong>. It’s not counting down to a shadow drop or announcement of the Fallout 3 remake, <strong>but </strong>the project <strong>is </strong>on the way.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-3-remake-is-coming-but-nobody-knows-when">Fallout 3 Remake is Coming, But Nobody Knows When</h2>



<p>In a new and extensive report from Windows Central, the future of Xbox and the many studios under the gaming titan’s banner was explored. It’s a huge year for ‘Team Green’, and several high-profile anniversaries promise some sizeable announcements should be lined up.</p>



<p>Fans of the post-apocalyptic series from Bethesda Game Studios have been expecting a reveal of the Fallout 3 remake for quite some time. However, despite references to the project being found in documents some years ago, <strong>nothing concrete </strong>has been announced by the studio.</p>



<p>That might be about to change soon, but what’s suspected to be the biggest indicator of an impending announcement has been <strong>debunked</strong>.</p>



<p>In Jez Corden’s <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent supersized breakdown</a> of what’s coming in the Xbox space, the insider stressed that the Fallout countdown running on the Amazon Prime site is <strong>not </strong>related to a Fallout 3 remake announcement.</p>



<p>He wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m told this is not the case. However, we are&nbsp;<em>eventually&nbsp;</em>getting a Fallout 3 remake in the vein of&nbsp;Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not clear when Bethesda Game Studios plans to announce the Fallout 3 remake, but at this point, it’s almost guaranteed that it’ll be unveiled soon. In the last couple of years, the Fallout TV show, updates to Fallout 4, and the ongoing expansion of Fallout 76 have all combined to push franchise sentiments sky-high.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Last of Us actor recently shared his thoughts on AI, stating that we shouldn’t “demonize” it and that it could help people seek more authentic experiences. </p>



<p>As technology continues to evolve rapidly, the presence of AI is becoming more prominent than ever. It’s impossible to ignore the growing impact of AI across all areas of tech, and we recently saw Sony file a patent for an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-patents-ai-technology-that-can-play-the-game-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI “ghost player”</a> that can basically play a section of the game for you. Now, one of the gaming industry’s prominent members has shared his thoughts on this tech. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-actor-feels-ai-will-make-people-seek-authentic-experiences">The Last of Us Actor Feels AI Will Make People Seek Authentic Experiences </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-troy-baker-could-we" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Business</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/troy-baker-ai-shouldnt-be-demonized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer</a>), The Last of Us actor Troy Baker spoke about AI and its impact on the industry as a whole. Baker first spoke about ” a fundamental premise to making art that people are not remembering right now, and it’s that it requires artists.” People usually look at AI and are amazed by what it can do, but that shouldn’t matter. </p>



<p>Baker adds that people don’t need “don’t need to diminish it, we don’t need to denigrate it, we don’t need to demonize it.” All they need to do is accept its existence while also knowing that their choice as a performer and producer still exists. The Last of Us actor added that AI “there is no doubt that AI can make content way better than humans,” however, the tech “can create content, but it cannot create art” as it “invariably requires the human experience.” </p>



<p>Troy Baker also stated that the growth of AI will drive people to seek more authentic experiences, such as “‘I want to go and watch this person sing this song live.’ ‘I want to see theater’. ‘I want to read books.’ ‘I want to have this first-hand experience as opposed to the gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror”, which is a good thing, “a revolution”. </p>

Additionally, The Last of Us 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-2-update-offers-yet-another-way-to-play-the-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a> offers yet another way to play the story.
