<p>A skin for Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil Requiem Deluxe has been accidentally mentioned on PlayStation Portugal’s store page, seemingly confirming the character’s appearance in the upcoming title. </p>



<p>Leon Kennedy’s appearance in Resident Evil Requiem has been a subject of concern since the very start. One of the leakers in this space has been adamant that Leon is indeed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of three playable characters</a>. Now, the RE Requiem Deluxe Listing has seemingly confirmed that character’s presence in the latest title. </p>



<h2 id="h-leon-dso-agent-skin-coming-to-resident-evil-requiem">Leon DSO Agent Skin Coming to Resident Evil Requiem</h2>



<p>Spotted by DuskGolem on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1983676774207967556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the pre-order page for Resident Evil Requiem Deluxe Edition on PlayStation Portugal gave away the details of a Leon skin. Just like Grace’s Dimitrescu outfit, which was announced as a pre-order bonus today, Leon Kennedy will get a DSO Special Agent outfit. 5 outfits were mentioned, but only two were revealed: one for Grace and the other for Leon. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony just accidentally leaked Leon in Resident Evil Requiem. On the official PlayStation 5 pre-order page for RE9 Deluxe in Poruguese, it accidentally lists a Deluxe Costume for Leon. <a href="https://t.co/xKA1Pj0Tm0">pic.twitter.com/xKA1Pj0Tm0</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1983676774207967556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Other Deluxe edition bonuses for Resident Evil Requiem include two filters, one of which is Apocalypse, four weapon skins, which include S&amp;S M232 Apocalypse Weapon Skin, two charms, including the Mr. Raccoon charm, the Raccoon City Classic audio pack, and files: Letters from 1998. The pre-order bonus also includes the Apocalypse outfit for Grace. </p>



<p>Players should note that even though the skin seemingly confirms Leon Kennedy’s appearance in Resident Evil Requiem, Capcom is yet to confirm the arrival of this character officially. </p>



<p>In other news, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiems-first-trailer-featured-leon-leaker-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaker has claimed</a> that Resident Evil Requiem’s first trailer featured Leon. Additionally, the game’s bosses will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-bosses-will-have-players-using-their-wits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">require players to use their wits</a>. What are your thoughts on Leon receiving a DSO Special Agent skin in Resident Evil Requiem? Does this confirm the arrival of the character?

<p>Microsoft says that Xbox hardware sales have gone down 29%, leading to a roughly $113 million revenue loss year over year. The news comes after, earlier in October, the company increased <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the price of Game Pass</a> to much controversy.</p>



<p>Xbox, despite having some well-received titles recently like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-world-record-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and The Outer Worlds 2, has had a rough time recently. Massive cancellations of Game Pass and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/costco-has-reportedly-decided-to-stop-selling-xbox-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even removal from Costco</a> have not done well for the gaming team at Microsoft. Unfortunately, it seems like it has spread to its sales, as the company reports a 2% loss in total revenue.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-reports-notable-drop-in-sales-for-xbox-compared-to-last-q1">Microsoft Reports Notable Drop in Sales for Xbox Compared to Last Q1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Microsoft </figcaption></figure>



<p>In the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) Q1 report from Microsoft, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company revealed</a> that Xbox did not reach the same heights as it did last Q1 for FY25. Having made $5.621 billion last Q1, the gaming subcompany went down to $5.508 billion, losing around $113 million. This also marks a 2% loss in total revenue, which is not great, but not too bad. The press release does mention the drop, stating,</p>



<p><strong>“Xbox hardware revenue decreased 29% driven by lower volume of consoles sold,”</strong> the company said. <strong>“Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% on a strong prior year comparable with growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content, offset in part by a decline in first-party content.”</strong></p>



<p>It’s important to note that the mentioned 1% increase comes from splitting content and services away from hardware, showing how each specific subsector is performing.</p>



<p>Whether Xbox can regain ground from its loss remains to be seen. It recently announced that Halo: Campaign Evolved is coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>, continuing the company’s third-party movement forward. Xbox is planning a big year in 2026 with releases like Forza Horizon 6, Clockwork Revolution, and Fable. It’ll be interesting to see how it pans out and whether it can save face, regardless of how good its new games could be.</p>



<p>Overall, for Microsoft, the numbers aren’t bad as the company announced its operating income was up 24% to $38 billion while it saw a  12% total net income increase to $27.7 billion.</p>



<p>What do you think about the revenue drop for Xbox? Are you surprised by it? What do you hope Microsoft does to fix it? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League 2026 season is shaping up nicely now that the full schedule and running order have been revealed. Next year, the Call of Duty League will go to <strong>three countries</strong> in an unprecedented global tour that takes the CDL further than ever. It was also revealed that, <strong>thankfully</strong>, Control is being removed from the CDL rotation and will be replaced with an all-new mode.</p>



<p>Control was never awful, but the slow tempo, limited map pool, and tricky mechanics have long stood in the way of the mode being a complete success with fans of the COD League. It became suffocating during the 2025 CDL season when it was confined to just <strong>two maps</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-mode-is-replacing-control-in-the-cdl">What Mode is Replacing Control in the CDL?</h2>



<p>Control is officially being replaced after <strong>many years </strong>by Overload, a brand-new mode released alongside Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. In Overload, players are forced to contend with dynamic objectives, rapid respawn timers, wider map compatibility, and much clearer win conditions, all wrapped up in a mode that’s not too different from Capture the Flag.</p>



<p>The 2025 CDL season wrapped a few months ago, and now that it is dead and gone, so too is Control.</p>



<p>Despite being a staple of the COD League since 2018, the popularity of the mode declined, and quite drastically so in recent years. It was a mode that didn’t accommodate too much strategy, and it was ultimately something too repetitive to be hugely enjoyable</p>



<p>Overload goes the other way entirely, revealing positive results in tests and drawing nice feedback from the fans that’s sure to make it a winning formula when the CDL 2026 season goes live on December 5.</p>



<p>In some social circles, Overload has been dubbed ‘the most CDL-ready mode in years’, given that it perfectly accommodates the competitive flow that users expect from the COD League.</p>



<p>Do you think Overload will be a nice reset to the COD League formula going into the CDL 2026 season? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-league-2026-is-going-to-europe-uk-and-usa-with-all-new-format.1338637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League’s grand reveal has just taken place for the 2026 season, and fans are immensely excited. The new season starts on December 5, and in the months that follow, the CDL 2026 season will greet fans in three countries. Majors are set to take place in the United States, England, and France, all wrapping up with a grand COD Champs event in <strong>Las Vegas</strong>.</p>



<p>Plenty of changes are coming for the new season, including the first 10-team Major, the return of Minor tournaments, and beefed-up Challengers opportunities at <strong>every LAN event in the season</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-cdl-2026-schedule-looks-insane">CDL 2026 Schedule Looks Insane</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/news/2026-season-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty League 2026</a> schedule is already running wild. It confirms my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-league-return-to-europe-and-uk-2026/">earlier exclusive reports</a> that the COD League is coming to the United Kingdom, as well as hosting a Major in Paris, France. It also confirms the placement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-champs-2026-hosted-faze-las-vegas/">COD Champs in Las Vegas</a>, which I exclusively revealed earlier this year.</p>



<p>Here’s the schedule for the 2026 Call of Duty League:</p>



<ul>
<li>Opening Weekend: December 5 – 7</li>



<li>Major I (Dallas, Texas): January 29 – February 1</li>



<li>Major II (DreamHack UK): March 27 – 29</li>



<li>Minor I: April 24 – 26</li>



<li>Major III (DreamHack Atlanta): May TBC</li>



<li>Minor II: June 5 – 7</li>



<li>Major IV (Paris, France): June 25 – 28</li>



<li>COD Championship (Las Vegas, Nevada): July 16 – 19</li>
</ul>



<p>Major III at DreamHack Atlanta will be a Pro-Am event, and the Minor tournaments will feature teams <strong>outside </strong>the core CDL structure, as will Major II in Birmingham, UK.</p>



<p>It has already been too long since the end of the last season, during which OpTic Texas claimed the top spot and won the first back-to-back COD Champs in Call of Duty esports history. The team would then go on to win at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, solidifying a spot in the history books.</p>



<p>The team is set to host Major I in Dallas, Texas, at the end of January – will the winning streak continue on home turf?</p>
