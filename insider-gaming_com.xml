<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is the long-awaited spin-off to the acclaimed 2017 indie Metroidvania, Hollow Knight. Playing as Hornet, you’ll take down many hard bosses and explore the bug-infested land of Pharloom. Its release had been anticipated by many for years since being announced in 2019, before finally launching in September 2025. The game was met with critical praise from fans and outlets, even earning several year-end awards, including Best Action/Adventure Game at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> last week. Now, Team Cherry has revealed what’s next for Hornet with a small but intriguing tease.</p>
