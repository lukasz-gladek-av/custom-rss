            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-gta-6-most-expensive-game-ever/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, rumours have been circulating suggesting that GTA 6’s development cycle has – so far – set Rockstar back between $1 – 2 billion. This would easily make it the most expensive game ever developed, sitting some way ahead of Destiny (2014 – $500m), Cyberpunk 2077 (2020 – $330m), and Modern Warfare 2 (2009 – $310m).</p>



<p>Even Grand Theft Auto V, released in 2013, only cost Rockstar around $250m to develop. But, when that game launched, it raked in more than $1 billion in just three days – so it’s safe to say that the exorbitant development fee was well and truly earned back.</p>



<p>But is GTA 6 set to dwarf all of these previous titles? If the budget <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/gta/news-gta-6-reportedly-going-expensive-video-game-ever-made" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘leaked’ in 2023</a> is accurate, then it will be.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-could-be-the-most-ambitious-game-ever">GTA 6 Could Be The Most Ambitious Game Ever</h2>



<p>Well, it depends on how you define ‘ambitious’. </p>



<p>What about Starfield, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-starfield-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with 1000 fully explorable planets</a>? Or how about Ghost Recon: Wildlands, which was <em>supposed </em>to boast a living, breathing world, with every NPC having a purpose and a life of their own?</p>



<p>If <a href="https://twitter.com/DexertoGaming/status/1655987337669509177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the rumours are true</a>, then GTA 6 will be the most expensive game ever developed. It’s also the most highly-anticipated title in history, and for more than a decade, players have been locked firmly in on GTA 5, desperately awaiting concrete news regarding the development of the next game in the series.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/">a massive leak</a> that saw 100GB of data posted online, Rockstar Games had no choice but to come out and admit that it was working on the next Grand Theft Auto game, but that was it. For a while, anyway. In December 2023, the team released the first trailer for GTA 6, uncovering what could be the best game ever made:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>There has been an exponential increase in the development cost of Grand Theft Auto games since the series began, but if the rumours are to be believed, then GTA 6 has set a new bar for monumentally expensive games:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto (1997) – $1 – 2 million*</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 2 (1999) – $3 – 4 million*</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 3 (2001) – $5 million*</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) – $5 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004) – $10 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) – $100 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V (2013) – $250 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 6 (2025?) – $1 – 2 billion</li>
</ul>



<p>(*Estimated based on research)</p>



<p>If we work with that data, then we can assume that both time-wise and financially, the next GTA title might cost around $3 billion to produce and it’ll take around fifteen years for it to be released. But that’s just me having fun with the numbers – don’t quote that.</p>



<p>At the time of publishing, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/0LCX:LON?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiCmPiIyOz-AhVHdcAKHWBkB_0Q3ecFegQIFxAa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two is worth some $32.5 billion</a>, so around $1.5 billion spread out over the course of a decade to develop GTA 6 doesn’t really seem all that unrealistic – especially when you consider how much this game is going to make when it finally does release.</p>



<p><em>Finally</em>.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has finally been revealed by Rockstar Games, and we have received our first detailed look at the map. In the trailer that was released by Rockstar, we saw a showcase of sorts, with much of the GTA 6 map being shown, revealing swamps, forests, white beaches, islands, and a dense, urban sprawl, dripping with neon. That’s all well and good, but where is GTA 6 set, and is it somewhere we’ve been before?</p>



<p>Let’s learn about the new GTA 6 map.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-gta-6-map-is-massive">The GTA 6 Map Is Massive</h2>



<p>We now know that GTA 6 is set in Leonida, a fictional state that’s reminiscent of Florida. Like GTA 5’s San Andreas, there’s a city at the heart of the map, which back then was Los Santos. This time around, the beating centre of the map is Vice City, which players will remember from 2002’s game of the same name. It’s a modern-day rendition, though – but it retains much of that ‘1980s vibe’. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c12j12N4yVU">the GTA 6 trailer</a>, we got a relatively full look at the new map for the game, which is scheduled to be released in 2025. We saw airboats skimming through dangerous swamps, planes soaring over glistening blue oceans and white, sandy beaches, and thick traffic sitting bumper to bumper amidst skyscrapers and neon-toting nightclubs. </p>



<p>Check out the trailer here:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It certainly looks like a diverse map, and it’s going to be bursting at the seams with opportunities to explore it for hundreds of hours. </p>



<p>If you came here wondering where is GTA 6 set, we hope that answers your question!</p>

<p>Call of Duty has been one of the most popular franchises in gaming for quite some time now. The series has worked hard to release titles every year, making it one of the biggest franchises in the world. </p>

<p>Call of Duty is one of the most exciting esports titles on the market, offering fans a dense schedule packed with entertainment for around eight months of the calendar year. From Warzone to the traditional multiplayer offering of Modern Warfare or Black Ops, there’s a diverse spectrum out there that millions of fans worldwide can appreciate.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m breaking down the highest-earning Call of Duty pro players of all time. There are thousands of competitors out there, but which among them have earned the most money during their careers?</p>



<p>Read on to learn which Call of Duty players have won the most money.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-players-ranked-by-earnings">COD Players Ranked by Earnings</h2>



<p>Most of these players are still actively competing, so expect their earnings to change over time.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-dylan-envoy-hannon-984-000">10. Dylan ‘Envoy’ Hannon – $984,000</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Envoy won COD Champs in 2022 while playing for the LA Thieves, which is where the bulk of his winnings came from.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-seth-scump-abner-992-000">9. Seth ‘Scump’ Abner – $992,000</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Scump is arguably the most iconic (retired) competitor in the Call of Duty esports scene. In 2017, he won the Call of Duty Championship.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-anthony-shotzzy-cuevas-castro-1-03-million">8. Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro – $1.03 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Shotzzy is one of the best and most capable COD players in the world. He’s a two-time world champion <strong>and </strong>a world champion in Halo.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-james-clayster-eubanks-1-15-million">7. James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks – $1.15 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Clayster was, when he retired, the most veteran competitor still playing in the COD League. He’s one of the few three-time Call of Duty world champions.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-kenneth-kenny-williams-1-19-million">6. Kenneth ‘Kenny’ Williams – $1.19 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Kenny is a two-time world champion, having secured the trophy in both 2022 and 2024. </p>



<h3 id="h-5-ian-crimsix-porter-1-32-million">5. Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter – $1.32 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Crimsix is the winningest competitor in COD history, having won more tournaments than anyone other player. Before retiring, he’d claimed three world championship titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-alec-arcitys-sanderson-1-39-million">4. Alec ‘Arcitys’ Sanderson – $1.39 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Arcitys is no longer in the Call of Duty League, but he has claimed two world championships in almost a decade of active competition, along with many chips.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-mcarthur-cellium-jovel-1-53-million">3. McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel – $1.53 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Cellium has represented Atlanta FaZe for years and is often considered one of the best players in COD esports. He secured his first world championship in 2021 and also won the first Esports World Cup in Call of Duty.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-chris-simp-lehr-1-77-million">2. Chris ‘Simp’ Lehr – $1.77 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Simp is a phenomenal player with two world championship wins under his belt at just 23 years of age. He also won the Esports World Cup in Call of Duty in 2024 alongside Cellium and aBeZy.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-tyler-abezy-pharris-1-78-million">1. Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris – $1.78 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris is the highest-earning Call of duty player ever, but it’s close. He has won two world titles and secured the top spot at the Esports World Cup in 2024 in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets is a name that everyone following Counter-Strike esports should be familiar with. This year, the superstar prodigy has marked himself as one of the most talented individuals to watch going forward, and after winning the Perfect World Shanghai Major, he has cemented himself as a record holder.</p>



<p>He’s the youngest Counter-Strike player to win a Major, the youngest to be named HLTV MVP, and he’s tied first for some of the highest ratings in competitive CS history. Coming out of the Team Spirit Academy and moving into the first team, he has racked up more prize money in <strong>one year </strong>than most pro players will make in ten.</p>



<p>Is there anything donk can’t do?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-donk-donk-donk-donk">donk, donk, donk, donk</h2>



<p>With all the makings of a game-wide GOAT, donk has managed to make a solid name for himself in a matter of months. Last year, he made his way into Team Spirit’s starting lineup in CS:GO, and then underwent the transition that everyone else made, moving over to CS2.</p>



<p>Since then, donk has <strong>exploded</strong>.</p>



<p>He just won the Shanghai Major, becoming the youngest CS player in history to net the achievement, and he was named MVP of the event, which is his <strong>fifth </strong>this year at a ‘big’ event. He was previously named MVP at IEM Katowice, a legendary event that kickstarted months of success for donk – and the rest of Team Spirit.</p>



<p>Few players have managed to secure more MVP awards in a single year – the likes of s1mple, ZywOo, and device come to mind.</p>



<p>As the Shanghai Major unfolded, donk racked up <strong>four </strong>aces, one of which was secured in the grand final against FaZe Clan – which was yet another record picked up by the 17-year-old competitor. </p>











<p>That move was preceded in the group stage of the Shanghai Major by a stunning 1v5 against Heroic. Later on in the tournament, Heroic would be sent home by G2 Esports.</p>



<p>All in all, this has been a <strong>stunning </strong>rookie year for donk, who has pieced together almost half a million dollars in earnings thus far. </p>



<p>What’s even more amazing is how humble donk has been through all this. Earlier this year, he <a href="https://blast.tv/article/spirit-donk-blast-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke to BLAST</a> and said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve won some big trophies in my first season. We’ve shown good results but we should also do better and keep our routine to work harder. </p>



<p>I’m not very consistent yet. I need to find my key to playing consistently, and I’m trying to do that right now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked if he sees himself as one of the top three players in the world, he said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I am, no.</p>



<p>It’s m0NESY, ZywOo, and sh1ro.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With donk, the sky is the limit, and there are high expectations that he’ll become one of the greatest esports competitors of all time.</p>



<p>Where do you place donk in your top CS players ranking? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that LEGO Horizon Adventures could soon be coming to Xbox in a bid to make the game a commercial success.</p>



<p>That’s according to Arab media outlet <a href="https://justplayit.info/news/sony-game-coming-to-xbox-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">justplayit</a>, who claim that their sources have said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a> will be coming to Xbox in the coming months.</p>



<p>While the outlet did not give a specific date, they said it’s likely to come in the first months of 2025 “at most” and even went as far as to speculate that it could be sooner.</p>



<p>The move comes as the console exclusivity strategy between platforms has shifted in the past few years. PlayStation has seen tremendous success in bringing some of its titles to PC, whereas Xbox has decided to bring the majority of its exclusives over to PlayStation.</p>



<p>WindowCentral’s Jez Corden even recently said that console exclusive titles on Xbox “is over” in a <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1867407921199362372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent tweet</a>. PlayStation bringing Lego Horizon Adventures to Xbox could mark a change in its console strategy, too, with PlayStation seemingly testing the waters on a multiplatform release (although the game is already on Nintendo Switch and PC).</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony/PlayStation for comments, and if we receive a comment, we will update this article.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/atl-faze-roster-under-fire-cdl-loss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atl-faze-roster-comes-under-fire-following-landmark-cdl-loss.1061925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atl-faze-roster-under-fire-cdl-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For the first time in 587 days, Atlanta FaZe has been dealt a 0 – 3 loss in the qualifying stage of a CDL Major. This loss came at the hands of a dominant Carolina Royal Ravens side, which succeeded in trapping FaZe in the hundred-point club during the opening Hardpoint, and it all went downhill from there.</p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe is now 0 – 3 in the qualifiers and has failed to secure a single CDL Point since the 2025 season kicked off. Typically, Atlanta FaZe is the single-most successful team on the board in the regular season, but right now, they’re on par with the Vegas Falcons.</p>



<p>Is it time for a roster change?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-paradigm-shift">Paradigm Shift</h2>



<p>Since the Call of Duty League became a thing in 2020, Atlanta FaZe has been a stalwart force in the scene. The squad, comprised of Simp, aBeZy, Cellium, and <strong>someone else</strong> (Drazah since last season), has been a team to be reckoned with for the longest time, but this season has started with such a sour mood that questions are now being asked.</p>



<p>In the Cold War season, Atlanta peaked, winning three Major tournaments and the CDL Championship. In the year that followed, the squad didn’t secure a single victory, and when Modern Warfare II arrived, only one Major win was lined up for the team.</p>



<p>This year, FaZe made history by winning the first Esports World Cup in the Call of Duty MP category, but coming in off that win has meant little for the squad, starting this CDL 2025 season with three heavy losses.</p>











<p>In a historic loss, Atlanta FaZe fell to the Royal Ravens. The opening Hardpoint set the tone for the series, with FaZe losing P2 on 42 points and securing just 88 points by the time the match had ended. Between the second rotation from P1 to P4, the team picked up just 24 points, counting themselves lucky to even find the final scraps on the hills.</p>



<p>Do you think a change is needed, or do Atlanta FaZe just need to find their fit in Black Ops 6?</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2024 was raised in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the showcase. It was an ambitious event all around, and many viewers rated it higher than any iteration in history. Collectively, we saw dozens of awards handed out (which not everyone agreed with, admittedly) and many games either revealed or updated with new trailers.</p>



<p>It has been revealed in data collected by Streams Charts that this year’s The Game Awards was the most-watched edition ever, topping more than <strong>four million </strong>concurrent viewers. The growth was aided by co-streamers and watch parties, which are fast becoming some of the most entertaining ways to watch streams online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bigger-than-ever">Bigger Than Ever</h2>



<p>The Game Awards played host to some massive announcements and trailers, such as The Witcher 4, Naughty Dog’s new game, a new Virtua Fighter, and Mafia: The Old Country.</p>



<p>It was potentially the most electric edition of The Game Awards we’ve ever seen, and Geoff Keighley’s team spared no expense in piecing together an all-singing, all-dancing event featuring a star-studded lineup of guests.</p>



<p>In a report published <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/game-awards-2024-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Streams Charts</a>, it was revealed that The Game Awards (across top channels) racked up a combined peak concurrent viewership of 4,003,578 users. It had a total watched hours count of 15,267,555, and 1,498 channels were logged broadcasting the event in some way.</p>



<p>In total, The Game Awards was on air for just south of five hours, and while the top channels for the broadcast were the official ones, the likes of IGN, Asmongold, and Moist Cr1TiKaL pulled in massive audiences while reacting to the showcase.</p>



<p>How did you rate this year’s The Game Awards? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/when-cdl-skins-coming-to-black-ops-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-are-the-cdl-skins-coming-to-black-ops-6.1061787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-cdl-skins-coming-to-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On November 12, Activision revealed the full line-up of CDL skins, but fans worldwide are <strong>still waiting </strong>for them to be delivered in Black Ops 6. While this year’s CDL skins aren’t as gaudy or ‘interesting’ as they have been in recent years, fans are still eager to represent their favourite CDL teams in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>With that being said, when <strong>are </strong>the CDL skins coming to Black Ops 6, and how much will they cost when they arrive?</p>



<p>Read on to find out what we know.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cdl-skins-release-date-in-black-ops-6">CDL Skins Release Date in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed by Activision when the CDL skins will be released in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>If we use last season’s release schedule as a representative example, we can determine that it might still be a couple of weeks until they arrive.</p>



<p>Last season, the action commenced on December 8, 2023, and the MWIII CDL skins were released on January 8, 2024. </p>



<p>The current season started on December 6, so it could be the first week of January that the team skins arrive once again. It was mentioned that it would be ‘later in season one’ that the CDL skins would drop, and that’s more or less where we are now that the ‘Season One Reloaded’ update has arrived.</p>



<p>If you’re holding out to know when the CDL skins are coming to Black Ops 6, take note – it could be another few weeks.</p>



<p>Which skin will you be purchasing once they’ve dropped? There isn’t much variation between the various CDL skins this year, but it’s still nice to see the teams represented, and of course, the organisations benefit from the sale of the skins.</p>



<p>On that note, how much do the CDL skins cost?</p>



<p>Typically, a CDL skin pack – which comes with the base skin, weapon camos, stickers, emblems, and calling cards, retails in the COD store for around $11.99. They can’t be purchased with COD Points – only real-world money.</p>



<p>Let us know which team you’re representing in Black Ops 6 when the CDL skin packs drop.</p>
