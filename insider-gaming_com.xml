<p>Call of duty has released a brand-new trailer for Warzone, showing off the return of the original map ‚ÄòVerdansk‚Äô.</p>



<p>The near three-minute trailer shows off the return of the original map, weapons, vehicles and more in spectacular Call of Duty fashion, with the re-confirmation that the map will return with 150 players.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? ü•π

No escape from the fight now ‚Äî Drop into the map that started it all in Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VerdanskReturns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#VerdanskReturns</a><span> ü™Ç </span></p></article></div>



<p>According to sources, Verdansk comes at a crucial point for Call of Duty Warzone, with Activision hoping that the map will see a resurgence in players similar to how the original Fortnite map worked for Epic Games.</p>



<p>One source said that Verdansk could be ‚Äúdo or die‚Äù for the free-to-play Battle Royale, whereas another said it likely means Warzone support will dwindle down if its play numbers don‚Äôt increase.</p>



<p>Verdansk is set to return to Warzone not as ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù as some might have expected though. This time, the Battle Royale map will return with some movement adjustments, including keeping in omnimovement. The developers did outline that player movement speed has bee reduced though, to try and stay somewhat in line with how the game originally felt. </p>

<p>PlayStation recently revealed that it provided extensive support during development to Game Science, a developer of Black Myth Wukong, among others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/black-myth-wukong-received-tons-of-support-from-sonys-content-ventures-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingBolt</a>, a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/leadership-spotlight-a-conversation-with-phil-rosenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new interview</a> with Phil Rosenberg, SVP of Global Partner Development and Relations at Sony Interactive Entertainment, revealed details about third-party games receiving support from PlayStation. Rosenberg first stated that the Content Ventures team at Sony is excellent at identifying new franchises and bringing them on. They have discovered games like Stray, Genshin Impact, Black Myth Wukong, Stellar Blade, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rosenberg added that there‚Äôs ‚Äúnobody better in the world‚Äù than Christian Svensson and Shawne Benson at finding these hidden gems and ‚Äúnurturing up-and-coming companies‚Äù that are usually very difficult to find. Moreover, the third-party account management team and the partner development team at Sony provide ‚Äútons of support‚Äù to games like Black Myth Wukong, Stray, and more, as they are often the first points of contact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were rumours earlier last year that Black Myth Wukong had not been released on Xbox due to an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusivity deal</a> with Sony. Also, a Microsoft representative later added that the delay was not due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-isnt-delayed-due-to-xbox-platform-limitations-microsoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platform limitations</a>. However, early this year, the CEO and founder of Game Science confirmed that the Xbox port for Black Myth Wukong didn‚Äôt arrive due to<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-xbox-delay-caused-by-series-s-issues-ceo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> optimisation issues on the Series S</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Black Myth Wukong knockoff has appeared on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-knock-off-appears-on-nintendo-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo‚Äôs Store</a>.

<p>In a new press release by Capcom, it has been announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has passed 10 million units sold in its first month of release.</p>



<p>The press release also reconfirmed that the first free title update will be released later this week and that the second update for the game will be released in the summer. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds impressive sales numbers puts it on pace to easier match Monster Hunter World, which went on to sell 22 million units since its release.</p>



<p>But it‚Äôs success wasn‚Äôt without its issues. On release, Monster Hunter Wilds surpassed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.3 million concurrent players</a>, but was criticised for its lack of PC optimisation. </p>



<p>‚ÄúThis game is absolutely amazing ‚Äì but has the worst optimisation I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù said one Steam user.</p>



<p>That being said, Monster Hunter Wilds continues to be a success for Capcom and the games multiple updates since release has addressed a lot of issues pertaining to PC optimisation.</p>



<p>As for where the success will end remains to be seen, but Wilds‚Äô next target will likely to be to try and overtake Monster Hunter Wilds place to become the best-selling Monster Hunter game in the series.</p>



<p>Do you think Monster Hunter Wilds has enough lets to hit 22 million units sold? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>
