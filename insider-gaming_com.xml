<p>It’s Tuesday, and as usual, that means it’s time for another NYT Connections puzzle. Today’s task isn’t an impossible one, but the fastest way possible to solve the NYT Connections challenge for today is to scroll down and use the hints and solutions I’ve assembled for you.</p>



<p>If you’re stuck on today’s NYT Connections answers and need some back-up, I’m here to help you out. Simply scroll down, pick out the hints, and continue that streak.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-11">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 11)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #884:</p>



<ul>
<li>MUSIC NOTES</li>



<li>FOUNDATION</li>



<li>STAND</li>



<li>SCALE</li>



<li>BASE</li>



<li>REST</li>



<li>RANGE</li>



<li>COMPASS</li>



<li>HIGHLIGHTER</li>



<li>ENVELOPE</li>



<li>POWDER</li>



<li>SCOPE</li>



<li>SPEECH BUBBLE</li>



<li>BLUSH</li>



<li>EXTENT</li>



<li>HOLDER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>Get ready for your close-up… these belong in a beauty bag</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>How wide, how far, how much… these words measure scope</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>They hold things up, keep things steady, or give something a place to rest</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>Tap to open… these are visual symbols for apps</em></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 11.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-11-884">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 11 (#884)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BLUSH, FOUNDATION, HIGHLIGHTER, POWDER</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – EXTENT, RANGE, SCALE, SCOPE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BASE, HOLDER, REST, STAND</li>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 Has Sold Over 84 Million Consoles Worldwide]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation has revealed that the PlayStation 5 has sold over 84 million units worldwide since its launch in 2020. Furthermore, the console doesn’t seem to be stopping, selling over 3.9 million in the past three months.</p>



<p>Despite a high price tag, the PlayStation 5 has gone on to be a highly successful console compared to others on the market. With landmark first-party titles like Ghost of Yotei, God of War: Ragnarok, and Astro Bot, there’s a lot to love about Sony’s latest gaming product. Earlier this year, the console was said to have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-has-sold-over-75-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 75 million units</a>, which is a pretty impressive number. Now, it’s gone up almost 10 million, with a good bit of those sales done just recently.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-5-outsells-xbox-360-xbox-one-in-lifetime-sales-new-report-shows">PlayStation 5 Outsells Xbox 360, Xbox One, in Lifetime Sales, New Report Shows</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a financial report from PlayStation</a>, <strong>the PlayStation 5 has sold 84.2 million units worldwide</strong>. Over the past three months, it’s sold 3.9 million, a 0.1% increase from last fiscal year. For comparison, the Xbox 360 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/tech/microsoft-xbox-one-discontinue/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold around 84 million</a> and the Xbox One sold 53 million (<a href="https://gamingbolt.com/xbox-series-x-s-has-sold-21-million-units-xbox-one-at-58-million-as-per-microsoft-brazil-presentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">last reported in 2023</a>) over their lifetimes. It’s a pretty impressive feat, especially since the console is still on the market for $500. Unfortunately, it’s unknown if PlayStation 5 Pro is included or what it has sold.</p>



<p>Other interesting stats from the report include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-final-launch-trailer-playstation-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a>‘s sales, which <strong>total 3.3 million copies</strong> since its launch in October. Furthermore, it seems <strong>a majority of gamers bought digital</strong> in Q2 of 2025, just around 72%. In terms of PlayStation Online, over 119 million monthly users are on. Overall, it seems like Sony is happy with how the PlayStation 5 is shaping out. With many exciting game still to come, like Saros, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>, and Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, it’ll likely be an uphill slide from here. </p>

<p>A new Nintendo Direct focused on The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is coming on November 12th. The presentation will host more information on the film, as well as the first official trailer.</p>



<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie came out in 2022 to massive success. For a time, the lllumination and Nintendo film was the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6718170/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-grossing video game adaptation</a>&nbsp;of all time. A sequel, now titled The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, was quickly greenlit, and a short teaser was released during the last Nintendo Direct. While leaks have been rampant and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of a trailer</a> abundant, it seems Nintendo is ready to show it off, and soon.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Join us on Wednesday, Nov 12, at 6am PT for the Nintendo Direct featuring the world premiere of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie official trailer.

<p>Announced by <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintend</a>o, <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct will livestream at 6 am PT/9 am EST on November 12th, 2025</strong>. It will be available to watch on YouTube, Twitch, and the Nintendo Today! app. The presentation plans to talk about the upcoming film and show off the first official trailer. The tweet does note that no new game information will be revealed at the event, so don’t expect any 3D Mario news. Still, we could get some casting and character reveals for the film, slated to release on April 3rd, 2025.</p>



<p>A bit ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-yoshi-bowser-jr-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a leak</a> regarding who may be in the film came from Pillsbury slice-and-bake cookies. The box showed off Yoshi, who was teased at the end of the first film. His design, more realistic than his game counterpart, looked quite good. On the back, we did see Bowser Jr.’s logo, hinting that the son of Bowser is making his debut in the film. Seeing how popular The Super Mario Bros. Movie was, the new trailer for Galaxy is sure to be a hit for fans and moviegoers alike.</p>
