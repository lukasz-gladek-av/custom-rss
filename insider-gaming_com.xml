<p>As someone still actively playing Gray Zone Warfare as a sherpa for new players, I am excited and eager to try out the upcoming update. I’m certainly not alone. Most players can’t wait to return, but they want quality-of-life tweaks and AI improvements before returning. I can’t blame anyone, especially when helicopter wait times prove formidable. But this new Gray Zone Warfare update should change everything!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-next-gray-zone-warfare-update-release">When Does the Next Gray Zone Warfare Update Release?</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-night-ops-update-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next major update</a>—0.2 Night Ops—is out on <strong>November 27</strong>. We’re many months out since release, with the game launching in Early Access on April 30. Most players finished the entire storyline and all available quests within the first month of the game’s lifespan and have since eagerly awaited more or moved on to a different tactical shooter. A few of us continue playing, repeatedly running the same tasks and points of interest.</p>

<p>This is a major game update, and alongside countless fixes for the AI and additional content, like weapons, tasks, and night operations gear, there’s a wipe. Essentially, this means you’ll lose all your current progress and equipment, resetting to zero alongside everyone else.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-the-next-gray-zone-warfare-update-include">What Does the Next Gray Zone Warfare Update Include?</h2>



<p>The next major update for Gray Zone Warfare, dubbed Night Ops, focuses primarily on resolving many of the community’s notable issues with the gameplay experience, namely helicopter wait times and AI one-shotting everything in sight. However, it’s not without significant content additions. The update expands the core gameplay with a day and night cycle, night vision optics, IR laser sights, canted sights, new weapons, and tasks. Here’s an overview of what’s to come:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Day/Night Cycle</strong>: A 2:1 ratio with three hours of real-time gameplay making up a single day in Lamang.</li>



<li><strong>Exterior and Interior Lighting</strong>: In addition to NVGs, you can activate lamps, light barrels, and candles and illuminate or snuff out the light in your environment to gain an advantage.</li>



<li><strong>New Missions</strong>: This update features 22 tasks across the various vendors, with some designed specifically for nighttime.</li>



<li><strong>AI Improvements</strong>: AI will no longer one-shot players; they now adapt to their surroundings, taking cover and hiding in the tall grass, and will pose unique challenges by patrolling or remaining indoors at night.</li>



<li><strong>New Equipment</strong>: Night vision goggles, flashlights, laser sights, and new weapon customization attachments enter the fray.</li>



<li><strong>New Weapons</strong>: MP5, AKS-74U, and various modern AK variants.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, we’ll see high-value loot, in-game economy alterations, reduced landing zone times, an aim-down-sight toggle option, enhanced progression systems, and more!</p>

<p>2024 has been a genuinely excellent year for video game releases, but most to date have been full price titles that drain your wallet and bank account. I don’t know about you, but even doing this job, I can’t afford every new release. It’s nice to download a new title, play it for tens or hundreds of hours, and not spend a dime. Well, that’s about to become much easier, as three upcoming free-to-play games are coming before the year’s end, and I’m sure they’ll dominate!</p>



<h2 id="h-upcoming-free-to-play-games-coming-before-2024-ends">Upcoming Free-to-Play Games Coming Before 2024 Ends</h2>



<p>Three high-profile free-to-play titles are launching in December, each within a different genre, and they’re all building momentum before release for various reasons. We have <strong>Delta Force</strong>, the upcoming “Battlefield killer,” <strong>Marvel Rivals</strong>, a hero shooter with team-based PvP, and <strong>Path of Exile 2</strong>, the positively monumental ARPG with its iconic passive skill tree and class roster.</p>



<h3 id="h-delta-force">Delta Force</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Delta Force</li>



<li><strong>Developer</strong>: Team Jade</li>



<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: December 4</li>



<li><strong>Price</strong>: Free to Play</li>



<li><strong>Genre</strong>: First-Person Shooter</li>
</ul>



<p>The free-to-play first-person shooter from developer Team Jade, which many consider the ultimate “Battlefield killer” (as if we haven’t had a thousand of those), has enjoyed immense success with its multiple beta test periods over the past few months. We here at Insider Gaming spent a lot of time with the <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-delta-force/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a></strong> and even called it the “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Battlefield game played in years</a>.”</p>



<p>It includes countless weapons and weapon customization opportunities, vehicle combat, multiple game modes, a single-player story-driven experience, an extraction game mode, and large-scale infantry combat encounters with sizeable maps that ensure every round feels unique and thrilling.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Marvel Rivals</li>



<li><strong>Developer</strong>: NetEase Games</li>



<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: December 5</li>



<li><strong>Price</strong>: Free to Play</li>



<li><strong>Genre</strong>: Hero Shooter</li>
</ul>



<p>While I’m personally exhausted by the hero shooter genre after playing a few rounds of Overwatch six years ago, I know it’s still a popular competitive scene with an entire subset of the gaming community champing at the bit for a hit to release. <strong>Marvel Rivals</strong>, from NetEase Games, may be that hit as a free-to-play third-person shooter that combines the classic arena-style combat of titles like Overwatch and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a> with Marvel’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/39-marvel-rivals-characters-found-from-closed-alpha-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roster of heroes and villains</a>.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals features 6v6 arena-based combat with evolving battlefields in which superheroes and supervillains utilize abilities and powers to dominate objectives and the enemy team. You can play as Rocket Raccoon, Hulk, Spider-Man, Thor, and countless others, dealing damage and stomping through the environment in unbeatable action!</p>







<h3 id="h-path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Path of Exile 2</li>



<li><strong>Developer</strong>: Grinding Gear Games</li>



<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: December 6</li>



<li><strong>Price</strong>: Free to Play</li>



<li><strong>Genre</strong>: Action RPG</li>
</ul>



<p>I genuinely cannot get enough of the ARPG genre. I grew up playing the likes of Champions of Norrath and the original Diablo titles alongside my stepfather, and the love for the grind stuck with me decades later. Now, you’ll often find me in either Diablo IV or Path of Exile, and like many of you, I’m eagerly awaiting the latter’s sequel. Well, it’s time. <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-path-of-exile-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a></strong> launches in Early Access on December 6, featuring an expansive campaign, a six-player co-op, an enhanced passive skill tree, and more class and play style variety than ever before.</p>



<p>With six acts, more than 100 boss fights, over 600 unique enemies, 12 base classes, and 36 Ascendancies, Path of Exile 2 promises to be bigger, better, and more time-consuming than ever before. I welcome the challenge!</p>
