            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Game Science’s CEO and founder, Yocar-Feng Ji, recently discussed Black Myth Wukong not winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/black-myth-wukong-game-science-ceo-the-game-awards-criticized-game-of-the-year-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Yocar-Feng Ji took to the Chinese social media platform, <a href="https://weibo.com/6603744955/5111567333196223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a>, to express his dissatisfaction with Black Myth Wukong losing out on GOTY at TGA 2024. Feng Ji first spoke about how the award ceremony came along simultaneously with their ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relatively large update</a>‘ for the title and how this project has spanned 7 years. He then talks about how the game was nominated across four categories and won the Best Action Game and Players’ Voice award, with the latter being more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji reveals that he had “a sense of loss and regret” (as translated by ChatGPT on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1he81dp/game_producer_of_black_myth_wukongs_post_after_tga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/PS5</a>) with Wukong not winning GOTY and states that the games nominated “were all exceptional”. However, he “can’t determine the criteria” for GOTY this year. Feng Ji said that he feels he came all the way to Los Angeles “for nothing”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji added that he was very confident about Black Myth Wukong winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024, so sure that he had written his acceptance speech “two years ago”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Black Myth Wukong has been a massive success for Game Science, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 10 million copies</a> and breaking several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concurrent player records on Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Black Myth Wukong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed China’s gaming industry to new heights in 2024</a>. Also, check out the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boss Rush update</a> for the game.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-event-unlock-kappa-dark-times/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-tarkov-event-rewards-players-with-the-game%E2%80%99s-most-coveted-item.1063113/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games has started a new pre-wipe event in Escape from Tarkov, and it rewards players with one of the most coveted, cherished items in the game’s ecosystem: Kappa.</p>



<p>The Kappa secure container is one of the items that the game’s most die-hard fans aspire to unlock after every wipe (read: game reset). It takes a huge amount of effort to grab one, but after completing this relatively simple quest from Battlestate Games, you can get your hands on one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-temporary-greatness">Temporary Greatness</h2>



<p>The only drawback to this event is that you’ll lose Kappa when the game wipes in the coming weeks – but for those weeks, you’ll feel like a legend. Typically, each new wipe brings around a ‘race to Kappa’, with many streamers participating to see who can unlock the aspirational item the fastest.</p>



<p>It’s a beast of a task that requires collecting several rare items and completing dozens of in-game quests. The average player will never get within sniffing distance of Kappa before the game wipes, which is an event that takes place around once every six months.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-kappa-in-tarkov">How to Unlock Kappa in Tarkov</h3>



<p>To get Kappa, you’ll need to complete the new ‘Dark Times’ quest, given to you by Fence, one of Escape from Tarkov’s traders.</p>



<p>Dark Times requires players to venture into Factory at night and kill 30 targets using nothing but a TOZ-16, one of the game’s most cumbersome and pointless weapons. That being said, if you put the right ammunition into it, there’s no reason why you couldn’t get this task done in just a few raids.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you need to eliminate 30 <strong>targets</strong>, and not just PMCs. That means you can run in, blitz through fields of Scav enemies, and then hey presto, you’ve unlocked Kappa for the remainder of the wipe.</p>



<p>Have fun while the secure container is in your possession – it’ll be gone soon. Perhaps the added stash space will motivate you to chase Kappa next wipe, who knows?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-anti-cheat-not-good-enough/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-devs-admit-black-ops-6-anti-cheat-wasn%E2%80%99t-good-enough.1063107/</guid>

<p>In a blog post on the Call of Duty site, Activision has expressed what’s next for Team RICOCHET, the providers of COD’s anti-cheat mechanics. The post addressed the launch of Black Ops 6 and the subsequent release of Ranked Play, which was marred by an influx of cheaters that made grinding a miserable, impossible experience.</p>



<p>In a line, the team admitted that the anti-cheat systems used in Black Ops 6 simply weren’t good enough.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-missing-the-mark">Missing the Mark</h2>



<p>In the blog post on the COD site, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After a series of updates our systems are in a better place today across all modes; however, <strong>we did not hit the mark</strong> for the integration of RICOCHET Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 01 – particularly for Ranked Play.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On social media, pro players worldwide were lamenting the state of Ranked Play, revealing clips showing them constantly brushing up against cheaters and malicious operators.</p>



<p>Further to the statement above, Activision went on to mention the obvious:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We understand the promise of glory and notoriety from Ranked Play leaderboards makes Ranked Play an attractive target for cheaters. For this reason, our teams have been especially focused on turning the tide to deliver the competitive arena our players seek.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, several key changes are now being implemented. In addition to the 19,000 accounts already banned, the team is promising ‘increased velocity’ on suspensions, to kick cheaters from the game much faster. Team RICOCHET has also started to provide ‘further training’ for AI-based detection systems.</p>



<p>RICOCHET’s kernel-level driver and server-side protections are set to receive some serious upgrades that’ll be deployed alongside Season 02 and Season 03 in Black Ops 6 and Warzone. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/12/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-update-december#:~:text=After%20a%20series%20of%20updates,01%20%E2%80%93%20particularly%20for%20Ranked%20Play." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post was closed</a> out with a request to keep reporting cheaters whenever you see them because, after all, there’s only so much these automated systems can do.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-dev-social-media-pegi-rating/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-dev-takes-to-social-media-to-reflect-on-18-pegi-rating.1063104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-dev-social-media-pegi-rating/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro secured the award for the Best Indie Game of 2024 at The Game Awards, a success that came just after the game shipped more than 3.5 million units. It has been a great year for Balatro, which was pieced together by a solo developer by the name of ‘LocalThunk’.</p>



<p>Recently, LocalThunk took to social media to rue the PEGI ratings change that was applied mere weeks after the game hit the market in February 2024. On Twitter, he compared Balatro to games like EA Sports FC, suggesting that he could drop his 18+ rated game to a 3+ rating if he added loot boxes and microtransactions to his game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-red-logo-looks-kinda-dope">‘The Red Logo Looks Kinda Dope’</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that LocalThunk doesn’t disagree with the 18+ PEGI rating that was given to his game in March 2024. He’s more ‘irked’ by the games that are given a lower rating despite having similar – or ‘worse’ – mechanics.</p>



<p>He uses EA Sports FC as an example, pointing out that they feature real gambling in the form of loot boxes and other, similar microtransactions. For the longest time, courts worldwide have debated the existence and purpose of loot boxes, and some territories have banned them entirely.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Since PEGI gave us an 18+ rating for having evil playing cards maybe I should add microtransactions/loot boxes/real gambling to lower that rating to 3+ like EA sports FC</span></p></article></div>







<p>After posting this message on Twitter (now ‘X’), LocalThunk wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just to clear it up – I’m way more irked at the 3+ for these games with actual gambling mechanics for children than I am about Balatro having an 18+ rating</p>



<p>If these other games were rated properly I’d happily accept the weirdo 18+. </p>



<p>The red logo looks kinda dope</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=balatro&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-HRGPPBlRm8v8y6E9psaIxVdwU7I9vn_KrpZcbPWoxww&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the PEGI platform</a>, the strong rating is justified by saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game teaches – by way of images, information and gameplay – skills and knowledge that are used in poker. During gameplay, the player is rewarded with ‘chips’ for playing certain hands. </p>



<p>The player is able to access a list of poker hand names. As the player hovers over these poker hands, the game explains what types of cards the player would need in order to play certain hands. As the game goes on, the player becomes increasingly familiar with which hands would earn more points. </p>



<p>Because these are hands that exist in the real world, this knowledge and skill could be transferred to a real-life game of poker.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Balatro is one of 2024’s strongest games, and it has pulled in remarkable reviews throughout the year.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s an inherent issue with games like EA Sports FC receiving such low ratings despite featuring loot box-like mechanics? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 reached its highest ever concurrent player peak this past Sunday, confirming to all that the iconic first-person shooter from Valve is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very much not dead</a>. This peak came less than 24 hours after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the trophy was lifted at the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a>.</p>



<p>While this latest peak isn’t the highest in the history of Counter-Strike itself, it’s an incredible accomplishment for CS2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-upward-trajectory">Upward trajectory</h2>



<p>The Counter-Strike 2 player peak reached 1,740,261 concurrent players this past Sunday, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/#48h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>. This is the highest number of concurrent players on CS2 ever, roughly 180,000 more than the peak that was set when the sequel officially launched in September 2023. With the exception of June and July, the concurrent player peak has gone up every single month of 2024. Both monthly concurrent player peaks and player averages are up now compared to where they were when the year began.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new CS2 player peak did fall a few hundred thousand players short of the all-time peak set in May 2023. The all-time CS2 player peak of 1,818,773 concurrent players was brought on by both the release of the BLAST Paris Major viewer pass and the ongoing CS2 limited test. CS:GO player numbers jumped following the CS2 limited test announcement as players tried to increase their hours in hopes of getting access.</p>



<p>The Major typically brings in more players throughout its duration, as players make Pick ‘Ems selections, redeem souvenir packages, and open sticker capsules. Following Team Spirit’s victory, the players’ championship autographs will become available for purchase soon.</p>



<p>Despite widespread player concerns about the amount of content and the state of anti-cheat, among other issues, CS2 is showing no signs of slowing down or a diminished player count. It still remains the most actively played game on all of Valve by a considerable margin, and that likely isn’t changing anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Ubisoft Wants to Change the ‘Far Cry Formula’ with Far Cry 7 and Maverick]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft-wants-to-change-the-%E2%80%98far-cry-formula%E2%80%99-with-far-cry-7-and-maverick.1062879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2023, Insider Gaming had several reports on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry series throughout the year.</a> Notably, the Far Cry series currently has two games in development, which were both originally under the same game and codenamed Talisker. Its next mainline title is now under the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">codename Blackbird</a>, and an extraction-based shooter is under the codename Maverick. Both games are still in development at the time of writing, but their release dates have been pushed back internally from 2025 to 2026 due to complexities in development.</p>



<p>Moving from Dunia to Snowdrop and under development at Ubisoft Montreal, both games are set to move away from the ‘Far Cry formula’. Maverick, which takes place in the Alaskan wilderness, will see players fight one another, animals, and the harsh weather to survive. On the flip side, Blackbird will now see the player have to rescue his family (NOT played by Cillian Murphy), who have been kidnapped by a conspiracy cult who have been performing hallucinogenic experiments on animals and children. It’s said that the player has 24 real-life hours (72 hours in-game) to rescue their family, and the timer is reflected in-game by the player wearing a watch on his wrist.</p>



<p>But it isn’t just the gameplay loop of both games changing. It’s understood that both games have had a significant overhaul to their movement systems, too, including the addition of tactical spriting, sliding, vaulting, and more. Seemingly, this is due to both projects originating from the same game and sharing similar movement mechanics, with the similarities of both games bleeding into one another. Other aspects, including the inventory system and looting, also appear to bleed from the extraction-based shooter into Blackbird, too, with sources outlining that it doesn’t affect the mainline entry. “I’d argue it makes a lot of sense given your desperation to rescue your family,” said one source when asked.</p>



<p>Internally, Ubisoft Montreal and its supporting studios on Blackbird are optimistic, but some concerns over Maverick and its future loom given recent events at the publisher. Ubisoft has been attempting to do a Far Cry multiplayer for the best part of a decade, and while an extraction shooter could make a lot of sense for the Far Cry universe, it was ultimately greenlit to chase trends, and the genre doesn’t seem to have attracted the player’s numbers that the industry thought it would. </p>



<p>Defiant’s recent cancellation and subsequent layoffs felt like the beginning of a downward spiral, said some staff, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=yves" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yves’ internal memo</a> following the announcement of its cancellation not inspiring much confidence in those already unsure about their project’s future.</p>



<p>For now, though, Ubisoft is seemingly trying to break its own trend of chasing trends, and Far Cry 7 (or whatever it’s called) and Maverick seems to be a step in the right direction, albeit a considerable risk. </p>

<p>Throughout the entirety of 2024, it was a three-horse race to see who would be the best of the best Counter-Strike 2 players in the world. Three superstars, two of which are still in their teens, put up dominant performances during the most prestigious CS2 events all year.</p>



<p>By the end of the Perfect World Shanghai Major, and thus the 2024 CS2 calendar, one name stood the tallest amongst the best CS2 players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-of-2024">Best CS2 Players of 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-danil-donk-kryshkovets">Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</h3>



<p>Thanks to a historic performance at the Shanghai Major <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/">culminating in his first Major trophy</a>, Team Spirit’s 17-year-old donk is the unquestionable best CS2 player of 2024. In Shanghai, donk <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/">posted the highest ever player rating at a Major ever</a> while becoming the youngest MVP ever. Donk’s mastery of crosshair placement, crouching, and the “donk slide” combined with his utmost confidence has been nearly unbeatable all year. And he’s just getting started.</p>

<p>Another special young talent that dominated 2024 is G2’s star AWPer Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov. After a breakout 2023, m0NESY showed no signs of slowing down, and is still the most lethal player in the world with the AWP in his hands. He has amazing aim and reaction speeds, but also the game sense of a veteran. Even though the AWP is the most dangerous tool in his arsenal, he can also produce highlights or clutches with a rifle if pressed to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ZywOo feels like the elder statesman when comparing him to actual teenagers like donk and m0NESY. But the prodigy and multi-time HLTV Player of the Year winner is still one of the best Counter-Strike players of the year. He put up nearly identical numbers as his younger adversaries <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/players?startDate=2024-01-01&amp;endDate=2024-12-31&amp;matchType=BigEvents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at big events</a> all year, and has grown more dangerous with the rifles after dominating with the AWP earlier in his career. He always delivers in big moments for Team Vitality, and the guy who’s been dominating Counter-Strike for half a decade is still only 24 years old.</p>



<p>Which of these three deserves to be called the very best CS2 player of 2024? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
