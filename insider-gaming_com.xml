<h2 id="h-will-vitality-dominate-the-final-run-of-2025">Will Vitality Dominate The Final Run of 2025?</h2>



<p>Team Vitality has been the most consistent force in Counter-Strike 2 throughout much of 2025. They have stormed through the major with clinical precision, defeating Team Spirit with a sweep in the semifinals and refusing to drop a map thus far.</p>



<p>ZywOo has led the roster to greater heights than this in 2025, and this is just another potential trophy for the jam-packed cabinet.</p>



<p>On the other side of the fence, you’ve got FaZe Clan, a team that has pushed for a miraculous run throughout this event. FaZe Clan also dropped from the running in the tournament’s opening stage, but stellar performances from the likes of broky, Twistzz, and, of course, karrigan, have kept them afloat.</p>



<p>However, we need to be critical ahead of the betting predictions for the StarLadder Budapest Major.</p>



<p>Team Vitality is easily the safe bet for the outright market. They’ve proven that already time and again this year, and if you want an easy (but small) return, you’ll float this wager.</p>



<p>For bigger potential returns and the love of the game, you might back FaZe Clan, as the final best-of-five could be anyone’s series in truth. That’s the beauty of Counter-Strike esports, and stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>If you want to have a flutter on MVP markets, consider backing ZywOo to take the accolade away.</p>

<p>FaZe Clan has eliminated Natus Vincere to reach the grand final of the StarLadder Budapest Major. The team, which had a rocky road to get where it is, will now face Team Vitality with the hopes of securing a massive $500,000 grand prize. The team, led by the iconic karrigan, almost dropped in the first stage of the tournament, but the resilience from the squad has proven insane.</p>



<p>The semifinal clash against Natus Vincere could have gone either way, and it went to the wire, with FaZe Clan securing a 2-1 victory over the Ukrainian side.</p>

<h2 id="h-faze-clan-makes-the-grand-final">FaZe Clan Makes The Grand Final</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan will now need to contend with Team Vitality at the final post. This is a team that has dominated much of 2025 with near-flawless consistency. Recently, Team Vitality won awards based on its consistency this year, marking it as the greatest esports organization of 2025.</p>



<p>During the recent semifinal round, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-vitality-defeats-spirit-to-secure-grand-final/">Team Vitality swept past Team Spirit</a> with ease, setting up an intense best-of-five showdown for hte grand final.</p>



<p>For FaZe Clan, the spot in the final round is a testament to holding firm against all odds. Earlier in the tournament, the team sat on the brink of elimination, and now they’re one series away from securing a huge prize in front of hundreds of thousands of viewers.</p>

<p>Team Vitality has secured a prestigious place in the grand final of the Budapest Major after a thrilling semifinal victory over Team Spirit, one of the favorites to go all the way.

<p>Now, Team Vitality will wait patiently in the grand final slot, and Natus Vincere and FaZe Clan will duke it out for a shot at the grand final and the $500,000 prize.</p>

<h2 id="h-team-vitality-navi-and-faze-remain-in-budapest">Team Vitality, NAVI, and FaZe Remain in Budapest</h2>



<p>Team Spirit had one heck of a run thus far, with donk going so far as to set a new record, but it wasn’t enough to beat Vitality to the punch in Budapest. The first map of the series, Mirage, proved to be a tenuous enough battle, going long into overtime, but the second map, Dust II, was much easier for Vitality to handle.</p>



<p>Vitality has had a remarkable run in Budapest. The team failed to secure a perfect record in the tournament’s third stage ahead of the playoffs, but the squad has made up for that in the bracket by refusing to drop a single map.</p>



<p>The streak has been enough for ZywOo to rack up a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zywoo-secures-record-for-best-map-performance-starladder/">new single-map Major record</a>.</p>



<p>In our recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/budapest-semi-finals-predictions-and-betting-tips/">predictions piece for the semi-finals</a>, we accurately predicted that Team Vitality would make it through to the grand final, and we also suggested that Natus Vincere would rise to meet them. The accuracy of that prediction will be revealed very soon.</p>
