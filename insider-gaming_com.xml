<p>PIONER is an ambitious, post-apocalyptic MMO FPS that fuses PvE and PvP mechanics, crafting, and customization to bring players a memorable experience that’s just a <strong>bit </strong>reminiscent of other games. It has been compared to a combination of Escape from Tarkov and Fallout in the past, and it’s easy to see why.</p>



<p>In PIONER, players contend with a grim, desolate world teeming with threats, all while exploring an immersive story that promises to offer stacks of opportunities to dig into the game’s ecosystem. The developer, GFA Games, has just announced that PIONER’s open beta is available now, exclusively on Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-pioner-s-open-beta-is-live-now">PIONER’s Open Beta is Live Now</h2>



<p>If you want to sample all the dark, destructive things that PIONER has to offer, you’ll want to jump in now and explore the open beta, available on Steam until November 11.</p>



<p>In a press release, the team at GFA Games said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players can now explore the dangerous and mysterious Tartarus Island and experience the game for free ahead of its full release, planned for late 2025. This is the next step in the ongoing development of this highly anticipated title, following a series of successful closed beta tests to which selected players have been invited over the past few weeks.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GFA Games is a Serbian studio made up of developers who formerly worked on games like STALKER and Atomic Heart.</p>



<p>PIONER’s open beta will offer around 30 hours of content, including the first five acts of the story campaign, which will give players the lay of the land when it comes to factions, points of interest, and more. There’s a hefty PvE raid available, as well as a PvP deathmatch portion for the players who want an added challenge.</p>



<p>Players can explore three huge missions, taking on a world boss and getting a taste of the full scope of PIONER.</p>



<p>PIONER is set to be released later this year, but doesn’t have a confirmed date at present. It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">coming to Steam</a> first, but GFA Games has promised that console versions are coming later.</p>

<p>While Fortnite players are currently enjoying the slew of The Simpsons-related content in the game, further big changes are on the horizon with the release date of Chapter 7 rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s mini-season themed around The Simpsons will only be here for a few weeks before the setting of Springfield is left behind and a new adventure begins with Chapter 7, which will mark the start of the next year of content for Fortnite.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering just how long there is to enjoy The Simpsons content and want to know the release date for Chapter 7, we’ve got all the crucial details.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-fortnite-chapter-7-release">When Does Fortnite Chapter 7 Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big things are coming. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Chapter 7 in Fortnite is set to kick off on November 29, following the end of The Simpsons-themed mini-season that brings a conclusion to Chapter 6.</strong></p>



<p>The end date of the current season, and the subsequent start of the next Fortnite chapter, was revealed in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> for The Simpsons mini-season, and we already know there will be the customary end-of-chapter event that marks the start of the new chapter.</p>



<p>Specific timing for the event and launch of Chapter 7 have not been revealed yet, however, and there will be downtime ahead of the start of the new chapter. Given how large of an update this will be, and the vast changes that will take place, the downtime could be longer than the standard end-of-season downtime.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-fortnite-chapter-7">What’s Coming in Fortnite Chapter 7?</h2>



<p><strong>Chapter 7 in Fortnite will see vast changes to the game, with a new map in Battle Royale, a host of new weapons, and tweaks to core gameplay.</strong></p>



<p>In previous years, new chapters have resulted in huge introductions like Fortnite Festival and LEGO Fortnite, alongside marking the start of major new collaborations. While specifics are lacking at this stage, it certainly promises to be an exciting time for Fortnite players.</p>



<p>Leaks have already started ahead of Chapter 7, with it stated that both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> will feature in upcoming collabs, while a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood setting is also rumored</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll also see the start of Winterfest 2025 during the first season of Chapter 7, likely during early December, which will likely offer the usual slew of free cosmetics.</p>

<p>Retroid has confirmed that there is no official licensing deal for Soulja Boy’s new handheld retro console, SouljaGameFlip. </p>



<p>The retro handheld console market has experienced significant growth in the past few years, with several new major players entering the scene in recent years. Retroid is a popular name in the retro handheld market, and it appears that some of their consoles are being sold by Soulja Boy as his own device, without an official deal in place. </p>



<h2 id="h-soulja-boy-is-selling-rebranded-retroid-consoles-at-more-than-double-the-price">Soulja Boy is Selling Rebranded Retroid Consoles At More than Double the Price </h2>



<p>Soulja Boy started marketing the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 as the SouljaGameFlip on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQlFjCpgLDq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">souljaboygame Instagram account</a>. One of their recent post has the hip-hop artist showcasing the console in his hand while talking about all the games and apps it features, including “Sonic, TikTok, Instagram and everything ya need.” </p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Retro Dodo</a>, Retroid was not aware that Soulja Boy was selling their retro consoles as his own. The official statement from a representative states, “I didn’t know about this. This is not any kind of official licensing deal. He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S by ourselves”. </p>



<p>If you visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.souljaboy.net/product-page/souljagame-flip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>&nbsp;where the SouljaGameFlip is being sold, it becomes blatantly obvious that the device is just a rebranded Retroid Pocket Flip 2; even the images for the console are the same ones used on Retroid’s website. Furthermore, the rapper has more than doubled the price of the original console, with the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 priced at $209 and the SouljaGameFlip costing $436.50. </p>
