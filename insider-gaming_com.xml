            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Once upon a time, Halo was set to secure an MMO dubbed ‘Titan’, pieced together by Ensemble Studios, a company shut down in January 2009. In a scalding post on social media, Sandy Petersen, who had been with Ensemble since the 1990s, revealed that Don Mattrick, former overseer of the Xbox brand, killed the project to protect his corporate bonus.</p>



<p>This pulling back of the curtain is a fiery look back at the scrapping of a game that, on paper, sounded very interesting.</p>



<h2 id="h-titan-was-a-prequel-mmo-in-the-halo-universe">Titan Was a Prequel MMO in the Halo Universe</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/SandyofCthulhu/status/1982965186781954468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a>, Sandy Petersen, who was once a level designer working on Doom and Quake before joining Ensemble Studios, revealed why Halo’s ‘Titan’ MMO never saw the light of day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In 2008, Ensemble Studios started planning a gigantic MMO set in the Halo universe. We code-named it Titan. It was to take place tens of thousands of years ago, before the Halos were set off &amp; destroyed all sentient life in the Galaxy.</p>



<p>It was all brought to naught when Don Mattrick realized that his stock bonus was based on the income MS had from games in 3 years.</p>



<p>You see, we estimated 3.5 years to finish Titan if we did it right. And that’s beyond Mattrick’s drop dead date. </p>



<p>So by firing ALL of Ensemble, he didn’t have to pay for our expensive studio for 3 years and he didn’t care about Titan.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Petersen revealed that the would-be Halo MMO would have featured an expansive universe that allowed players to assume control of Forerunners or Covenant characters. The Flood also had a starring spot in the game, but wouldn’t have been playable, of course.</p>



<p>The quest lines were mapped out, the homeworlds were designed, and Microsoft estimated that the game would have made a whopping <strong>$1.1 billion</strong>.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>In 2008, Ensemble Studios started planning a gigantic MMO set in the Halo universe. We code-named it Titan. It was to take place tens of thousands of years ago, before the Halos were set off &amp; destroyed all sentient life in the Galaxy. </p><p>I was in charge of the universe-building -… <a href="https://t.co/8eaSbEt81X">pic.twitter.com/8eaSbEt81X</a></p></div>— Sandy Petersen 🪔 (@SandyofCthulhu) <a href="https://twitter.com/SandyofCthulhu/status/1982965186781954468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Petersen went on to further slam Mattrick, settling on it being part of the executive’s nature in the industry:P</p>



<blockquote>
<p>All he lost was a game studio who never sold less than 3 million copies of everything we made. I don’t believe he did justice to MicroSoft stockholders but hey – Don started as an EA hatchet man so what would you expect?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Petersen and the wider Ensemble Studios team were tasked with bringing to life this ancient Halo setting, and the game was seemingly deep in development when the plug was pulled, and the hand on the cable was Don Mattrick’s. It was once suggested that Titan would have taken unique concepts, such as time travel, and taken a deep dive into the lore of Halo.</p>



<p>Don Mattrick served as the President of Microsoft’s Interactive Entertainment arm, overseeing the strategy of Xbox until he departed from the firm in 2013 to instead serve as the CEO of Zynga.</p>



<p>Halo’s Titan isn’t to be confused with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-blizzards-cancelled-mmo-titan/">Blizzard’s Titan MMO</a>, another canceled game that came to a head after an $80 million investment.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kt-rolster-shatter-expectations-to-reach-worlds-2025-finals-for-the-first-time.1341508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>KT Rolster has pulled something monumental out of the bag, handing Gen.G an insane loss at the League of Legends World Championship in Shanghai. This is the first time that KT Rolster has reached such lofty heights, and it came after knocking out one of the favorites to win the entire event.</p>



<p>The devastating loss kicks Gen.G out of the tournament in fourth place, mere weeks after winning the 2025 Mid-Season Invitational, the Esports World Cup, <strong>and </strong>the LCK 2025 season.</p>



<h2 id="h-gen-g-fails-to-make-finals-yet-again">Gen.G Fails to Make Finals Yet Again</h2>



<p>Gen.G has now failed to make the finals at LoL Worlds <strong>eight years in a row</strong>. In 2021, the organization secured a third-place finish, which is the closest the team has been thus far to making the number one spot.</p>



<p>KT Rolster proved to be the obstacle too strong to overcome for Gen.G this time around. The South Korean squad put up one hell of a fight, going the distance in a best-of-five series mere days after devastating CTBC Flying Oyster in a 3 – 0 sweep.</p>



<p>The team now has a spot in the Grand Final, poised to fight either T1 or Top Esports. It’ll be one for the history books, especially with T1 sitting on a burner with the squad’s typical Worlds buff.</p>



<p>In KT Rolster’s history in the League of Legends space, the organization has won almost <strong>nothing </strong>to write home about, and in the last three Worlds tournaments the brand has attended, lacklustre finishes have left fans wanting more. Even if KT Rolster doesn’t win at the November 9 final, it’ll be the biggest single prize the organization has ever claimed – $800,000.</p>



<p>Do you have any high expectations for KT Rolster, and do you believe the team could beat a dominant T1? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gamerlegion-ceo-disputes-100-thieves-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamerlegion-ceo-disputes-claims-of-100-thieves-player-buyout-but-confirms-return.1341505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, rumors surfaced in the Counter-Strike space that 100 Thieves is preparing for a mighty comeback to the scene, signing Håvard ‘rain’ Nygaard to lead a new roster backed by GamerLegion talent. In an <strong>even more recent post</strong>, the CEO of GamerLegion confirmed that <strong>no such sales </strong>are lined up.</p>



<p>However, the CEO, Nicolas Reber, <span><strong>confirmed&nbsp;</strong>that the organization met</span> with 100 Thieves to discuss ‘their intention to come back to CS’. This effectively bolsters the recent suggestions that the LA-based company is breaking back into Counter-Strike.</p>



<h2 id="h-gamerlegion-isn-t-selling-players-to-100-thieves">GamerLegion Isn’t Selling Players to 100 Thieves</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/GL_L3gi/status/1984552479753978259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a>, Nicolas Reber, CEO of GamerLegion, confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Guess its worth to share. </p>



<p>We had a chat with 100T few weeks ago about their intention to come back to CS, but there is no active discussion about selling any players or cores. We focus on the team we have right now. </p>



<p>Lets get that 3rd place at @pglesports!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/100-thieves-returning-counter-strike-rain-signing/">signing of rain</a> hasn’t been announced yet either, so there’s still time for that claim to be refuted.</p>



<p>100 Thieves was last seen in Counter-Strike more than five years ago. It’s a new world these days, but with 100 Thieves preparing to pull out of League of Legends after Worlds, there’s room for a new roster to rise. The iconic organization fields a current roster in painfully few games, and Counter-Strike is an easy one to step into.</p>



<p>Some have questioned 100 Thieves potentially signing GamerLegion talent, given that there are ‘much better organizations’ to pick from and GamerLegion has had more than a year of bad luck, failing to secure a single major victory for a long while.</p>



<p>What do you think about the potential return of 100 Thieves to Counter-Strike? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PGL is yet again doubling down on an ongoing commitment to Counter-Strike 2 after unveiling a huge competitive calendar for 2028. Between 2027 and 2028, a whopping <strong>15 Tier 1 tournaments </strong>will play out, including a full slate of <strong>eight events </strong>for 2028 alone. It’s easily one of the most ambitious schedules in Counter-Strike’s esports history.</p>



<p>PGL’s 2027 calendar is looking similarly hefty, with six tournaments being lined up to span January through October.</p>



<h2 id="h-pgl-is-supercharging-counter-strike-2-s-calendar">PGL is Supercharging Counter-Strike 2’s Calendar</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.pglesports.com/news/1760364087969-pgl-confirms-at-least-15-counter-strike-2-tier-1-events-planned-for-2027-and-2028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, the PGL team revealed that 2027 will see <strong>six </strong>independently produced tournaments and one massive collaboration: the Perfect World Counter-Strike Asia Championships.</p>



<p>Here’s the schedule revealed thus far for 2027:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>February 11–22</strong></li>



<li><strong>March 17–29</strong></li>



<li><strong>April 14–26</strong></li>



<li><strong>August 17–29</strong></li>



<li><strong>September 1–13</strong></li>



<li><strong>October 6–18</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Looking even further ahead into 2028, a staggering schedule has been lined up for Counter-Strike fans around the world. Here’s the full list of PGL tournaments planned for 2028:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>February 9–21</strong></li>



<li><strong>March 22–April 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>April 19–May 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>August 16–28</strong></li>



<li><strong>August 31–September 11</strong></li>



<li><strong>October 4–16</strong></li>



<li><strong>November 1–13</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>This is shaping up to be unprecedented in the Counter-Strike 2 space, and it reflects the ongoing value of the game and the ecosystem surrounding it.</p>



<p>The most recent PGL event, PGL Masters Bucharest, wrapped up just yesterday, with Aurora securing the trophy and picking up the lion’s share of the $625,000 grand prize. The win marked Aurora’s most sizeable victory to date in the Counter-Strike space and came mere months after falling in second place at the Esports World Cup.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-2-875/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-875-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-sunday-november-2.1341481/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a sleepy Sunday, but while you’re finding time to relax, you’ll also need to find an opportunity to complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Fortunately, I’m here to help you on your way with the latest NYT Connections hints and solutions, to give you the best chance possible of dominating today’s challenge.</p>



<p>Read on to get the best NYT Connections hints, and scroll to the bottom of the page if you want to jump to today’s answers.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-2">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 2)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #875:</p>



<ul>
<li>GEM</li>



<li>LOAD</li>



<li>FAWN</li>



<li>SWEAT</li>



<li>CARGO</li>



<li>TAN</li>



<li>SAG</li>



<li>CRAMP</li>



<li>HAUL</li>



<li>AQUA</li>



<li>REDDEN</li>



<li>CAMEL</li>



<li>FREIGHT</li>



<li>PANT</li>



<li>KHAAKI</li>



<li>CAPRI</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of items or terms associated with moving goods or heavy items. These are all about what gets carried or shipped.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each word here is a color that falls within the brown or beige spectrum—often used in fashion or design.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These words describe what happens to your body when you’re working hard, exercising, or overheating.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are all names or abbreviations of astrological signs. Some are less obvious, so think symbolically.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 2.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-2-875">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 2 (#875)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CARGO, FREIGHT, HAUL, LOAD</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CAMEL, FAWN, KHAKI, TAN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CRAMP, PANT, REDDEN, SWEAT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – AQUA, CAPRI, GEM, SAG</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<h2>How To Play Wordle</h2>



<p>Wordle is a simple but addictive word puzzle. Each day, players have to <strong>guess a five-letter word answer</strong> in no more than six attempts. After each guess:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>



<p>Wordle can only be played on the New York Times website. There is currently no app for you to download the official game.</p>

<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA DICE has added a new ‘Casual Breakthrough’ mode to Battlefield 6 with a new update, accessible via the core multiplayer menu. This new mode is designed to be a more comfortable entry point for new players, allowing them to rank up while fighting mostly <strong>bot </strong>enemies.</p>



<p>It was stated by EA that teams will consist of eight real players apiece and 16 bot characters per team.</p>



<h2 id="h-bots-are-making-life-easier">Bots Are Making Life Easier</h2>



<p>Die-hard Battlefield fans have argued that this kind of mode shouldn’t exist outside of Portal, but here it is. Electronic Arts has added Casual Breakthrough to Battlefield 6, introducing a bot-filled mode that allows users to earn career, weapon, and battle pass XP, all while completing challenges and grinding unlocks.</p>



<p>The key thing to note is that any actions against <strong>bot characters </strong>will reward reduced XP, while taking on human enemies yields the full rewards.</p>



<p>Initially, only Siege of Cairo and Empire State have been added to the map rotation, but it was stressed that EA DICE will be monitoring feedback to ‘determine if further adjustments are needed in the future.’</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Introducing: Casual Breakthrough</p><p>We understand that sometimes you want to jump into Battlefield but without the intensity of a full PvP lobby. To create a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges, we’re introducing Casual Breakthrough…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984667774430691819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The only things that don’t align with the core multiplayer experience are career stat updates, dogtag grabs, and accolades.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to share mixed feedback in the comments section under the post, with many defending the addition. The vibe is, ‘if you don’t like it, don’t play it,’ which makes sense.</p>



<p>One concern is that some players will find an inevitable way to turn Casual Breakthrough into an XP farm mode, but let’s hope that Electronic Arts has its eyes fixed firmly on the data to avoid that happening.</p>



<p>Will you give Casual Breakthrough a try, or are you comfortable enough with the standard mode? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
