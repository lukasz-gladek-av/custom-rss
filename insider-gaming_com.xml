<p>Saber CCO’s recent statement hints that Star Wars KOTOR Remake is still in development.</p>



<p>Tim Willits, Saber Interactive’s Chief Creative Officer, recently shared some information on the games they are working on. Willits stated on <a href="https://x.com/TimWillits/status/1900374508113961250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> that the studio is currently working on several games across different genres; however, all the games Saber has spoken about are “still in development.” This statement has led many to speculate that the KOTOR remake is still in development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details about the KOTOR remake have been scarce since the game was confirmed in 2021. Since then, Embracer Group has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kotor-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken about</a> all the games in development “as of May 24, 2023.” The list included the likes of Tomb Raider (final title TBC), Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine II, Remnant 2, Ride 5, and Star Wars: KOTOR remake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have not received concrete details about the Star Wars: KOTOR remake or an official confirmation from developers. The original KOTOR was released in 2003, and players had to become the last hope of the Jedi Order and master the power of the Force to save the Republic. The game has a unique Star Wars RPG experience with unique characters, creatures, vehicles, and planets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KOTOR encourages players to learn to use the Force and wield 40 different powers while building their lightsaber. Players get to explore some of the most popular regions in the franchise, including Tatooine and the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk. Several customisable characters can be added to your party, and there are eight enormous worlds in the player’s starship, Ebon Hawk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Star Wars Eclipse developer is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-eclipse-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unaffected by Netease’s restructuring</a>. Also,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-star-wars-collab-heresy-act-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Destiny 2 recently</a> received Star Wars skins. What are your thoughts on Saber Interactive’s CCO suggesting that a KOTOR remake is still coming?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98we%E2%80%99re-cursed-man%E2%80%99-hecz-discusses-optic-texas-cdl-woes-following-0-15-record.1134615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new video uploaded by Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez, the President at OpTic Texas (amongst other things), the current ‘curse’ plaguing the Call of Duty League team was discussed at length. The 18-minute video offered a walkthrough of the offices that OpTic Texas plays out of, with HECZ talking to his team about the issues that have led to a 0-15 map record in recent weeks.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that <strong>something </strong>is wrong at OpTic Texas, as just a few months back, the team won the Call of Duty League Championship, the first COD world title for OpTic since 2017.</p>



<p>OpTic is trying anything at this point.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-think-it-s-this-room">‘I Think It’s This Room’</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas’ Dashy and Kenny both suggested in the video that the room they compete out of ‘might be cursed’, with HECZ revealing that he ‘saged’ the room, revealing at the end of the video exactly what that meant. He’d even taken the time to stencil the ‘Green Wall’ mantra on a whiteboard in the room to inspire his players.</p>



<p>Shotzzy took a similar path, suggesting that they need to relocate to the old office that used to house the squad in Dallas, Texas:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know what it is, bro – I know what it is. We need to go back to the Dallas office.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pred, who recently returned to the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/huke-replacing-pred-in-optic-texas-starting-roster/">after a hiatus</a> lasting a couple of months, agreed with Shotzzy.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video from HECZ:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>HECZ stuck tightly to the theory that this is a curse, suggesting that the organisation has to try ‘supernatural’ solutions to kick out the bad luck that surrounds the team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s talk about this curse. Let’s talk about this curse, because it can’t be anything else. It can’t be skill, they’ve proven to be world champions, they’ve proven to push through adversity – what made this happen?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revisited comments he made previously, wherein he stated that the current roster is the worst Call of Duty team OpTic has ever had:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know that I jokingly and not jokingly said that this is the worst team we’ve ever had, but it is becoming more and more clear that, as talented as these guys are, there’s something else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HECZ then walked around the office, demanding to know who had brought the curse upon the organisation. He then went off on a tanget about the talked-about ‘ring ceremony’ from COD Champs 2024, which is yet to take place. He stressed that ‘no matter how bad they’re doing’, the Green Wall and OpTic Texas <strong>deserve </strong>to see the ring ceremony.</p>



<p>What do you think is wrong at OpTic Texas? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Seeking Investors For “New Entity”, Report Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-seeking-investors-for-new-entity/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-seeking-investors-for-%E2%80%9Cnew-entity%E2%80%9D-report-claims.1134612/</guid>

<p>Ubisoft is actively looking to bring more investors into the fold for what is described as a “new entity”. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published</a> on Friday, Bloomberg says that the company is “considering selling a minority stake in the venture and has contacted potential bidders.” These bidders include Tencent along with various funds located both in France and around the globe.</p>



<p>“Ubisoft has asked for preliminary bids to be made as soon as this month, the people added, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter,” Bloomberg says.</p>



<p>This new venture would include “some of its core” gaming franchises such as Assassin’s Creed. Tencent refused to comment on the claims while Ubisoft pointed to recent earnings reports where it stated that it was exploring all possible options for the company.</p>



<p>The idea of a “new entity” isn’t completely new. Back in January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was reported</a> that Ubisoft and Tencent had talks of a “new venture” that would allow the Guillemot family to retain control of the company while giving Tencent more control over various assets. At the time, Insider Gaming sources said that there was no firm decision or direction reached with the company continuing to look at every option.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft has continued to come under fire both outside and within the company. A minority shareholder has even called for a protest outside the company’s Paris headquarters after its claim that the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to disclose IP acquisition talks</a> with EA and Microsoft.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft looking for investors to create a new company entity in order to turn things around? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
