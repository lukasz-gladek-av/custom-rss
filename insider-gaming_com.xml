<p>In the latest Black Myth: Wukong update, which is being deployed later today, players will be invited to take part in a new ‘boss rush’ challenge mode. This mode is split into two branches, and it’ll see players select former opponents to battle across a range of difficulty levels.</p>



<p>Game Science also revealed a new ‘Journeyer’s Chart’ mechanic, as well as a fresh set of armour, a new soundtrack application, and dozens of bug fixes.</p>



<p>Read on for the full scope of the next Black Myth: Wukong update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-a-challenge">Prepare for a Challenge</h2>



<p>Per an update published by Game Science, the new boss rush mode introduces two core challenges:</p>



<ul>
<li>Return of Rivals</li>



<li>Gauntlet of Legends</li>
</ul>



<p>In Return of Rivals, players are invited to fight past opponents, tweaking the difficulty settings to suit their abilities.</p>



<p>In Gauntlet of Legends, players can undertake a journey, fighting multiple boss characters in succession using a series of customised curses to alter gameplay elements. It was noted that some old bosses will appear with fresh movesets, just to keep players on their toes.</p>



<p>By completing the Gauntlet of Legends, players will unlock rare treasures, including curios, medicine, equipment, and up to three new weapons.</p>



<p>The ‘Journeyer’s Chart’ isn’t immediately obvious, but here’s the description <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the blog update</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A remarkable one has captured these landscapes, organizing them into charts for guidance and marking.</li>



<li>A Journeyer’s Chart can be unlocked when the Destined One first enters Black Wind Mountain and meets the Keeper.</li>



<li>Afterwards, for each new territory reached, a “Journeyer’s Chart” can be purchased at the Keeper’s Shrine.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Also, Game Science has introduced a new equipment set – the ‘Set of Opulence’, which has been designed to celebrate the impending Chinese New Year. Elsewhere, players can use the Black Myth: Wukong Soundtrack Selection feature to enjoy the game’s OST more intricately.</p>



<p>These updates have been made in addition to dozens of changes and bug fixes, along with further localisation tweaks, such as Turkish language support.</p>



<p>The update – 1.0.12.16581 – is available today on PC and PS5.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle revealed that CD Projekt Red was unhappy with him for stating that Geralt will be a part of Witcher 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a conversation with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WiKrmDmyL8&amp;t=1161s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geektown</a> on YouTube (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/the-witcher-4-polaris/220849/news/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-char" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Doug Cockle revealed how he “got slapped by CD Projekt” for stating Geralt was in The Witcher 4. Cockle added that he wasn’t sure about “how true it is” and “went off a rumour”. He thought that he had “seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4, but he won’t be the main character”; however, he wasn’t sure how true this was. CD Projekt Red came to him stating, ‘We haven’t put anything out there, don’t say anything.’</p>



<p>Cockle explained that he doesn’t know “what it’s going to be” he thought he had an ‘idea’ about what it was, but then he was told by CD Projekt Red, ‘We haven’t put anything out there, don’t say anything.’ He also pointed out that his information might be “from a really really old statement that somebody who no longer works for CD Projekt actually put out about three years ago”. Currently, Witcher 4 is a “complete mystery” for the Geralt voice actor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s some context for those wondering what Cockle had stated about Geralt and Witcher 4. During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkl5T0pMFb4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fall Damage</a> on YouTube about four months ago, Cockle stated, “Geralt will be part of the game.” He wasn’t sure how prevalent his role would be, but he knew the game wouldn’t focus on the character. Cockle also added that he hadn’t seen the script yet and could be lying through his teeth.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ewcf-club-partner-program-expansion/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ewcf-club-partner-program-to-award-%E2%80%98six-figure-funding%E2%80%99-to-40-esports-organisations.1056564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ewcf-club-partner-program-expansion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed by the Esports World Cup Foundation that the EWCF Club Partner Program applications for 2025 are now open – and that the scheme has been massively bolstered. The EWCF Club Partner Program will now invest $20 million into organisations, and this year, the scheme has been expanded to cover 40 members, up from 30 last year.</p>



<p>The top eight teams from the EWC’s Club Championship automatically score an invite, but the remaining 32 slots are up for grabs now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prestigious-program">Prestigious Program</h2>



<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program isn’t open to <strong>every organisation</strong>. Some prerequisites must be met by applicants, including having a high level of fan engagement and ‘creative excellence’. </p>



<p>Here’s the spiel from <a href="https://esportsworldcup.com/en/clubprogram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program 2025 will focus on Clubs around the world that show high levels of fan engagement and creative excellence. Through this partnership, the EWCF and the participating Clubs will jointly invest to tell the EWC 2025 stories. Partnered Clubs are expected to have an established track record of elite competitive performance across multiple games, as well as a substantial social media presence with the ability to engage and grow a global fanbase. </p>



<p>Participating Clubs will be able to access the Program funding by engaging their fanbase with their brands throughout the esports year – so fans can follow storylines leading up to the Esports World Cup, watching tournaments online and experiencing live matches during the season.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All participating clubs will receive a six-figure sum to help grow their organisation ahead of the Esports World Cup 2025. If the participants see immense success as part of the EWCF Club Partner Program, they’ll receive additional funding. It was stressed that being a member of the scheme <strong>doesn’t </strong>grant instant qualification into next year’s Esports World Cup, though.</p>



<p>Per the terms of the application process, organisations have until the 10th of January to get their forms filled out. </p>



<p>In a statement, Faisal bin Homran, the CPO of the EWCF, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program represents a significant step forward in our ongoing mission to foster a thriving ecosystem for esports Clubs worldwide while unlocking opportunities for organizations from some of the world’s fastest-growing esports markets, like China. </p>



<p>Through this program, we enable partnered Clubs to attract fans with engaging content beyond the games, showcasing the personalities and talent of players, alongside their origin stories, while also developing their Clubs’ brands as fan-favorite powerhouses in esports entertainment.</p>
</blockquote>
