<p>We received a welcome treat with the launch of Battlefield 6’s REDSEC content, as it included a new DLC trophy list specifically for battle royale and Gauntlet content. Insider Gaming has the full list for you to check out, and for something so short, it’s deceptively grindy.</p>



<p>Once we got wind of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-trophy-list-all-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 trophy list</a>, we’d have been forgiven for thinking this would be the extent of BF 6’s trophies. Alas, we were wrong, and we’re glad to say we were. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REDSEC battle royale</a> content was introduced with Season 1, and so with it came the awesome new Gauntlet mode.</p>



<p>Gauntlet and traditional BR make up the fabric of the new Battlefield 6 trophies and achievements, so let’s check them out.</p>

<p>The extra Battlefield 6 DLC REDSEC trophy list is like a 3ft powerlifter—Small in stature, but doing a lot of heavy lifting. There aren’t many trophies and achievements here, but they will take you a long time to achieve.</p>



<p>Here’s the complete list of DLC REDSEC trophies for Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">May the Odds Forever Be in Your Favor</td><td data-align="center">Play 74 matches in any version of Battle Royale.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Here’s Your Birthday Present</td><td data-align="center">Deploy 42 call-ins.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Collector</td><td data-align="center">Loot 10 Superior or Custom items.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stone Cold</td><td data-align="center">Stun enemies 316 times in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rise from Your Grave</td><td data-align="center">Revive teammates 1988 times in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Army of Two</td><td data-align="center">Win 7 matches in Battle Royale: Duos.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Never-Ending Game</td><td data-align="center">Play 125 rounds of Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Everybody Fights, Nobody Quits</td><td data-align="center">Win a Battle Royale match as a full squad with total squad survival.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mission Accepted</td><td data-align="center">Complete 214 missions in any version of Battle Royale.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Dog of War</td><td data-align="center">College 9 dog tags in Battle Royale or Gauntlet.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mozambique Hotel</td><td data-align="center">Ping a Shotgun in Battle Royale.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-battlefield-6-redsec-dlc">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies In Battlefield 6 REDSEC DLC?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s a small helping of 11 extra PlayStation Trophies and 11 Xbox Achievements to explore, discover, and obtain in Battlefield 6’s optional REDSEC DLC list.</strong></p>



<p>Quite often, when we do these lists, we have to give Xbox owners the bad news that PS users get an additional trophy. This isn’t the case this time around! DLC trophy lists don’t carry a Platinum, so it’s a level playing field for once.</p>



<p>If you are on PS5, it’s broken down into 10 Bronze Trophies and 1 Silver Trophy. Happy hunting, soldiers.</p>



<p>Let us know what you think of the extra list. Should more live-service games add more trophies and achievements as DLC lists?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-nod-bringing-a-%E2%80%9Cmajor-ip%E2%80%9D-to-gaming-for-netflix.1337404/</guid>

<p>Don’t Nod, the studio behind Life is Strange, is working with Netflix on a new narrative-driven game. Furthermore, the title is said to be of a ‘major existing IP’.</p>



<p>If you’ve played any big narrative games this past decade, chances are a Don’t Nod title was one of them. From the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the iconic Life is Strang</a>e series, the French developer/publisher has quickly become one to watch. Now, in its half-year sales report, the company has a new collaboration: Netflix.</p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-and-don-t-nod-working-on-a-new-existing-franchise-based-game">Netflix and Don’t Nod Working on a New Existing Franchise-Based Game</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t Nod announced its half-year results for 2025 in <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new press release</a>. The company reported that it more than tripled revenue, releasing games like Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage. While the title didn’t meet sales expectations, upcoming projects like The Lonesome Guild and Aphelion hope to turn the tide. However, the biggest news comes with the announcement of a collaboration with Netflix. The company stated that the narrative-driven project is in development at its Montreal studio. It will be published by Netflix and be based on a ‘major IP’. </p>



<p>As to what that IP may be, there are certainly a few possibilities. Personally, with the style of Lost Records, Stranger Things is a no-brainer for Don’t Nod. Given how it fits the mystery/sci-fi genre it mastered with Life is Strange, it’ll feel right at home. However, Netflix is home to many major franchises like Bridgerton, Outer Banks, Bird Box, and Wednesday, so there are plenty of options. It’ll be exciting to see how it turns out, as I’m both a fan of Don’t Nod’s work and Netflix’s catalog. </p>



<p>What franchise do you want Don’t Nod to adapt for Netflix? Do you have a favorite title of the company? Enjoy Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage?
