<p>Corinne Busche, the director of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and longtime BioWare employee, has joined Wizards of the Coast’s Skeleton Key Studio. The news was confirmed in by Wizards of the Coast’s Dan Ayoub.</p>



<p>In a new interview with Stephen Totilo’s <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-preps-an-edgy-snake-eyes-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, Ayoub confirmed that Busche has joined the studio as a creative lead on a new game currently in production. It’s the studio’s first game since opening in 2022.</p>



<p>Skeleton Key had been working on two projects, but cut one of them in order to streamline its focus. Since then, Ayoub says that a “vast majority” of those who were working on the cancelled project have moved over to the unannounced game.</p>



<p>News of Busche’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure from BioWare</a> became public in January. The move comes after she spent 18 years at the Canadian-based studio. Busche has yet to comment publicly on her new role. At the time she said that she didn’t want people to “read too much” into her departure. </p>



<p>“I want to encourage everyone not to read too much into this,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/corinnebusche.bsky.social/post/3lfxyo5h5vk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">she said</a>. “This was my decision so I could continue making the kind of RPGs you (we) enjoy. Thank you for the outpouring of love and support. You mean the world to me.”</p>



<p>What do you think the new game in development at Skeleton Key is, and Dragon Age’s former director Busche joining the team?

<p>One of the biggest sports superstars (or SIU-perstar) and soccer sensation Cristiano Ronaldo is officially joining the roster of playable fighters in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. One of the most popular figures in sports and social media will have a soccer-themed set of attacks, and can hit his trademark celebration.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-closest-cristiano-ronaldo-will-ever-come-to-joining-wolves">The Closest Cristiano Ronaldo Will Ever Come to Joining Wolves</h2>



<p>Ronaldo <a href="https://x.com/Cristiano/status/1904942189102182598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that he would join Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves today, announcing the news to his 115.1 million followers on X (the third most on the platform). He also posted the trailer on his Instagram account, where he has the most followers of anyone on the world: a staggering 651 million followers. Ronaldo will be voiced by voice actor Juan Felipe Sierra.</p>



<p>One of the most recognizable faces in sports and social media is now joining one of the most recognized and beloved fighting game franchises. The original Fatal Fury: King of Fighters released in 1991, and was created by Takashi Nishiyama, the creator of the original Street Fighter. The series was immensely popular in the 1990s, but an original game has not released since Mark of the Wolves came out in 1999, though there have been several ports of different titles in recent years.</p>

<p>News of the first Fatal Fury game in over 20 years first emerged at EVO 2022, when a new title was announced on stage at the world’s biggest fighting game tournament. Street Fighter characters Ken Masters and Chun-Li will join the roster as part of the first season of downloadable content. Ronaldo was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ronaldo-fatal-fury-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first linked to Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves back in September</a>, when he posted a teaser that said: “A legendary player joins a legendary game.” Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is also one of several titles that will be featured at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this summer; Ronaldo currently plays in the Saudi Pro League for club Al Nassr.</p>
