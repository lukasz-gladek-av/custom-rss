<p>The first Nintendo Treehouse livestream for the Nintendo Switch 2 is live now and fans have voice their frustration over the consoles and games prices.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, 121,000 people are currently watching the livestream on the official Nintendo of America YouTube channel, with many voice voicing their frustration about the console and game prices.</p>



<p>“DROP THE PRICE” currently consists of about 99% of the comments on the stream, with a few comments here and there giving thoughts on the actual stream.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will cost players $450, with its games going up from $70 to $80. In some regions, such as Spain, the price is an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eye-watering 90 euros for a physical game, which converts to $99.91</a> at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Nintendo raising it’s prices will undoubtedly set a precedent for other publishers moving forward, and by the end of the year, we could see $80 games normalised. </p>



<p>Earlier today, Argos, a UK retailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-are-already-live-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made its pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2</a> live ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worldwide April 9 pre-order date</a> and went on to sell out of the Switch 2 in a matter of hours. Argos was offering the base unit for £395.99 and the MK bundle for £429.99.</p>



<p>If you choose to pre-order via Nintendo, the company is working to limit scalpers with a new pre-order plan. According to the company, those who want to pre-order through Nintendo will have to be an active Nintendo Switch Online member for “at least two years continuously by March 31, 2025”. Players must also have spent a certain amount of time playing on the console with priority going to those who played more. It’s currently unknown how other retailers will work to combat scalping.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-on-nintendo-switch-2-runs-at-40-fps-costs-70/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When the Nintendo Switch 2 was fully revealed on April 2, one of the bigger third-party game announcements came when CD Projekt Red confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 would be launching on the console. Now, just a day later, there are more details on what Switch 2 players can expect from the game on the new system.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://x.com/jan_rosner/status/1907780644131799153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s vice president of business development Jan Rosner</a>, Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will cost $70 when it releases on June 5. What’s more is that, should you buy the physical version of the game, it will come full on the Switch 2 cartridge.</p>



<p>“The game will be distributed on a 64GB game card (containing the game and expansion, no download required), as well as via digital download from Nintendo eShop for Nintendo Switch 2,” Rosner said.</p>



<p>The news of the game being included on the physical card comes after Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/not-all-nintendo-switch-2-games-include-game-on-cartridge-despite-prices-of-up-to-90/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed that not all physical copies</a> of games for the system will actually include the games themselves. Instead, they will be treated as licensing keys that allow you to download and play the game on your console.</p>







<p>With the game being on the Switch 2, many have wondered how the game’s performance would be. Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, who spent time with the game on the system, gave a bit of insight on that front.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Schreier says that Cyberpunk 2077 ran at 40fps while in performance mode when the system was docked. He didn’t mention how the game runs in handheld.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to CD Projekt Red for more details on the game’s performance on the console. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/emma-frost-leaks-suggests-marvel-rivals-season-2-debut-awaits/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals players might need to wrap up warm as a leak says Emma Frost is dropping into the Season 2 action. The feisty female has been a mainstay in Marvel comics for years, and a Rivals appearance is fitting.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-studio-closures-dozen-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NetEase</a> did the unthinkable and broke into the live-service shooter market. The hero-based multiplayer title has managed to keep up with its contemporaries and remain one of the most-played online games on the market. The Season 1 Eternal Night Falls content is symptomatic of the game’s success, offering plenty of exciting new additions.</p>



<p>But live-service titles need to evolve and expand—it can’t all be about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-teases-venom-twerking-emote-as-in-game-event-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twerking Venom emotes</a>. Marvel Rivals Season 2 continues this heroic origin story, and a leaker has outed Emma Frost as an integral piece of the next chapter.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-2-debut-for-emma-frost-reported">Marvel Rivals Season 2 Debut For Emma Frost Reported</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How will she fit in? Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s unlikely many players would be cold toward an Emma Frost arrival. The femme fatale has been a favorite throughout the comics and has regularly been seen across various forms of Marvel media. According to leaker <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XOXLEAK</a>, she’s destined to make her Marvel Rivals bow in Season 2.</p>



<p>The user posted an image on X showing (presumably) a snippet of the Marvel Rivals Season 2 artwork. You can see a character model that looks the spitting image of Emma Frost in it. </p>



<p>From the white and icy blue outfit to the ice crystals protruding from the getup, I think I can say with confidence this is <strong>Emma Frost</strong>.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Emma Frost arrives in season 2</span></p></article></div>



<p>If it <em>is </em>her and this post is real, it’s unclear if Emma Frost arrives on day one or is a later inclusion. Either way, it’s another solid acquisition for a stacked Marvel Rivals roster.</p>

<p>When players load up EA Sports Madden NFL 26 this year, they’re going to notice a change to the game’s broadcast team. Specifically, there will be something different about the game’s in-game voice.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/Schultz_Report/status/1907561382200951183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Schultz of Fox Sports</a>, the voice of NFL RedZone Scott Hanson is joining the series as the new in-game host for Madden 26. Hanson is expected to replace Johnathan Coachman who had long-been the in-game host of the game.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-latest-game-announcements-april-3-2025">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-game-announcements-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Latest Game Announcements – April 3, 2025</a></h6>



<p>While know specifics weren’t revealed, Hanson is likely to be the voice players here when loading into a game as well as during halftime. It’s unknown if more will be added for Hanson’s role as EA Sports has yet to officially reveal Madden 26’s features.</p>



<p>Madden 26 is expected to be revealed sometime in late spring/early summer ahead of a summer release. For Madden 25, the first reveal came in June when the game’s cover athlete was announced. It could be assumed that EA will likely stay on the same schedule for this year’s game as well.</p>



<p>Sticking with Madden news, it was confirmed during April 2’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the franchise will be returning</a> to Nintendo consoles for the first time in over a decade. Madden 26, along with EA Sports FC, will be launching later this year for the Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>



<p>According to EA, both titles will have feature parity to other platforms “as much as the hardware allows.”</p>

<p>It’s time for the latest game announcements for April 3, 2025.</p>
