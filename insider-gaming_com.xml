<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 having Early Access would go a long way to shortening the seven-year wait for a sequel. The first game was a blockbuster success and has kept fans entertained for years. The time has come for a new title though, but you want to know if you can play it early, and we know.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios believes in the “bigger is better ideology.” The sequel is bigger, the development team working on the game is bigger, and it has a bigger weapon pool. It’s just <em>bigger</em>. The first game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 8 million units</a>, so it’s obvious the interest is there—hence the Early Access discussion.</p>



<p>Early Access is all the rage. Everyone wants everything now. Let’s see if you can have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 doesn’t feature any form of Early Access, meaning the only way to play KC2 is to wait for the worldwide launch.</strong></p>



<p>Warhorse Studios hasn’t commented on Early Access, which isn’t ideal. Worse still, we’ve seen every Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 edition, and while they come with a whole host of luxurious benefits for launch and after KC2’s release, <strong>there’s no Early Access</strong>.</p>



<p>Why is this? I don’t know. There does seem to be a trend of games with close communities and titles geared toward players (and not microtransactions) foregoing modern-day business practices—Early Access being one. The developer has opted not to have Early Access, and potentially use the benefit as a way to flog more expensive editions.</p>



<p>Lots of this is speculation on my part. However, one thing not up for debate is there is no Early Access.  </p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-editions">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Editions</h2>



<p><strong>There is a Standard Edition, Gold Edition, and Collector’s Edition for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 if you want more out of the experience.</strong></p>



<p>Each one ramps up the price, but also the content included. To iterate, none of them have Early Access. But you can check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-editions-collectors-edition-gold-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 edition</a> to see if any catch your eye. </p>



<p>Plus, securing your copy early is a surefire way to guarantee the inviting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-editions-collectors-edition-gold-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order bonus</a> too.</p>

<p>I’m sorry if you were hoping for better news. At least it isn’t long now until the February 4 release date, and you can make the Kingdom of Bohemia your own. Let us know the first thing you’re going to do in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 in the comments below.</p>



<p>We’ve answered many other questions about the sequel too including if it’s coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-coming-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how big the map is</a>, and what the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-launch roadmap</a> plans are looking like.</p>
