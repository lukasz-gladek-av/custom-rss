<p>In recent years, the United Kingdom’s gaming scene has been shaken by a dwindling count of in-person events. It was tough coming out of COVID-19, but for a while, a decent spread kept gamers across the nation entertained. We had EGX, Insomnia, WASD, and a few other, smaller events scattered here and there.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Insomnia disappeared following a round of layoffs at the event’s parent company. Now, after months of speculation, it has been revealed that WASD London, which first took place in 2022, has been struck from the schedule forever as the organiser enters liquidation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-nothing">To Nothing</h2>



<p>In October, EGX surfaced as it does every year, but it was twinned with MCM, the nation’s biggest comic con event. It was suspected that this was to help keep both events afloat, and while the turnout was solid, the future of EGX is also under threat.</p>



<p>The Insomnia Gaming Festival, which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year, was due to take place in September, but the expected show dates came and went without a word being uttered.</p>



<p>Now, WASD London’s organiser has entered liquidation, with the firm’s co-founder lamenting the state of the scene:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(The) increasing costs and less demand for stand space means running events is just not viable for us anymore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For a while, WASD London was becoming a spearhead event in the city. It welcomed both top-tier titles and indie developers, helping to cast a light on lesser-known games with small (or no) budgets while also allowing players to enjoy the next biggest games.</p>



<p>At past WASD events, I was fortunate enough to be one of the first people in the country to play Dead Island 2 and Lords of the Fallen. I maintain that when it peaked, WASD London was one of the best industry events in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>In a comment posted <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxvxzp909o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on a BBC article</a>, one indie gaming aficionado expressed their concerns about the sustainability of these events:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that bigger gaming companies are running their own digital events, there’s no reason for them to spend time, money, and resources on being present at in-person events.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pretty soon, all we’ll have that’s anywhere close to the UK will be Gamescom – but the saving grace there is that it’s effectively the world’s biggest gaming expo right now.</p>

<p>Obsidian has revealed the minimum and recommended system requirements for running Avowed on a PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avowed is an upcoming fantasy RPG with a vibrant open world that you can experience from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-deep-dive-video-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-person and third-person perspectives</a>. Many players have wondered what specifications they might need to experience the game as the developers intended. Fortunately, Avowed’s minimum and recommended PC requirements are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">out now</a>; check them out below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 10/11 with updates</li>



<li>Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 / Intel i5-8400</li>



<li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li>Graphics: AMD RX 5700 / Nvidia GTX 1070 / Intel Arc A580</li>



<li>DirectX: Version 12</li>



<li>Storage: 75 GB available space</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 10/11 with updates</li>



<li>Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X / Intel i7-10700K</li>

<li>Graphics: Graphics: AMD RX 6800 XT / Nvidia RTX 3080</li>



<li>DirectX: Version 12</li>



<li>Storage: 75 GB available space</li>
</ul>



<p>The requirements aren’t too demanding, with players only needing an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 / Intel i5-8400 and AMD RX 5700 / Nvidia GTX 1070 / Intel Arc A580 to run the game. At the same time, 75 GB of storage space, 16GB of RAM, and DirectX Version 12 are essential for both Avowed’s minimum and recommended PC system requirements.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-amazon-1236173978/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Amazon’s Tomb Raider series could potentially cast Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner as Lara Croft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report states that the parties are negotiating to get Sophie Turner to play Lara Croft in Amazon’s upcoming Tomb Raider series. Their <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/tomb-raider-sophie-turner-lucy-boynton-lara-croft-1236161243/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> from last month stated that Turner was auditioning for the part along with Bohemian Rhapsody’s Lucy Boynton. Sophie Turner is currently working on two shows, Joan and Haven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the writer and executive producer for Amazon’s Tomb Raider series. During the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-live-action-show-coming-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, Waller-Bridge expressed her love for the franchise and how honoured she feels to be a part of the series. She stated, “I can’t wait to go on this adventure. Bats ‘n all.” Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, also called the upcoming series “epic” and “globetrotting” during the reveal.</p>



<p>The series does not have a release window at the moment, and no plot details have been revealed. If the reports are accurate, securing Lara Craft for the upcoming live-action Tomb Raider series will be the first significant development for the show. </p>

<p>My wife enjoys laughing at me because I spend time daily going through the most wishlisted upcoming Steam games on the digital storefront in search of anything new I might have missed. Something is launching daily, and new game announcements occur weekly, so it’s not outside the realm of possibility that my nearly 1,000-strong wishlist is missing something. I’m sure I’m not alone, which is why I’m sharing with you the ten most wishlisted upcoming games on the platform for November!</p>



<h2 id="h-top-wishlists-on-steam-for-november">Top Wishlists on Steam for November</h2>



<p>For the most part, the top ten <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=popularwishlist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlists on Steam</a> don’t change too frequently. Many of these games, like Monster Hunter, Deadlock, and Hollow Knight, remain in the top ten month after month. They likely will until launch. But it’s nice seeing titles like Delta Force, Arena Breakout, and the upcoming STALKER 2 make an appearance!</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Deadlock</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></li>



<li><strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</strong></li>



<li><strong>Delta Force</strong></li>



<li><strong>Marvel Rivals</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII</strong></li>



<li><strong>ARK 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Light No Fire</strong></li>



<li><strong>Arena Breakout: Infinite</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Just narrowly missing the top ten list are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-path-of-exile-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>, inZOI, and Unrecord. I imagine Path of Exile 2 will push into the top ten slot this month, following the developer’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming livestream showcasing the launch-day build, classes, and end-game content</a>!</p>







<h2 id="h-upcoming-game-releases-in-november-worth-keeping-an-eye-on">Upcoming Game Releases in November Worth Keeping An Eye On</h2>



<p>Of course, just because something isn’t on the top wishlists on Steam doesn’t mean it’s not worth your time. November is chock full of hot releases, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong></li>



<li><strong>Metro Awakening</strong></li>



<li><strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership</strong></li>



<li><strong>Funko Fusion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</strong></li>



<li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws (Steam)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Genshin Impact (Xbox Series X|S)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Towers of Aghasba</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Who could forget the recently released Farming Simulator 25? It launches with a few day-one issues that require a patch promptly from Giants, but it’s still a fun, relaxing experience!</p>
