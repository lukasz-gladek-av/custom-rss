            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An MMORPG based on PlayStation and Guerrilla Games’ Horizon series has been leaked before its official reveal. We now know several details surrounding the game, now called Horizon Steel Frontiers.</p>







<p>While a newer IP, the Horizon series, consisting of 2017’s Zero Dawn and 2022’s Forbidden West, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-franchise-32m-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-received by critics</a>. The third-person post-apocalyptic shooter is known for its gorgeous graphics and intuitive open-world gameplay. With hulking mechanical monsters and a lush environment, Horizon’s iconic settings make for the perfect setup for games outside of the main series. We did see LEGO Horizon Adventures and a VR spinoff, but it’s stayed in its lane for a bit. However, rumors of an MMORPG had surfaced over the past years, but it was thought to be cancelled. However, according to new information, it seems it’s here and, most likely, will be revealed quite soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-minute-video-of-mmorpg-horizon-steel-frontiers-coming-soon-according-to-leak">10-Minute Video of MMORPG Horizon Steel Frontiers Coming Soon, According to Leak</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Leaked key art from Horizon Steel Frontiers </figcaption></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819657/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-sony-ncsoft-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, which supposedly saw a 10-minute video of the Horizon MMORPG, called Horizon Steel Frontiers. It even included key art, which we have above. Supposedly, the game is set to be revealed at the G-STAR 2025 event, but information came out early. </p>



<p>In the article, it mentions that the game is a collaboration between PlayStation and Korean developer NCSoft. The video, planned to be shown there, showcases gameplay, both complete and in development. As it is an MMORPG, instead of playing as Aloy, you’ll create your own character and join others in the world, called the Deathlands. It also says that the title will release on PC, iOS, and Android. No mention of a release date or if it will go to PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As the game is not yet confirmed, take the news with a grain of salt for now. However, given the content leaked, it’s safe to say it’s only a matter of time before it’s announced. Either way, it will be interesting to see how Horizon fits into the MMORPG genre and the differences between it and the main series.</p>







<p>What do you think of Horizon Steel Frontiers? Does Horizon need an MMORPG? Excited to see gameplay? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Rogue Piece monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free Gems and Cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogue Piece is an exciting anime-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that is based on the ultra-popular anime series One Piece, while also taking inspiration from various other anime shows. Players progress through the game by exploring various islands, defeating enemies along the way to get stronger and level up. The enemies that players will have to face get stronger as the game progresses, which makes grinding that much harder, and that’s where Rogue Piece codes can be of use to players. The codes will provide players with some much-needed resources, which can be used to get stronger weapons and upgrade existing abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-rogue-piece-codes">How To Redeem Rogue Piece Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rogue Piece Codes Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Many Roblox games nowadays require players to complete certain steps before they’re able to redeem codes in the respective game. Some require players to follow the social media profiles of the developers, while others force players to join the game’s official Discord server before the code redemption feature gets unlocked for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogue Piece, however, doesn’t fall into the category. Redeeming codes in Rogue Piece is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes given above into the correct text box. For newer players of the game who may be unfamiliar with the Roblox menu ecosystem, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeeming codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Rogue Piece.</li>



<li>Click on the settings button on the left side of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the ‘code’ text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click the ‘Enter’ button to claim your reward.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-rogue-piece-codes">How To Get More Rogue Piece Codes</h2>



<p>The developers of Rogue Piece often drop new codes during updates or special events, which means that the next set of codes could be released very soon. However, tracking the release of these codes can be a hassle, as it requires players to comb through the game’s social media handles or Discord server regularly. Instead, the easiest way for players to stay up to date with the latest codes would be to bookmark this page. We update this article immediately after any new codes are dropped, making it your one-stop shop for all things Roblox codes.</p>
