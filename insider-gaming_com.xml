<p>Ubisoft has unveiled the full Rainbow Six Year 11 roadmap during the Six Invitational in Paris. On one of the grandest stages in the esports landscape, Ubisoft uncovered the next year of Rainbow Six Siege content, and things are looking great.</p>



<p>The breakdown started with a new trailer that revealed the death of Phobos. From there, the team talked about Ranked 3.0, balancing changes that will update how players enjoy the game (looking first at entry and roaming, and the new cadence with seasonal updates.</p>



<p>Check out everything you need to know below.</p>







<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-siege-year-11-roadmap-is-more-siege-more-often">Rainbow Six Siege Year 11 Roadmap is ‘More Siege, More Often’</h2>



<p>The running theme of Rainbow Six Siege’s Year 11 roadmap is, according to Ubisoft, ‘more Siege, more often’.</p>



<p>That all begins with a hefty array of new seasons coming to the game over the next 12 months. For some reason, the team started by detailing <strong>season four</strong>, dropping at the end of the year.</p>



<p>This update will be all about <strong>teamplay</strong>, and to accommodate better collaboration, a new <strong>social hub </strong>will be implemented. A new ‘testing grounds’ playlist will also drop in season four, with Ubisoft monitoring feedback and seeing what needs to change before Year 12 kicks off.</p>



<p>Towards the end of Year 11, a new strategic option is coming to the test area in the form of <strong>half reinforcements</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Y11S4, the Hostage mechanic is also going to get a major rework. Additionally, The Grand Larceny, a limited-time event not seen for almost <strong>six years</strong>, is coming back.</p>



<p>Players will be able to prove their expertise with specific Operators in Y11S4, too, leaning on Operator Mastery tiers. As the team said, this gives your time with these characters ‘more meaning’.</p>



<p>Y11S3, which will drop <strong>before season four</strong> (obviously), introduces a new Defender with a brilliant counter for shield users, codename: <strong>Firework</strong>. The small teaser we got for the unnamed character revealed a gadget that can punch clean through shields.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In Y11S2, the in-game esports tab is getting a huge update, allowing fans of the competitive scene to better connect with and follow their favourite competitors.</p>



<p>This season will also welcome a new Rainbow Six Siege map, pulled straight from Rainbow Six Vegas – <strong>Calypso Casino</strong>. It’s a ‘tribute to the amazing Vegas games from Rainbow’s past,’ said Alex Kaparzis, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-creative-director-stepping-down/" id="173856">former Creative Director of the game</a>.</p>



<p>Y11S2 will also yield a remaster for Dokkaebi, giving her a ‘more personal and targeted approach’ as well as a new primary weapon to broaden her arsenal. It was stressed that the weapon won’t be locked behind a battle pass but will be available to all users when it drops.</p>



<p>But what about what comes in the first season of Year 11?</p>



<h2 id="h-year-11-season-1-welcomes-a-recognisable-face">Year 11 Season 1 Welcomes a Recognisable Face</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/">Y11S1 welcomes Solid Snake</a>, the protagonist of the <strong>older </strong>Metal Gear Solid games. He’ll be joining Zero as a new Operator, and he’s coming on board with a standalone story to set him up nicely in the universe.</p>



<p>The first season of Year 11 is themed almost entirely around Metal Gear. There’s a new event named [REDACTED] that brings MGS-themed skins and a limited-time 4v4 mode, a string of cosmetics coming in the battle pass, and, of course, Solid Snake himself.</p>



<p>He’s coming in as a one-health, three-speed Operator with unique voice lines, a new gadget, and a sweet loadout.</p>



<p>The first season, Operation Silent Hunt, launches on March 3rd. It’s set to welcome modernized maps, a 1v1 arcade mode, and a huge balancing overhaul, amongst other things.</p>



<p>For your information and perusal, here’s the full Rainbow Six Siege Year 11 roadmap:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Solid Snake is coming to Rainbow Six Siege in Y11S1, a season dubbed ‘Operation Silent Hunt’. He’s coming into the game as a <strong>permanent Operator </strong>and has unique, new voice lines recorded by the iconic David Hayter. He’s coming to the Rainbow Six world with unique gadgets, weapons, and an immense aura.</p>



<p>During the Six Invitational in Paris, France, Ubisoft debuted a short trailer that saw Solid Snake welcomed to the franchise by none other than Sam Fisher. The team went on to reveal that Konami has provided iconic sounds from the Metal Gear series for his arrival in Rainbow Six.</p>







<h2 id="h-solid-snake-is-rainbow-six-siege-s-new-operator">Solid Snake is Rainbow Six Siege’s New Operator</h2>



<p>The short trailer that was revealed to unveil Solid Snake went down like a storm at the Six Invitational in Paris. Towards the end of January, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-rainbow-six-siege/">Solid Snake would be coming</a> to the game as a new Operator by dataminers, which prompted many to fully expect a full reveal at the Six Invitational.</p>



<p>And here it is:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Solid Snake will be a one-health, three-speed Operator, which means he can’t take a hell of a lot of damage, but he’s fast, which is what you’d expect from one of the stealthiest heroes from the gaming world.</p>



<p>His loadout is already iconic and features the F2 assault rifle, the PMR90A2 battle rifle, and the TACIT .45, a powerful and suppressed handgun. His OSP Pouch gadget provides a unique radar and early warning system, which is where the sounds iconic from the Metal Gear series come from.</p>



<p>To welcome Solid Snake to the game, a new event has been set up for Y11S1, now one of the most highly anticipated seasons in recent years. It’s called [REDACTED], and it sees some of the most recognizable characters from the Metal Gear franchise surface as skins in an exclusive 4v4 mode.</p>



<p>And of course, a stack of battle pass cosmetics is coming too:</p>

<p>During the unveiling of the Rainbow Six Year 11 roadmap at the Six Invitational in Paris, Ubisoft’s game leadership team revealed what’s coming next for the game.</p>



<p>In one of the most exciting revelations, fans learned that Bishop is making a return to the Rainbow Six universe. This is a fan-favourite character who hasn’t been seen in the series since Rainbow Six Vegas 2 was released in 2008. As he said in the teaser that unveiled his return, ‘Things must be bad if you’re calling me.’</p>







<h2 id="h-bishop-s-rainbow-return-is-imminent">Bishop’s Rainbow Return is Imminent</h2>



<p>In 2008, Bishop was last seen in Rainbow Six Vegas 2, serving the all-important role as protagonist. While Bishop could have been either male or female <strong>back then</strong>, Ubisoft has confirmed that the character’s return will be solely focused on the male variant.</p>



<p>When the events of Rainbow Six Vegas 2 had wrapped up, Bishop was sent to be the Deputy Director of Rainbow, but then the character faded out of the universe.</p>



<p>This year, Bishop is coming back, resurfacing after almost twenty years away from the franchise. Rainbow Six Vegas 2 is often considered one of the gems of the franchise, having launched way back in 2008.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Bishop has changed a little since 2008, that’s for sure.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Over the years, fans of the series have wondered <strong>why </strong>Ubisoft doesn’t bring back Bishop as an Operator or some kind of starring character, and now those questions have been answered.</p>

            <guid>1436596</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" id="311">Fallout</a> is a bustling realm that’s as much made up of the original projects by the developers as it is fan-made projects pieced together by those enthralled by the post-apocalyptic universe that emerged in the late 1990s. The latest entry into that world, Fallout: The New West, is no different, but it’s one of the more ambitious concepts to surface in recent years.</p>



<p>Fallout: The New West is a fan-made project that aims to remake the cancelled Fallout: Van Buren, which many die-hard fans have always dubbed ‘the original Fallout 3’. It’s what might have been had the original team not hit a patch of financial distress and shifted focus away from the series, ultimately selling the label to Bethesda Game Studios.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-the-new-west-revives-what-might-have-been">Fallout: The New West Revives What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>Van Buren was canned in 2003 after months of development at Black Isle Studios. It would have been the third major release in the series, bearing the name ‘Fallout 3’ and taking players to the American southwest, around Colorado. Coincidentally, that’s where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-fallout-set-colorado-season-two-explained/" id="174234">the next season</a> of the Fallout television show is headed.</p>



<p>It was never to be, and in 2008, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda/" id="419">Bethesda Game Studios</a> released Fallout 3, a monumental overhaul to the series and a real risk-taker of a game, after acquiring the licenses from Interplay and Black Isle.</p>



<p>Now, a group of dedicated modders is bringing Van Buren back to life with Fallout: The New West. It’s a complete conversion mod that promises to transform Fallout: New Vegas, telling the ‘same broad story envisioned by Fallout: Van Buren.’ On the website for Fallout: The New West, the game’s narrative was outlined, and by all accounts, it’s an ambitious stab at a near-forgotten game.</p>



<p>Days ago, The United West Team, the group assembling The New West, posted the first teaser trailer for the mod:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout: The New West Reveal Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KY5X0G_05h0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>At the time of writing, the trailer had garnered more than 100,000 views and hundreds of positive comments. One user wrote, <em>‘For a moment, I thought this was from Bethesda and went, ‘Oh, so they were actually cooking.’ As always, it’s the community that keeps Fallout alive.’</em></p>



<p>Fallout: The New West actually surfaced around five years ago. In May 2021, the team at The United West announced plans to piece the mod together, but back then, it was dubbed Fallout Revelation Blue. Back then, it was noted that Fallout: The New West <strong>would not </strong>treat New Vegas as canonical.</p>



<p>One thing is for sure, and that’s that Bethesda’s Todd Howard probably won’t play this mod either, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-no-interest-fallout-4-mod-london/" id="167864">effectively snubbing Fallout: London</a>.</p>
