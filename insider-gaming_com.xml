<p>In a feat that everyone deemed impossible, a content creator has managed to solo a Queen in ARC Raiders. The hulking mech is the most dominant and terrifying enemy in the game right now, and up until this point, it was believed that it was <strong>not possible </strong>to take it down as a solo player.</p>



<p>To put it into perspective, during an earlier testing session, the Queen was killed 58 times out of <strong>four million raids</strong>.</p>

<p>In a short clip uploaded to social media, JGOD revealed the closing moments of a <strong>20-minute battle </strong>with the Queen on Dam in ARC Raiders. In the comments under the video, JGOD revealed that he used a variety of locations, some of which could be considered ‘cheesing’ the boss character, but remaining dynamic was key to defeating the fearsome enemy.</p>



<p>JGOD suggested taking a good Hullcracker into the fight and running in with ‘around 200’ shots for it. The rifle that he used went from 125 durability to under <strong>20 </strong>as the fight progressed. Any longer, and his weapon might have broken entirely. He didn’t <strong>count</strong>, but he said that he fired ‘about 180’ because he ‘missed a bunch as well’.</p>

<p>Another user suggested taking in a stack of Wolfpack grenades to whittle down the Queen’s HP pool, which sits at around 30,000 points.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is becoming famous for having some of the most entertaining AI enemies to fight, and that naturally includes the gargantuan Queen. In this PvPvE extraction shooter, the ARC enemies represent something dynamic, unpredictable, and adaptable, which is much more enjoyable than the cannon fodder NPCs seen in some extraction shooters.</p>

<p>The superhero narrative game Dispatch has already sold over a million copies in just ten days. Bolstered by a big cast and impressive production team, the game is already one of 2025’s biggest games.</p>



<p>Released in late October with episodes 1 and 2, Dispatch follows a former superhero working a desk job and dispatching former villains to do good in Los Angeles. AdHoc Studios, composed of former Telltale Games members, keeps the spirit of its pedigree alive with a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-type dialogue choices and consequences. The game became <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1981416301709934652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the best-selling title</a> on Steam last week, though it was unknown just how much it sold. Now, we have an official number and it’s quite impressive.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1985470807804453077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from AdHoc Studios</a>, the team reveals that Dispatch has sold one million copies in ten days. With only four episodes out, the game technically isn’t fully out yet. Therefore, it’s a pretty impressive feat to sell as much, especially since the studio is new. </p>



<p>It isn’t too surprising to see Dispatch get as popular as it is. With a cast led by Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul and Telltale’s narrative sense, it struck a lot of notes for fans. Plus, even with four episodes, it’s already a hit with critics and fans. We at Insider Gaming reviewed the title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two episodes</a> and loved our time with it. With how things have been shaping up for Dispatch, we could see a surprise newcomer to the Game of the Year discussions right at the tail end of 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of Dispatch’s sales so far? Have you played it yet? If so, what do you think? Where does it rank for you for 2025?
