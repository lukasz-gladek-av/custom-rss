<p>As Highguard’s struggles continue amid collapsing player counts and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" id="175994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs at developer</a> Wildlight Entertainment, a new report has shed light on who was funding the game all these years.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a>, Chinese conglomerate Tencent was the “lead financial backer” of the studio. Specifically, it’s said that TiMi Studio Group is the main studio backing the game.</p>







<p>Up until now, the funders behind the game have been kept quiet. In past interviews, the studio has declined to comment on who was investing in the studio.</p>



<p>Totilo adds that neither Tencent nor Wildlight provided a comment on the matter by the time of publication. Insider Gaming has also reached out for comment, but has not received a response. </p>



<p>Highguard launched on January 26th to nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam. Since then the game has seen its playerbase fall to under 2,000 peak concurrents on the platform. It has also received mixed reviews. </p>
