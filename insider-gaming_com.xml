<p>Use these Roblox Survive Wave Z monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Scrap and much more.</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the classic multiplayer Call Of Duty game mode Zombies? If so, Survive Wave Z is going to be right up your alley, and you need to check out this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-ants-empire-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> wave defence experience immediately. As the name of the game suggests, players are tasked with defending and surviving against endless waves of enemies, with the end goal being to survive Wave Z, which is considered the last one. There is a wide variety of weapons and other items that the players can use in their mission to survive, but not all of them will be available for use at the start of the game.</p>







<p>As is the case with most games of this genre, unlocking powerful weapons required a massive amount of grinding, and for players who are new to the game, acquiring some of these can seem like a pipe dream. That’s where these codes can come to the players’ aid. They provide free rewards to the players, including key resources like Scrap, making it a key part of the game. Redeeming these codes will help players get ahead of the competition and progress through the levels faster than they otherwise would be able to.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-survive-wave-z-codes">Expired Survive Wave Z Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Survive Wave Z, as the game only came out quite recently. The one active code given above is the only one that has been released by the developers so far. However, with the game’s increasing popularity, new codes are likely on the horizon. As soon as any of the active codes expire, they will be moved to this section of the page.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Survive Wave Z code redemption page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Redeeming codes in Survive Wave Z is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes into the correct text box. There are no prerequisite steps, making it a very beginner-friendly process. For players who are new to the Roblox, however, here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Survive Wave Z.</li>



<li>Click on the settings button at the top of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the codes text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on the Submit button to claim your rewards.</li>
</ol>

<p>New Roblox game codes are often released by the developers through the game’s official Discord server, through the Roblox game page, or on their social media pages. However, tracking all of these regularly can be a hassle, and that’s where this article can be a lifesaver. We update this page with new codes as soon as they drop, so we recommend that all players bookmark this page to not miss out on any free rewards.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion has soared onto the scene, with the beat ’em up title boasting an impressive roster of characters, including several that are locked behind progression.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review-a-cosmic-blast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming review of Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, a ‘Great’ verdict of the game was issued, with the title attracting praise for providing chaotic gameplay in a good way, with a perfect balance of depth to keep players engaged, but not overwhelmed, in the vintage beat ’em up.</p>



<p>If you’re diving into Marvel Cosmic Invasion but want to know how to unlock a specific character, or are wondering who there is to choose from on the roster, this guide has all the crucial details.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-marvel-cosmic-invasion-characters-amp-how-to-unlock">All Marvel Cosmic Invasion Characters &amp; How to Unlock</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Locked. Image via Tribute Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 15 playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion, four of which are locked behind specific requirements in progression.</strong></p>



<p>The base roster in Marvel Cosmic Invasion is kind, with 11 characters unlocked by default, including fan-favorites like Captain America, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Rocket Raccoon.</p>



<p>However, Jean Grey/Phoenix, Venom, Phyla-Vell, and Silver Surfer must be unlocked by completing specified missions, which require exploring several areas of the game as split paths present themselves regularly. Due to this, you won’t be able to unlock all the characters immediately, and will have to backtrack at some points.</p>



<p>The challenge of unlocking the restricted characters is not difficult, however, as you only need to complete the specified levels, and don’t need to achieve any particular objectives, though this means potentially venturing out of your way to the four individual levels containing the locked characters.</p>



<p>The full list of playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion and how to unlock them is shown in the table below.</p>

<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 won every award imaginable when it came out, as did The Witcher 3 years before it. It makes sense that CD Projekt Red wants to create the most successful sequel possible, and acquiring one of BG3’s senior devs is a good way to do this.</p>



<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher if you want <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-dev-doesnt-know-how-to-top-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> to have any hopes of living up to the reputation of the third game. Cyberpunk 2077 battled to become a huge success in the end, but it required a lot of hard work. The Witcher 4 will be equally as difficult, but it can get off to a better start than CP 2077. One way to do that is by bringing in a Larian Studios artist.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-4-adds-baldur-s-gate-3-senior-cinematic-dev">The Witcher 4 Adds Baldur’s Gate 3 Senior Cinematic Dev</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Treasure what you have today, because it may be gone tomorrow. Credit to Larian Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Felix Pedulla worked at Larian Studios for six years, starting as a cinematic artist before becoming a senior cinematic artist.</p>







<p>They helped Baldur’s Gate 3 to become one of the most celebrated and successful game releases of the last few years. That journey recently came to an end when Pedulla announced a new career move on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fedulla_newjob-careergrowth-gamingindustry-activity-7401304661347172352-uP_M?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACUuJ-8BNA69V1_ApZijzm0QdBNPNFJlEnA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>“After an incredible and frankly wild six-year ride with the amazing team at Larian Studios, a new chapter begins. I’m so grateful for every chaotic, creative, and unforgettable moment we shared. We made some serious magic together, and I’ll forever cherish the lessons and memories. A huge thank you to all my incredible colleagues and friends I made.</p><p>As one adventure ends, another begins! I am absolutely thrilled to announce that I’m joining the legendary team at CD Projekt Red as a Senior Cinematic Designer! The opportunity to contribute to one of the most ambitious studios in the industry is a dream come true. Time to trade in my Baldur’s Gate dice for some Polish steel and get to work crafting some epic cutscenes.”</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>It was nice to see so many of the replies being Larian Studios devs, sad to see the artist go. Interestingly, this news comes only a handful of weeks after it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s lead gameplay designer</a> also joined CD Projekt Red. The team is obviously keen to recruit and house the best developers in the world to create one of the most anticipated RPGs of all time.</p>



<p>If you think The Witcher 4 will be an instant hit, there’s one place you can let everyone know: The free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite kicked off Chapter 7 in style with the Zero Point live event, marking the end of the last Chapter, attracting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-featured-over-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million players</a>, but social media was soon awash with claims that AI created some artwork and assets used in Chapter 7 Season 1, despite a lack of proof.</p>

<p>As posted by the likes of <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1995684089945620483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HypeX</a>, Fortnite artist Sean Dove revealed he was behind the Marty McFly Spray in the game that some have accused of being created by AI, showing his work on the image.</p>



<p>Dove explained the process of his work, particularly the background featuring clocks, where he “grabbed some clocks off image search, collaged them, and halftoned them.”</p>



<p>He admitted that “the numbers are bad” and that it was “entirely possible” he grabbed an AI clock when gathering images, but, nevertheless, the work was done by him.</p>



<p>Although this doesn’t quite end the AI debate surrounding Fortnite, as there are plenty of accusations revolving around other images found in the game, it does show evidence that one of the most prominent pieces of art, which is available as a Spray in the Battle Pass, is not AI-generated.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Epic Games regarding the accusations of AI artwork being used in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 and is waiting for a response.</p>
