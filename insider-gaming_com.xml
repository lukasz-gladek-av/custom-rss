            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ahead of its November 14th, 2025, release, Activision has put out the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launch trailer. Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-release-date-remains-unchanged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of an early release</a>, this all but confirms it’s sticking to its launch date with no early access.</p>



<p>As the next mainline entry, Black Ops 7 is putting a big emphasis on multiplayer. With a co-op campaign and 18 launch multiplayer maps, it’s honing in on what fans want. Despite returning to the futuristic settings of games past,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-not-have-jetpacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without jetpacks</a>, it’s still one of 2025’s biggest titles. Now, we have the launch trailer for the upcoming FPS that showcases just about everything it has to offer.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P1Z6CyfEjk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we see a lot of Black Ops 7, from its campaign to multiplayer and zombies. It does show off all of the game’s offerings through gameplay and cinematics. There’s some new footage like the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-standoff-meltdown-maps-season-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2</a>‘s Menendez and campaign locales, but it’s more or less the same. Still, it does state that Black Ops 7 is the biggest Black Ops game ever, which is a bold statement.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if it will live up to the sub-series’ pedigree, given how well-received Black Ops titles are. Some of Call of Duty’s best titles were from Black Ops, like 1 and 2. Even then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-trial-battlefield-6-redsec-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, which came out last year, was one of the more positively reviewed entries in years. As a fan of the series, I do hope Black Ops 7 lives up to the hype, even with the emphasis on multiplayer. We’ll know for sure as we head to November 14th.</p>

<p>With Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 set to release on November 14, Activision has confirmed the final PC specs that players will need for the best performance on their machine. </p>



<p>No matter what type of PC build you have, it’s important to note that both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-setup-tpm-secure-boot-2-0-black-ops-7-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot</a> will be required to play the game. Also, online Intel and AMD CPUs are supported. </p>



<p>If you plan on playing on a handheld PC, Activision says that Black Ops 7 will run on “most Windows-based handhelds”. It will also feature optimized visuals and “sharper text” for the smaller screens. There will also be “smart power and battery optimization”.</p>



<p>For full machine builds, check out the rest of the recommended and minimum PC specs below. It’s also worth noting that the storage specs below are for Black Ops 7. More storage will be needed to install Warzone.</p>
