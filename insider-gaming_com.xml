<p>Quantic Dream has just announced that Detroit: Become Human has surpassed 15 million units sold in 2026. </p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human was released back in 2018 and quickly gained popularity in the community thanks to its cinematic storytelling and decision-based gameplay. We were recently informed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/detroit-become-human-sold-one-million-copies-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 1 million copies in two weeks</a>, thanks to a massive Steam discount that was instrumental in reaching a new milestone. </p>







<h2 id="h-detroit-become-human-reaches-massive-sales-milestone-in-2026">Detroit: Become Human Reaches Massive Sales Milestone in 2026</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466707/detroit-become-human-sales-top-15-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>, a <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2026/01/08/detroit-become-human-surpasses-15-million-units-sold-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Quantic Dream reveals that Detroit: Become Human has sold 15 million units worldwide across PlayStation 4 and PC. The report shows that the game has been steadily hitting new milestones since 2020, with 5 million units in that year, reaching 11 million units in the next 5 years. 2025 was an excellent year for the game, as it sold 4 million more units, bringing total sales to 15 million by January 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-about-detroit-become-human">About Detroit: Become Human</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human takes place in 2038, where technology has advanced so much that human-like androids can be found worldwide. Players get to play as three of these androids, each of which has different moral dilemmas and obstacles to overcome. The game places a significant focus on player decisions, where your choices not only shape your characters’ journey but also impact the entire city of Detroit. The game features “thousands of choices and dozens of possible endings,” so no playthrough is exactly the same, as the most minute decisions can have a significant impact on how the story plays out. </p>

<p>ARC Raiders developers have revealed that they are implementing significant changes and new detection systems to tackle the ongoing cheating problem in the game. </p>



<p>In recent days, ARC Raiders has been accused of rampant cheating, with a popular streamer stating that the “egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worse than peak Call of Duty</a>.” The developers have now acknowledged the issue and outlined their plan to resolve it. </p>

Embark Studios first acknowledged the discussion around cheating in ARC Raiders and informed players that they are taking this issue “very seriously” and are acting on the players’ feedback. </p>



<p>The dev team will be “implementing significant changes” to ARC Raiders rulesets and will deploy “new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters” in the coming few weeks. The process will include updating their anti-cheat system to improve detection and enforcement of bans. </p>



<p>Additionally, the developers will implement “client-side” fixes that will target the ARC Raiders ‘out-of-map glitch, which has become a massive pain in the title. Furthermore, the developers will also be adding changes that will help streamers, including tools that will “help mitigate stream sniping”. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#943)—Clues and Answers for Friday, January 9]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-9-943/</link>
            <guid>1401313</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of another week, but before the weekend can land successfully, you need to complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Let’s keep that streak running and make 2026 your most profitable year in the puzzle challenge space! Below, I’ve outlined today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions, so you can get things wrapped up quickly.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #943:</p>



<ul>
<li>3 BALL</li>



<li>8 BALL</li>



<li>6 MAFIA</li>



<li>COUTH</li>



<li>CARDINAL</li>



<li>DEEP END</li>



<li>CHAINZ</li>



<li>FORTH</li>



<li>HEART EMOJI</li>



<li>LIMB</li>



<li>DIRECTION</li>



<li>LEST</li>



<li>SOLO CUP</li>



<li>THIN ICE</li>



<li>NON BLONDES</li>



<li>OAST</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Slang or casual terms for where you live.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Think about how something might sound.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>THands you might make at a card table.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Add “animal” after each</em> <em>word</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 9:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-9-943">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 9 (#943)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– 3 BALL, CARDINAL, HEART EMOJI, SOLO CUP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – 8 BALL, DEEP END, LIMB, THIN ICE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – 6 MAFIA, CHAINZ, DIRECTION, NON BLONDES</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COUTH, FORTH, LEST, OAST</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up? Fortnite January 9 Downtime, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-server-downtime-january-9/</link>
            <guid>1401304</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first Fortnite update of 2026 has arrived, bringing new content and changes to the game, resulting in the customary downtime, and this guide has all the details of when to expect servers to return.</p>



<p>After a packed schedule of Winterfest content, Fortnite still has plenty to offer during Chapter 6 Season 1, which won’t come to an end until early March, and the January 9 update has plenty to offer.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Fortnite downtime duration and what’s coming in the January 9 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers be Back up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Arrival. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite’s servers will be down for several hours for the January 9 update, and there’s no confirmed time for their return. However, previous downtime indicates how long the game will be unavailable.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, though the wait can be longer if any issues are discovered.</p>



<p>This means that servers should be back up after the January 9 update somewhere between 5 AM ET and 8 AM ET, so keep an eye on social media around these times to check if the servers are back online.</p>



<p>Once the servers are back online, make sure to have a look at the latest content on Insider Gaming for guides on all the major additions and tips to help you.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-january-9-update">What’s in the Fortnite January 9 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The biggest additions in the January 9 update in Fortnite are the launch of a major South Park collab, introducing new cosmetics in the Item Shop and in-game content.</strong></p>



<p>A free Mini Pass will be available during the South Park collab, along with a makeover to the Wonkeeland POI, which is transformed into Cartmanland, and the addition of the Stick of Truth Mythic item.</p>



<p>The January 9 update will also bring a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-south-park-collab-will-include-limited-time-five-player-playlist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new five-player limited-time game mode</a>, while removing Winterfest content from the game, and there will also be updates to other game modes, including Blitz and Reload.</p>



<p>Full patch notes and content reveals should be shared by Epic Games on the official Fortnite blog during the downtime.</p>

            <guid>1401232</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Towerborne, a Looter Brawler developed by Stoic and published by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/xbox-game-studios/">Xbox Games Studios</a>, is leaving early access and launching as a full game on February 26, 2026. In addition to the Xbox platforms the game is currently available on, including PC, it will also be available on PlayStation 5. Along with the full launch, many changes are coming as part of the reimagined launch experience update.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/towerborne-launches-february-26-with-massive-full-game-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Per Xbox,</a> one of the major changes that current players may not be happy with is the game moving from free-to-play to a fully paid model. The game will start at $24.99 for the standard release and $29.99 for the more premium deluxe edition. However, one benefit of the new model is that the game will shift from always being online to a title players can buy once and play offline.</p>







<h2 id="h-more-of-the-major-changes-coming-to-towerborne-1-0-in-february">More of the Major Changes Coming to Towerborne 1.0 in February</h2>



<p>In addition to the new paid release model, the game features multiple updates that enhance the player experience. For example, there’s an updated, complete story featuring a major antagonist, side quests, and an overhaul of the Bounty Board. There’s also a reworked difficulty system with a new Brutal difficulty for those seeking a truly challenging experience. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.towerborne.com/FAQ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Towerborne FAQ </a>states that players can continue their character progression from Early Access; however, it recommends starting over and playing the game from the beginning.</p>



<p>During an interview as part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA4J6ByZPR0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New Game+ Showcase</a>, game director Daniel McLaren and design director Shana Markham spoke about how important it was for them to listen to their player base and flesh out the story after it was originally intended for the narrative not to play a major role in the game and be more of a backdrop for the Looter Brawler experience.</p>
