            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-leak-new-images-deluxe-edition-upgrades-remastered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Minutes ago, images were uploaded and circulated on social media showcasing alleged shots of Oblivion ‘Remastered’ – <strong>not </strong>Oblivion ‘Remake’. In the images, we see side-by-side comparisons, which help to uncover how much of an evolution the game will be. The details that have appeared online also suggest a Deluxe Edition is on the way.</p>



<p>The game is still expected to be shadowdropped by Bethesda and Virtuous next week, after April 21. That claim was recently backed up by Jeff Grubb, who has reportedly heard from separate sources that we’re just days away from the Oblivion Remastered release.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-oblivion-remastered-not-remade">Oblivion Remastered, Not Remade</h2>



<p>In images that surfaced <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/#post-138553332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first on Resetera</a>, eagle-eyed gamers got a first glimpse at Oblivion Remastered. They were taken from a Virtuous website, which also let slip that the project has been in development as a collaboration between Virtuous and both Bethesda Dallas and Bethesda Rockville.</p>



<p>The site further noted that Oblivion Remastered will be released on PC, Xbox, <strong>and </strong>PlayStation 5. The latter platform was never part of the rumours, and it was believed that it would be coming <strong>only </strong>to Xbox and PC.</p>



<p>A further leak revealed cover art and an advertisement for the Deluxe Edition of Oblivion Remastered. In this special edition, players can get access to extra items, such as horse armour and exclusive weapons.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered images were just found in the Virtuous website files!</span></p></article></div>







<p>More images were later revealed on social media:</p>











<p>For several weeks, rumours have been circulating regarding the release of Oblivion Remastered, which has long been thought of as an Oblivion remake. These are the first images we’ve seen of the project, which should be in our hands or on our consoles within a week.</p>



<p>What do you think about Oblivion Remastered? Let me know in the comments if you’re going to pick a copy up.</p>

<p>A Schedule 1 player has discovered a new property in the game, and it seems like the perfect place for players to show off their wealth.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/schedule-1-new-property-discovered-for-future-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, a Schedule 1 player has discovered a brand new property within the game called The Manor. The upcoming property could be the biggest yet, sporting four bedrooms on the first floor and two large reception rooms on the ground floor. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jvy0d1/the_manor_will_be_purchasable_for_50000_in_a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a> also features a glitched image showing the price of The Manor, which is set at $50,000; however, this could change when it is released for the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-could-be-getting-the-ultimate-flex-property">Schedule 1 Could be Getting the ‘Ultimate Flex’ Property</h2>



<p>The Manor seems like the ultimate flex purchase for Schedule 1, perfect for letting the people know that your drug dealing escapades have led you to the creme de la creme of society, and you are finally earning the big bucks. The price of the Manor is the same as the game’s current most expensive property, The Warehouse. Many players are hoping that this property’s price will increase to at least $100,000 when it arrives, which will make it more of a challenge.</p>



<p>Schedule 1’s The Manor property is also the most scenic property in the game right now. It is essentially a large mansion built on top of a hill. It looks over one of the game’s regions and has forest cover. It is an excellent location for the players to relax while their drug-dealing operation runs rampant across different regions. However, players should know that the developer hasn’t officially confirmed the new property.</p>

<p>Barely two weeks after A Minecraft Movie was released, a sequel was demanded by the rabid fanbase. It honors the franchise and brings Minecraft to life in ways never thought possible, and if a sequel does happen, you’d have to think it would be as big a smash hit.</p>



<p>Jack Black, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jason-momoa-promotes-minecraft-movie-by-saying-he-doesnt-let-his-kids-play-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Momoa</a>, and co. had the difficult task of bringing to life one of the most successful franchises of all time. Minecraft has earned billions from game sales, merchandise, and much more. But A Minecraft Movie is a different beast. It hasn’t disappointed moviegoers who helped the movie earn over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$300 million in its first weekend</a>.</p>



<p>Its success has grown daily, fueling speculation of a successor. We’ve got the latest on a new movie, and whether this is becoming a fully fledged film franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-minecraft-movie-2-sequel-status-explained">Will There Be A Minecraft Movie 2? Sequel Status Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I feel for you, buddy. Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to an interview, plans for A Minecraft Movie sequel are “imminent.”</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/warner-bros-mike-de-luca-pam-abdy-courage-in-face-of-brutal-press-coverage-1236366618/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> interviewed Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy from Warner Bros. about the future of A Minecraft Movie and the potential for a sequel. When queried about the plans for a Minecraft sequel, De Luca had this to say: <strong>“Imminently. The ink might not be dry on the deals yet, but imminently.”</strong></p>



<p>This comes days after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film’s director, Jared Hess, said</a>: “He would have a blast doing the sequel.” He said there were many ideas and concepts they couldn’t fit into this film, so it makes for a sequel to follow and to include a lot more of the source material that didn’t make the cut the first time around.</p>



<p>An imminent sequel is hardly a surprise given the overwhelming success of A Minecraft Movie.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-a-minecraft-movie-2-sequel-be-about">What Could A Minecraft Movie 2 Sequel be About?</h2>



<p><strong>There are still many new characters, enemies, and ideas that could be introduced in A Minecraft Movie 2 Sequel, but the end of the original film gives away some big details.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Spoiler Alert—I’m about to briefly discuss what happens after the credits roll in A Minecraft Movie. You have been warned.</strong></p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-minecraft-movie-runtime-explained-does-it-have-a-post-credits-scene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-credits cutscene to prolong its runtime</a>. In it, Steve turns up at a house with the hope of going into the attic. We find out the house belongs to a person named Alex—who Minecraft fans will instantly recognize.</p>



<p>We don’t know if this is a mini one-off for Alex or if they could feature heavily in a sequel. We’ll have to wait and see!</p>

<p>We hope you’re enjoying A Minecraft Movie, and listening to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disclaimer about not throwing popcorn</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/most-gamestop-stores-will-have-100-switch-2-units-at-launch-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1164477/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/most-gamestop-stores-will-have-100-switch-2-units-at-launch-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new claim, most GameStop stores expect to have abundant Nintendo Switch 2 console units at launch.</p>



<p>The new claim comes from Nintendeal on <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1911810754099249648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-nsw2-united-states-preorder-stock-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), stating that according to their sources, most GameStop stores are expecting “100 Switch 2 consoles available at launch.” However, games and accessories will be “extremely limited.” Players have questioned whether 100 units are an ample amount to meet the demand, to which the source <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1911811154672029943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a>, “100 consoles at launch in each store is…. a lot more than basically any console launch ever.”</p>



<p>Along with Nintendo Switch 2 units at GameStop, players wondered if Best Buy would have a similar amount of stock. Nintendeal <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1911811597091377666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> that they have not heard anything from Best Buy sources; however, “the general consensus is that the console itself will not be difficult to acquire.”</p>



<p>Ever since it was announced, players have wondered about the supply of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. Nintendo also recently delayed pre-orders in the US “to assess the potential impact” of the tariffs. However, if the source is accurate, it seems the company will be well prepared for the console’s launch. Nintendo will use a pre-order invite system on My Nintendo Store for the Switch 2, and the invites will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-invites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begin rolling out next month</a>. </p>



<p>In other news, a recent report stated that Switch 2s manufactured in China could be subject to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-manufactured-in-china-reportedly-subject-to-145-us-tariff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">145% US Import Tariffs</a>. Also, ‘Breath of the Wild’ and its upcoming DLC cost&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 on the upcoming console</a>.

<p>The PS6 Portable claims have been updated with more information, clarifying that the handheld will be able to run PS5 games with a scaled-down experience. </p>



<h2 id="h-ps6-portable-can-run-ps5-games-at-a-lower-resolution-and-frame-rate">PS6 Portable Can Run PS5 Games At a Lower Resolution and Frame Rate</h2>



<p>Yesterday, information about a next-gen PlayStation 6 (PS6) Portable surfaced online, with KeplerL2 claiming that the portable version of the upcoming console <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be as powerful</a> as the PS5 and the handheld features “a 15w SoC on 3nm.” Today, the user has clarified on <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-5#post-270323192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NeoGaf</a> (via r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jzjjef/kepler_clarifies_that_the_portable_ps6_can/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>) that the PS6 Portable “can definitely run PS5 games, just not at the same resolution/FPS, mainly due to lower memory bandwidth.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-ps6-portable-probably-falls-between-xbox-series-s-and-ps5">PS6 Portable Probably Falls Between Xbox Series S and PS5</h2>



<p>KeplerL2 has also provided context about where the PS6 Portable would stand against the current-gen consoles. The leaker thinks that in terms of performance, “it’s somewhere between the XSS (Xbox Series S) and PS5.” However, they clarified that it’s hard to know for sure as it’s “using an unreleased GPU uarch.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>KeplerL2 also spoke about the regular PS6 SoC, explaining that it differs from the portable SoC and “[Redacted] is specially designed to run at very low voltages”. KeplerL2 added that the portable PS6 chip has “a lot less than 40” CUs (compute units).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Readers should note that this information doesn’t come from official Sony channels, so take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sony is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-to-increase-ps5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasing the price</a> of the PS5 in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/a-minecraft-movie-runtime-explained-does-it-have-a-post-credits-scene/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been a long time coming, but A Minecraft Movie has finally creeped up on 2025 and delivered the goods. It’s raking in hundreds of millions of dollars, and if you’re looking to see it yourself, we can tell you how long it is and if you need to stick around for a post-credits scene.</p>



<p>Video game movies and TV are as popular as they’ve ever been. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-2-viewership-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> has captivated TV audiences, whereas animated blockbusters like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Mario. Bros Movie</a> has lit up the silver screen. It’s the turn of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-minecraft-movies-cast-in-the-game-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Minecraft Movie</a>, and the big-screen adaptation of the block-building bonanza.</p>



<p>Depending on what you read and who you trust, Minecraft is the <strong>first or second-best-selling game in history</strong>—putting a lot of pressure on the movie’s shoulders. It’s doing well, and despite people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">throwing popcorn at every screening</a>, it bodes well for a sequel. Here are the crucial details if you need to see A Minecraft Movie first.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-minecraft-movie">How Long is A Minecraft Movie?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t say it… Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A Minecraft Movie has an official runtime of 101 minutes.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve ever been to the theater yourself, you know you won’t be in your seat for 101 minutes. This means the official runtime of <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/a-minecraft-movie-out-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Minecraft Movie</a> from the opening stills to the final frame of the credits is approximately 101 minutes (or 6,060 seconds).</p>



<p>However, factor in eating your popcorn before the film starts, a few minutes waiting for the lights to go down, sitting through adverts and a few helpings of new movie trailers, and the overall experience is probably closer to <strong>120 minutes / 2 hours</strong> or a bit longer.</p>



<p>Let’s see if a post-credits scene accounts for the movie’s minutes.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-a-minecraft-movie-have-a-post-credits-cutscene-no-spoilers">Does A Minecraft Movie Have a Post-Credits Cutscene? (No spoilers)</h2>



<p><strong>There is a post-credits scene in A Minecraft Movie, meaning you should stick around until the very end.</strong></p>



<p>Now, I’m not going to disclose the nature of the scene. It’s a nice bit of fan service for Minecraft lovers. But I will say the scene lasts <strong>roughly 25 seconds</strong>, so you don’t need to hang around for too long once it begins.</p>



<p>It could have potential implications for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored sequel</a>, so I’d say it’s worth watching. Plus, it doesn’t hurt to give everyone involved in the production the credit they deserve!</p>
