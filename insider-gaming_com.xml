            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In major breaking news on Friday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has announced that Micorosft Gaming CEO and head of Xbox Phil Spencer is retiring from the company. </p>



<p>In addition, Xbox President Sarah Bond has resigned.</p>







<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Spencer’s retirement will be effective as of Monday, February 23.  He leaves after spending 38 years with the company.</p>



<p><strong>“I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership,”</strong> Nadella said via email to Microsoft and Xbox staff. <strong>“Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms.”</strong></p>







<p>Spencer, in his memo to staff, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-retiring-from-xbox-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said that he made</a> it known last year that he was <strong>“thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.”</strong></p>



<p>Taking over as head of gaming for Microsoft is Asha Sharma. Sharma had previously been the head of CoreAI at Microsoft after joining the company in 2024. Matt Booty, who will remain with Xbox, is moving up to chief content officer.</p>



<p>In his first message to Xbox staff, Sharma said that they won’t flood the market with “soulless AI slop”.</p>



<p><strong>“To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love,” </strong>he wrote. <strong>“But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Roy Lee, the producer of the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bioshock/" id="1100">BioShock </a>movie, has provided an update on the forthcoming Netflix film and hopes that it will tie into an upcoming game release.</p>



<p>The announcement of Netflix taking on a BioShock adaptation first came in 2022. 4 years later, there is an explanation for why the project has been dormant and when things could actually start progressing toward production.</p>







<h2 id="h-other-projects-took-precedence-over-bioshock">Other Projects Took Precedence Over BioShock</h2>



<p><a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with Collider’s</a> Steve Weintraub, Lee stated that production would have begun sooner, but other projects, including The Long Walk and a Hunger Games prequel, got in the way. However, he says the project could tentatively be next up for him, and that both Netflix and Take-Two are hopeful the movie will come out and tie into a future game release.</p>



<p>“I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bioshock-4/" id="702">fourth BioShock game</a> was announced in 2019. Last year, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick promised the game would release.</p>



<p>Lee didn’t want to fully commit to a date for when production could begin. Still, he says he’s hopeful things will get started in 2027.</p>



<p>“I know that the intent is to hopefully get in production next year,” he said.</p>







<h2>Video Game Adaptations Are Plentiful on Streaming Platforms</h2>



<p>Netflix saw success with video game series related to Sonic the Hedgehog, Tomb Raider, Castlevania, Devil May Cry, and more. Over on Amazon Prime Video, the Fallout television series has been successful. They are currently working on a God of War series, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ryan-hurst-comments-on-playing-kratos-in-prime-videos-god-of-war/" id="170361">with Ryan Hurst tapped to play Kratos.</a></p>



<p>Netflix is also the exclusive streaming partner of the upcoming Legend of Zelda film, following its theatrical release next year.
