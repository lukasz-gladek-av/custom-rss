<p>Years of waiting for Hollow Knight: Silksong are finally coming to a close with a release date announced, which may have alarmed those unsure of what platforms the title will release on, but we have all the details.</p>



<p>Set to land on September 4, our hands-on preview with Hollow Knight: Silksong showed it was well worth the wait, with years of development paying off.</p>



<p>With a release now on the horizon, here are all the details you need on the platforms that Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-ps5">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on PS5?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PlayStation 5 at launch.</strong></p>



<p>Silksong has one of the widest releases in recent years, touching almost every platform imaginable, and PS5 is set to take an important role. This is despite the fact that a lot of the marketing attention has been from Microsoft and Nintendo, which may have confused you into thinking it was platform-exclusive for the pair.</p>



<p>That isn’t the case, however, and Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PS5.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on Xbox Series X|S, with Microsoft having played a big role in marketing for the title.</strong></p>



<p>Not only will Silksong be available on the platform, but those with an active <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass subscription will be able to play Hollow Knight: Silksong on release</a> without paying an additional fee—perhaps giving Xbox an edge over other titles.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-pc">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PC through various storefronts, so you can choose your favorite.</strong></p>



<p>Those with a PC Game Pass subscription will be able to play Hollow Knight: Silksong for no additional fee through the Xbox App, and you can add the title to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> launcher through this service, if you’d prefer.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-nintendo-switch">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on both the original Nintendo Switch console and Nintendo Switch 2 at launch.</strong></p>



<p>In fact, the Nintendo family of consoles will be the first to receive physical editions early in 2026, for those who want to add to their physical games library, before later releasing a physical version of Hollow Knight: Silksong on other platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-ps4-and-xbox-one">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on PS4 and Xbox One?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PS4 and Xbox One, meaning those yet to upgrade to current-gen consoles won’t miss out.</strong></p>



<p>Though it may come as a surprise that a huge title like Hollow Knight: Silksong is releasing on last-gen platforms, remember that the game has been in development for seven years. Therefore, development would have begun on these consoles before switching over to new-gen models.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is one of the most anticipated launches of all time, and the long wait is finally coming to a close. Here, we’ve got all the Xbox Game Pass details for the title.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4 </a>release date has been announced, bringing an end to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">years of waiting</a>, and our hands-on preview showed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong is well worth the wait</a>.</p>



<p>If you want to know whether the title will be available with a Game Pass subscription, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Ready? Image via Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription immediately when it launches on September 4.</strong></p>



<p>Available on both Xbox Series X|S and PC, Hollow Knight: Silksong will undoubtedly be one of the biggest highlights in the Game Pass catalog in September, following on from an already impressive Wave 2 in August.</p>



<p>As it’s available at launch, it’s expected that Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on the Game Pass service indefinitely, although precise details have not been stated. Any departures are announced well in advance, however, so it shouldn’t spring up a surprise if it does get removed.</p>



<p>For now though, you won’t have to worry about splashing out to gain access to Silksong.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Gamer Celebrates 15,000th Platinum Trophy]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-gamer-celebrates-15000-platinum-trophies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-gamer-celebrates-15-000th-platinum-trophy.1279416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I like to consider myself an avid gamer, and then I come across someone like ‘timpurnat’, who has just celebrated unlocking his 15,000th <strong>Platinum Trophy </strong>on the PlayStation Network. I don’t even dwindle in comparison; I’m a mere speck in timpurnat’s overwhelming universe of completion.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, timpurnat, self-proclaimed Trophy Hunter, revealed that he’d 100% completed 15,000 PlayStation games, hitting level 999 on PSN and securing a total of 387,000 individual Trophies in his bid to become the most completed PlayStation gamer in the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-one-from-top">One From Top</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/timpurnat/levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN Profiles</a>, timpurnat sits in second place behind dav1d_123, <strong>but not by much</strong>. The number-one PlayStation gamer has 21,228,060 points on the platform with 15,489 Platinum Trophies, while timpurnat is in second place with 20,422,230 points and 15,020 Platinum Trophies.</p>



<p>Dav1d_123 boasts a <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/447928-most-playstation-platinum-trophies-won" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Guinness World Record</a> for the most verified Platinum Trophies, which he received in December 2023.</p>



<p>In timpurnat’s fight for the top spot, the gamer has completed 16,300 games with a completion rate of 99.23%, and has earned an average of 112.2 Trophies <strong>every day</strong>.</p>



<p>I don’t think I unlock 112.2 PlayStation Trophies <strong>a month</strong>.</p>



<p>These attributes have landed timpurnat with the number-one rank in his country, and the number-two rank <strong>in the world</strong>.</p>



<p>On social media, timpurnat can frequently be seen discussing his Platinum awards in sequence, offering a tidbit about the games that he uses to climb further up the leaderboard. Most recently, he wrote about his 14,929th Platinum, unlocked for Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nice music and easy platinum, I was surprised to see they made this one so much easier than previous entries. Even if you fail a song, you’re still progressing towards the platinum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Timpurnat’s efforts enabled him to move up the charts on PSN Profiles, overtaking the gamer now in third place, ginko765.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-preview-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-duckov-preview-i-plucked-this-beak-biting-eggstraction-shooter-and-it%E2%80%99s-no-yolk.1279377/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’d told me that one of the gems of my Gamescom experience would be a parody extraction shooter themed around <strong>birds</strong>, I’d probably have believed you, because I <strong>gel </strong>with games like Escape from Duckov. This title wins points for the name alone, but there’s <strong>a surprising </strong>amount of meat on this bird, even if it has a few glaring and somewhat fowl flaws.</p>



<p>I promise I’ll stop the bird-related puns now.</p>



<p>Join me and we’ll take flight (sorry) with a full Escape from Duckov preview, pecking away (sorry) at the layers of this developing game that might just hatch (sorry) into something beautiful.</p>



<h2 id="h-extreme-bird-bashing-action">Extreme Bird Bashing Action</h2>



<p>Following my week at Gamescom, I sat down with a demo of Escape from Duckov and took a deep dive into everything this satirical extraction shooter has to offer. What I wasn’t expecting was a thoroughly enjoyable game that’s a little rough around the edges but stacked with hilarious potential.</p>



<p>In Escape from Duckov, you control <strong>a bird</strong>. When you start playing the game, you’re able to customise your bird, opting to pick a pre-designed all-yellow chick or create something utterly bizarre. The sliders give you full freedom to flex your imagination, and the resulting build can see you becoming <strong>a walking beak</strong>.</p>



<p>I mean…</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>When you’re ready to go, you’re plunged into the world of Escape from Duckov, which is, of course, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-revealed-game-is-not-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently received a full release date</a> after eight years in beta.</p>



<p>In Escape from Duckov, you follow a simple gameplay loop:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enter the world</li>



<li>Loot, shoot, and survive</li>



<li>Extract again</li>



<li>Rinse and repeat</li>
</ul>



<p>As you explore the small, cartoony, and charming maps, you’ll find a vast variety of items that you can use to build stations and creature comforts in your hideout, sell to traders, or use to complete quests. There are stacks of side missions to complete, which are represented by a relatively diverse selection of objectives.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="It’s a perfect day for an adventure! | ESCAPE FROM DUCKOV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-VqL4FBFrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I was genuinely surprised by how <strong>violent </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-competitor-duckov-new-trailer/">Escape from Duckov</a> is. Taking a bat or a gun and attacking enemies (dogs and other birds) results in an explosion of blood and gore, which dissipates to reveal something that resembles a cooked chicken on a plate, which is the ‘loot box’ of defeated enemies.</p>



<p>If you die at any point, the typical extraction shooter formula kicks in and you’re booted back to your hideout, which in this case is a bunker. You’ll have lost everything you took with you and picked up, but you’ve got a chance to run back to where you died and collect your dropped gear.</p>



<h2 id="h-similarities-run-deep">Similarities Run Deep</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Duckov is a carbon copy of Escape from Tarkov in <strong>many ways</strong>. First, there’s the name – that’s pretty obvious. As I played, I noticed themes, iconography, mechanics, and even <strong>map names </strong>that mimicked Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>The opening map is named Ground Zero, which is one of the ‘starter maps’ in Escape from Tarkov. Many of the weapons, such as the PM Pistol, AKS74, and TOZ shotgun, are mainstays in Escape from Tarkov, and Duckov players escape their raid by finding a green flare and standing in a zone for a few seconds, which is <strong>identical </strong>to most Tarkov extractions.</p>



<p>Even the trader, stash, and mission systems are reminiscent of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Because of all this, it’s impossible to take Escape from Duckov seriously, no matter how entertaining the gameplay loop is or how genuinely satisfying the combat is.</p>



<p>There are differences, of course.</p>



<p>Escape from Duckov utilizes a ‘top-down’ kind of perspective, while Tarkov is a first-person shooter. Duckov also has a ‘fog of war’ mechanic on higher difficulty levels, which means you can only see in the direction your character is facing. On that note, it’s important to stress that Duckov has several difficulty tiers to suit the individual playing the game.</p>



<p>Also, Escape from Duckov is (for now) entirely single-player.</p>



<h2 id="h-imperfection">Imperfection</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Duckov shines in some areas, such as the charming visual palette, the combat mechanics, and the customization elements, plus you get to run around with a puppy dog companion, which is fantastic. The hideout building system shows great promise, and there are plenty of tasks to complete, even at a demo level.</p>



<p>I also know that expansions, including new maps, are already planned.</p>



<p>However, the demo was riddled with issues related to the UI, menus, and accessibility elements like subtitles. Many tasks and conversations had their subtitles replaced with placeholder text, which is pretty tough considering the game isn’t voiced. The difficulty balancing is also a little skewed at times.</p>



<p>There are a few elements in Escape from Duckov that don’t make much sense. For instance, you can find teleportation points around the map that shoot you across the way to another site for no real reason. I’m sure there’s <strong>something </strong>in there to explain why these exist, but I’ve not noticed anything yet.</p>



<p>I can’t see anyone sinking more than a few hours into Escape from Duckov, but it would do much better if it had PvP features woven into it. Perhaps that’s a deliverable further down the line after basic considerations like subtitles and a clean UI.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Blood of Dawnwalker PREVIEW: Witcher-Coded But Laced with Stunning Vampirism]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-preview-witcher-coded-vampirism/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blood-of-dawnwalker-preview-witcher-coded-but-laced-with-stunning-vampirism.1279344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I was ushered into a replication of Svartrau Cathedral at Gamescom and sat down before a screen to experience half an hour of live gameplay from The Blood of Dawnwalker. This vampiric debut title from Rebel Wolves has sat firmly on my radar since the studio was opened, and I was beyond excited to finally see it unfold before my eyes.</p>



<p>In a guided segment, I saw combat, exploration, puzzle-solving, and cinematic sequences unravel, with the Rebel Wolves team showcasing as much of The Blood of Dawnwalker as possible in a relatively short window.</p>



<p>Here’s my full preview based on that presentation.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-will-rival-the-witcher">The Blood of Dawnwalker Will Rival The Witcher</h2>



<p>Rebel Wolves took me deep into a reimagination of 14th-century Europe, complete with Gothic architecture aplenty, dark and foreboding streets, and mythical themes of monsters lurking in the shadows. I quickly learned that our hero, Coen, is one of those monsters, cursed with vampiric powers and a bloodthirsty mission to save his family before a ticking clock runs out.</p>



<p>The demo started some ways into the game, with Coen already boasting many upgrades and being around a third through his ‘time limit’ to rescue his family before the worst could happen.</p>



<p>Instantly, I could see how ‘Witcher-coded’ The Blood of Dawnwalker is. This game comes from Rebel Wolves, an all-new studio made up of a mix of talent, much of which has worked extensively on CDPR’s The Witcher franchise in recent years.</p>



<p>It was almost inevitable, but much of the UI, the combat mechanics, menus, and even music are deeply reminiscent of The Witcher. That’s not a bad thing, but it <strong>might </strong>harm Dawnwalker down the line when it’s trying to stand apart from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-witcher-4-trailer-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games like The Witcher 4</a>.</p>



<p>I can honestly say that, if nothing else, Dawnwalker will be <strong>a strong rival </strong>to The Witcher. The hybrid action-RPG flow of the game promotes skill paths and brutal combat sequences unfolding in real-time, and the addition of vampirism only makes the game more visceral and visually incredible.</p>



<p>As I watched the Blood of Dawnwalker preview, I saw Coen walk up walls as though they were floors, dart between rooftops as a cloud of smoke, and dispatch enemies with gnashing teeth and slashing claws. This is his <strong>night form</strong>, and it’s remarkable to behold.</p>



<p>In the daytime, Coen is much more human and relies more readily on swords, daggers, and traditional approaches to navigate the game’s open world environment.</p>



<p>I was pleased to note that very few bugs were present in the demo, despite Rebel Wolves offering a disclaimer warning us of the possibility. I noticed <strong>one </strong>issue, and that was when Coen chopped off an enemy’s head, and it proceeded to float away like a balloon.</p>



<h2 id="h-coen-is-already-memorable">Coen is Already Memorable</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>I found myself pulled in by Coen’s story, aided by the reiteration of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-first-trailer-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cinematic trailer</a> that was used to unveil Rebel Wolves’ The Blood of Dawnwalker in the first place. I’ve always been a fan of vampire-themed tales, and Blood of Dawnwalker hits the nail on the head in that respect.</p>



<p>As the minutes ticked by, I watched a Rebel Wolves representative explore Svartrau, hunting for a powerful sword that would be a key tool in the fight against the vampiric overlords who had claimed Coen’s family. The journey took me from a gorgeous and thriving cityscape to catacombs and tombs beneath the bustling streets.</p>



<p>I was informed that while players have a ‘time limit’, Rebel Wolves have cleverly employed control tactics to make sure users can still enjoy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-devs-quality-not-quantity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything on offer in Blood of Dawnwalker</a>. The clock will only tick down when certain tasks are completed, and you can see ahead of time how much a certain action will cost you. It’s a very transparent system, and I like it already.</p>



<p>As the Blood of Dawnwalker preview came to an end, I watched a tense boss fight unfold, with Coen battling Mihai, a long-forgotten soul trapped by betrayers hundreds of years before. He uses similar techniques to Coen, which makes the fight a relatively matched battle.</p>



<p>This is where we learn more about the Dawnwalker lore, understanding how important a character Coen is and how unique his condition is to the world around him.</p>



<p>I can already promise you that Blood of Dawnwalker is now one of my most highly anticipated titles. It might remind everyone who plays it of The Witcher, but in many ways, it’s doing certain things <strong>better </strong>than CDPR, and both Dawnwalker and The Witcher 4 can exist happily in the same space.</p>



<p>Blood of Dawnwalker is slated for release in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p>

<p>Are you hunting for Roblox Steal a Brainrot codes?</p>



<p>Steal a Brainrot is the most popular game on Roblox right now, tying in terms of player record with Grow a Garden. In Steal a Brainrot, players do exactly that – <strong>they steal Brainrots</strong>. If you’re enjoying this insanely popular game and are hunting for all Steal a Brainrot codes and rewards that are active <strong>now</strong>, look no further than this guide.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve captured every Steal a Brainrot code so you can unlock all the key benefits and rewards in a matter of seconds. If you’ve been trying to figure out how to use Steal a Brainrot codes, I’ve covered that too.</p>



<p>Read on to see all the latest Steal a Brainrot codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-steal-a-brainrot-code-in-roblox-august-2025">Every Steal a Brainrot Code in Roblox (August 2025)</h2>



<p><strong>It might sound bizarre, but there are no Steal a Brainrot codes in August 2025</strong>. Since the game was released, the developer ‘Brazilian Spyder’ has neglected to provide a function for redeeming any reward codes in Steal a Brainrot.</p>



<p>The only way you can unlock Brainrots in this game is to steal them from other players, which is the core gameplay loop of Steal a Brainrot.</p>



<h3 id="h-will-steal-a-brainrot-ever-have-rewards">Will Steal a Brainrot Ever Have Rewards?</h3>



<p>It’s a good question, and I’d like to say for sure one way or another, but it’s entirely up to the developer.</p>



<p>Grow a Garden, one of the most popular games ever introduced to the Roblox platform, has <strong>plenty of codes </strong>for players to activate and soak up, but Steal a Brainrot just doesn’t follow suit. There are no codes in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/109983668079237/Steal-a-Brainrot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steal a Brainrot</a>, nor is there any way to redeem them.</p>



<p><strong>Yet.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-secrets-in-steal-a-brainrot">How to Get Secrets in Steal a Brainrot</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As there are no Steal a Brainrot codes, you’re restricted to two methods when it comes to getting secret characters in Steal a Brainrot:</p>



<ul>
<li>Purchasing them using earned cash</li>



<li>Stealing them from other players</li>
</ul>



<p>Most players follow a ‘server jump’ tactic to enter a server, scan for valuable secrets, and then steal them when the owners aren’t looking. If there are no valuable secrets on a given server, players just complete a jump to another one.</p>



<p>If you’re going hard on stealing Brainrots from other players, you’ll need to buy gear to help you trap them.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you can try using a private server combined with a conveyor belt to hopefully roll a valuable secret character.</p>



<h3 id="h-most-valuable-secret-brainrots-in-steal-a-brainrot">Most Valuable Secret Brainrots in Steal a Brainrot</h3>



<p>Here are some of the most valuable secret characters in Steal a Brainrot. Be aware that the values might have changed since this guide was published:</p>



<ul>
<li>Garama and Madundung (10 Billion)</li>



<li>Nuclearo Dinossauro (2.5 Billion)</li>



<li>La Grande Combinasion (1 Billion)</li>



<li>Chicleteira Bicicleteira (750 Million)</li>
</ul>



<p>Let me know below or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what your most valuable Brainrot is.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-steal-a-brainrot-rewards">Where to Find Steal a Brainrot Rewards</h2>



<p>The best way to find Steal a Brainrot codes is to keep this page bookmarked and check back regularly. Failing that, you can join the Brazilian Spyder Discord server for the game and hope that the developers announce the addition of a Steal a Brainrot codes function in Roblox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tens of millions of players have flocked to Roblox this weekend to participate in a special, limited-time event backed by the two biggest games in the Roblox ecosystem. Grow a Garden, joined by the more recently successful Steal a Brainrot, have linked forces in an ‘Admin War’ event that pushed Roblox’s concurrent player count to <strong>47 MILLION+</strong>.</p>



<p>This shatters the previous record set in June, originally spearheaded by <strong>just </strong>Grow a Garden. Steal a Brainrot is the latest monumental success in the Roblox space, and it continues to soar.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-admin-war-in-roblox">What is the Admin War in Roblox?</h2>



<p>On social media, Jandel (<em>Grow a Garden</em>) and SpyderSammy (<em>Steal a Brainrot</em>) have been engaged in a digital beef to promote an Admin War event in Roblox. This event has propelled Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot to the top of the charts and the history books alike, with more than <strong>30 million concurrent players </strong>enjoying these two games alone.</p>



<p>This has now cemented Roblox as boasting the record for the highest CCU in gaming history.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365329529675882496/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on LinkedIn</a>, Roblox Strategist James Purell noted that the recent PR issues that have set Roblox alight are doing nothing to slow the platform’s growth:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>Now Roblox is officially the largest gaming platform by concurrent users and also holds the record for highest CCU game in the world.</p><p>While Roblox corporate deals with PR issues, developers like Jandel and Sammy are building experiences that millions of kids can’t stop playing. They’re the ones pushing the platform forward with innovation and community building.</p><p>Yes, Roblox 100% needs to do better on safety, but these developers are creating the content that keeps 47M people engaged. They’re the real engine behind the numbers – not Roblox corporate.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>In a similar sentiment, Atlas Creative’s CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaelherriger_roblox-hit-47-million-concurrent-users-this-activity-7365080265284567040-tD_J/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Michael Herriger</a>, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The future of gaming is happening right in front of us. Great job to all the devs and for Roblox for propping up great games.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>No game on the market can come close to Roblox right now, which is <strong>technically </strong>more of an ecosystem than a single title. It’s unfair to refer to Roblox as ‘a game’ when it’s the most diverse UGC-backed universe in the industry.</p>



<p>Those taking part in the Admin War between Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot are picking their side and soaking up the special event before the weekend is up and things return to normal.</p>



<p>Which side did you pick in the war between Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
