<p>Activision has lifted the lid on a massive Call of Duty: Warzone tournament circuit dubbed ‘Resurgence Series’. The new ecosystem boasts a massive prize pool worth $1.2 million and will unfold through 2026, culminating in a Championship event at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>This is set to replace the World Series of Warzone, throwing players into the small-form, fast-paced maps, as opposed to the larger, traditional battle royale experiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-has-a-new-esports-circuit">Warzone Has a New Esports Circuit</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://callofduty.worldseriesofwarzone.com/resurgence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent release</a>, Activision detailed the all-new Resurgence Series, a grand event set to turn around some gamers’ fortunes in 2026. It starts with online qualifiers that begin on February 9th, which will feed players into the first LAN event at DreamHack Birmingham in late March in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>Following that event, a second qualifying stage starts, this time with players competing at DreamHack Atlanta in May. From these two LAN events, a selection of teams will qualify for the Esports World Cup <strong>directly</strong>. Another 22 spots will remain open for the Esports World Cup Qualifiers, set to be hosted in June ahead of the ultimate tournament in July in Riyadh.</p>



<p>The prize pool will be split accordingly:</p>



<ul>
<li>DreamHack Birmingham: $100,000</li>



<li>DreamHack Atlanta: $100,000</li>



<li>Esports World Cup: $1,000,000</li>
</ul>



<p>This is a trios-based tournament that uses the traditional kill race format, with players earning points for kills and getting boosted multipliers for higher finishes during each round.</p>



<p>For a while, fans have been sceptical about the future of Warzone’s esports ecosystem. It has been rocky for a couple of years now, but this new diverse approach that has spawned more LAN events at some of the biggest showcases in the business has pro players enthused.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#957)—Clues and Answers for Friday, January 23]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-23-957/</link>
            <guid>1413970</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Welcome to the end of another long week, and the introduction of a fresh round of NYT Connections hints and solutions. Today’s puzzle is a tough one, but that’s why I’m here to help you out. Before we roll into the weekend, let’s see if we can keep your streak running for a little while longer.</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions in just a few seconds.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-23">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 23)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #957:</p>



<ul>
<li>STONE</li>



<li>TEMPLE</li>



<li>PILOT</li>



<li>LIP</li>



<li>STREET</li>



<li>CHEEK</li>



<li>FOOT</li>



<li>TRAFFIC</li>



<li>EYE</li>



<li>ACRE</li>



<li>FLOOD</li>



<li>METER</li>



<li>GARAGE</li>



<li>LIME</li>



<li>BUSHEL</li>



<li>VALET</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about parts of the face you’d point to during a game of “Simon Says.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Different ways you might leave your car depending on the situation</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> Old‑school measurements still used in certain countries.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each one forms a common compound phrase when placed before the word <em>light</em>.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 23:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-23-957">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 23 (#957)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHEEK, EYE, LIP, TEMPLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – GARAGE, METER, STREET, VALET</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ACRE, BUSHEL, FOOT, STONE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FLOOD, LIME, PILOT, TRAFFIC</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Playground Games Explains Fable’s New Reputation-Based Morality]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-explains-fables-new-reputation-based-morality/</link>
            <guid>1413880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The morality system in the Fable reboot sets out to reflect our own world.</p>



<p>Playground Games’ reboot of the Fable franchise was the centerpiece of the Xbox Developer_Direct on January 22, 2026. In the wake of that presentation, Playground’s founder, Ralph Fulton, spoke with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/fable-interview-overview-details-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a> about the game’s direction.</p>







<h2 id="h-morality-is-a-sliding-scale-in-fable">Morality Is a Sliding Scale in Fable</h2>



<p>When discussing upgrading the classic morality system for the modern era, Fulton explains that the team wanted the way people view morality in everyday life to be reflected in the game’s system.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>How we think about morality in the world today has really informed how we wanted to represent it as a game system in this game. That’s to say: there is no objective good, there is no objective evil. Really it’s just about people’s subjective opinions and what they choose to value in someone else when they make that judgment.</p>



<p>So, as you saw in Developer_Direct, our version of morality isn’t a sliding scale – we’ve chosen to anchor this around the actions you do, and specifically the things you do in Albion that are witnessed by at least one other person. So, if the things you do are seen by one or more people, you’ll start to earn a reputation for that thing. Obviously, we always use the chicken kicking example, because kicking chickens is classic Fable.</p>



<p>So if a person sees you kicking a chicken, you will start to get a reputation as a ‘Chicken Chaser’ – and if enough people see you do it, or you do it a lot, that reputation will become one of the things you’re known for in that settlement. And people will react to you based on what they think about that particular reputation.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Fable is slated to launch in the autumn of 2026. For the first time ever, it is headed to PlayStation 5 in addition to its release on Xbox platforms.</p>



<p>One thing that will be missing from this reboot is dog companions. Learn why Ralph Fulton made the decision to cut that feature in the upcoming game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/theres-no-dog-companion-in-new-fable-and-even-devs-are-upset/">here</a>. </p>



<p>However, don’t worry, the team worked very hard to preserve the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-founder-on-preserving-fables-true-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">true spirit and Britishness.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wildgate developer Moonshoot is the latest video game developer to confirm layoffs, as announced by its parent company, Dreamhaven. </p>



<p>The undisclosed number of layoffs comes after the sci-fi shooter struggled in the month following its July 2025 release. </p>







<h2 id="h-dreamhaven-is-hopeful-they-will-find-a-way-to-support-moonshot-in-the-long-term">Dreamhaven Is Hopeful They Will Find a Way to Support Moonshot in the Long Term</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Moonshot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a statement made to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/moonshot-games-making-layoffs-after-wildgate-struggles-to-become-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Dreamhaven stated that despite Wildgate launching on the Epic Games Store at the start of 2026 and seeing a boost in playership, Dreamhaven was forced to make a difficult decision in an effort to ensure it could continue updating the game and work on ways to support the studio long-term. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Despite the increase in player numbers and overall positive reception, it wasn’t enough to sustain the size of our development team. So we made the difficult decision to reduce team roles to ensure we can continue delivering updates to the game while working in a way that supports the studio in the long term. We remain focused on Wildgate’s next content update, which introduces more quality of life improvements, including the highly-requested progression system, which we anticipate coming later this quarter.” </p>
</blockquote>







<p>Dreamhaven also had to make cutbacks in September 2025; at that time, they largely affected the publishing team. A month earlier, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhavens-wildgate-has-struggled-with-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it was reported</a> that the game had only sold $130,000 unit; now, it is free to play on the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, layoffs in the gaming industry are common right now. Ubisoft recently announced a massive restructuring. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>No, there is no dog companion in the upcoming Fable reboot. Yes, there are those in the development team who are upset about it as well.</p>



<p>In Fable 2 and Fable 3, one of the player-favorite features of the game was the dog companion. However, the series is now being rebooted by Playground Games, and unfortunately there’s no dog companion. There will be horses, though.</p>







<h2 id="h-playground-founder-explains-why-he-nixed-dog-companions-in-fable">Playground founder explains why he nixed dog companions in Fable</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with IGN, </a>Ralph Fulton of Playground Games noted that he was the one who made the decision to cut the dog companions, he cited “development reasons” as the cause, and noted that there were members of his team that have yet to forgive him for making the decision.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I did know I was going to get this question. And do you know what? There are some folks on the team that were relishing me getting this question because I cut it a while back. You know what? For development reasons, right? I don’t need to go into any more detail than that, except to say there are a substantial number of people on the team who have yet to forgive me for that decision.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Despite the lack of a canine by your side, Fable will retain the freedom and Britishness of the original series. Learn more about the origins of the reboot at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playground-games-founder-on-preserving-fables-true-spirit/">this link.</a></p>

<p>Playground Games’ Ralph Fulton spoke about the origins of Fable’s return and ensuring the game kept the core spirit of the original series, which debuted a quarter of a century ago.</p>



<p>Fable has returned for the first time since 2018 and is set to release its first mainline game in the franchise in over a decade since Fable 3 in 2010. With Playground Games currently at the helm of the franchise, Fulton can now reflect on how the success of Forza Horizon 3 and the desire to grow as Developers sowed the seeds for Fable’s return. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with IGN, </a>Fulton expanded on what he thinks led to this opportunity for the team of developers.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that as a developer, you should always be trying to challenge yourself and expand your skill set. So, that’s where the idea came from. And obviously because we’d been working with Xbox for really since our inception as Playground Games, we had great relationships with them. We knew a lot of people there. The obvious first conversation for us was with them where we said, “Hey, look, we’re looking to build a second team. We want to work in a new genre.” We felt like the transferable skills that we had from the Horizon games were an open world. We had learned a lot about building open worlds technically in terms of streaming, in terms of game design and game flow and all that good stuff. And in lots of ways that are maybe surprisingly car-agnostic. There’s a ton of things about Horizon games that are about the cars, but there’s a ton of principles that we’d learned there, which we felt were transferable. And I don’t remember who said the word Fable first, but as soon as I heard it, I was like, “That has to be it. That fits so perfectly.” It’s a series that we adored here and still do.</p>

<h2 id="h-playground-wanted-to-make-sure-fable-maintained-its-core-elements-including-its-britishness">Playground Wanted to Make Sure Fable Maintained Its Core Elements, Including Its Britishness</h2>



<p>When rebooting such a beloved franchise from the ground up, the team at Playground wanted to ensure certain core elements remained intact. Ralph Fulton says the three pillars of Fable games they landed on were “Freedom,” “Fairytale,” and “Britishness.” For developers, these three pillars formed the core of Fable’s DNA.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We actually wrap that up into the word “freedom” because it’s about the freedom to choose, the freedom to make the choices and then have to live with the consequences of your choices. It’s the freedom to go where you want, do what you want, be the hero you want to be. And that right there is at the heart of our game. We want you to be the hero you want to be. So, freedom is absolutely central to it.</p>



<p>We landed on two other tonal pillars, I think. And the first is fairytale. And we actually inherited this from Lionhead. We had this treasure trove of documents which had been in storage, that came originally from Lionhead. And one of them had this incredibly neat little bit of direction, which was Fable is a fairytale, not fantasy, which I just think is brilliant, incredibly incisive and speaks to really tonally what Fable is…</p>



<p>Finally, it’s about Britishness. And again, why was it important to Xbox that a British studio continued with Fable? Because Fable is this quintessentially British game, and not just because Albion is medieval Britain through a filter, if you like. And not just because the characters are British and have British accents. There’s a sensibility to the games, there’s a tone of voice, a way of thinking about things, a way of reacting to things. It’s very British. And those things combined are for us the DNA of Fable. If you don’t hit those things, if you’re not true to those things, you’re not making a Fable game. So, that was something that we decided right at the start.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, Fable has the freedom to release on PlayStation, and the game will be coming to PlayStation 5 on the same day it’s released on Xbox platforms.
