<p>It was recently claimed that a slew of characters from popular franchises were heading to Fortnite, which isn’t by any means a reach for the game. The list featured the likes of Agent 47, Mortal Kombat fighters, Jack Black, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 characters.</p>



<p>The latter title was a bit out of left field, as aside from having a successful launch in February, there’s no real reason why Fortnite would accommodate characters from the medieval RPG epic.</p>



<p>I caught up with one of the game’s actors and tuned into the Warhorse team on socials to see this claim debunked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-henry-of-tilted-towers">Henry of Tilted Towers</h2>



<p>We recently reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-characters-list-leaked/">on a claim that aired</a> during an episode of the XboxEra Podcast. During a brief segment, ShpeshalNick claimed that a string of characters is coming to Fortnite, some more bizarre than others. Amongst the list sat ‘Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’ characters.</p>



<p>I leapt straight over to catch up with Luke Dale, the talent behind Hans Capon in KCDII, and he was none the wiser about the leak. He suggested that KCDII’s publisher might <span>b</span>e <strong>making moves </strong>without anyone knowing, but the team at Warhorse Studios, KCDII’s developer, echoed the sentiment:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The claim hasn’t been corroborated by any of the ‘typical’ Fortnite leakers and insiders, so for now, I’d advise taking this with a pinch of salt. The folks at Warhorse might be trying to subvert our expectations by playing it down, or they could genuinely have no idea what this claim is taking about.</p>



<p>It’s not unheard of for a popular franchise or release to make it into Fortnite <strong>just because </strong>it’s successful, but out of the entire list provided by ShpeshalNick, Kingdom Come just stands out as being too out of left field.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/666-players-can-buy-doom-on-a-limited-edition-box-that-plays-doom/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 Edition from Limited Run Games could be the best yet. It’s become a running joke over the years to see what DOOM can run on. Now, it literally runs in a box, and only 666 people have the chance to secure this incredible bundle.</p>



<p>I’ve seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-can-run-the-original-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM played in Fortnite</a>, on fridges and calculators, and I’m sure someone’s probably got it to work on a pencil at this point. DOOM is considered the father of first-person shooters (shout out to Wolfenstein too), and its impact is still being felt in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s not just old DOOM games either. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM The Dark Ages</a> is one of the biggest games of 2025. But if you can’t wait, you might need to fight off Imps, Cacodemons, and people if you want to secure Limited Run Games’ DOOM Will It Run Edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-limited-edition-doom-will-it-run-is-very-limited">Limited-Edition DOOM “Will It Run?” is Very Limited</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You get so much cool stuff. Credit to Limited Run Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Limited Run Games is doing a special DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 collection of the two original games lumped together in one physical package. It’s great for collectors and people who want to buy DOOM again for the umpteenth time.</p>



<p>If you want more, the Big Box Edition comes with Cassette Tapes and Trading Cards. But you’re here for the big gun, and the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/doom-doom-ii-will-it-run-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Will It Run Edition</a> comes inside a giant box in the style of an old-school DOOM door.</p>



<p><strong>It’s $666.66 and is limited to the first 666 people who buy it!</strong></p>



<p>This demonic deal includes the following content:</p>



<ul>
<li>DOOM + DOOM II Game*</li>



<li>Box that Plays DOOM</li>



<li>Two Piece Big Box</li>



<li>Cassette Tape Soundtrack Set with Slipcase
<ul>
<li>Includes Base Soundtrack and full IDFKR Soundtrack&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Floating Cacodemon – on Magnetic Base
<ul>
<li>3’ Cacodemon with 5’ Base</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Handheld Cacodemon – Plays DOOM</li>



<li>Trading Card Pack includes five random cards</li>



<li>Certificate of Authenticity&nbsp;</li>



<li><em>*PC Edition includes Digital Steam Code</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The “Box that Plays DOOM” is easily the best feature. It’s tongue-in-cheek, it’s a remarkable piece of memorabilia in its own right, and it is a must-have for hardened DOOM fans.</p>

<p>According to a new report, Nintendo Switch 2 units manufactured in China will face a 145% US import tariff.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2s-from-china-could-face-145-us-tariff">Nintendo Switch 2s From China Could Face 145% US Tariff</h2>



<p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/China-made-Nintendo-Switch-2-in-line-for-145-tariff-hit-supplier-warns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Asia</a> (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jywikr/chinamade_nintendo_switch_2_in_line_for_145/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zukhov-74</a>) reports that the Nintendo Switch 2 and other game consoles manufactured in China will fall victim to “the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.” They recently reviewed an “internal assessment memo” from a “major Apple and Nintendo supplier,” and things don’t seem bright for Nintendo’s upcoming console.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memo states that game consoles manufactured in China will still face the 145% US import tariff for goods made in China. This means the Nintendo Switch 2s from China are “in line for a massive hit.” This could be one reason why the company decided to delay pre-orders, as it wanted to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assess the potential impact</a>” of the tariffs on the US market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report adds that a significant chunk of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles “are made in China” and a “relatively small proportion made in Vietnam.” Hence, it will be hard for the company to manoeuvre through such circumstances. This might also explain why pre-orders for the upcoming console have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed in Canada</a> at the last minute.&nbsp;However, there’s no official word from Nintendo at the moment.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order invites will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-invites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begin rolling out next month</a>. Also, ‘Breath of the Wild’ and its upcoming DLC cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 on the upcoming console</a>.
