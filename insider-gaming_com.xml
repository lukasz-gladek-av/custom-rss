<p>Call of Duty’s pro scene isn’t in a good place. From lengthy gaps between stages to Black Ops 6 being in a pit thanks to cheaters, the Call of Duty League isn’t all that appealing right now. That’s a huge sticking point for both fans and pro players, most of whom rely on COD’s competitive ecosystem to make a living.</p>



<p>To support the floundering esports scene, Vegas Falcons, which entered the CDL this season, has stood up a Respawn 8s tournament with a sizeable cash prize to keep the content flowing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-falcons-on-top">Falcons on Top</h2>



<p>Despite being at the bottom of the CDL standings, the Vegas Falcons are trying their darndest to help the scene out as much as possible. One of the biggest issues in the Call of Duty esports ecosystem is the lack of content. Outside of the CDL, there’s not much to watch, leaving the scene’s brands and creators to organise tournaments and events.</p>



<p>And the less said about Warzone, the better. It’s in a shocker of a spot right now.</p>



<p>Today, the Vegas Falcons revealed a $10,000 Respawn 8s tournament, set to run from today through the weekend (17 – 26 Jan). On <a href="https://x.com/VegasFalcons/status/1880057467968934354" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the organisation wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Introducing the Vegas Falcons Ladder</p>



<p>A pick-up game initiative designed to bring together the best talent to fight for $10,000 over 10 days. </p>



<p>Who will be crowned king ahead of Major I?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Major I is the most highly anticipated event of the CDL season thus far. It’s taking place in Madrid between January 30 and February 2, marking the first EU Major in Call of Duty League history. After that, things return stateside for Major II, which will take place in Texas, and then Major III, set to surface in Florida in April.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s fair that organisations have to scrape together to arrange events just to keep the fans switched on? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Riot Games announced today that the company will be launching “in-game fundraisers” in VALORANT and League of Legends to support relief for the wildfires affecting the city of Los Angeles. <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/la-wildfire-fundraiser" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot says</a> the fundraisers will go live next week, and are part of several initiatives that the company has undertaken to aid the city it’s based in.</p>



<p>The wildfires in Los Angeles started earlier this month, destroying hundreds of homes and doing billions in damage.</p>

<p>Beginning January 22nd, the latest EX.O skin collection in VALORANT will be converted to a Give Back Bundle. Proceeds from the bundle items will go directly to the <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/who-we-are/social-impact/social-impact-fund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games Social Impact Fund</a>. VALORANT has featured a Give Back Bundle, featuring fan-voted skins from other collections, every year since the game’s release. In previous iterations, 50 percent of skin proceeds and 100 percent of accessory proceeds are sent to the Fund. The EX.O bundle will leave the store on January 30th.</p>



<p>Additionally, League of Legends is un-vaulting Firefighter Tristana on January 23rd until February 5th. Firefighter Tristana was originally released back in 2010, and is one of the rarer skins that League fans have wanted to get their hands on.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At the beginning of today’s VALORANT Champions Tour Americas broadcast, Head of VALORANT Esports Leo Faria addressed the wildfires. He implored fans to donate to the California Fire Foundation and the International Medical Corps.</p>



<p>Since the wildfires began tearing up the city, Riot has provided temporary housing and stipends to displaced employees, donated meals, and even provided a backup generator to a local fire station that had lost power. The developer says it is “in this for the long-term and will support both the immediate response and years-long recovery efforts in Southern California.”</p>
