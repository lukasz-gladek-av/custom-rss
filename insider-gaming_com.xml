<p>It’s 2025, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is about to be released for what feels like the millionth time. Skyrim is available on just about every platform in the world at this point, even the Amazon Echo to an extent, but now you can add another format to the list.</p>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-skyrim-against-call-of-duty-2011/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> is an exceptional RPG. Yes, Bethesda, everyone knows how proud you are of the game and its legacy. It’s at a point now where Skyrim has been ported to every device in the world, making it beyond being a meme at this point. One key platform is missing, and Skyrim is about to be released on it.</p>

<p>PlayStation has just confirmed that players will receive a new look at Saros at The Game Awards 2025 on December 11. </p>



<p>Saros is the next sci-fi shooter from the hands of Housemarque, the team responsible for bringing us games like Returnal, Nex Machina, Matterfall, and more. They provided players with a look at the title’s gameplay during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September’s State of Play event</a> and have now confirmed a new look at the title for TGA. </p>







<h2 id="h-saros-pre-order-announcement-expected-at-the-game-awards">Saros Pre-Order Announcement Expected at The Game Awards</h2>



<p>PlayStation confirmed Saros’s presence at The Game Awards 2025 through a new post on their <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1998407291754729536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post says that players will receive a “new look” for the title, but doesn’t explain what that means. We could receive a new gameplay trailer or a trailer focusing on the narrative bit as well. Some players are also speculating that pre-orders will open that day, as the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-has-been-rated-in-taiwan-pre-orders-expected-imminently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated in Taiwan</a> recently. </p>



<p>Saros is an entirely new IP from Housemarqye which focuses on a “haunting story of a lost off-world colony on Carcosa under an ominous eclipse.” The key difference between Saros and Returnal gameplay is the presence of permanent resources and progression, which makes every death valuable. Which means that even though the world will change after each death, players can come back stronger with the ability to choose and permanently upgrade their loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit parts.</p>







<p>In other news, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider title</a> will be revealed at The Game Awards, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> will appear at the event as well.
