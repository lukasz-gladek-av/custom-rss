<p>The CEO of Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that no generative AI is used in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="114633">Grand Theft Auto 6.</a></p>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/strauss-zelnick-generative-ai-has-zero-part-in-what-rockstar-games-is-building-with-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick discussed his take on generative AI, stating that while he is personally enthusiastic about the technology and its practical uses in terms of saving time and money, he does not believe these tools can create great entertainment on their own and affirms that there is no generative AI usage in the upcoming release in the Grand Theft Auto franchise. </p>



<p>He would go so far as to say that GenAI has no part in what Rockstar is building and that the worlds are handcrafted.</p>



<p>“Specifically with regards to GTA 6, Generative AI has zero part in what Rockstar Games is building. Their worlds are handcrafted. That’s what differentiates them,” he said.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-will-have-a-physical-release">GTA 6 Will Have a Physical Release</h2>



<p>In debunking a rumor, Take-Two confirmed in its quarterly earnings report that Grand Theft Auto 6 will have a physical release. Also, marketing is slated to begin this summer. The game remains on track for release on November 19, despite several delays.</p>







<p>Generative AI is on the rise in gaming. PlayStation recently announced plans to use the technology to create podcasts featuring video game characters. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-gen-ai-fake-podcast-playstation-characters/">here</a>.</p>

<p>An update on when the next Xbox console could come home to players.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_axi0nsx93A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During AMD’s Q4 2025 earnings call</a>, CEO Dr. Lisa Su provided an update on the potential launch window for the next-generation Xbox. Su stated, “Development of Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC [system-on-a-chip] is progressing well to support a launch in 2027.”</p>



<p>The potential launch timing was mentioned during a discussion of AMD’s semi-custom chip business, which includes video game consoles. She said annual revenue from that segment is expected to decline in 2026 by a “significant double-digit percentage.”</p>







<h2 id="h-the-relationship-between-amd-and-xbox-explained">The Relationship Between AMD and Xbox Explained</h2>



<p>In 2025, Microsoft announced that it was working with AMD on its next-generation console. This is all part of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-comments-partnership-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multi-year partnership. </a></p>



<p>At that time, Su stated that AMD would go above and beyond by building custom chips for Xbox Hardware and planned to create a “full roadmap of gaming optimized chips, combining the power of Ryzen and Radeon for consoles, handhelds, PCs, and the cloud.”</p>







<p>In other AMD news, the company is raising the price of its graphics cards to offset rising memory costs. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The next PlayStation console is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be launching in 202</a>7.
