<p>Saints Row 1 Director has stated that he has been asked to create a pitch for a prequel instalment to the series, and it will not be a VR game. </p>



<p>The 2022 Saints Row reboot didn’t go down well with anyone, as most of the charm of the game was lost in this new version. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saints-row-2022-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly generated $1.7 million</a> before Volition closed down, but it failed to meet fan expectations due to its lackluster narrative and shift in tone. However, it seems that all is not lost for the Saints Row franchise, as a new game is currently being pitched. </p>



<h2 id="h-saints-row-1-director-is-going-back-to-his-roots-with-the-prequel">Saints Row 1 Director is Going Back to His Roots With the Prequel</h2>



<p>The revelation about a Saints Row prequel pitch comes from the design director of the first title, Chris Stockman, latest post on the r/SaintsRow <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/ive_been_asked_to_a_create_a_pitch_for_a_saints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/saints-row-1s-director-is-pitching-a-prequel-that-gets-back-to-the-roots-of-what-made-sr-1-entertaining-but-i-mostly-want-to-know-what-became-of-the-saints-row-2-pc-patch-whose-developer-died/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>). Titled, “I’ve been asked to create a pitch for a Saints Row prequel!” Stockman’s post says he has hopeful news for the fans, as he has been approached “to create a pitch for a Saints Row reboot.” He is unable to share any more information right now, but his “dreams for this game just became a little more than just dreams.” </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Moreover, Stockman also stated that the prequel will not be a VR title, and he is returning to his roots. Sotckman added that he has a “very clear vision” for the prequel as he was the director of the first game. He also indulged in other conversations with players, explaining his vision for the title. </p>



<p>Stockman stated, “The core idea of Saints Row ’77 is to go back to the roots of what made SR 1 entertaining in the first place. It was somewhat grounded in reality but also a bit zany too. It had a lot more satirical elements vs. the later entries.” He added, or maybe they could “start in the 90s, then go 80s, then go 70s! Bookmark this reply. *wink wink*.” Whatever this ends up being, fans definitely seem excited about a prequel instalment to the series. </p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is launching on November 14, 2025, as previously announced; there will be no early access for the title. </p>



<p>A few days ago, there was speculation that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s campaign and Zombies modes would arrive a bit earlier than the multiplayer mode, based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-zombies-release-early-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-load dates</a>. There were also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumours</a> about the game’s release being preponed by a week. However, all of these rumours about playing Black Ops 7 early have been debunked by Activision. </p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-no-early-access-everyone-start-playing-on-november-14">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Has No Early Access, Everyone Start Playing on November 14</h2>



<p>Reliable Call of Duty news source CharlieINTEL debunked the game’s early access rumors through a recent post on their official <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1985132037498433755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post states that Black Ops 7 releases on Friday, November 14. “There is no early access. There is no change to the release date.” An Activision representative confirmed these details to CharlieINTEL, so this should clear up all the confusion that players had. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on Friday, November 14. There is no early access.

<p>For those wondering, Black Ops 7 will feature a co-op campaign mode at launch, where players will be able to visit a variety of different environments, “from the neon-lit rooftops of Japan to the Mediterranean coast.” Coming to the multiplayer mode, players can start their BO7 journey with 16 6v6 maps and two 20v20 maps at launch. Lastly, round-based Zombies returns with the upcoming title as players descend into the heart of the Dark Aether. </p>

<p>Sentinels have announced they are exiting Marvel Rivals Esports, though the door has been left open for a return in the future.</p>



<p>The team competed in the inaugural Marvel Rivals Ignite mid-season finals in China, but, as preparations start to prepare for the end-of-season Ignite tournament, expected to take place next month, Sentinels announced they are exiting the competition.</p>



<h2 id="h-sentinels-leaving-marvel-rivals-esports">Sentinels Leaving Marvel Rivals Esports</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Departure. Image via Sentinels</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/senrivals/status/1985492677669110241?s=46&amp;t=SjOb542MOiUY8kbKILY2Og" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Sentinels stated they were “pausing” operations in Marvel Rivals, but they would “revisit the decision” if NetEase were to roll out a program with team incentives.</p>



<p>It’s added that all players in the team are “now free to explore new opportunities,” with those who were on the team now available to sign for another organisation.</p>



<p>The stance from Sentinels aligns with what the organisation’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sentinels-ceo-says-marvel-rivals-team-bundles-are-critical-for-esports-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CEO Rob Moore told Insider Gaming</a> at the Marvel Rivals Ignite mid-season finals, where he described the introduction of purchasable team bundles as “critical” for the future of the title in the Esports scene.</p>



<p>NetEase is yet to announce any decision regarding bundles, though <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1953474966185214111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esports Tournament lead Adam H</a>uang did state that skin bundles could be added in the future, which could contribute to the prize pools of the grand finals.</p>



<p>Similar incentives are commonplace across other Esports, helping to establish the economics of the scene, and it remains to be seen whether NetEase will introduce a similar stance.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase for comment on the Sentinels exit from the Esports scene and whether team incentives are being planned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best ARC Raiders Maps for Quests and Items]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-maps-quests-items/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-arc-raiders-maps-for-quests-and-items.1342912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a pretty challenging game when it comes to finding quest items and locations. It doesn’t <strong>entirely </strong>hold your hand and requires you to explore a little to get to the objectives you need to resolve the game’s many tasks. With that being said, there are a few ARC Raiders maps and resources you can rely on to get the fastest route possible to what you need.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll help you figure out what the best sites are for ARC Raiders maps.</p>



<h2 id="h-find-quest-objectives-in-arc-raiders-with-ease">Find Quest Objectives in ARC Raiders with Ease</h2>



<p>When it comes to playing extraction shooters, you’ll often need to rely on maps and wiki pages to track down what you need. It’s an inherently tricky genre that wants players to go the extra mile, rather than relying on map markers and guide lines to find where they need to go.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders might be more accessible and have maps and a more detailed UI, but the quest objectives are sometimes tough to find, as all Embark Studios has offered is a <strong>clue</strong> or two.</p>



<p>That in mind, here are two of the best resources for ARC Raiders maps:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://mapgenie.io/arc-raiders">MapGenie</a></strong></li>



<li><strong><a href="https://metaforge.app/arc-raiders/map">MetaForge</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These maps are brilliant, as they’re adjustable and modular, meaning you can apply filters to select exactly what you’re looking for in ARC Raiders, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARC locations</li>



<li>Containers</li>



<li>Nature resources</li>



<li>Events</li>



<li>Biomes</li>



<li>Supply Stations</li>



<li>Field Debots</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-easiest-map-in-arc-raiders">What’s The Easiest Map in ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p>By definition and rating, the easiest map to learn in ARC Raiders is Dam Battlegrounds. It’s a relatively open map with a lower difficulty ranking, except for when night falls and it becomes much more treacherous. It’s also the first map that players can explore after completing the opening sequence of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Buried City is the next easiest map to learn, but the tight-knit streets and densely-packed buildings make PvP a challenge, as you never know where enemies might be lurking. There are a few observation points higher up that players can use to scan the map with a powerful rifle, so you’ll need to keep your eyes open when on this map.</p>



<p>The Blue Gate is the hardest map by the game’s rating, but it’s not <strong>that </strong>bad. It’s so open that your chances of running into other players are slimmer, and it has plenty of verticality, meaning you can jump deep into tunnels to escape pursuing ARC enemies.</p>



<p>I think Spaceport is the toughest map, mainly because of the way it’s built. It’s a sprawling thing that’s heavily occupied by ARC forces, and the central Launch Tower area serves as a hub that players rush to at the start of the match, but to get to it, you need to cross an immense amount of open ground without cover.</p>



<p>Any budding snipers can pick off their kills with ease.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been suggested in the latest round of Fortnite leaks that a <strong>movie theme </strong>might be front and centre when Chapter 7 lands next month. On social media, a famed leaker posted images claiming that Kill Bill is coming to Fortnite via a collaboration, and eagle-eyed users noticed Epic teasing the ‘Hollywood sign’ in a new trailer for Chapter 7.</p>



<p>That, in addition to recent claims that both Harry Potter and SpongeBob Squarepants crossovers are coming, is enough for fans to believe that the next Chapter will be focused on film and television.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-a-huge-leap">Not a Huge Leap</h2>



<p>It’s not a vast leap to assume that Fortnite’s Chapter 7 will be focused on film and television, based on the latest leaks.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Shiina, one of the most reliable Fortnite leakers, revealed references to Kill Bill that had been discovered by two other users.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Others have noticed further references, such as the coordinates to the <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1985358100870963419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollywood sign</a> being found in a recent teaser trailer for Chapter 7, and the presence of a ‘Nevada’ theme that includes both a <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1984705463112384643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">casino and Area 51 POI</a>.</p>



<p>In the most recent leaks, it was suggested that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpongeBob Squarepants</a> are headed to Fortnite in future collaborations. All this is poised to follow the current period of the immensely popular battle royale game, which features classic television icons, The Simpsons.</p>



<p>This is all lined up as the latest in a <strong>very </strong>long line of pop culture collaborations that have swollen the skins and bundles repository in Epic Games’ free-to-play shooter over several expansive years.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/solo-queen-arc-raiders-someone-did-it/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-has-solo%E2%80%99d-the-queen-in-arc-raiders%E2%80%94but-it-took-a-while.1342888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a feat that everyone deemed impossible, a content creator has managed to solo a Queen in ARC Raiders. The hulking mech is the most dominant and terrifying enemy in the game right now, and up until this point, it was believed that it was <strong>not possible </strong>to take it down as a solo player.</p>



<p>To put it into perspective, during an earlier testing session, the Queen was killed 58 times out of <strong>four million raids</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-solo-the-queen-in-arc-raiders">How to Solo the Queen in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>In a short clip uploaded to social media, JGOD revealed the closing moments of a <strong>20-minute battle </strong>with the Queen on Dam in ARC Raiders. In the comments under the video, JGOD revealed that he used a variety of locations, some of which could be considered ‘cheesing’ the boss character, but remaining dynamic was key to defeating the fearsome enemy.</p>



<p>JGOD suggested taking a good Hullcracker into the fight and running in with ‘around 200’ shots for it. The rifle that he used went from 125 durability to under <strong>20 </strong>as the fight progressed. Any longer, and his weapon might have broken entirely. He didn’t <strong>count</strong>, but he said that he fired ‘about 180’ because he ‘missed a bunch as well’.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another user suggested taking in a stack of Wolfpack grenades to whittle down the Queen’s HP pool, which sits at around 30,000 points.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is becoming famous for having some of the most entertaining AI enemies to fight, and that naturally includes the gargantuan Queen. In this PvPvE extraction shooter, the ARC enemies represent something dynamic, unpredictable, and adaptable, which is much more enjoyable than the cannon fodder NPCs seen in some extraction shooters.</p>
