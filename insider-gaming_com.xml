            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/old-cod-veteran-keeps-up-with-new-talent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve been playing Call of Duty since 2004 – <em>Finest Hour </em>was where it began for me. In 2009, I started playing Call of Duty multiplayer, falling head over heels in love with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and swearing up and down that I was the next best COD player in the world. Since then, I’ve at least dabbled in every Call of Duty game ever made.</p>



<p>It’s a different landscape now. There is no space for the casual gamer in Call of Duty, and Black Ops 6 can be <strong>punishing </strong>at times for someone with creaky thumbs and reflexes akin to that of a geriatric sloth.</p>



<p>With that being said, this is how I, a ‘Call of Duty veteran’, try desperately to keep up with the new blood flooding what was once my favourite shooter franchise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-set-it-up-right">Set It Up Right</h2>



<p>For starters, I play on a PC that gives me the best visual advantage possible, and my frame rate is often unparalleled. It’s like a comfort blanket – if I have the FPS soaring, I feel like I’m microseconds ahead of the competition, and in a reflex shooter like Call of Duty, that could mean the difference between a win and a loss.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>I use a bog-standard Dualshock 4 controller, equipped with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-kontrol-freeks-worth-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a set of Kontrol Freeks</a> for added accuracy (I swear it works), but I have spent years honing a <em>twist </em>to my controller layout. I use Bumper Jumper Tactical, which means I can try my best to use the age-old tactics of ‘jumpshotting’ and ‘dropshotting’ without needing one of those newfangled Scuf controllers that all the kids have.</p>



<p>It’s a game-changer, and I think I must have been using Bumper Jumper Tactical for at least five years straight in Call of Duty.</p>



<p>I’ve got the option to use my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powera-ops-v3-pro-review-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerA OPS V3</a> with all the bells and whistles, but I’m just so used to the Dualshock 4.</p>



<p>If I ever try to use a keyboard and mouse (which isn’t often), I try to rely on some of the best esports equipment I can lay my hands on, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g915-x-lightspeed-tkl-review-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Logitech G915 TKL</a>.</p>



<p>From there, having a solid headset is also one of the most important plays in Call of Duty. If your setup is lacking a headset, you’re not going to be good at Call of Duty, whether you’re a grizzled veteran or a complete newcomer. To that end, I make use of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-a50-wireless-headset-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro A50 Gen 5</a> which helps my aging ears pinpoint the pounding footsteps of an approaching enemy with relative ease.</p>



<p>Internet, too. If you’re relying on old-school copper wire broadband, you’re at a disadvantage. Old folks like us might not need super-fast internet for much else, but for gaining an edge in Call of Duty, it’s a <strong>must</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-tips-for-getting-good-at-black-ops-6">Top Tips For Getting Good at Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Not everyone can be good at Call of Duty, that’s just the bare truth of it. For every cracked player, there are nine bang average gamers, and I fall into that latter camp. Fortunately, there are a few things that you can do to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-black-ops-6-controller-settings-aiming-combat-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boost your Black Ops 6 skillset</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Learn the Maps</strong></p>



<p>Practice makes perfect, and only looping the same maps over and again will result in you knowing routes, grenade spots, and rotations for objectives.</p>



<p><strong>Find Your Mode</strong></p>



<p>If you don’t like Search and Destroy, <strong>don’t play Search and Destroy</strong>. It might be one of the best game modes in Black Ops 6 for XP, but it’ll grind you down to a nub. I tend to rely on Kill Confirmed with the Strategist specialist to maximise XP gains.</p>



<p><strong>Get the Gear</strong></p>



<p>Watch videos online and study pro players on social media to pick up the best weapon builds. Everyone claims to have the best build, but they’re mostly the same with one or two tweaks here and there.</p>



<p><strong>Optimise Your Settings</strong></p>



<p>From the Bumper Jumper Tactical tip to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-audio-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ‘Enhanced Audio’ sound profile</a>, there are many things you can do to secure the best settings in Black Ops 6. Take a little time to trawl through the menu and find what works best for you. </p>



<p>Here’s a tip for Black Ops 6: <strong>Turn off Omnimovement</strong>. If you’re on a controller, you can switch off diving, and it honestly makes such a refreshing change not needing to worry about leaping all over the map accidentally.</p>



<p><strong>Accept Imperfection</strong></p>



<p>Like I said, not everyone can get good at Call of Duty. You’ll be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-reveal-sbmm-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devastated by SBMM</a> and wannabe pro players before long, so it pays to sometimes accept that a) you’re almost past it, and b) everyone is just <strong>better </strong>at Call of Duty these days. And spoiler alert: almost everyone good at the game is 10 – 20 years younger than you.</p>



<p>Through sheer tenacity, settings that I’ve gotten used to over many years, and a desire to keep up with what’s trending, I stay somewhat ahead in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. I float around a 1.45 KD ratio, which isn’t bad for someone with my casual skillset, but I do painfully miss the old days.</p>



<p>I’ve gone from topping the charts to occupying a familiar spot at the bottom of the table. That’s what time does to you, folks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-explains-the-inner-workings-of-esports-broadcasts-for-a-modern-audience.1028259/</guid>

<p>Following the recent League of Legends World Championship event in London, Riot Games sat down in an interview to talk about all things broadcasting. During this interview, Riot’s Sam Kordower Chaimson, the executive broadcast producer for Worlds, explained what the gaming titan is doing to push content to a modern and increasingly demanding audience.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-worthwhile-to-support-all-those-fans">‘It’s Worthwhile to Support All Those Fans’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.svgeurope.org/blog/headlines/fan-eye-view-riot-games-on-creating-a-superior-viewer-experience-and-taking-fans-forwards-in-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with SVG Europe</a>, Kordower Chaimson explained that Riot Games is constantly adjusting its operating model to account for an ever-changing audience. Most recently, the broadcast team started producing a 9:16 stream – a vertical format – to accommodate those watching on platforms like TikTok.</p>



<p>It’s all about bringing as many viewers to the action as possible, and that’s only made a reality by fully diversifying how content can be consumed.</p>



<p>Kordower Chaimson drew key comparisons to ‘traditional’ sports and referenced a bold waking up to the versatility and accessibility of esports broadcasts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think traditional sports and traditional media are starting to clue into the fact that fans have different ways of engaging and at Riot we think it’s worthwhile to support all those fans, wherever they are. </p>



<p>Whether they’re watching a more traditional sport editorial broadcast like some of our main language feeds using our traditional broadcast apparatuses, or they’re watching one of our co-streamers, or they’re watching in another language using a broadcaster that may have a little bit more irreverent content, fans are choosing to engage with our sport in the way they engage with everything else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Kordower Chaimson puts it, Riot is busy trying to ‘serve a core fan experience’, and to do that, the company must ‘tailor its content to resonate with them and to reward them’.</p>



<p>Riot Games boasts one of the most tried, tested, and reliable broadcast infrastructures in the esports world. In 2022, the company opened two new remote broadcast centres as part of ‘Project Stryker’, one in Dublin, Ireland, and the other in Seattle. These facilities rival the tech-focused buildings backed by some of the world’s most powerful television broadcast companies.</p>



<p>Kordower Chaimson dipped into the emotional scenes that can unfold on a grand stage like the League of Legends World Championship:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s about marrying that hyper empathetic, hyper real personal experience with the spectacle of a top tier sporting event. I don’t think we lean too much into adhering to traditional editorial practises intentionally, but it’s about marrying the two. You obviously have natural advantages. </p>



<p>A big venue is pretty and beautiful and exciting, but it’s also a unique time to showcase our amazing community and our fans. It’s about celebrating the people around you that play the game. It’s about celebrating that comradery and those shared experiences we have, and that’s really special.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It could be mere weeks until Activision opens up about the Call of Duty League 2025 roadmap. The long-awaited arrival of this season’s competitive ecosystem has been made even more exciting by the success of Black Ops 6, which is proving to be a winner for players both novice and pro.</p>



<p>Recent claims have outlined the season structure for the year ahead, with it being suggested that Activision is adding in ‘Minors’ alongside the existing ‘Major’ structure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-to-europe">Going to Europe</h2>



<p>One of the most electrifying rumours, which is all but confirmed at this point, is that the 2025 COD League season is headed to Europe for the first time in several years. In the new year, Major I will take place in Barcelona, Spain, and it’ll be hosted by Toronto Ultra. Here’s the full (rumoured) schedule for the COD League 2025 season:</p>



<ul>
<li>Major I: Barcelona</li>



<li>Major II: Texas</li>



<li>Major III: Florida</li>



<li>Major IV: Chicago</li>



<li>Champs: Toronto</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.breakingpoint.gg/posts/the-2025-call-of-duty-league-season-structure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Breaking Point has claimed</a> that Activision will host a series of ‘Minors’ going into the 2025 season. These one-shot tournaments will offer a $20,000 prize for the winner, and they’ll be a neat opportunity for pro players to secure more CDL points.</p>



<p>Presently, the rumour is that the Minor events are only lined up alongside Major I and II as sort of a ‘testing phase’. Per the claims, a Minor will incorporate all twelve CDL teams playing online across a four-day weekend.</p>



<p>BP also suggested that this year’s season will feature a whopping 246 matches, one of the most we’ve seen in Call of Duty esports history. This will include 160 online fixtures, 72 Major matches, and 14 ‘post-season’ matches.</p>



<p>What do you think about the rumoured structure for the CDL 2025 season? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/metro-awakening-review-meta-quest-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metro-awakening-review-through-the-eyes-of-the-apocalypse.1028160/</guid>

<p>Metro Awakening is finally here and <strong>it is looking sharp</strong>. I played a trial of Awakening on PS VR2 at Gamescom, but it was a drop in the ocean in terms of experience compared to running through the entire game on Meta Quest 3. That’s what I’ve busied myself with of late, and I’m happy to say that this is <strong>still </strong>one VR shooter that you shouldn’t miss.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Metro Awakening review, captured on Meta Quest 3.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-underground">Going Underground</h2>



<p>Metro Awakening is, for want of a better term, a <strong>real Metro game</strong>. It looks, feels, and sounds like a classic Metro title, plunging players into the dank depths of the Moscow metro system, forced to survive against mutants and human enemies out for blood. It’s an entirely new perspective on the franchise – literally – but it works so well once you give it a few minutes to get settled.</p>



<p>I’ll be honest, it took me a few attempts to gel with Metro Awakening, and those attempts included playing with the game’s settings, but once I’d hit the perfect setup, I was <strong>immersed and loving every inch </strong>of Vertigo Games’ stab at this legendary post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>Metro Awakening has an all-new, original story penned by Dmitry Glukhovsky, the franchise’s creator. That’s one of the most remarkable elements of this gritty VR shooter, and a few twists and turns along the way kept me thoroughly engaged, just as I would have been playing a premium, traditional release in the series, like Metro Exodus.</p>



<p>As you explore this story, you’re treated to an original soundtrack composed by Anne-Kathrin Dern. It’s unmistakably <strong>Metro</strong>, and on more occasions than I could count, the soundtrack, paired with the ambient audio, was enough to send a chill through me.</p>



<p><em>Seriously, if you’ve ever played a Metro game, you’ll know how terrifying they <strong>can </strong>be. As you’re crawling through a spider-infested vent with nothing but a lighter to guide you, a ‘Lurker’ will leap around a corner, diving and scratching at your face. Imagine how intense that is through a VR headset.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-excellent-expansion">Excellent Expansion</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Metro Awakening is a prequel, and it takes players along a path that sees the protagonist, an unassuming doctor named Serdar, become one of the most supernatural entities in the Metro series: Khan. It’s set in 2028, while the first Metro game walks players through events that happen in 2033.</p>



<p>That’s where the name ‘Awakening’ comes from, see?</p>



<p>It might be a prequel set years before the first game, but it’s brilliant how familiar Awakening feels compared to the follow-up, full-sized titles. From the voice acting to the weapons, and from the post-apocalyptic environment to the mutants that stalk the tunnels of Moscow, everything is instantly recognisable as being pulled from a Metro game.</p>



<p>And it’s in these elements – the weapons, equipment, set pieces, and so on – that players will come to appreciate the depth and detail of this game. I spent so long studying the rifles and handguns I could pick up, I probed every corner looking for collectables, and I found myself hitting ‘restart’ on checkpoints just so I could try a different approach through a scene.</p>



<p>This game is focused heavily on stealth, given that Serdar is not a grizzled combat veteran, but I found myself pushing into some hardcore fights. On the easiest difficulty, you’ll still get a tasty enough challenge, and going on the toughest difficulty setting is nothing short of masochistic.</p>



<p>Within a couple of hours, you’ll have an arsenal of weapons and a full array of tactics to deploy, but like other games in the series, Awakening is relatively open-ended. I found myself accidentally ‘getting ahead of the game’ just by wondering <strong>if </strong>I could do a certain thing and then <strong>trying </strong>to do it. It doesn’t hold your hand, thankfully.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>This game isn’t without faults. I’ll sum those up before I cap off my Metro Awakening review.</p>



<ul>
<li>I had to reload checkpoint a few times because of a bug where I was either too high off the ground or too close to the floor.</li>



<li>I also had to reload the game because on three or four occasions, I stepped outside my boundary and the game locked me out of the playable area.</li>



<li>I lost a fair bit of ammunition by taking a magazine out of my weapon and setting it down on a surface that promptly swallowed it.</li>
</ul>



<p>I also <strong>had </strong>to play the game using continuous movement as opposed to teleporting, simply because I kept teleporting into surfaces that would throw my headset into disarray. It worked out for the better, though – continuous movement is superior. </p>



<p>Ultimately, Metro Awakening is worth every penny. It’s the most immersive post-apocalyptic experience I’ve had the pleasure of playing, and every step I took through the tunnels beneath Moscow had me feeling on edge and wary of my next move. I lost myself in the heart-pounding pressure of gunfights, and stealth sequences made my mouth run dry.</p>



<p>This is as close to the end of the world as you’ll ever hope to be, and the 8 – 10 hours you play fully exploring this game will be very well spent. </p>



<p><em>Metro Awakening is available worldwide on November 7 on PS VR2, Steam, Meta Quest, and Viveport.</em></p>

<p>Call of Duty is not only one of the most popular casual shooter games, but it thrives in the world of competitive and ranked, too. With Black Ops 6 just released, many are waiting for the game’s ranked system to drop. However, all Call of Duty games over the last few years have kept the same ranked system. Here are all the Call of Duty ranks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-call-of-duty-rank">Every Call of Duty Rank</h2>



<p>Call of Duty still stands as one of the biggest games in the world of esports and gaming, with millions of players hopping on every day. However, just because the game is incredibly popular amongst casual gamers, there is a massive competitive scene too.</p>



<p>So, here is a list of every rank in Call of Duty (updated last in Modern Warfare 3):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze (I – III):</strong> 0-899 SR</li>



<li><strong>Silver (I – III):</strong> 900-2,099 SR</li>



<li><strong>Gold (I – III):</strong> 2,100-3,599 SR</li>



<li><strong>Platinum (I – III):</strong> 3,600-5,399 SR</li>



<li><strong>Diamond (I – III):</strong> 5,400-7,499 SR</li>



<li><strong>Crimson (I – III):</strong> 7,500-9,999 SR</li>



<li><strong>Iridescent:</strong> 10,000 SR</li>



<li><strong>Top 250:</strong> 10,000+ SR</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s ranked system runs off of Skill Rating (SR), which is Call of Duty’s in-game points used to rank up. Players rank up by getting kills and wins when playing ranked. </p>



<p>If the ranked system changes for Black Ops 6, we will update you here at Insider Gaming.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-top-250-in-call-of-duty">How to get Top 250 in Call of Duty</h2>



<p>Call of Duty’s final rank, Top 250, is quite unique compared to other games. While every game has a final rank that players strive for, no other game has a rank that specifies you are in a certain top portion of players. </p>



<p>Being able to brag that you have made it into the Top 250 in Call of Duty is an incredibly impressive feat, as literally, <em>only </em>250 people will be able to make this claim. Still, unlike other final ranks in games, your spot in the Top 250 could be lost depending on how many others are working to get there. </p>



<p>To stay in the Top 250 you will have to consistently play ranked and work to not lose your spot. Those who make it into the Top 250 will be shown on a leaderboard for everyone to see, giving them the ultimate bragging rights.</p>



<p>Are you planning on trying to get into the Top 250 in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6?</p>
