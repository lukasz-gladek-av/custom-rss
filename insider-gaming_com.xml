<p>In December, the grand final of the PUBG Mobile Global Championship will unravel in London, England. With a $3 million prize pool up for grabs, this has snatched the record for the most valuable esports event to ever be held in the United Kingdom. It’s the first time the tournament has taken place in the UK, and fans are <strong>excited</strong> to say the least.</p>

<h2 id="h-big-money">Big Money</h2>



<p>The PUBG Mobile Global Championship is one of the most valuable tournaments in the modern esports calendar. A single event will rarely reach such epic proportions in terms of a prize pool, and few tournaments come close to the $3 million pot that this game boasts.</p>



<p>During the event, 49 teams will compete for a chance at snatching the coveted PMGC trophy. In 2023, it was IHC Esports that walked away with the prize. The tournament was a roaring success in 2023, with a whopping peak viewership of 980,123 users being recorded, which decimates most competing events.</p>



<p>In recent years, the concept of mobile-based esports tournaments has skyrocketed in popularity. It’s estimated there at 2 billion mobile gamers worldwide, and many of them invest time and effort in games like Free Fire and PUBG Mobile.</p>



<p>While the United Kingdom’s gaming expo scene is crumbling, the esports ecosystem across the region remains relatively solid. In the last few years, we’ve seen the likes of the League of Legends World Championship, the Halo Championship Series, a BLAST R6 Major, and the Rocket League Championship Series all make their way into the region.</p>



<p>Will you be watching the PMGC unfold in London? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>If you’ve heard the term ‘adpocalypse’ in the streaming world and haven’t got a clue what it means, you’re not alone. Recently, it was revealed that some Twitch streamers are suffering immeasurably from plummeting ad revenue rates, and nobody knows why. On the streaming platform, some users have reported a drop in ad revenue of as much as 95%.</p>



<p>This adpocalypse came on suddenly and has impacted some of Twitch’s biggest streamers, some of whom were picking up thousands of dollars a month through ad revenue. They’re now looking at just a few hundred dollars, and on their end, nothing has changed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-taken-for-granted">Taken for Granted</h2>



<p>Admittedly, this is the bread and butter earnings for some Twitch streamers. On social media, clips have surfaced showing users complaining about their ad revenue drops, <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1857455706376450514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">such as Lacy</a>, who stressed that his $10,000-a-day ad revenue stream has dropped to around $2,000 a day.</p>



<p>That’s still <strong>far, far </strong>more than the average worker earns, but for someone who has built a way of living out of those earnings, it could be devastating. Twitch allowed them to secure the bag in this way, and then without warning or forethought, the rate of earnings has been slashed immeasurably.</p>



<p>Imagine if your place of work suddenly cut your salary by 80% without telling you – that’s effectively what’s happening here. Sure, the creators still have subscriptions, bits, and other donations, but it’s not <strong>good</strong>.</p>



<p>One streamer, TheStockGuy, revealed that he’s disabling ads on his streams because the returns aren’t worth the disruption. He was reporting a 95% drop in earnings – one of the most significant examples of the adpocalypse we’ve seen.</p>



<p>Twitch has yet to comment on why ad revenue is plummeting – I’ve reached out for a statement in the meantime.</p>



<p>Do you think streamers needed their earnings adjusted, or is this an unfair change from Twitch? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Dying Light 2 is available on PS Plus this month as a free game, but Techland has gone one step beyond that provision and added a series of PS5 Pro-focused enhancements to the game. One of the best open-world zombie games ever made has just gotten better with these recent changes – read on to find out what they are.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-the-world-looks-gorgeous">The End of the World Looks Gorgeous</h2>



<p>With a PlayStation 5 Pro, users can soak up several key advantages, from boosted resolutions to enhanced frame rates. There’s a sizeable processing boost under the hood of the PS5 Pro, and many developers have leant on that to strengthen their games. </p>



<p>It was recently revealed that 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human will be added to PS Plus this month as a free game. It was then announced by Techland, the game’s developer, that PS5 Pro enhancements are also inbound.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced graphics settings (Balanced, Resolution, Performance, Quality)</li>



<li>Increased base resolution</li>



<li>Improved shadows, screen-space reflections, and sub-surface scattering</li>



<li>Better weather (including fog)</li>
</ul>



<p>Dying Light 2 already looked phenomenal, boasting one of the best apocalyptic environments in recent years, but this latest round of changes takes things to an entirely new level. If you’re a PlayStation 5 Pro owner and you want to pick up a copy of Dying Light 2 when it goes live on PS Plus, I’d recommend doing so.</p>



<p>In recent news, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-one-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> had surpassed one million wishlists. Are you looking forward to the next instalment in the popular post-apocalyptic series? Let us know in the comments.</p>
