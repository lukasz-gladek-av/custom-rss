<p>Marvel Rivals continues to get plenty of attention, and with the launch of a new limited-time game mode, several balance changes have also been made.</p>



<p>Now deep into Season 3.5, players will be forgiven for starting to look ahead to Season 4 and wondering what’s in store, but the launch of Klyntar’s Resource Rumble mode should keep you busy for the time being.</p>



<p>It’s worth keeping on top of all the balance changes, however, so you’re familiar with all the buffs and nerfs. We’ve got all the details for you here.</p>

<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals balance changes on August 20 impact three heroes, with Blade, recently added at the start of Season 3.5, given a buff, while Human Torch and Loki receive a nerf.</strong></p>



<p>Blade has boosted Lifesteal gained during Bloodline Awakening, boosted from 60% to 65%, while the self-healing reduction has been lowered from 40% to 35%.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Human Torch’s Flame Field damage over time has been reduced to 20/s from 25/s, with Pyro-Prison damage also reduced from 50/s to 40/s.</p>



<p>In the Strategist department, Loki’s Mythical Missile damage dealt by the God of Mischief and his illusions has been reduced from 30 to 25, although healing for teammates remains unchanged.</p>



<p>All other characters in the game remain untouched, though don’t expect it to remain that way for long as the big end of season balance patch is now just a few weeks out.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-marvel-rivals-version-20250821-patch-notes">Full Marvel Rivals Version 20250821 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The full patch notes are below, as shared on the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250820/41667_1254957.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-duelist">Duelist</h3>



<p><strong>Blade</strong></p>



<p>The Daywalker’s resilience just slightly leveled up. Blade’s got more staying power for those midnight brawls!</p>



<p>– Increase Lifesteal gained during Bloodline Awakening from 60% to 65%. Reduce self-healing reduction from 40% to 35%.</p>



<p><strong>Human Torch</strong></p>



<p>Johnny Storm’s heat is still on, but his flame’s been dialed back just enough for ground heroes to catch their breath!</p>



<p>– Reduce Flame Field (right-click on terrain) Damage Over Time from 25/s to 20/s.</p>



<p>– Reduce Pyro-Prison Damage Over Time from 50/s to 40/s.</p>



<h3 id="h-strategist">Strategist</h3>



<p><strong>Loki</strong></p>



<p>The God of Mischief and his illusions are a tad less punishing!</p>



<p>– Reduce Mystical Missile damage dealt by Loki and his illusions to enemies from 30 to 25. (Healing for teammates remains unchanged.)</p>

<p>Skate made an appearance during the Future Games Show at Gamescom, with the big announcement being a tease for a major update next week as Early Access looms.</p>



<p>The EA title, relaunching the franchise after a 15-year hiatus, has been in Closed Alpha stage for months, but with the end of the summer looming large, big news is seemingly on the horizon.</p>



<p>In a developer interview shown at Future Games Show, details were shared about development, including the in-depth parkour features, with a sign-off to keep eyes peeled for a big announcement next week.</p>



<h2 id="h-skate-poised-for-big-update-ahead-of-early-access">Skate Poised For Big Update Ahead of Early Access</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Early Access is coming. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The comments at Future Games Show align with a recent <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1957843556678136288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) directed to Skate Insiders, informing them that maintenance will take place from today, August 20, until August 26, leaving the game inaccessible.</p>



<p>With Summer 2025 stated as the release for Early Access, and just a few weeks left until we tick into September and leave the Summer behind, next week’s big update could well be the launch into Early Access.</p>



<p>Skate will be released on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC, though it’s not clear yet whether the title will eventually make its way onto Nintendo Switch 2, nor do we know when a full launch will be.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on Skate’s social media channels for the big announcement next week, which we’ll also cover here at Insider Gaming.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam has just been unveiled by Team17 and Expression Games. In a follow-up to 2021’s Hell Let Loose, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam welcomes players to one of the most brutal and notorious conflicts of the 20th century, plunging them into 50v50 battles in the jungles of Vietnam.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will debut with six sprawling maps and will feature land, sea, and air combat.</p>

<h2 id="h-welcome-to-the-jungle">Welcome to the Jungle</h2>



<p>Vietnam was a harrowing war, but it makes for a fantastic theatre for video games. Historically, we’ve seen plenty of games pop up that have used the Vietnam War as a key setting, from Black Ops to Shellshock, and from Conflict to Battlefield.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the next take on the gruesome war that took the lives of millions of people between the 1960s and 1970s.</p>



<p>In a press release, Team17 and Expression Games revealed what players can expect in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set during the Vietnam War, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam offers existing and new fans a high caliber gameplay experience of authentic warfare where teamwork is the key to success. Experience 50v50 player battles across stunning, sprawling maps with careful attention aimed at creating an authentic, atmospheric and historically sensitive experience of events that occurred during armed conflict that occurred in Vietnam, between 1965-1973. </p>



<p>Retaining the gameplay base that fans loved from the first title, this is a brand new experience, utilising combined arms, with air, water, armour, infantry and support weapons that encapsulates the theatre of war feeling beloved by fans of the original title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Players will be using helicopters to deploy troops on the battlefield and deliver fire support to squads pinned down by enemy fire. Patrol boats will strafe the shore, while Vietnam’s NVA forces will use tunnels and jungle warfare tactics to dynamically ambush enemies.#</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is scheduled to launch in 2026.</p>
