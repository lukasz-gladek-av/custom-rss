            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League’s Toronto Ultra has unveiled a rebrand, taking on a new name and logo. In a press release, OverActive Media revealed the new name, ‘Toronto KOI’, in recognition of the organization’s association with KOI and Movistar. </p>



<p>This is the latest in a line of a few organizations to rebrand going into the 2026 Call of Duty League season. We recently saw the Riyadh Falcons, FaZe Vegas, and G2 Minnesota all surface amid ‘rostermania’. Merchandise and new jerseys to celebrate the new branding will launch in December, the organization advised.</p>



<h2 id="h-introducing-toronto-koi">Introducing: Toronto KOI</h2>



<p>In a press release, Adam Adamou, the CEO of OverActive Media, Toronto KOI’s parent company, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To be KOI is to belong</p>



<p>KOI has always been about connection, about fans, players and communities coming together under one banner. Toronto KOI brings that spirit home and gives it a global stage. This launch marks an important moment in our global strategy. It connects our North American operations with one of the most recognized and influential brands in global esports. </p>



<p>Bringing this illustrious brand to the Call of Duty League and to Toronto will benefit everyone, our fans, our players, our partners and the broader esports ecosystem. We are building a single, unified brand platform that scales across regions and delivers lasting value for all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This alignment brings Toronto Ultra into the core OverActive ‘KOI’ branding, offering fans something more tangible to connect to than the arguably arbitrary term ‘Ultra’.</p>



<p>It’s what ROKKR did by taking on the ‘G2 Minnesota’ label, and there are expectations that Gentlemates will deepen brand identity in the coming weeks by ‘moving’ LAG M8 to Paris. It’s a busy time to be a Call of Duty League fan, as everything is changing ahead of the long-awaited Black Ops 7 season.</p>



<p>It already feels like an age since the Call of Duty League Championship wrapped up towards the end of June, and there are still many weeks until the new season starts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday, and as the week comes to a close, I’ve got another round of NYT Connections hints and solutions to help you usher in the weekend. Today’s puzzle was tricky, but I persevered to bring you the hints you need to wrap this NYT Connections puzzle up much faster.</p>



<p>It’s time for the weekend! Let’s get into the NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-24">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 24)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #866:</p>



<ul>
<li>BAYWATCH</li>



<li>HIGHLIGHT</li>



<li>RAINBOW</li>



<li>HERRING</li>



<li>PRIME</li>



<li>SUNSET</li>



<li>BOLD</li>



<li>PEACOCK</li>



<li>COOTIE</li>



<li>HEYDAY</li>



<li>KALEIDOSCOPE</li>



<li>UNDERLINE</li>



<li>ZENITH</li>



<li>KINGPIN</li>



<li>STRIKETHROUGH</li>



<li>PINNACLE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words mark the peak of something — think career highs, golden eras, or when someone was “in their prime.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are all formatting options — the kind you’d find in a word processor or messaging app.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are vibrant by nature — often used metaphorically to describe something dazzling or full of variety.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word ends with something you might wear or carry — but the full word itself isn’t necessarily about fashion.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 24.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-24-866">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 24 (#866)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– HEYDAY, PINNACLE, PRIME, ZENITH</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BOLD, HIGHLIGHT, STRIKETHROUGH, UNDERLINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – KALEIDOSCOPE, PEACOCK, RAINBOW, SUNSET</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BAYWATCH, COOTIE, HERRING, KINGPIN</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
