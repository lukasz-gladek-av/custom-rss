<p>Hazelight Studios is looking to gatecrash all the Game of the Year parties again. Split Fiction is the studio’s newest co-op project, and Xbox Game Pass and EA Play members are curious to see if the title is coming to either subscription service.</p>



<p>It Takes Two to Tango, which is why the 2021 predecessor was so revered and successful. It shined a spotlight on tandem tale-telling and showed co-op games still have so much potential. I’ve already discussed our most anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op games of 2025</a>, and comfortably topping the list has to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>Split Fiction on Game Pass would be smart, and it’s an EA game, so EA Play access is logical. However, the cookie doesn’t always crumble this way.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-split-fiction-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Split Fiction on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you choose? Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Split Fiction isn’t coming to Xbox Game Pass at launch, and all the evidence would suggest it is staying this way.</strong></p>



<p>It’s common for new game announcement trailers to mention Game Pass. Split Fiction was announced during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>, and came with a full trailer. Unfortunately for Game Pass subscribers, there was zero mention of it coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/split-fiction/9n1wxxd1rl8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction Xbox Store Page</a> also neglects to mention Game Pass eligibility. There’s still time before release, meaning it could change. If it does, we’ll update this page and let you know.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-split-fiction-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Split Fiction Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s not confirmed, but Split Fiction could come to Xbox Game Pass if It Takes Two is anything to go by.</strong></p>



<p>It Takes Two released in March 2021. <strong>The co-op title was on Xbox Game Pass a few months later in November 2021</strong>. There’s no guarantee history repeats itself with Split Fiction. But there is a precedent here, so stay tuned for a change in its status.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-split-fiction-on-ea-play">Can You Play Split Fiction on EA Play?</h2>



<p><strong>Split Fiction is not available as a day-one title on EA Play.</strong></p>



<p>EA rarely (if ever) makes new EA titles free on EA Play straightaway. You can grab a Split Fiction discount if you have EA Play though. But like Game Pass, it’ll likely be a while before Hazelight’s newest co-op adventure is free-to-play on EA Play.</p>



<hr>



<p>Can another Josef Fares game catch lightning in a bottle and win Game of the Year again? Or is Split Fiction destined to split opinions and fall short of It Takes Two? Let us know based on what you’ve seen so far.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s February State of Play</a> showcase rightfully gave Split Fiction more exposure. You can check out the exciting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-received-a-new-trailer-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> showing off the litany of new ideas the release brings.</p>

<p>Nintendo and the Pokémon Company recently received a new patent in the United States, which could help their lawsuit against Palworld.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/yesterday-nintendo-received-a-u-s-version-of-another-anti-palworld-patent-and-asked-the-u-s-patent-office-for-an-interview-to-get-a-third-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Fray</a> (via <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patents-uspto-infringement-lawsuit-implications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>), Nintendo and the Pokemon Company recently acquired U.S. Patent No. 12,220,638, which helps them fight Palworld in different countries. Players must first learn about a previous patent published on December 31, 2024, to understand the new patent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On December 31, 2024, U.S. Patent No. 12,179,111 was acquired by Nintendo, where the company outlined a “first mode and a second mode”. In the former, players would use a “catching item” to procure a “field character”, and in the latter, a “fighting character” is released to engage in battle with the “field character”. It was speculated that Palworld changed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-has-changed-how-pal-spheres-work-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Pal Spheres worked in the game</a> when Nintendo was in the process of publishing this patent, as all parties were informed about it a month before it was published.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo acquired the new U.S. Patent No. 12,220,638 on February 11, 2025, and it was very similar to the one they published at the end of last year. However, some different terms were used in this patent, where “field character” has been replaced by “virtual character” and “catching items” with “obtaining items.” A display indicator for “likelihood of success” for obtaining a virtual character was mentioned, too. Lastly, any mentions of the first and second modes were removed.</p>



<p>So, how does Nintendo’s new patent help their lawsuit against Palworld? The report reveals that with the first patent, Pocketpair argued that there wasn’t a clear separation between a “first mode and second mode” in Palworld. With the new patent, Nintendo removed the distinction between these first and second modes and added new terms like “virtual character” and “obtaining items” to increase their chances in the patent infringement lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Nintendo and the Pokemon Company are not slowing down in their battle against Palworld. To help with the rejected claims, their attorney has requested an interview with the patent examiner on February 8, 2025. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-dev-pocketpair-publishing-interest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocketpair Publishing</a> is now live. Palworld received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-spring-festival-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five new skins</a> for the Spring Festival. Do you think Nintendo’s new patent help them in their lawsuit against Palworld?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>During today’s earnings call, Sony revealed that the PS5 has sold over 75 units in its lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During Sony’s <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a> today, the gaming and network services segment was the highlight of the show. PS5 crossed the 75 million milestone by shipping 9.5 million units in Q4. PlayStation Networks’ monthly active users were up, too, increasing from 118 million in FY23 Q3 to 129 million in FY24 Q3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s not all; PS5 and PS4 topped 95.9 million units in software, gaining a 6.2 million increase from last year’s 89.7 million. During this time, 11.6 million units of first-party games were sold, which decreased from 12.3 million last year. Moreover, out of the 95.9 million, 74% were full-game digital software downloads, down from last year’s 77%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to PlayStation 5’s growing sales, the current-generation console is just 1.5 million units behind the PS4 in outselling it during the same period. The console manufacturer believes that this number will only increase with the release of first-party games like Ghost of Yotei and third-party games like GTA 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-remastered-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> is coming to PlayStation 5 with Pro and VRR support on April 25.
