<p>Once you’ve got a few hours into Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll find yourself revelling in pomp and circumstance at a wedding in Semine. This is one of the pivotal moments of this open-world RPG, but it has a particular task that might be tricky for some.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the wedding mission, you’re prompted to congratulate the newlyweds, but the bride and groom are nowhere to be seen. This can leave you searching for a while, as the location they’re in is not at all obvious – and you might never think to look there.</p>



<p>In this short guide, I’ll help you find the newlyweds in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-find-the-bride-and-groom-in-kingdom-come">Find the Bride and Groom in Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>The wedding mission is one of the highlights of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. It’s the culmination of several hours of gameplay, and hopefully, you’ll be well-prepared to deal with everything it offers. In one moment, you’ll be duelling guards, and in the next, you’ll be procuring special alcohol for Moravian guests.</p>



<p>It’s a busy time.</p>



<p>At the end of the mission, you prepare to leave the wedding, but first, Henry of Skalitz wants to congratulate the newlyweds, but they’ve disappeared and nobody knows where they are.</p>



<p>Here’s where you’ll find the <strong>bride</strong> (Agnes) at the wedding:</p>



<p>Head away from the ceremony area through the arch leading to the dining area – nearby where the Moravian crew is sitting. Directly ahead of you will be a dead-end with a door to the left, with a guard posted outside. If you head in there, you’ll see it leads into a wine and beer cellar – it’s in here that you’ll find the bride.</p>



<p>If you’ve come here previously with the Moravian task, you’ll already have evacuated the strict guard from inside. Otherwise, you might need to distract him some other way. Either way, this is where to find the newlyweds in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>I won’t spoil what happens when you’ve found the bride – have fun!</p>

<p>Sony San Diego has released the first gameplay trailer for MLB The Show 25, and with it came reveals of new features coming to this year’s game.</p>



<p>MLB The Show 25 features a number of updates coming to each of the game’s core modes. With Road to the Show, players will be able to now play in high school and college before making it to the big leagues. Colleges confirmed in the game so far—based on the trailer—include UCLA, LSU, TCU, Cal-State Fullerton, Vanderbilt, Texas, South Carolina, and Tennessee.  There are also metal bats in the game, replicating the play and sound from lower-levels of baseball.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Moving on to Franchise Mode, Sony San Diego is touting a new “Front Office Experience”. According to the studio, “choices matter, consequences are real, and time is precious as a revitalized Free Agency system adds risk/reward elements, strategy, and excitement to the pursuit of the top free agents each offseason”.</p>



<p>For Diamond Dynasty, the game’s card-collecting mode, there will be two new game modes within. The first is called  Diamond Quest, a rogue-like offline mode. The second is an online league-style mode called Weekend Classic. </p>



<p>Other new features revealed include the addition of more quick-time events, first-person cameras, and more. More details and deep dives into the modes will come as part of Sony San Diego’s pre-launch roadmap that you can see below.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>MLB The Show 25 launches March 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. For the first time in years, the game won’t be available day one on Xbox Game Pass.</p>

<p>It feels like we’ve not had an amazing Battlefield game for a long time. This is why EA is giving its all to make Battlefield 2025’s release as good as it can be and bring the franchise back to the forefront of FPS gaming with a bang in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Battlefield 2025 is exactly what I’m looking for right now. Call of Duty is still great but can be arcadey, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> and Overwatch are compelling Hero shooters, and The Finals is lacking something, but adds the delicious destruction I seek. Battlefield has always provided something a bit different, and (in my opinion) we haven’t had a memorable entry since 2016’s Battlefield 1.</p>



<p>Early indicators are EA is inventing a lot of time, resources, and manpower into Battlefield 2025, so let’s check out what we know about the next <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-will-the-next-battlefield-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield release</a> and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2025-release-period">Battlefield 2025 Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boom. Credit to Battlefield Studios – Official Battlefield Labs Reveal Teaser video on YouTube</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s unconfirmed, but Battlefield 2025 is being eyed up for a potential 2025 release, and multiple reports seem to verify this.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve reported previously <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA’s next Battlefield game was aiming for 2025</a>. A few months later Vince Zempella—heading the new Battlefield title—hinted Battlefield was returning to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-modern-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modern-day combat, also in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>EA hasn’t come out and said a 2025 date is happening, but it seems extremely likely. I highly doubt it’s going to stay as “Battlefield 2025” either, and we could finally be getting the long-awaited <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> many have been asking for.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2025-battlefield-labs-testing-explained">Battlefield 2025 Battlefield Labs Testing Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Battlefield Labs is described as the “The most ambitious community collaboration in franchise history” and is a full-on cohesive alliance of multiple developers and players to create the ultimate Battlefield 2025 game.</strong></p>



<p>February 3 saw the first mention of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> project. It’s a series of tests throughout the pre-alpha phase (and probably beta testing) to continually ascertain the quality of the product. Consistent player feedback is looking to help the four studios working on Battlefield 2025: <strong>DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, </strong>and <strong>Criterion</strong>.</p>



<p>We don’t how long <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/announcing-battlefield-labs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Labs</a> will last, but you can try to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> and test the potential Battlefield 6 entry—providing feedback of your own.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-battlefield-6-gameplay-revealed">First Battlefield 6 Gameplay Revealed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s hope for a good one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The first-ever footage of Battlefield 2025 AKA Battlefield 6 was shown off during the Battlefield Labs demonstration. It showed explosive gameplay, destructible environments, vehicles, high-octane weapons, and much more.</strong></p>



<p>It looks spectacular for pre-alpha footage, but we’ve been fooled by Battlefield before. Nevertheless, you can check out the reveal for yourself below.</p>

<p>What does Battlefield 2025 need to do differently from Battlefield 2024—and even Battlefield 5—to make itself relevant again and bring the player base back? Is this the last chance saloon for EA and Battlefield as a whole? Get involved with a comment below.</p>
