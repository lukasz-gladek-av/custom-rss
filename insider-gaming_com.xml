<p>New images of Link and Zelda have been revealed for the upcoming The Legend of Zelda live-action movie. </p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda live-action movie has been in development for some time, and it appears that things are finally moving forward after the previous delay. Earlier this year, Shigeru Miyamoto had already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> which actors would be playing the roles of Link and Zelda, and now new images have showcased how they look in these costumes. </p>



<h2 id="h-official-images-of-link-and-zelda-were-revealed-through-the-nintendo-today-app">Official Images of Link and Zelda were Revealed through the Nintendo Today App</h2>



<p>The new images of Link and Zelda in costume from the live-action adaptation of The Legend of Zelda were revealed by Nintendo itself through the Nintendo Today app (via <a href="https://www.vooks.net/first-photos-of-link-and-zelda-in-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vooks</a>). Three official images were revealed: the first was a close-up of Bo Bragason, who is playing Zelda; the second image was a close shot of Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, who will be playing Link in the upcoming movie; the third image was of both of them looking over the horizon, with some of the movie’s world shown in the background. </p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda live-action filming has already begun, and these images finally confirm that news. A couple of days ago, we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-footage-has-reportedly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several videos circulating</a>, leaking images from the movie’s set, including actors, and other content. We already knew Link would be wearing a green tunic and Zelda would be wearing something blue, which is similar to her looks in BOTW and TOTK. The scene also seemingly included a horse with a patch featuring the classic Zelda logo. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zelda-movie-leak-impa-severance-actor-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Severance star</a> might be joining the upcoming live-action adaptation of The Legend of Zelda. Additionally, a new LEGO Zelda set is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to arrive in 2026</a>.

<p>The Cities: Skylines franchise is getting a new developer. Publisher Paradox announced on Monday that it was moving long-time developer Colossal Order off of the franchise in what is said to be a “mutual decision.</p>



<p>In a joint statement on the Paradox forums, Colossal Order is moving on to build new projects and explore “new creative opportunities.”</p>







<p><strong>“For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order,”</strong> <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen said</a>. <strong>“When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“We’re confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox’s leadership. As we move forward, we’re excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-meet-cities-skylines-new-developer">Meet Cities: Skylines New Developer</h2>



<p>Taking over the franchise will be another Finnish studio, Iceflake Studios. One of Paradox’s internal management studios, Iceflake will take over <strong>“all existing and future development for Cities: Skylines II, including free updates for the current version, continuous work on the Editor and console editions, as well as future expansions and content packs. This means that Cities players will be able to look forward to new updates and content drops for many years.”</strong></p>



<p>Colossal Order will continue on the game for a short time in order to implement in-progress updates like various bug fixes, the Bike Patch, Old Town buildings, and a Beta version of asset support for the game’s editor. After that, Iceflake will take over all development at the start of 2026.</p>







<p><strong>“Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honor and a great responsibility,”</strong> Iceflake studio manager Lasse Liljedahl said. <strong>“There’s a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can’t wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game.”</strong></p>



<p>When making the announcement, there was no update on the console version of Cities: Skylines 2. The version has been delayed multiple times, and there’s been no update on when players can expect it. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to ask what this change means for the console version.</p>
