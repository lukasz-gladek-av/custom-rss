<p>Like its name, the upcoming Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is somewhat obscure. It’s a story-rich role-playing game with turn-based and real-time mechanics set in a world inspired by the Belle Epoque France. From what we’ve seen, it looks phenomenal, but only time will tell. For now, let’s explore the various Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 editions and pre-order information!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-included-in-the-clair-obscur-expedition-33-editions">Every Included in the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Editions</h2>



<p>There are four versions of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to pre-order, from the basic standard edition, which includes the game itself, to the collector’s edition, which features physical items, like a hardcover artbook and music box.</p>

<p>Intel is one of the largest computer technology companies in the world. When it comes to consumer CPUs, it’s often in a neck-and-neck battle with competitor AMD for the processor market. </p>



<p>Because of that, Intel’s earnings reports are closely watched by investors, analysts, and consumers alike. That makes it important to know when the next one is, what time it starts, and how you can listen to it live. These quarterly updates provide insights into a company’s financial health, performance across key divisions, and general outlooks for the months ahead. </p>



<p>What is the health of Intel’s business? What are investors looking for in terms of revenue? Are there any concerns or roadblocks in various sectors? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-intel-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next Intel Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/intel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intel</a> is currently scheduled to deliver its fourth quarter (Q4) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2024 on Thursday, January 30.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some companies run an April-March fiscal year, Intel’s fiscal year goes from January to December, and ends on the last Saturday of the month. That means its fiscal year ended on Saturday, December 28th. The company’s quarters are structured as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Q1: January – March</li>



<li>Q2: April – June</li>



<li>Q3: July – September</li>



<li>Q4: October – December</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-next-intel-earnings-report-start-time">Next Intel Earnings Report Start Time</h2>



<p>The next Intel earnings report is scheduled to start after trading closes for the day at 5PM ET/2PM PT on January 30, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-listen-to-intel-s-earnings-report">How To Listen To Intel’s Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to listen to Intel’s quarterly earnings report—or just look over the numbers—you can do so via the company’s website. Simply do the following:</p>

<li>Then select “Financial Results”</li>



<li>This will take you to a page with recent earnings calls, presentations, infographics, remarks, and more.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you want more than just the most recent earnings call and data, the “Financial Results” page will have a catalog of the reports from past years, going back—as of writing—as far as 2002.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-intel">What To Expect From Intel</h2>



<p>When Intel releases its latest earnings, it will provide a number of updates on the state of the overall business. Details such as where things stand with its restructuring efforts, early returns from the release of its new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review-a-new-era-for-efficiency-but-is-it-right-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core Ultra S CPUs</a>, the launch of its Intel Arc <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/intel-battlemage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlemage graphics cards</a>, its growth in the AI space, and more will be discussed.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-intel-earnings-report">The Last Intel Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When Intel announced its earnings for Q3 FY2024, it announced that it’s year-over-year net revenue fell by 6.17% to $13.28 billion from $14.16 billion. Intel said that the decline in revenue was due to restructuring costs after laying off 15% of its global workforce along with more investments into different areas of research and development.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-company-earnings-calls">What Are Company Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they’re a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often put out a press release and presentation with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-next-era-of-dying-light%E2%80%99-revealed-as-techland-celebrates-10th-anniversary.1093026/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Techland has lined up an impressive 2025 roadmap for Dying Light 2, and it all begins with a celebration event honouring the 10th anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. In 2015, this open-world epic of a zombie apocalypse title made its way onto our screens and into our hearts, and today, it remains one of the best zombie games to ever be released.</p>



<p>From today, the anniversary celebration commences, with Techland pushing out four weeks of entertainment across both Dying Light and Dying Light 2: Stay Human, which was released in February 2022.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-hard-at-work">‘Hard at Work’</h2>



<p>In a recent press release, Techland explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the same time we’re celebrating the 10th anniversary of Dying Light, we are already hard at work on the next era of the franchise.</p>



<p>Our recent major rebrand aims to establish the franchise as the ultimate zombie experience across all future projects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This summer, the team will release Dying Light: The Beast, a standalone game that sees the return of Kyle Crane, the iconic protagonist from the first game. At Gamescom 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I caught up with Roger Craig Smith</a>, the legendary actor behind Kyle Crane, who returns to the Dying Light series after a ten-year break.</p>



<p>To kick off the celebrations, Dying Light 2: Stay Human will be discounted to the lowest price ever, per the Techland update. Those still playing Dying Light (2015) will get a free skin bundle and a special ‘hypermode’ event, too. After that, both Dying Light 2 and Dying Light will have special, in-game events unravel, including the return of fan-favourite modes like Low Gravity and Super Crane.</p>



<p>In the week starting February 19, Dying Light 2’s Tower Raid mode will be permanently released, and a special ‘Light up the Night’ stream will be held by Techland.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>But that’s not all!</p>



<p>Beyond that, the spring welcomes a major update in Dying Light 2: Stay Human, and in the summer, a fresh event will be delivered. In the fall comes the ‘Fall Update’ which goes hand-in-hand with a limited-time Halloween event, and finally, Winter Tales returns at the end of the year.</p>



<p>Throughout all that, Dying Light 2 players will receive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Co-op gameplay and matchmaking updates</li>



<li>New Tower Raid characters</li>



<li>New firearms and melee weapons</li>



<li>Community map support</li>



<li>Prologue improvements</li>



<li>Free outfits and gear</li>



<li>Technical and graphical improvements</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a busy year for the team at Techland, and the press release finished with a promising statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our plans to grow the franchise don’t stop at Dying Light: The Beast. We’ll continue the series with multiple unannounced projects and will also go beyond video games with new board games, exclusive merchandise, original webcomic series and more on the horizon. Our goal is to bring the world of Dying Light to even more people.</p>
</blockquote>
