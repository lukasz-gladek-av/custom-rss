<p>Albeit a port of an older game, Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the big third-party launch titles for the Nintendo Switch 2. And while the game was both available in both digital and physical form, players clearly had a preference for how they wanted the game.</p>



<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/08/cd-projekt-group-presentation-h1-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings report</a>, CD Projekt Red revealed that of the game‚Äôs sales on the console, more than 75% of players bought the physical version of Cyberpunk 2077. </p>



<p>CD Projekt Red joint CEO Micha≈Ç Novakovski believes that the game sold well physically on the system because they included the full game, including the Phantom Liberty expansion, on the 64GB game card. Novakovski said that they believe players find the ‚Äúplug and play experience‚Äù attractive. He added that the Switch 2 enhancements for the game helped push it to a new audience, but he does think digital sales will pick up moving forward.</p>



<p><strong>‚ÄúThis dominance of physical sales continues into the current quarter with additional stock orders coming in,‚Äù</strong> he said. <strong>‚ÄúIn the long run, we expect the breakdown of sales between these channels to reflect our past experiences with the share of digital sales progressively increasing as time goes by. It‚Äôs worth noting that physical and digital sales channels have different economics. Digital sales naturally yield higher net revenue, while physical copies involve additional manufacturing and packaging costs as well as distributor fees.‚Äù</strong></p>

<p>Battlefield 6 brings back Battlefield 2042‚Äôs popular Portal game mode. If you can‚Äôt wait until BF6‚Äôs launch to see what it features, a Battlefield 6 Portal gameplay footage leak has given us all a sneak peek of what to expect‚Äîdid someone say Battlefield 6 meets Only Up?</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> has returned. With the open beta now way behind us, it‚Äôs time for Labs participants to get back into testing and ensure the FPS sequel is primed and ready for its October launch. But, like with Labs before, you can expect leaked footage to appear from time to time. A new video has surfaced showing off Battlefield 6‚Äôs revamped Portal mode.</p>







<figure><figcaption>No limits to your imagination. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios are promising some wild scenes with the new and improved Portal mode. Players can build their own maps, and as we‚Äôve seen in a new leak from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a>‚Äîeven homages to hit indie games.</p>



<p>A full 5-minute video shows off Battlefield 6‚Äôs Portal mode in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-testing-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returning Labs test</a>. It‚Äôs not the most compelling footage, admittedly, and will be a mere taste of the creations and chaos the community is bound to concoct. But in the video, the tester has assembled a mammoth-sized structure, intricately designed to be climbed.</p>



<p>Comments on the video compare the footage to that of Only Up‚Äîthe viral 2023 game in which you have to climb an entire landscape until you reach the top, risking total failure if you fall. Once at the top, the Battlefield 6 player looks down, and a full-blown firefight is taking place atop the structure.</p>

<p>BF6 devs claim <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-mode-will-keep-the-game-fresh-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6‚Äôs Portal Mode will keep the game fresh for years</a>. To be honest, I don‚Äôt doubt it, and I‚Äôm excited to see what some creative people are capable of building in Portal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MSI‚Äôs Titan 18 HX AI isn‚Äôt really a laptop in the traditional sense. It‚Äôs more like a full-on desktop packed into a form you can technically carry around. Of course, that‚Äôs if you don‚Äôt mind lugging eight pounds of aluminum alloy plus a hefty power brick. This isn‚Äôt something you casually throw in a backpack for a coffee shop session. It‚Äôs a machine built for people who want raw, uncompromising power in a device that still folds shut.</p>



<p>It has all the bells and whistles you could ever want, but with a hefty price tag and some frustrating design aspects,&nbsp;is it really one that you should invest in?</p>



<h2 id="h-msi-titan-18-hx-ai-review">MSI Titan 18 HX AI Review</h2>



<p>The first thing that stands out is the massive 18-inch Mini-LED display. It runs at 4K UHD+ with a 120Hz refresh rate, delivers excellent color coverage, and pushes brightness high enough for work or play in just about any environment. Whether you‚Äôre gaming or doing creative work, it‚Äôs a screen that feels built for both. And the hardware driving it has the muscle to match. </p>



<p>MSI crammed in Intel‚Äôs Core Ultra 9 285HX processor and NVIDIA‚Äôs RTX 5090 laptop GPU, which means the Titan 18 HX handles modern games at 4K with ease. Frame rates in demanding titles hold strong, and production tasks like video rendering or 3D modeling run faster than most dedicated desktops. Simply put, it does whatever you ask of it.</p>



<p>I don‚Äôt want to spend too much time going over benchmarks because, as I mentioned, this machine will do whatever you need with ease. Still, it‚Äôs worth going over a couple for the Core Ultra 9 285HX. </p>



<p>On Geekbench, it received a single-core average score of 3,169 and a multi-core score average of 22,135. Compared to the MSI Raider GE78 with an Intel Core i9-14900K (single-core: 3,000/multi-core: 18,262), and you are looking at an average increase of roughly 21% for the multi-core and 5% for the single-core. Other synthetic benchmarks from software like 3D mark also showed impressive results with it hitting a CPU profile score of 17,815 for Max Threads on stock settings and 1,311 on a single thread.</p>



<p>Moving to productivity, and I was rendering five-minute 4K videos in roughly three minutes with 1080 being done, on average, between 60-90 seconds. &nbsp;Obviously, if you are someone who uses a lot of transitions and edits, it might take a bit longer, but nothing that would become concerning.</p>

<h2 id="h-upgradeability">Upgradeability</h2>



<p>One of the big debates between laptops and desktops comes with how easy they are to upgrade and repair. Desktop machines will, likely, always have the advantage because of how easy it is for people to buy new components and swap them as they need. For laptops, that‚Äôs a bit more of a challenge.</p>



<p>Truth be told, it‚Äôs not overly difficult to access what you need inside. In fact, it‚Äôs kind of easy as long as you take your time.</p>



<p>With the Titan 18 HX, upgrading your memory and storage is pretty easy once you get through all of the screws at the bottom of your machine. But that‚Äôs really where the upgrades end, as you would expect. Swapping out the CPU or GPU just isn‚Äôt going to happen. And if you reach a point where you need to replace the display or other internal, you‚Äôll have to have a long talk about how much you trust yourself to make a swap.  </p>



<h2 id="h-general-usage-comes-with-some-concerns">General Usage Comes With Some Concerns</h2>



<p>Typing on the Titan 18 HX is a different kind of highlight. The Cherry MX ultra-low-profile mechanical keyboard is, to me, one of the best you‚Äôll find on a laptop, offering satisfying key travel and feedback. Long typing sessions actually feel good, which isn‚Äôt something you can always say for a gaming notebook. That said, the keyboard does tend to heat up under heavy loads, which can get uncomfortable during longer stretches of play or work. The touchpad, on the other hand, feels like a complete a miss. MSI went with a built-in haptic design that blends into the palm rest, and while it looks futuristic, it‚Äôs not always practical. Precision can be frustrating, and most people will end up relying on a mouse instead. More on that in a moment.</p>



<p>Naturally, performance at this level comes with tradeoffs. The cooling system‚Äîdual fans paired with a vapor chamber‚Äîdoes a solid job of keeping things in check, but when the laptop is under stress, it gets loud. The fans spin up past the point where you‚Äôll want a headset just to drown them out. The system also pulls a ton of power, so battery life isn‚Äôt great. You can expect maybe two-to-three hours of light use and closer to 90 minutes or so when gaming, making it clear this is a machine meant to stay plugged in most of the time. </p>



<p>Portability isn‚Äôt just about battery life, though. Between the size of the machine itself and the power brick required to feed it, taking the Titan 18 HX on the go feels more like hauling around a workstation than a laptop. Yes, you can travel with it, but it‚Äôs not a device you‚Äôll be setting up on a cramped airplane tray table. I actually tried to take it to various events throughout the summer, but quickly realized there was no way I was going to walk around for hours with it on my back. Plus, the the combined space required for the power brick and the laptop in a bag will have you lucky to fit anything else inside.</p>



<p>On the plus side, the Titan 18 HX is well-equipped for the future. It‚Äôs packed with ports‚Äîdual Thunderbolt 5, HDMI 2.1, USB-A, Ethernet, Wi-Fi 7, and even SD card support‚Äîmaking it ready for whatever setup you want to throw at it. The AI tuning engine MSI built in can automatically adjust performance and cooling depending on what you‚Äôre doing, and storage flexibility means you‚Äôll be able to keep expanding as needs grow. In other words, this laptop isn‚Äôt just about today‚Äôs games and workloads; it‚Äôs built with an eye toward what‚Äôs coming next.</p>



<h2 id="h-msi-titan-18-hx-ai-verdict">MSI Titan 18 HX AI Verdict</h2>



<p>The MSI Titan 18 HX AI is a monster of a laptop. It‚Äôs loud, heavy, and not something you‚Äôll want to really carry around for long stretches, but it delivers performance that few portable machines can match. From high-end gaming to intensive creative work, it handles everything you throw at it with ease. Sure, the keyboard can get warm, the fans are noisy, and battery life is limited, but these are the trade-offs for having desktop-level power in a ‚Äúlaptop‚Äù form.</p>



<p>This isn‚Äôt a device for everyone, but for creators, gamers, or tech enthusiasts who want a, somewhat, future-proof powerhouse they can move between locations, the Titan 18 HX makes a strong case. It‚Äôs a showcase of what‚Äôs possible when performance takes priority, and for those who need the absolute best, it‚Äôs hard to ignore.</p>
