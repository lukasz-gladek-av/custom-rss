<p>Whether you believe it or not, COD Mobile actually has quite the competitive scene. With many large tournaments held across the world, the game has grown immensely in popularity, but what about its ranked system?</p>



<p>Here are all the COD Mobile ranks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-mobile-all-ranks-from-worst-to-best">COD Mobile: All Ranks from Worst to Best</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grandmaster</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>COD Mobile does not follow the traditional ranked system, such as the Bronze, Silver and Gold ranked system. However, it does split some of the ranks listed above into different levels.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-rookie">Rookie</h3>



<p>Rookie is the lowest rank in COD Mobile, where many gamers start out. Here is every Rookie rank:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-veteran">Veteran</h3>



<p>Following the Rookie rank is Veteran (which seems like it should be the name for the top rank). Here is every Veteran rank in COD Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Veteran I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-elite">Elite</h3>



<p>Elite is the next rank in COD Mobile, which also is split into multiple segments. Here is every Elite rank:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Elite I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-pro">Pro</h3>



<p>Considered the middle rank in COD Mobile, the Pro rank is filled with players who probably play the shooter game regularly, so if you make it this far, then consider yourself a COD gamer.</p>



<p>Here is every Pro rank in COD Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pro I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-master">Master</h3>



<p>Master is the next rank in COD Mobile and the first one without any split segments. Once you hit Master, you will not have to worry about progressing through the rank. </p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-grandmaster">Grandmaster</h3>



<p>Grandmaster is the second to last rank in COD Mobile, meaning you will need to be quite the gamer to make it this far. However, it is not the last and will be extremely difficult to rank up from here.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-legendary">Legendary</h3>



<p>Legendary is the rank all COD Mobile gamers strive for, but very few ever hit. It takes quite a few COD points to make it this far, so if you are ever good enough to hit Legendary, take yourself out for a nice steak dinner to celebrate.</p>



<p>Jump into COD Mobile now and start ranking up so you can hit Legendary.</p>

<p>Whenever you’re excited about an upcoming game, especially one as unique and eclectic as Slitterhead, you want to check out the game’s system requirements beforehand. It’s wise to prepare, though you’re unlikely to upgrade your system for a single game. But hey, you can temper your expectations. Here’s a look at the Slitterhead system requirements before launch!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-run-slitterhead-s-system-requirements-successfully">Can You Run Slitterhead’s System Requirements Successfully?</h2>



<p>While most of Slitterhead’s PC system requirements don’t appear overly challenging for most gaming computers nowadays, the processor on the recommended requirements side of the spectrum may throw a wrench in the works for many players. Do you think your system can handle the upcoming horror game?</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3400</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB / AMD Radeon RX 580</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 30 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>

<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 30 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-when-can-you-play-slitterhead">When Can You Play Slitterhead?</h2>



<p>If you’re eager to get your hands on the latest horror game from one of the minds behind the original Silent Hill, then you’re in luck because Slitterhead is nearly out in the world. The horror game officially launches on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on <strong>November 8</strong>.</p>



<p>Based on early critic reviews, it’s a mixed reception. Many believe the combat is relatively weak, with plenty of bugs and rough edges that mar the overall experience. Other critics, however, think Slitterhead is worthy of your collection, especially if you’re a horror gaming fan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-1-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-1-4-aims-to-improve-combat-and-embrace-player-choice.1027401/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-1-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>There was a lot about Star Wars Outlaws that I thoroughly enjoyed, but its combat wasn’t one of them. I cheesed the system whenever possible, using stealth or outright taking a long route around enemies to avoid combat. It felt awkward, clunky, and barebones. Apparently, that will all change with Star Wars Outlaws title update 1.4, which aims to improve the game’s feel and approach, specifically combat, and embrace player-choice-driven gameplay, allowing you to tackle encounters and missions more freely. It’s a welcome change that we hope will entice returning players.</p>



<p>This reveal stems from a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent official blog post</a> by the Star Wars Outlaws team, which also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-full-release-star-wars-outlaws-get-new-creative-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed a new Creative Director, Drew Rechner</a>, who is taking over for Julian Gerighty. For now, let’s focus on the gameplay enhancements coming in title update 1.4, namely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we’ve focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions particularly around stealth, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we’re looking to improve the game even further.</em></p>



<p><em>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter. Finally, our third key area of focus is centered around the character controls, which means improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls overall.</em></p>



<p><em>You can expect to see more details about how we will be celebrating and embracing player choice more than ever before, whether it’s sneaking through encounters, going in blasters-blazing, or everything in-between. We will provide more specific details about the changes to these areas and more in the upcoming weeks as we provide further updates to you. All of this will culminate in the release of Title Update 1.4 which will release on November 21st alongside the Steam launch and first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thankfully, we don’t have to wait long—Star Wars Outlaws title update 1.4 launches alongside the game on Steam on <strong>November 21</strong>.</p>

<p>The popular video game, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, which was released back in 2019, just had images leaked online of it being tested on PSN (PlayStation Network). Since its release, the game has been a staple within the PC and Xbox community but has not seen the light of day on a PlayStation console in over a decade.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-being-tested-on-psn">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition Being Tested on PSN</h2>



<p>The original Age of Empires II was first released back in 1999. For its 20th anniversary, the game got the Definitive Edition just back in 2019. Xbox and PC gamers were lucky enough to indulge in this classic, but it has barely ever been seen on PlayStation consoles. In fact, no Age of Empires game has ever been released on a PlayStation console since the PS2.</p>



<p>However, leaked images online show that PSN subscribers could soon be getting the title brought over to their respective consoles.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leak first surfaced when Reddit user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/draconis90/">u/draconis90</a>, posted the image above on Reddit, which shows two players playing the game on PlayStation. </p>



<p>However, the user also states that this could just be a graphics bug.</p>



<p>Still, not too long ago, Tom Warren, a Senior Editor at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>, leaked that the game could be getting a PlayStation release in the early months of 2025. Still, no known information has been released since except for the leaked image above.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-this-all-mean">What Does This All Mean?</h2>



<p>So, what does all of this mean? Will Age of Empires fans finally be getting a title on PlayStation? Or is it simply just a bug that appeared? </p>



<p>While many are speculating on whether or not this image is real, there have been zero other gamers to emerge and claim they have seen the same glitch happen in their game.</p>



<p>Tell us your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p>I wasn’t among the countless who positively despised Star Wars Outlaws upon its release. Sure, it wasn’t the best open-world game, but it certainly wasn’t the worst. It was missing something, and apparently, Ubisoft feels the same, as its latest blog post for the game announces not only Title Update 1.4 but also the fact that Star Wars Outlaws has a new Creative Director, Drew Rechner, who is taking over for Julian Gerighty.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official blog post</a> on the Star Wars Outlaws site, Ubisoft said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Outlaws,</em></p>



<p><em>I’m very excited to be stepping into the role of Creative Director on Star Wars Outlaws and to be working with the incredibly passionate team here at Massive Entertainment along with our talented co-development studios around the world and Lucasfilm Games. I would like to personally thank you, our community, for your positive response to the game. We see and love all the fan arts, comments, and videos you’ve created around the game, and it continues to provide joy and inspiration to the team. We truly hope you’re enjoying your journey across the Outer Rim with Kay and Nix thus far.</em></p>



<p><em>I also want to take the time to say that we hear not only your positive feedback, but your constructive feedback as well. Thank you for sharing with us and helping us make the game even better. Today, I want to share with you the next priority areas we are looking to address to ensure that Star Wars Outlaws is the best experience possible for you.</em></p>



<p><em>From before launch and continuing into post-launch, we have been gathering data from and listening to you. This takes place not only formally through our analytics, user tests, reviews and media feedback, our Star Wars Outlaws Bug Reporter, crash reports, and other mechanisms, but also informally when we see your YouTube videos and Reddit, Discord or other social media posts. We deeply care about your experience with the game, and use all the data and feedback possible to see the friction points you are encountering, what you’re enjoying, and where we can further improve certain elements that matter the most to you.</em></p>



<p><em>Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we’ve focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions particularly around stealth, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we’re looking to improve the game even further.</em></p>



<p><em>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter.

<p><em>You can expect to see more details about how we will be celebrating and embracing player choice more than ever before, whether it’s sneaking through encounters, going in blasters-blazing, or everything in-between. We will provide more specific details about the changes to these areas and more in the upcoming weeks as we provide further updates to you. All of this will culminate in the release of Title Update 1.4 which will release on November 21st alongside the Steam launch and first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</em></p>



<p><em>To our players, thank you again for your support and feedback, and we hope you will enjoy continuing exploring the galaxy with us. And if you’re new to the game, there’s never been a better time to experience the Outer Rim with Kay and Nix!</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’re unsure what’s coming in the next Star Wars Outlaws update. According to the post, the community has highly requested fixes and features, and there are likely plenty of quality-of-life tweaks, but there’s no telling just yet. The team promises to share more about Star Wars Outlaws Title Update 1.4 on social media later, but it’s scheduled to hit on November 21st, so we expect to hear more soon!</p>

<p>By now, you’ve undoubtedly heard about the Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-says-star-wars-outlaws-performance-contributed-to-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did you know Star Wars Outlaws’ performance directly contributed to Ubisoft’s decision</a>? It’s true, and Insider Gaming reported on the matter recently!</p>
