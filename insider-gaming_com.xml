<p>It’s been eight years since the original the Nintendo Switch was revealed to fans. Now it’s time for the world to get a full look at its successor, the Nintendo Switch 2 with a special Nintendo Direct presentation.</p>



<p>The event will last <strong>around 60 minutes</strong> in total and feature a full look at the console, its features, release plans, and even launch games. One game many expect to be revealed is the next Mario Kart title, Mario Kart 9. It should also be assumed that Nintendo will drop a few surprise announcements to get fans excited about its latest system.</p>



<p>The show begins at&nbsp;<strong>9am ET/6am PT&nbsp;</strong>on Wednesday and will be updated throughout. That means all of the announcements below is listed in the order they appeared.</p>



<p>Before and during the show, make sure you let us know down below what you are most excited about with the Nintendo Switch 2. And join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-everything-announced-at-the-nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct">Everything Announced At The Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</h2>



<p><strong>Mario Kart World</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo kicked off the show with its latest installment of the Mario Kart franchise, Mario Kart World. The game will launch exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2. It features a free roam, 24-player races, and rolling starts. The game will launch on the same day as the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<figure></figure>



<hr>



<p><strong>The C Is For Chatting</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo has lifted the veil off the mysterious “C” button. The new “GameChat” button will allow players to chat with other players online through the console for the first time. This seemingly removes the need for the third-party app that online players of the original Nintendo Switch required. It also allows for screen sharing between players. </p>



<p>Using GameChat requires Nintendo Switch Online.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s time for another breakout sensation in the indie gaming space. We always love to see it, and Schedule 1 has come out of nowhere to occupy millions of hours of players’ playtime to create kingpins in the making.</p>



<p>Step aside, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a>, it’s time for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> to shine. I say that, but REPO continues to smash it and show there’s hope for all indie titles. Now and again, a game comes out of nowhere to RKO the gaming scene. Balatro did it in 2024, Among Us before it, and now Schedule 1 is doing the same. </p>



<p>Oddly enough, unlike REPO, which attracted a decent amount of Steam Wishlist interest, Schedule 1 has been even more low-key. This hasn’t stopped hundreds of millions of players from literally cooking up a storm.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-schedule-1">What is Schedule 1?</h2>

<p>Schedule 1 is a crime simulator where you need to cultivate drugs and grow your vast empire across Hyland Point. Its official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> says: “Produce a range of&nbsp;drugs&nbsp;to satisfy your customers, each one with its own unique production process. Discover&nbsp;special recipes&nbsp;to create new drug variants with special properties.”</p>



<p>I can’t think of many drug simulators off the top of my head. This is probably why Schedule 1 has amassed an <strong>all-time peak of 412,713 concurrent players</strong>. We’re only 10 days removed from launch, making this figure even more staggering.</p>



<p>Right now, <strong>Schedule 1 is currently fourth in Steam’s “Top Games” list</strong>, and word of mouth is spreading minute by minute. For comparison, <strong>REPO’s all-time peak is 266,908</strong>—another unbelievable feat.</p>



<p>The sky is currently the limit for Schedule 1. With an extensive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap of content</a> already planned and potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console ports</a> on the cards, we’ll take a step back now and enjoy this high.</p>



<p>Head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a> to discuss your Schedule 1 experience with other members.</p>

<p>Schedule 1 attracted several hundred thousand players in its first week alone. The developer has outlined a consistent line of plans and future content updates for Schedule 1 through a detailed roadmap.</p>



<p>If you took one look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> as an outsider, you’d think it was a South Park-inspired game about drugs. The art style could sway this argument, but Schedule 1 is big and beastly enough to cement its own identity and status as one of 2025’s biggest indie titles. </p>



<p>Developer TVGS is releasing a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patches</a> to keep the experience smooth and steady. But Schedule 1’s future is looking very bright, and we’ve looked at what we’ve all got to look forward to.</p>

<p>Here’s a look at the developer’s ideas for Schedule 1 and which category they fall under. We love the transparency, and it means if you’re enjoying Schedule 1, you have tangible reasons to keep coming back.</p>

<h2 id="h-schedule-1-roadmap-explained">Schedule 1 Roadmap Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The official Schedule 1 Trello board has an extensive list of “Monthly Update Ideas and “Smaller Additions/Improvements.” These are listed under the “Schedule 1 Roadmap,” and each list features an assortment of new activities, gameplay ideas, mechanics, and quality-of-life ideas.</strong></p>



<p>An “In Progress” column also exists. As of writing, this is empty, so we presume TVGS is focusing on either taking some downtime to recover from the overwhelming start, hasn’t updated the <a href="https://trello.com/b/VQQpru3F/schedule-i-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1 Trello</a> yet, or is getting ready to work on a new update.</p>



<p>We’ll keep checking in to see what new ideas are floating around for Schedule 1.</p>

<p>Steam has been flooded by players desperate to play Schedule 1—a sleeper breakthrough. It’s shot to popularity on PC, but we’re here to see if you can play it on PlayStation or Xbox consoles.</p>



<p>It’s amazing what the power of the grapevine and word of mouth can do. 2025’s indie sensation was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> for the longest time, but in the blink of an eye, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> kindly asked it to move over. Your meteoric ascendancy to head of Hyland Point is fueled by drugs, and the unique gameplay has turned more than a few heads.</p>



<p>Its player count has dominated the top of Steam Charts for a while, so let’s see if PlayStation and Xbox users can get in on the deal.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-schedule-1-on-ps5">Can You Play Schedule 1 on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This isn’t sus. Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As per the Schedule 1 Discord, you can’t play the crime simulator on PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 as it stands.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1256767987873091664/1267444919295803544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1 Discord</a> is home to all answers and questions about the game. But one that pops up frequently is if the title is lining up a PS4 or PS5 experience anytime soon.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the answer is a definite no for now. This might change in the future, though, depending on the success of the indie title—although if it carries on this way it won’t be “indie” for much longer!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-schedule-1-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Schedule 1 on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s also bad news for Microsoft fans as Schedule 1 isn’t available on Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>Let’s head back to the Schedule 1 Discord for a second. An official question is posed asking: “Will it (Schedule I) be available on Xbox/Playstation?” The developer has answered this: “<strong>Unfortunately not on release, but potentially in the future, depending on how gracious Sony/Microsoft are.</strong>“</p>



<p>I’m not entirely sure what they mean by “how gracious Sony/Microsoft are.” This might relate to the nature of the content and not allowing it on the PS or Xbox Store, but I feel this is unlikely, as we’ve seen worse. Regardless, like any indie hit on Steam, the initial buzz for Schedule 1 is outrageous, and it’s a huge success.</p>



<p>If the game can buck the trend of seeing its initial popularity disappear and become a long-standing hit in the vein of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/among-us-animated-series-trailer-revealed-during-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us</a>, it would be <em>dope </em>to see it on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later on.</p>



<hr>



<p>Converse with fellow Schedule 1 players in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Official Forum</a>. You can talk about the new title, whether you think it can keep its success going, and ask for specific guides for the game.</p>

<p>Inzoi has barely been out, and it’s already got the famous WickedWhims mod seen in The Sims. The user-created content is designed to let you experience Inzoi in a more unrestricted and uncensored fashion, and it was only a matter of time.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-sims-25th-birthday-bundle-all-included-dlc-for-the-sims-1-and-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sims</a> has always taken a lighthearted approach to intimate human activity. The action is usually pixelated and presented in a comedic yet casual fashion. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> is 2025’s realistic take on everyday life and features the usual hustle and bustle of existence: Jobs, Taxes, Death, and the creation of life.</p>



<p>It also keeps any intimate moments well hidden. But if you install the WickedWhims mod, you might want to play privately. </p>



<h2 id="h-controversial-the-sims-wickedwhims-mod-arrives-in-inzoi">Controversial The Sims WickedWhims Mod Arrives in Inzoi</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The mod gives you action more intense than this. Credit to Inzoi Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>X user <a href="https://x.com/WickedWhims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TURBODRIVER</a> is back at it again with mods. They are the creator of the WickedWhims mods—as seen in The Sims. In Inzoi, it allows you to “Undress anything you want at any moment without censorship getting in the way.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, you can: “Get on a bed, or on a sofa, or the floor, or anywhere you want to get freaky with anybody you want.” The mod promises fully interactive animations and realistic interactions between Zois. This is only possible because the game doesn’t support <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-inzoi-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deunvo</a>.</p>



<p>The official mod’s site has four simple instructions required to install the mod. Once you’ve done this, your copy of Inzoi becomes steamier and hotter in a matter of seconds! Don’t say we didn’t warn you.</p>



<p>Inzoi has already been in the headlines of late as it was discovered you could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run over children</a>. This was later addressed by the developer who claimed the action to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bug, and it was patched</a>.</p>



<p>Let us know your thoughts on Inzoi over in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.
