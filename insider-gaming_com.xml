            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation has today unveiled a monumental $45 million commitment to the players, teams, and organizations participating in the upcoming Esports Nations Cup. The event is set to unravel in Riyadh in November, and it’s in addition to the staggering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-2026-prize-pool-75-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$75 million Esports World Cup</a>, which begins in July.</p>



<p>While the Esports World Cup is centered around traditional organizations fielding teams across multiple games, the Esports Nations Cup is a country-based competition circuit that encourages national pride, amongst other things.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-ewcf-has-pledged-120-million-to-esports">The EWCF Has Pledged $120 Million to Esports</h2>



<p>The headline here is that the Esports World Cup Foundation, backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, has pledged an eye-watering $120 million to the esports space this year alone.</p>



<p>From November 2 to November 29, a host of countries will send their squads to Riyadh to compete across a slew of games, fighting for prize pools, recognition, and geographical bragging rights. In a press release, the $45 million pledge was broken down accordingly:</p>



<ul>
<li>$20 million in prize money, spread across 16 titles</li>



<li>$5 million in Club incentives for clubs that release and enable their professional players to participate in the ENC</li>



<li>$20 million through the ENC Development Fund, supporting partners with logistics, travel, marketing, and growth</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s hard to see a downside to this venture, as $20 million being set aside to help organizations get to this global stage is admirable, if nothing else.</p>



<p>In the release, the CEO of the EWCF, Ralf Reichert, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>National teams bring a powerful new layer to esports, one that is accessible, intuitive, and rooted in identity and pride. Clubs are the cultural backbone of esports. Nation-based competition expands the stage, creates new rivalries, and gives more fans a reason to care from day one. </p>



<p>Our prize model is designed to keep competition fair and sustainable, rewarding performance while supporting the long-term development of players, Clubs, and national programs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thus far, the EWCF has announced only a few titles out of the 16 coming to the Esports Nations Cup:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</li>



<li>Trackmania</li>



<li>Dota 2</li>
</ul>



<p>More games will be announced in the coming days.</p>

<p>Call of Duty’s iconic map has made its way into Hytale thanks to the hardworking modders. </p>



<p>Hytale is still in early access; however, modders have been hard at work to make the experience as enjoyable as possible. Over the past few days, we have seen the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-is-coming-to-hytale-through-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-minecraft-crossplay-mod-has-been-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft crossplay</a>, and more make it to the title. Now, Activision’s iconic FPS franchise has joined the fray as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-now-has-call-of-duty-s-hijacked-and-cod-like-zombies-mod">Hytale Now Has Call of Duty’s Hijacked and Cod-Like Zombies Mod</h2>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/hytale-modders-have-recreated-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WindowsCentral</a>, Call of Duty mods have now been integrated into Hytale. One modder has successfully added maps, including Hijacked from Black Ops 2, among others. Additionally, this mod transforms Hytale into a genuine first-person shooter, allowing players to engage in intense deathmatches with bullets flying from every direction. It also tracks kills and deaths, making the experience as close to a traditional first-person shooter as possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Meta’s recent earnings report revealed that its virtual reality division lost over $19 billion in the last year. </p>



<p>Earlier this month, Meta announced it would scale back its gaming presence, laying off 10% of Reality Labs staff. This led to the supposed cancellation of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/harry-potter-vr-game-canceled-by-meta-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter VR game</a>, as well as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-likely-canceled-after-meta-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman Arkham Shadow sequel</a>. Now, a new report reveals just how much they have lost in this business. </p>











<p>According to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-says-reality-labs-will-eventually-stop-losing-so-much-money-222900157.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechCrunch</a> report, Meta’s latest <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results-302673127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings</a> reveal that its virtual reality division incurred a $19.1 billion loss in 2025, up from a $17.7 billion loss the previous year. Of this total, $6.2 billion was lost in the fourth quarter alone. Mark Zuckerberg also mentioned that the company will focus most of its investments on “glasses and wearables” for the Reality Labs division moving forward.</p>



<p>The CEO stated that there will be an increased focus on Horizon, Meta’s VR social ecosystem, trying to make it a “massive success on mobile.” The goal is to turn virtual reality into a profitable ecosystem. Zuckerberg also mentioned that losses are expected to remain similar this year; however, he believes that the losses in 2025 are likely to be the “peak” and will gradually decrease thereafter. Interested readers can find the complete statement below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on Mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years. I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year, and this will likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.”</p>
