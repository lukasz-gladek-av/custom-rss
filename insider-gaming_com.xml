<p>We’re set for our first meaty look at The Outer Worlds 2 on June 8—courtesy of a Direct Showcase. We don’t know how long it will last, but it’s confirmed that the presentation will lift the lid on much of Obsidian’s sci-fi sequel.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/outer-worlds-spacers-choice-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds</a> was one of my favorite games of 2019. It included a lot of what I love about Fallout, but added its own shine and humor in a refreshing way! The Outer Worlds 2 being announced at The Game Awards 2024 was a pleasant surprise, and it had to come with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funny trailer</a> reminding us all what it’s about.</p>



<p>Obsidian has been quiet about The Outer Worlds 2 ever since. Its development, release, and support of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> likely had a lot to do with this. The Outer Worlds 2 Direct signals full-steam ahead for the successor.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase 2025</a> takes place on June 8. Soon after it finishes, we jump straight into The Outer Worlds 2 Direct.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-2025-outer-worlds-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a> newsletter said this on April 9: “Immediately following [Xbox Games] Showcase,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;Direct will bring you inside the walls of Obsidian Entertainment, revealing new gameplay, details, and developer insights, straight from the people making the sequel to the award-winning, first-person sci-fi RPG.</p>



<p>You can catch all the action through Xbox’s many channels, including YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and much more.</p>

<p>With a distinct absence of new Fallout video games, The Outer Worlds 2 has a chance to plug a space-sized hole. Share your favorite memories and stories of The Outer Worlds below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/you-might-want-to-check-nintendo-switch-2-camera-resolutions-before-you-regret-your-decision/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If something’s too good to be true, it usually is. The new Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera is the clear choice on paper. Having the prickly piranha next to your TV and Switch 2 is a dream, but its low-resolution image might taint the purchase.</p>



<p>Engagement with friends and family and social interconnectivity is huge in the Switch 2’s marketing. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> opened with a glorious package for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, and segued nicely into Switch 2 features such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-is-for-gamechat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C-Button</a> and using cameras to broadcast you in real-time to playing partners.</p>



<p>A line of official cameras can send an image of you to anyone you’re playing Switch 2 games with. The official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera looks professional, but the Piranha Plant Camera looks fun. However, there’s a drastic reduction in the latter’s camera resolution and quality.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-camera-offers-big-differences-in-resolution">Nintendo Switch 2 Camera Offers Big Differences in Resolution</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Which will you go for? Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera outputs a solid <strong>1080p</strong>; on the other hand, the Piranha Plant Camera barely pushes out <strong>640×480</strong>.</p>



<p>It certainly explains the price difference between <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo</a>‘s two devices. You’re looking at <strong>$49.99/£49.99</strong> for the official camera and <strong>$43.99/£33.99</strong> for the Piranha Plant. Given that almost anything licensed costs more, there had to be a catch somewhere, making the Piranha Plant cheaper.</p>



<p>Now you have the answer. If you were planning on picking up a Switch 2 camera, think carefully about whether you choose quality or an unquestionably amazing design for a camera.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-gamecube-controller-not-compatible-with-switch-2-games-just-gamecube-classics/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s come to the Nintendo community’s attention that the new Nintendo GameCube Controller—set to launch with the Switch 2—can is only usable with the limited collection of classic GameCube titles via Nintendo Switch Online.</p>



<p>A cool bonus during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> was the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-online-adds-gamecube-games-to-nintendo-switch-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameCube integration for Switch Online</a>. Nintendo’s library of retro games is growing even more, thanks to GameCube additions. Legendary properties, including Pokémon Stadium and Super Mario Sunshine, will make up the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.</p>



<p>A line of official Nintendo GameCube Controllers are coming too—featuring the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-is-for-gamechat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C-Button</a>. But if you’re looking to grab this super-special controller, take heed of its limited capabilities.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-t-use-new-gamecube-controller-with-nintendo-switch-2-games">You Can’t Use New GameCube Controller With Nintendo Switch 2 Games</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s very restrictive. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The “Classic Nintendo GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch 2!” video on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoUK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo UK YouTube channel</a> features an explainer of the new GameCube Expansion features. We also get treated to a look at the new GameCube controller, but a small-print message toward the end is easily missed. </p>



<p>At <strong>2:13</strong>, a message at the top of the screen reads: “<strong>The controller is only compatible with Nintendo GameCube—Nintendo Classics.</strong>“</p>



<p>The controller isn’t expected to be cheap, and it’s also quite exclusive. It’s only: “Available for Nintendo Switch Online members” on the My Nintendo Store. Unless you’re a die-hard Nintendo or GameCube fan or collector, this is another big cost for a piece of hardware only usable with a small handful of games.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Between the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price of the Switch 2</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost-physical-digital-game-prices-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of the games</a>, and even a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2s-paid-tutorial-welcome-tour-almost-made-a-player-fall-asleep-at-nintendo-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid tutorial</a>, the Switch 2 costs soon adds up. Are you desperate for a new GameCube controller? Or is this one step too far, and you’re looking to use the new Pro Controller or Joy Con 2?</p>
