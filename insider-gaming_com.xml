<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlestate-games/" id="1450">Battlestate Games</a> has published a preliminary roadmap for the first half of 2026, and it includes some juicy content updates. The game went wide in November with the long-awaited 1.0 release, and Battlestate Games has been keeping the pipeline plugged with patches and events ever since.</p>



<p>In Patch 1.0.5.0, which will land in Q2 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> players will come face to face with a new boss character, introduced via a ‘large-scale in-game event’, amongst other things.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-2026-roadmap-is-looking-good">Tarkov’s 2026 Roadmap is Looking Good</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled the Escape from Tarkov roadmap that takes us to the end of Q2 (around June-July). The heart of the roadmap sits with EFT Patch 1.0.5.0, which features a new <strong>boss character</strong>, who is currently unnamed and unidentified, and a large-scale in-game event, which will presumably <strong>announce </strong>said character.</p>



<p>Before we get to that, we’ve got EFT Patch 1.0.4.0:</p>



<ul>
<li>DLSS 4.5</li>



<li>Technical improvements to story task functionality and reward distribution</li>



<li>Reworked weapon animations and movement while aiming</li>



<li>Sound effects for dropped magazines</li>



<li>Balancing fixes, QoL changes, and cumulative fixes based on player feedback</li>



<li>Raid reconnect system rework</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition to the new boss event in Tarkov in Q2, users can also expect:</p>



<ul>
<li>Technical improvements focused on reducing the match loading and exit times, as well as improving the interface performance outside of raids</li>



<li>Culling system update focused on improving in-raid performance (<strong>finally</strong>)</li>



<li>Vegetation rework across all locations</li>



<li>Balancing fixes, QoL changes, and cumulative fixes based on player feedback</li>



<li>New PMC customization options</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at Battlestate promised that more is coming in the second half of 2026. Fans of the popular extraction shooter are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the game’s first DLC drop, which, from what we know, will focus on living life as a Scav character. We don’t know what that’ll look like, but given that it’s <strong><em>technically </em></strong>half of the base game (PMC vs. Scav character), it should be sizeable.</p>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 18, 2026, Quordle is the #1486 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="block-44882c9d-d6a6-4e4f-9b1a-8312ae0b3036">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 19.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

<p>Bringing the Highguard website back up is low priority for the developers as they focus on updates and content. </p>



<p>For those unaware, right before we learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-backed-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese conglomerate Tencent</a> was the “lead financial backer” of Wildlight Entertainment, we were also told the game’s website was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-website-is-currently-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unavailable</a>. Since then, the website has been unavailable, but the developers have finally addressed its status. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-devs-says-website-is-being-transferred-and-simplified">Highguard Devs Says Website is Being “Transferred and Simplified’ </h2>



<p>On the official Highguard <a href="https://discord.gg/euAUhFmZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> (via Rebs Gaming on <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024041021231739134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>), one of the developers finally addressed the website’s situation. When asked, the developer revealed that the website was down as it was being “transferred and simplified”. They are not sure about the timeframe, as “reputational damage (is) already done,” and are currently focusing on delivering new updates and content to improve the game for players. </p>



<p>The developer was also asked whether the team would refresh the previously communicated roadmap or keep it the same. The dev responded, stating that they doubt the roadmap will be restated, as they need to target player feedback to improve, not just content. However, saying that, the developer also revealed that a “lot of that content still coming out and probably sooner.” The developer in question is a designer on the team who has worked on Wardens, Base Select, Movement, and more aspects of the game. </p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<p>It was recently revealed that Battlefield 6’s development team was ‘biting their nails’ in anxiety at the Battlefield 6 roadmap. In a bid to push for a bold resurgence, Battlefield Studios tried to roll out a hefty update for the game’s second season, as well as evolving REDSEC somewhat, but it hasn’t proven to be as much of an adrenaline hit as they wanted.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> season two update was released <strong>yesterday</strong>, and it failed to bring back a considerable enough amount of players to call it a successful content drop. Similarly, viewership failed to increase, suggesting that nobody is interested in <strong>watching </strong>the game, just as much as they are losing interest in playing it.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-continues-to-backslide">Battlefield 6 Continues to Backslide</h2>



<p>When Battlefield 6 dropped in October, it was to a stellar reception that praised the game’s multiplayer platform to no end. The single-player portion was a take-it-or-leave-it delivery, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/redsec/" id="3151">REDSEC</a> turned out to be a fledgling battle royale that failed to make waves, but the multiplayer element of the game felt solid.</p>



<p>Since the game launched, interest has waned as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-studios/" id="2832">Battlefield Studios</a> has watched its player count slowly collapse. There was hope that players would either <strong>return to </strong>Battlefield 6 or <strong>discover </strong>the game with the deployment of the season two update, but that hasn’t been the case.</p>



<p>If we use Steam as a representative example, we can see that the player count hit 92,281 as the second season was released. But on a random Sunday afternoon on January 25th, <strong>with no new content drops</strong>, the game hit 97,959 players on the same platform. The game jumped somewhat in the last 24 hours, but not enough to dub the new season a <strong>resurgence</strong>.</p>



<p>For reference, the game reached 747,440 concurrent players upon release in October 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>To put this into further perspective, ARC Raiders was released just a couple of weeks <strong>after </strong>Battlefield 6 and had a peak player count of 481,966 users on Steam. In the last 24 hours, it hit a peak of 215,978 users.</p>



<p>We can then turn our attention to viewership, which hasn’t fared much better.</p>



<p>Last year, Battlefield 6 hit a whopping 868,520 concurrent viewers, a peak that few games have managed to achieve over the years. Once upon a time, more than 17,000 streamers were broadcasting Battlefield 6 at the same time.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the 24 hours that saw the arrival of season two, we saw the peak viewer count jump from about 3,000 users to 27,000, leaving Battlefield 6 as the 75th most-viewed game on Twitch. It’s possible we’d see more growth going into the weekend, which is when around 30% <strong>more people </strong>tend to consume Battlefield content, but it’s unlikely.</p>



<p>Using ARC Raiders as another comparison point, we see the peak of 372,816 viewers at launch holds much firmer with a 24-hour peak of 116,000, which is about typical for Embark Studios’ extraction adventure title.</p>



<p>It’s not Highguard levels of implosion, but Battlefield 6 players fear the counts will continue to slide as folks lose interest in the game that was designed to recapture the excitement of a floundering franchise.</p>
