<p>One of the biggest sports superstars (or SIU-perstar) and soccer sensation Cristiano Ronaldo is officially joining the roster of playable fighters in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. One of the most popular figures in sports and social media will have a soccer-themed set of attacks, and can hit his trademark celebration.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-closest-cristiano-ronaldo-will-ever-come-to-joining-wolves">The Closest Cristiano Ronaldo Will Ever Come to Joining Wolves</h2>



<p>Ronaldo <a href="https://x.com/Cristiano/status/1904942189102182598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that he would join Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves today, announcing the news to his 115.1 million followers on X (the third most on the platform). He also posted the trailer on his Instagram account, where he has the most followers of anyone on the world: a staggering 651 million followers. Ronaldo will be voiced by voice actor Juan Felipe Sierra.</p>



<p>One of the most recognizable faces in sports and social media is now joining one of the most recognized and beloved fighting game franchises. The original Fatal Fury: King of Fighters released in 1991, and was created by Takashi Nishiyama, the creator of the original Street Fighter. The series was immensely popular in the 1990s, but an original game has not released since Mark of the Wolves came out in 1999, though there have been several ports of different titles in recent years.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>News of the first Fatal Fury game in over 20 years first emerged at EVO 2022, when a new title was announced on stage at the world’s biggest fighting game tournament. Street Fighter characters Ken Masters and Chun-Li will join the roster as part of the first season of downloadable content. Ronaldo was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ronaldo-fatal-fury-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first linked to Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves back in September</a>, when he posted a teaser that said: “A legendary player joins a legendary game.” Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is also one of several titles that will be featured at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this summer; Ronaldo currently plays in the Saudi Pro League for club Al Nassr.</p>



<p>Will you be a Ronaldo main when Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves releases on April 24th? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-exclusives-are-dominating-playstation-store%E2%80%99s-pre-order-charts.1145655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-exclusives-are-dominating-playstation-stores-pre-order-charts/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Xbox exclusives like Indiana Jones, The Great Circle, and Forza Horizon 5 are at the top of PlayStation Store’s pre-order section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-forza-horizon-5-best-selling-playstation-5-ps5-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, if you head over to the PlayStation Store’s pre-orders <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/3bf499d7-7acf-4931-97dd-2667494ee2c9/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a>, it is visible that Xbox exclusives are dominating the PlayStation Store. Moreover, it’s not just one edition of these games; both standard and premium editions of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle and Forza Horizon 5 are the most pre-ordered games on the PlayStation Store right now.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-exclusives-have-overtaken-playstation-exclusives-in-pre-orders">Xbox Exclusives have Overtaken PlayStation Exclusives in Pre-Orders</h2>



<p>Interestingly, in pre-orders, Xbox exclusives have overtaken PlayStation exclusive Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. The game’s digital deluxe edition stands at the 6th position in the pre-order charts, and the standard edition barely reached the top 10 (at the time of writing). Third-party title, The First Berserker: Khazan’s standard edition is 5th in the PlayStation Store’s pre-order charts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at their performance, it seems like Xbox made the right decision by bringing their exclusives on PlayStation. Players are ready to invest money not just in the standard editions of the game but also shell out more to get access to additional content for these titles. Interestingly, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle’s pre-orders opened just a few days ago, and they have already beaten every other game on the PlayStation Store within such a short period.</p>



<p>In other news, an Xbox blog post accidentally leaked a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-blog-post-accidentally-leaks-steam-tab-in-user-interface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam tab in its UI</a>. Also, PS5 is outpacing PS4 sales, while Xbox Series <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-is-outpacing-ps4-while-xbox-series-trails-xbox-one-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trails behind</a> Xbox One. What are your thoughts on Xbox exclusives’ dominance of the PlayStation Store’s pre-order charts?

<p>The second annual Triple-I Initiative takes place on April 10, 2025, and will feature 37 game announcements from 36 studios. Games like Enshrouded and Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core are confirmed to be involved, but they won’t be the only titles on the show.</p>



<p>Like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-game-shown-at-the-triple-i-initiative-2024-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year’s debut</a>, this year’s event wont include any hosts or general advertisements. Instead, it focuses solely on games and those who make them. The showcase will feature revealed, new gameplay, demo announcements, and release date details.</p>



<p>While we don’t know all of the games making an appearance, we do know all of the studios involved with the this year’s showcase. And, based on the studios appearing, certain games could be expected to make an appearance like Endless Legend 2 from Amplitude and Outbound from Square Glade Games. Even Unfrozen is part of the showcase as they work on the new Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. The rest is up to speculation and guessing. </p>



<p>The original Triple-I Initiative featured games like Slay the Spire 2, The Rogue Prince of Persia, The Last Spell, Flintlock, V Rising, and more. If that’s any indication of what to expect, than fans should be in for quite a treat.</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of studios involved in the 2025 Triple-I Initiative below. And stick around on the day of the event for full coverage from Insider Gaming.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-is-returning-to-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1145556/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-is-returning-to-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new claim states that a Star Wars collaboration is planned for Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Season 2 ends on May 2, 2025, and post that date, according to a post by <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1904930387219874285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FNBRintel</a> on X (via <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1904931354669691269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hypex</a>), Season 3 will kick off with a Star Wars collaboration. The Star Wars collaboration will arrive as a mini-season that lasts approximately 30-35 days. The update will include a new POI based on the series, new mythics, skins, and other content.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1904931282011758877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Loolo_Wrld</a>, who recently leaked a Fortnite x <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-collaborating-with-dragon-ball-daima-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daima collaboration</a>, also corroborated the Star Wars Season 3 rumour while adding more details. Players should expect new Star Wars Bosses, NPCs, POIs, and items in Fortnite accounting to their posts. Moreover, the battle pass will seemingly feature 4-5 themed skins as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite and Star Wars have been collaborating since 2019, with new content arriving each year. Fortnite is known to have a new Star Wars collaboration or content ready for players each year on May 4, also known as Star Wars Day. Some of the most popular characters from the franchise, like the Mandalorian, Darth Vader, Han Solo, and a bunch more, have already been introduced to the game. </p>



<p>Last year, we saw the likes of Chewbacca, Dagobah Luke, Lando Calrissian, and AWR Trooper join the game. The collaboration was across several of Fortnite’s game modes, including Battle Royale, LEGO Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, and Rocket Racing. It will be interesting to see what Star Wars property Fortnite brings over this year, whether a new game, TV show, or movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Fortnite leaker has confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaker-confirms-mortal-kombat-content-is-finally-koming-to-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat content</a> is finally coming to Fortnite. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sabrina-carpenter-might-be-the-next-playable-fortnite-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a> could also be the next Fortnite Festival Icon.

<p>Lies of P: Overture is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-overture-prequel-announced-its-not-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to release</a> sometime later this summer, and new details on what players can expect have come out.</p>



<p>Thanks to a recent interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-remain-single-player-despite-refreshing-elden-ring-nightreign-says-director" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Lies of P: Overture director Choi Ji-won gave insight into where the upcoming prequel stands in terms of experience and in relation to the original Lies of P.</p>



<p>According to Choi, the story of Lies of P: Overture will be “accessible seamlessly from around chapter nine of the base game.” That means the new story is integrated into the original as opposed to being a completely standalone tale.</p>



<p>“We never really saw the development of Overture as a separate entity,” said Choi to Eurogamer. “With the base game and the expansion together, we believe that the whole entire thing delivers the game of Lies of P as how it was supposed to be experienced. We just couldn’t do that earlier on.”</p>



<p>As far as length is concerned, Lies of P: Overture will take “experience players” roughly 15-20 hours to complete. It features new locations, enemies, bosses, weapons, and characters. Two of those new weapons are a bow and claws, though not much else was given away by Choi.</p>



<p>Lastly, when it comes to what the DLC will actually be, Choi told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-director-says-overture-dlc-isnt-connected-to-base-games-massive-final-cutscene-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> in a separate interview that players should replay the base game. He says that there are various clues throughout that give hints as to what you’ll get with Overture. He also made it clear that the final cutscene of the game is unrelated to what will be in Overture. That scene—don’t worry, no spoilers here—is a tease for future adventures from the developer.</p>
