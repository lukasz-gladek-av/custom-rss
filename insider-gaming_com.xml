<p>Three Fields Entertainment is a studio in dire straits. The developers of the recently released Wreckreation have revealed that the entire company has been put on redundancy notice.</p>



<p>In a post on LinkedIn on Thursday morning, CEO Fiona Sperry wrote a length message about the situation. </p>







<p>Wreckreation launched in October, and was published by THQ Nordic, a subsidiary of Embracer. However, based on her messaging, there hasn’t been much in the way of support from the publisher.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fiona-sperry-601a0530_today-i-am-having-to-share-one-of-the-hardest-ugcPost-7402348124054376448-Yfpq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">her statement</a>, Sperry says that Three Fields Entertainment <strong>“will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future.”</strong> The studio, she said, has had to self-fund for most of 2025 and through all of the post-launch content.</p>



<p><strong>“Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form,”</strong> Sperry said. <strong>“Making this decision has been unbelievably painful.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“This is a heartbreaking moment for all of us. What makes it even harder is that we have so many things in the pipeline — multiple features, updates, and creative ideas that we were excited to bring to the game, many of which are showcased in the video we’re sharing today. These are things we genuinely believed would have continued to strengthen Wreckreation and grow its community.”</strong></p>







<p>Sperry writes that her hope is that by showing the latest internal work publicly for the first time, it will lead to funding or interest from a different company.</p>



<p><strong>“But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team,” </strong>she said. <strong>“I truly believe in the potential of this game and in the brilliance of the people who built it.”</strong></p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been revealed as the most downloaded PS5 game in the month of November 2025. </p>



<p>Black Ops 7, the latest Call of Duty title released on November 14, 2025, wasn’t able to make the same impact as previous instalments in the franchise. The game suffered the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-suffers-worst-launch-in-20-year-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst launch in Japan in its 20-year history</a>, sales were down by 50% in Europe, and it hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-metacritic-user-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">series low Metacritic user rating</a>. However, things don’t seem too bad, as it dominated the PS5 store last month. </p>
