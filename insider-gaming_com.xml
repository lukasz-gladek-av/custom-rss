<p>The Game Awards 2025 has revealed the 30 games up for Players’ Choice. The category, fully fan-voted, usually determines what fans believe to be the Game of the Year, outside of the show’s own pick.</p>



<p>After moving away from traditional media in 2014,&nbsp;The Game Awards&nbsp;has become a big celebration for the best of gaming each year. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, the streamed event has become home to several big reveals and moments. With a year as big as 2025 was for games (like Clair Obscur and Death Stranding 2), there’s plenty to root for.&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nominations for the awards</a>&nbsp;came out earlier in November and fans were surprised to see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-upsets-from-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some games left out</a> of Game of the Year contention. Luckily, as per tradition, the Players’ Choice category can help claim the public’s choice, and this year has some good ones.</p>

<p>Nintendo’s Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has not only emerged from the shadows in recent times, but it’s ready to step into the spotlight altogether with a full-scale Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-new-unlisted-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> didn’t just go off the grid after it was announced in 2017; it disappeared into obscurity. It wasn’t to be seen or heard from again until Samus and co finally got a proper update in June 2024. Aptly, everyone is primed for Metroid’s launch in 2025, and Insider Gaming has its release date, start time info, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-metroid-prime-4-beyond-release-date">What is The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Feel the power. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches exclusively on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on December 4.</strong></p>







<p>18 years after Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, the world gets to go Beyond. There will be reasons galore as to why it’s taken so long to make, but no one should think about this for now. Instead, start checking you have space on your Nintendo Switch consoles, make sure you’ve got the day booked off work, and everyone can find out why Metroid Prime 4: Beyond took so long to get here.</p>



<p>Side note: You can buy and play Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on either the Nintendo Switch or its Switch 2 upgrade. The more the merrier, especially in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/top-holiday-video-games-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Holiday</a> season!</p>

<figure><figcaption>It’s sure to make a big landing. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Almost all Nintendo first-party games go live at 7 AM PT on release day, meaning Metroid should be available at 7 AM PT on December 4, with other regions to follow.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo has said this about its first-party titles in the past. There’s no reason why it wouldn’t be the same, so here are the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release dates and times in key regions, based on existing information.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">10:00 AM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Grenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—December 5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Where Winds Meet has reached a huge milestone: 9 million players in 2 weeks since launch. </p>



<p>The free-to-play RPG from Everstone Studios and NetEase Games was expected to do well at launch after Where Winds Meet managed to surpass 10 million pre-registrations, hitting the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-hits-10m-pre-registrations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final community goal</a> ahead of the title’s launch. Now, the devs have revealed that the game only took 14 days to reach a new milestone. </p>



<h2 id="h-where-winds-meet-shows-no-signs-of-stopping">Where Winds Meet Shows No Signs of Stopping</h2>



<p>The new title from Everstone Studio and NetEase Games was released on November 14, 2025, and has been going strong ever since. It reached an all-time peak of 251,008 on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3564740/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> a week ago and has been averaging over 150,000 concurrent players at the time of writing. Where Winds Meet reached 9 million players across two platforms: PlayStation 5 and PC. The mobile release hasn’t happened yet, and pre-registrations are open at the moment. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Where Winds Meet is a Wuxia open-world action-adventure RPG set in ancient China in the tenth century. Players get to embody the role of a young swordmaster who is on a quest to&nbsp;uncover forgotten truths and solve the mysteries of their own identity. </p>



<p>The game features Wuxia—style traversal: scale rooftops, glide through the air, or use fast travel to navigate between regions swiftly. There are also options for combat, including melee, ranged, and stealth playstyles, with weapons such as swords, spears, dual blades, rope darts, bows, fans, and umbrellas. The game features over 20 unique regions with diverse characters, authentic activities, ancient cities, forgotten tombs, and much more. </p>

<h3 id="h-recording-streamer-requirements-1440p-60-fps">Recording / Streamer Requirements (1440p @ 60 FPS)</h3>



<div><p>For players who want to record, stream, or produce Hytale content with stable framerates during high-bitrate capture. The goal here is not raw FPS but consistent frametime under heavy load (large battles, complex builds, high view distance, simultaneous server simulation if in singleplayer).</p><p><strong>Suggested Setup</strong><br><strong><br></strong>● <strong>OS: </strong>64-bit Windows 10 (version 1809), Windows 11</p><p>● <strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Core i7-10700K (or equivalent), AMD Ryzen 9 3800X (or equivalent)</p><p>● <strong>RAM: </strong>32 GB</p><p>●<strong> GPU:</strong><br>○ NVIDIA RTX 30 Series<br>○ AMD Radeon RX 7000 Series<br>○ Intel Arc A-series</p><p><em>Note: These recommendations are made as newer graphics cards provide much better video quality for a given bitrate, especially for livestreaming scenarios. If supported, we also strongly recommend the use of AV1 / HEVC for video recording.</em><br><em><br></em>● <strong>Storage:</strong><br>○ NVMe SSD with at least 10% (or 50 GB) of free space available.<br><em>Note: For best performance, we recommend using a separate drive for video recording.</em><br><em><br></em>One internal benchmark (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D, NVIDIA RTX 5080, 2×32 GB DDR5-6000) sustained around 400 FPS at 3840×1440 resolution with view distance set to 768 blocks in singleplayer while recording the game in AV1. This tier is optional but helpful for creators who want stable 60+ FPS at high resolutions during recording sessions.</p></div>

<p>Fortnite devs revealed in a new post that the Chapter 7 launch featured 10.5 million players and over 3 million tuned in across livestream platforms. </p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 for Fortnite is already live, introducing players to a brand new island where the battle bus has been destroyed, and players have been tasked to collect the missing parts. Before Chapter 7 launched, Fortnite held a Zero Hour event that brought swarms of players to the title. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-launch-had-over-3-million-players-tuned-in">Fortnite Chapter 7 Launch Had Over 3 Million Players Tuned In</h2>



<p>The announcement of the new player stats comes from Fortnite’s post on <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1994855116869116102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The post states, “Absolute Cinema: 10.5M of you joined us in-game for Zero Hour, and 3M+ tuned in across livestream platforms!” Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Zero Hour event, bringing millions of players, wasn’t a surprise as it featured a jam-packed event filled with collaborations. We also saw the likes of Playboi Carti, Hatsune Miku, and more. The end also featured an Avengers: Endgame type of event, where so many past collabs of Fortnite returned.</p>



<p>For those wondering about the new chapter, Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 introduced a brand new map called Golden Coast. You have to reach this map by using Storm Surf, as the Battle Bus is out of commission. The update also introduced new gameplay features, including the addition of self-revive, drivable reboot vans, turning into bosses, and more. </p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is reportedly looking to add a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-getting-gulag-mechanic-similar-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone-style Gulag mechanic</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[The Grand Theft Auto 6 Reveal Trailer is Already Two Years Old]]></title>

<p>GTA 6 has the eyes of the world on it, from players to developers and publishers. It’s the biggest video game ever, and there’s no doubt about this. It’s been two years since Rockstar Games dropped a sacred piece of history on our laps with the GTA 6 reveal trailer, and no one’s been the same since.</p>



<p>The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> trailer debuted nearly two years to the day on December 5. Rockstar actually announced the trailer’s launch several days in advance, and it meant that everyone was locked in. We’re coming up to the trailer’s second anniversary, and it’s a moment of reflection on a long journey.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-trailer-1-turns-2-in-december">GTA 6 Trailer 1 Turns 2 In December</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Our time will all come. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s every chance Rockstar Games was going to drop GTA 6’s first trailer without warning. However, a leak beforehand forced Rockstar’s hand, and the company revealed the first trailer’s date in advance.</p>







<p>Vice City has never looked better than it did in Trailer 1. We also got our first glimpse into the mysterious new characters of Lucia and Jason. Eventually, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-2-is-live-featuring-jason-and-lucia/">GTA Trailer 2</a> <em>was </em>shadow-dropped, but it’s been two years since the record-breaking first trailer, and it’s incredible how little has been shown from the full game since—such as any discernible, official gameplay footage (not the leaks). </p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-1-allegedly-becomes-number-one-youtube-trailer-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 allegedly became the number one YouTube trailer of all time</a>.</p>



<p>We continue to wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-3-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Trailer 3</a>, and it’s amazing how ravenous the community becomes when so much as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-video-in-development-grand-theft-auto-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short in-development video of GTA 6</a> appears online!</p>



<p>The latest GTA 6 delay means it’ll be close to three years since Trailer 1 was announced. If you fancy a quick reminder of what’s coming, or feel a mini-wave of nostalgia close to Christmas, check out Grand Theft Auto 6’s reveal trailer here.</p>
