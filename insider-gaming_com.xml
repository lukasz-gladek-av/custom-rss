            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Yesterday’s Ubisoft announcement of its massive restructuring has made headlines across the industry for cancelling projects, closing down studios, and delaying projects, but one of the biggest announcements, for the most part, has been overlooked by many.</p>







<p>I am, of course, talking about the human impact of the recent restructuring and recently announced cost-cutting measures aimed to save the publisher an additional 200 million euros by the end of March 2028, which could result in thousands of more developers losing their jobs.</p>



<p>According to Ubisoft, this will be the “third and final phase” of its cost-cutting, and will end by March 2028. Ubisoft is still going through its second phase, which started four years ago and was a 300 million euro cost-cutting measure.</p>



<p>In that time, Ubisoft has decreased its headcount from 20,729 (as of September 2022) to 17,097 (as of September 2025), a reduction of 3632 developers. Ubisoft London, Osaka, San Francisco, Leamington, Halifax, and Stockholm have all closed their doors. More layoffs at the company will also be announced on February 12, 2026.</p>



<p>It doesn’t take a genius, then, to see that an additional 200 million euros in cost-cutting will lead to yet more studio closures and layoffs. Ubisoft’s third cost-cutting measure will be two-thirds of the second round, so with that round seeing 3632 jobs lost and using similar proportions, we can calculate that the next round could see approximately 2400 jobs lost by the end of March 2028.</p>



<p>On top of that, Ubisoft is set to enforce a return-to-office mandate of 5 days a week, while offering “annual allowances” for working from home. It’s a move that Ubisoft says will help with “efficiency, creativity, and collective success,” but many developers see it as another attempt to force yet more employees to leave the company as part of cost savings.</p>







<p>It’s part of Ubisoft’s strategy to prevent announcing mass layoffs (for the most part) to avoid negative press. Over the last few years, Ubisoft has continued to reduce its headcount through similar ploys, including not renewing contracts, giving developers nothing to do in the hopes they’ll leave, and enforcing RTO mandates.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-bigger-change-is-needed">A Bigger Change is Needed</h2>



<p>Ubisoft has been on a downward trend for a number of years (despite having a great future pipeline of games), but the constant mismanagement, structural changes, and lack of ownership from higher-ups have led to one of the most horrible environments for developers to work in in the games industry.</p>



<p>How are developers meant to get excited about their work and be productive and creative when they know thousands more of their colleagues will likely be gone in the next couple of years? When the same mistakes from leadership continue to happen year after year without accountability? When another restructuring and more cost-cutting measures will happen in the coming years?</p>



<p>It’s pretty evident that Ubisoft’s big restructuring needs to happen from the top and not the other way around.</p>



<p>We all know what needs to happen, but stubbornness is worse than witchcraft.</p>

<p>Fable fans can finally count down to the long-awaited release of the next game in the franchise after the release window was announced during the Xbox Developer Direct on January 22.</p>



<p>Developed by Playground Games, the new Fable is a reboot for the franchise, releasing a whopping 16 years after Fable III, and, after previous delays, a new release window has finally been announced.</p>







<h2 id="h-fable-release-window-announced">Fable Release Window Announced</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>During Xbox’s January 2026 Developer Direct, Playground Games announced that Fable will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC in Autumn 2026. As previously announced, Fable will be available day one with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was confirmed that Fable will be available on PlayStation 5, and the release window will be the same as on other platforms, meaning that PlayStation players won’t have to wait longer for a release, unlike another Playground Games title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-playstation-5-release-window-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>.</p>



<p>Fable was previously slated for release in 2025, but was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed back to a 2026 window in February</a> last year, when Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan said the title was “definitely worth the wait” and is the “most beautifully realized version of Albion” that players have ever seen.</p>



<p>The Fable reboot was officially announced in 2020, though gamers had to wait until 2023 to see the first proper trailer, and it’s been somewhat of a rollercoaster ride since then due to the hefty delay. Finally, though, the end is now in sight.</p>
