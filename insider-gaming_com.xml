<p>Electronic Arts is preparing to welcome gamers to San Vansterdam from September 16 as Skate (I’m not writing skate., I hate that title) enters early access. This news was announced on social media earlier today, and it comes after months of closed testing phases have unravelled much of the game’s content.</p>



<p>The Skate team also released a short trailer to celebrate the announcement. It has been more than 15 years since the last Skate game was released, and fans are <strong>hungry</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-skate-will-release-in-early-access-next-month">Skate Will Release in Early Access Next Month</h2>



<p>In little more than two weeks, Skate will be released in early access by Electronic Arts. Earlier today, the team posted a small trailer to announce the release date:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>For months, fans have been testing Skate (stylized as skate.) and running the game through its paces. This has meant that stacks of content have emerged online, giving us a fair indication of what to expect when San Vansterdam opens up on September 16, 2025.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the team revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-skate-game-gets-official-cover-art-and-early-access-release-date-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover art for Skate</a>, promising that the early access release date would drop <strong>today</strong>. Well, as you can see from the above, they’ve delivered on that promise.</p>



<p>In June, the biggest update ever made to the playtest product was unveiled, adding more challenges and upping the server limit to 150 players per map. Even in a testing state, Skate featured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-skate-playtest-update-revealed-wishlists/">a whopping 140 challenges</a> and activities.</p>



<p>The full game could end up being something pretty monumental, scale-wise.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Skate when it enters early access on September 16? Let me know what you’re most excited about with this game on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: When Did The IndyCar Deal Come Together With iRacing?]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On Tuesday, it was announced that iRacing and IndyCar had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indycar-game-coming-in-2026-from-iracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached an agreement</a> on a new game for the second half of 2026. The first console game in over 20 years for IndyCar, this new title is planned to launch on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam. </p>



<p>But when did the deal come together? </p>



<p>Back in early 2024, iRacing president Tony Gardner <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-iracing-not-planning-an-indycar-console-game-right-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Insider Gaming</a> that an IndyCar console game wasn’t in a “short-term plan” for the company, but that the door was open. Later that year, the door blew wide open.</p>



<p>Gardner says that while the long-term plan was <a href="https://iracingstudios.com/iracing-studios-to-produce-standalone-indycar-video-game-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to eventually get here</a>, talks really picked up in late 2024.</p>



<p><strong>“We finalized an agreement with them early this year,”</strong> Gardner told Insider Gaming, <strong>“So, it was six to nine months ago and, and we didn’t want to announce it too soon because we’d rather get some development under our belt and whatnot.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as why announce the game now, Gardner said it made sense to do it ahead of the final race of the 2025 season on August 31. </p>



<p><strong>“We need to to start talking more openly to the teams and getting driver feedback on the physics and things like that,” </strong>he said. <strong>“So it’s a good time for us to let the cat out of the bag.</strong>“</p>



<p>In addition to the console game, iRacing will continue to have a relationship with IndyCar on its main platform. The game is <a href="https://www.iracing.com/iracing-development-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to add</a> the Dallara IL-15 from the INDY NXT series is set to join iRacing in season 4 of 2025.</p>
