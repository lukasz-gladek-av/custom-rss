            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re here, it’s almost certain that you’re trying to figure out what is the best weed recipe in Schedule 1. To start, it can be fairly complicated to start growing, but there’s big money to be had with some of the better recipes in the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-weed-recipes-in-schedule-1">Best Starting Weed Recipes in Schedule 1</h2>



<p>When starting off in Schedule 1, you won’t have the best ingredients and equipment to start, but luckily, you’ll be able to get all of the ingredients you need from the Gas-Mart. Unfortunately, though, these recipes do not create the highest quality strains of weed, but are a good way to build up cash to take your empire to the next level. Here’s some of our favourites: </p>



<h4 id="h-og-kush-strain-1">OG Kush Strain 1</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Donut, Mouth Wash, Cuke, Banana, Viagra</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $118</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Anti-Gravity, Jennerising, Balding, Thought-Provoking, Gingeritis, Tropic Thunder</p>



<h4 id="h-og-kush-strain-2">OG Kush Strain 2</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Donut, Mouth Wash, Cuke, Banana, Viagra, Flu Medicine</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $127</p>

<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $80</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Jennerising, Thought-Provoking, Energizing, Gingeritis</p>



<h4 id="h-og-kush-strain-4">OG Kush Strain 4</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Mouth Wash, Cuke, Viagra, Banana</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $103</p>

<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $81</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Refreshing, Cyclopean, Sedating, Foggy</p>



<h4 id="h-green-crack-1">Green Crack 1 </h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Viagra, Horse Semen</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $77</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Energizing, Tropic Thunder, Long Faced</p>



<h4 id="h-green-crack-2">Green Crack 2</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Gasoline, Viagra</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $65</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Bright-Eyed, Toxic, Tropic Thunder</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-weed-strain-to-start">The Best Weed Strain to Start</h2>



<p>One of the better strains from the list is <strong>OG Kush Strain 3</strong>, which only requires two ingredients that can be obtains from the very beginning. What’s even better is that the ingredients will only set you back a mere $6 with a sell price of $80, giving you a nice profit from the get-go. </p>



<p>Remember, that starting off with some of the cheaper strains is a good way to gain money fast, but conscious that you’ll need to continue on innovating and producing higher quality strains to keep your customers happy. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield Pro ‘Premium’ Subscription Uncovered by Dataminers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-pro-subscription-dataminers-uncover/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-pro-%E2%80%98premium%E2%80%99-subscription-uncovered-by-dataminers.1156032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-pro-subscription-dataminers-uncover/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts might be working on a fresh iteration of the old ‘Battlefield Premium’ membership, but this time around, it’s set to be called Battlefield Pro. In a recent batch of information uncovered by dataminers (allegedly), it was claimed that Battlefield Pro would come with a string of benefits that include persistent server hosting on Battlefield Portal.</p>



<p>Amongst the benefits sat items like ‘exclusive instant unlocks’, tier skips for the game’s Battle Pass, a permanent XP boost, and access to unique challenges. It makes sense on paper, but as with all datamined content, you’ll need to take it with a pinch of salt.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-premium-dude">Premium, Dude</h2>



<p>In a report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/bf-labs-datamine-battlefield-pro-lets-players-host-persistent-servers-in-portal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, it was claimed that dataminers have uncovered references to a Battlefield Pro subscription from Battlefield Labs. No source was given for the ‘leak’, but it admittedly makes sense that something like this would eventually exist in the new Battlefield space.</p>



<p>After all, we recently covered the impending reveal of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-free-to-play-battle-royale-gamemode-has-been-datamined/">a free-to-play battle royale game</a> within the new Battlefield ecosystem. That kind of game is perfect for a ‘premium’ subscription model that includes access to a Battle Pass. </p>



<p>According to MP1st, the unidentified dataminers have claimed that the following content will be included with a Battlefield Pro subscription:</p>



<ul>
<li>Includes Battle Pass: Get all the perks and rewards from the Battle Pass in addition to extra exclusive content</li>



<li>6 Exclusive Instant Unlocks: Instantly access these BF Pro exclusive cosmetics</li>



<li>+10% Battle Pass XP</li>



<li>Portal: Host a Persistent Server</li>



<li>20 Tier Skips Included: Advance faster on the Battle Pass path to race to the final reward!</li>



<li>Exclusive Bonus Path: Gain access to this exclusive Bonus Path for additional exclusive content. Bonus Path will be released later this season.</li>



<li>BF Pro Challenges: Access to the BF Pro Challenges vault – Unlock exclusive cosmetics from this season’s new BF Pro Challenges. Includes access to previous season(s) BF Pro challenges. Listen to the Pro Radio Station</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s nothing too ‘out there’ on this list. I’m curious how the persistent server hosting would work, as in previous games, players had to <strong>pay </strong>to host private servers like that. Also, the ‘Pro Radio Station’ is interesting as it’s not revealed where that exists or what it includes.</p>



<p>Back in the day, Battlefield Premium was a one-time purchase that unlocked plenty of benefits, but it’s safe to assume that Battlefield Pro will be a monthly or seasonal purchase. Again, it’s unconfirmed at present and should be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>



<p>Would you purchase a subscription to Battlefield Pro? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Bungie started posting cryptic messages about Marathon on social media. The upcoming extraction shooter has run a little silent in recent months, but something is about to be announced by the developer – we just don’t know what that is.</p>



<p>Marathon is a reboot of a 1994 title of the same name, but this time around, it’s a futuristic extraction shooter – because we just needed <strong>another one of those</strong>, right? </p>



<p>It was recently discovered that some players might be enjoying an alpha version of Marathon <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-are-they-playing-it">Are They Playing It?</h2>



<p>It was noticed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jrnmit/marathon_alpha_test_begins_this_year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eagle-eyed Reddit users</a> that the Marathon Discord server has newly added channels about alpha feedback and discussions. There’s a section for ‘alpha bug reporting’, too. This leads us to believe that the team is either a) preparing to launch an alpha, and that’s the upcoming news, or b) content creators and the like are already enjoying Marathon’s alpha version.</p>



<p>I’d be willing to believe that the former is on the nose. Marathon has been in development for years at this point, and it’s hard to see it not being ready for a good old playtest.</p>



<p>It was suggested on social media that <strong>both </strong>of those possibilities are true. Users were claiming that some Destiny streamers had been granted access to the closed alpha of Marathon, which remains a mystery since its initial reveal in 2023. </p>



<p>It was also recently claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-news-being-teased-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie is preparing</a> to make a major announcement regarding Marathon later this month. That’s hardly a leap, given that social media takeovers are happening, and we’re seeing these alpha channels on Discord.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to trying out Marathon? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has returned the boobs to far Cry 4 following a mistake which censored the game worldwide.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-4-censorship-patch-removes-nudity-10-years-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our report earlier today</a> which brought further light to the situation that Ubisoft had apparently censored the nudity in Far Cry 4, the official Far Cry account <a href="https://x.com/FarCrygame/status/1908168738886787356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied to our post</a> to clarify the situation.</p>



<p>“To clarify, the update was the result of a mistake during deployment. Content intended specifically for the Japanese version of the game was accidentally pushed to the global Steam version,” they said.</p>



<p>They continued, “The team has since corrected the error by reuploading the proper global files to Steam. If players are still seeing anything unusual, restarting Steam and checking for updates should resolve it. Just to reassure everyone: there are no plans to censor Far Cry. This was purely a regional packaging error and has now been fully addressed. Thank you“</p>



<p>So fear not, boobs have once again returned to Far Cry 4.</p>



<p>Ubisoft community developer Patricia Brochu-Gagné also took to Reddit to further clarify the situation saying, “This was simply an error tied to a specific regional build, and it’s now been corrected.”</p>



<p>Far Cry 4 went on to sell over 10 million copies during the PlayStation 4 / Xbox One generation and to some, is considered one of the better Far Cry titles in the series. </p>

<p>Movie Games has announced that Drug Dealer Simulator will be coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S consoles on April 16, with a PlayStation 5 release to come at a later date.</p>



<p>In the new press release, it was said that Drug Dealer Simulator has already surpassed over “1 million buyers” on PC – a total amounting to some $16 million in revenue.</p>



<p>Originally, the announcement was made a few weeks ago, but the recent PR email seems, at least at face value, that they are also trying to capitalise on the highly-successful Schedule 1. </p>



<p>Schedule 1 released on March 29, and recently hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peak concurrent playercount of 414,000</a>, with a 24-hour peak of 329,000 concurrent players at the time of writing. At the moment, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 is yet to announce a console release</a>, so it makes sense that a rival drug dealer simulator would try and get ahead with an Xbox and PlayStation release… I guess.</p>
