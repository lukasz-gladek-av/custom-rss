<p>A Minecraft Movie is one of the biggest movie prospects in 2025, and while promoting it, Jason Momoa told journalists that he doesn’t let his kids play video games or have phones.</p>



<p>Jason Momoa plays Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-minecraft-movies-cast-in-the-game-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Minecraft Movie</a>. The character has become one of the most iconic images from each trailer. Aside from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jack-black-has-logged-more-than-100-hours-on-minecraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Black</a>, Momoa is easily the biggest star power. It’s hard to see A Minecraft Movie not doing well, and it’s likely to help the already-enormously successful franchise.</p>



<p>While promoting A Minecraft Movie, Momoa shared fascinating details about his kids and specific strict measures he implements.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://x.com/Deadline/with_replies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Momoa was asked if his children play video games. The actor answered frankly: “We don’t have a TV, my son doesn’t even have a phone. He’s 16 and doesn’t have a phone—we’re different dude. Sorry, man.”</p>



<p>The actor explained that his son can have a phone when he turns 18, and “explore the world” after that. Momoa justified the decision by saying he wants his kids to “use their creativity in a different way.” He also adds that he didn’t grow up with a phone and “everyone was doing just fine” without them.</p>



<p>You can see the full exchange for yourself.</p>

<p>It’s a unique way of operating life, of course, but it’s interesting to see one of A Minecraft Movie’s key stars admitting he doesn’t let his kids play video games when he’s starring in an overtly video-game movie.</p>

<p>The Game of Thrones franchise is one of the most popular in modern entertainment history. Unfortunately, for as well-received as the books and shows have been, the games—for the most part—have left a lot to be desired. For developer Netmarble, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is an attempt to turn that around and release a new game in the series that will have people talking.</p>



<p>Sadly, the type of talking most people will have about this game is its uninspired gameplay and heavy monetization practices.</p>



<h2 id="h-game-of-thrones-kingsroad-early-access-review">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad Early Access Review</h2>



<p>As the title mentions, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">currently in early access</a>. While the game will be free-to-play once out of early access, those who want to play now will have to buy one of three bundles of the game. The cheapest is the standard pack for $24.99 while the most expensive, the Ultimate Pack, costs $89.99. Each of the three packs come with access to the game along with various benefits like Iron Bank Marks, outfits, emojis, and even battle pass access for the two higher bundles.</p>



<p>Without giving away much in terms of spoilers, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad’s story takes place during the fourth season of the show. You play as a brand new character to the world who is the heir to House Tyre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting started, you pick one of three classes—knight, sellsword, or assassin—and create your character using a pretty limited character creator. I mean, you can’t even make yourself bald. What’s up with that?</p>



<p>In and of itself, the story isn’t too bad. The dialogue is solid, and nothing feels out of place as you play. What does feel out of place, though, are the animations. In an area where the game feels exactly like a mobile game or something from the mid-to-late 2000s, everyone’s mouth either looks like it’s chewing the words being said or is nowhere close to how it should be. In some cases, you kind of feel like you are watching a 1970s kung fu movie with English voiceovers. And yes, I likely dated myself with that reference.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Moving on to gameplay, there’s nothing really special to write home about. It’s your typical action RPG with your basic attacks, special attacks, blocking, and dodging. Most of the moves look solid, but there’s no weight behind the attacks. Every swing of a weapon or kick you make just feels like you are swinging around the lightest paper towel tube. Even dry pool noodles feel like there’s more power behind attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other animations also feel janky, such as any movement in a diagonal direction. Whether you are running, walking or riding a horse, it all looks and feels like your characters are sliding around and/or floating. Like the attacks, there’s no weight behind what’s being done. It just all feels like going through the motion with no sense of reward for anything you do.</p>



<p>There are three different trait trees—attack, defense, and support—that you can progress through as you play. They add things like increased damage, mount stamina, parrying ability, and other skill improvements that you’d expect. They are fine for what they are, but the trees are so small that it just feels like something to be added to the game rather than help improve your play.</p>



<p>One other area with the game that bothers me is with your equipment. You can buy, find, and unlock better equipment like other games. But, when you equip them, you don’t see it. It’s there, but the only look you have is the basis of your character. Get a rare set of gloves to equip? They are there in stats only. Some might not care about it, but not being able to see the gear I’ve found is a major turn off with games like this.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-the-mobile-monetization">The Mobile Monetization</h3>



<p>Now onto what is, arguably, the most frustrating of the game: the microtransactions. First things first, this is going to be a free-to-play game, so in-app purchases are expected. However, there’s a way to do it right and then the way Game of Thrones: Kingsroad does them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As expected, there are various cosmetics that you can pay to unlock for your character. That’s the norm in almost every game, free or paid, at this point. The problem lies in some obvious cash grabs within the game right now.</p>



<p>Should you die and you want to revive with your health, it’ll cost you copper. Want to fast travel to an area you unlocked? It’ll cost you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on in the game it’s not too bad, but the further into the game you go, the more and more tedious it becomes. There are energy restrictions throughout, and timegating becomes a major concern that will make you feel like you wasted the dozen or so hours you have spent in the game to that point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game is advertised as co-op, but only dungeons are able to be played with friends. Oh, and that’s another area where an in-game currency is needed in order to access. It’s easy to continue on with the problematic monetization practices, but it’s not really worth rambling at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review-verdict">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad Review Verdict</h3>



<p>Don’t let the fact that it’s available on PC fool you, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is a mobile game. It looks like a mobile game and plays like one, too. While in 2025 that’s not necessarily a bad thing, it’s when it attempts to pass itself off as something more that it becomes an issue.</p>



<p>At this present moment, it’s hard to tell anyone not to hold off for the game to go free-to-play after the early access period ends. Even then, with the heavy—and I mean heavy—microtransaction push, the lack of exciting gameplay and frustrating animation issues, this is one trip to Westeros you’re better off postponing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>VERDICT: SKIP</strong></p>
