<p>It has been revealed by the Esports World Cup Foundation that the EWCF Club Partner Program applications for 2025 are now open – and that the scheme has been massively bolstered. The EWCF Club Partner Program will now invest $20 million into organisations, and this year, the scheme has been expanded to cover 40 members, up from 30 last year.</p>



<p>The top eight teams from the EWC’s Club Championship automatically score an invite, but the remaining 32 slots are up for grabs now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prestigious-program">Prestigious Program</h2>



<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program isn’t open to <strong>every organisation</strong>. Some prerequisites must be met by applicants, including having a high level of fan engagement and ‘creative excellence’. </p>



<p>Here’s the spiel from <a href="https://esportsworldcup.com/en/clubprogram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program 2025 will focus on Clubs around the world that show high levels of fan engagement and creative excellence. Through this partnership, the EWCF and the participating Clubs will jointly invest to tell the EWC 2025 stories. Partnered Clubs are expected to have an established track record of elite competitive performance across multiple games, as well as a substantial social media presence with the ability to engage and grow a global fanbase. </p>



<p>Participating Clubs will be able to access the Program funding by engaging their fanbase with their brands throughout the esports year – so fans can follow storylines leading up to the Esports World Cup, watching tournaments online and experiencing live matches during the season.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All participating clubs will receive a six-figure sum to help grow their organisation ahead of the Esports World Cup 2025. If the participants see immense success as part of the EWCF Club Partner Program, they’ll receive additional funding. It was stressed that being a member of the scheme <strong>doesn’t </strong>grant instant qualification into next year’s Esports World Cup, though.</p>



<p>Per the terms of the application process, organisations have until the 10th of January to get their forms filled out. </p>



<p>In a statement, Faisal bin Homran, the CPO of the EWCF, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program represents a significant step forward in our ongoing mission to foster a thriving ecosystem for esports Clubs worldwide while unlocking opportunities for organizations from some of the world’s fastest-growing esports markets, like China. </p>



<p>Through this program, we enable partnered Clubs to attract fans with engaging content beyond the games, showcasing the personalities and talent of players, alongside their origin stories, while also developing their Clubs’ brands as fan-favorite powerhouses in esports entertainment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers, Netease, have just released the game’s first post-launch update, version 20241210. The new patch brings some hero balancing changes, map and game mode fixes and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-general-changes-nbsp">General Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>The Marvel Rivals version <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1866393674554527800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">20241210</a> update introduces a fix for lag and significant crosshair deviation while playing highlights and recordings. Saving highlights will no longer cause the game to crash.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Players observed that heroes equipped with costumes were not visible when joining a quick match as a replacement; this issue has been fixed. Additionally, mission progress on the Season Event screen will be displayed correctly after the latest Marvel Rivals update.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Moreover, fixes related to textual errors, relatively common crash issues, and game freezing have also been released; more will be added in a future update.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-maps-and-game-mode-changes">Maps and Game Mode Changes</h2>



<ul>
<li>Clipping or becoming stuck during special collisions in specific maps, such as Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface, have been mainly fixed. However, some areas are still affected, and the developers will continue to work on fixing these problems.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The new Marvel Rivals update also introduces fixes for foggy areas of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Birnin T’Challa. These places will not have fog disappear from Hela and Storm’s perspectives after the new patch. Also, enemies and teammates will be able to see the effects of Joyful Splash when Jeff the Land Shark is revived while in the fog.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Regarding Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven—Frozen Airfield, players will observe that lighting no longer behaves abnormally when a player is knocked out near a target area. Also, disconnecting and reconnecting during matches will not cause the desynchronisation of some doors.&nbsp;</li>



<li>There are several fixes for Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven – Eldritch Monument. Adam Warlock’s ultimate will no longer lead to teammates being revived and stuck beneath the terrain when the target area ascends or descends. In the exact location, if Thor and Loki were revived through Hela’s team-up ability, they would not get stuck under the terrain.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Moreover, the Marvel Rivals update also ships characters from getting stuck under the terrain when Jeff the Land Shark uses his Ultimate while ascending or descending. In the same situation, Winter Soldier’s Ultimate will no longer lose damage if it’s right on the target.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Coming to Competitive mode changes, the new Marvel Rivals patch will display the vehicle range when switching between rounds. Also, when you reach the third round, Competitive Convoy or Convergence Heroes will not carry over their Ultimate Energy from the second round.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-hero-changes-nbsp">Hero Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>When players equipped the Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume for Wolverine, they observed that no ability voice lines instead of Undying Animal would play. This update fixes this issue. Also, Star Lord Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’s MVP animation does not have sound effects on the result screen, but it has been fixed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The Marvel Rivals patch also fixes Iron Fist’s voice lines not playing when using pings. Regarding Black Widow, the description of her ADS sensitivity has been fixed. Also, she will recover energy as intended in every situation.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Coming to the last bit of Heroes changes in the new Marvel Rivals update, Captain America’s Ultimate wouldn’t end as intended in specific extreme situations; this problem has been fixed. Now for the most significant change: Doctor Strange’s portals were causing terrain KOs, which restored the character’s ultimate energy. After the new patch, the portals’ terrain KO attribution was disabled as a temporary fix. A proper fix will be ruled out to restore this attribution in a later update.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-pc-and-console-changes-nbsp">PC and Console Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>Players would observe memory leaks and blurry models on PCs when using FSR 3 frame generation technology to improve the resolution. The new Marvel Rivals update will fix this issue.&nbsp;</li>



<li>For consoles, players observed that restarting the game when wearing the PlayStation bundle’s Scarlet Spider costume would cause the outfit to not display correctly. This issue has also been fixed.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>This morning, Amazon Studios and Games Workshop finalised a deal that was cooking for an entire year. The completion of this deal means that Amazon Studios now has exclusive rights to any movies or television shows set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe – and per a follow-up update from Games Workshop, there are <strong>multiple </strong>productions in the pipeline.</p>



<p>The news was also shared on social media by Henry Cavill, who has been aligned with a Warhammer 40,000 project for the longest time. He’ll be producing and starring in a series of his own, giving him another outlet through which to explore a passion he’s tracked for 30 years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-signed-sealed-and-delivered">Signed, Sealed, and Delivered</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an update</a> posted by the Warhammer team, it was confirmed that multiple projects are on the 40,000 roadmap:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s official – Games Workshop and Amazon Studios have finalised their deal – the creative guidelines are nailed down, and we’re all set to bring Warhammer to the screen.</p>



<p>But what does that actually mean?</p>



<p>Well, it means we now have synopsis and ordering for the stories we’re going to tell… yep, we said&nbsp;<em>stories</em>! It might have taken a year but it was a year well spent! And what fun – sifting through the enormity of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, debating characters, story arcs and the thematic grit that underpins it all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/agreementwithamazonforfilmsandtelevisionseries101224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the legal release</a>, it was stated that Amazon also has the option to license rights in the Warhammer Fantasy universe <strong>following the release </strong>of any Warhammer 40,000 production – so this deal could eventually run much deeper.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the team at Games Workshop and Amazon Studios stressed that it’ll be many years before production surfaces in full. What has been dubbed as ‘Project One’ is only just preparing to enter the scripting stage, so there’s still a long time left to wait before the fruits of this deal are realised.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently, a trailer surfaced on YouTube for a new Satisfye product called the Zengrip 2, a case for the Nintendo Switch 2 — or whatever it’s going to be called. The trailer was quickly deleted, but not before eagle-eyed users snapped shots of the footage, which showcased what could be the first look at a finished Switch 2.</p>



<p>It’s highly likely it’s a shot of a mock-up produced by Satisfye based on leaks and Nintendo-provided dimensions, but it <strong>could </strong>also be our first look at Nintendo’s upcoming console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bait-and-switch-2">Bait and Switch (2)</h2>



<p>The assumed leak was spotted on Twitter by ‘DP19’, who captured a grainy image of the trailer before it was taken down by Satisfye:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Other users then followed up with successive shots of the same video <a href="https://x.com/nRAYm2002/status/1866295996785074518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that were a little clearer</a>. Presently, the driving notion behind this being a real Switch 2 is that the ‘Joycons’ featured in the trailer have ‘the extra button’ that’s sitting front and centre on leaked designs.</p>



<p>Even if it is the Switch 2, it’s almost too blurry to make out any major details. Many have quipped that it ‘looks like a Switch’, which is fairly obvious. It was never expected that Nintendo would make any great or innovative strides when piecing together the next generation of the popular handheld console.</p>



<p>Do you think the Switch 2 leak is to be believed, or could it be a marketing ploy by Satisfye? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The FTC has announced that the ‘first wave’ of refunds resulting from a $245 million fine to Epic Games <span>is being distributed&nbsp;<strong>now</strong>. In March 2023, Epic Games was ordered to pay back players ‘duped’ into spending money by mistake, and the first round of refunds—totalling $72 million—has</span> started being handed out.</p>



<p>When the dust had settled in the FTC vs. Fortnite case, the gaming titan was found to have been promoting a ‘counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration’ that subsequently led to millions of players making purchases they didn’t want.</p>

<p>In recent years, the United States Federal Trade Commission has been hot on these tactics, which typically involve ‘clever placement’ of buttons and prompts to encourage users to buy things in digital stores without them necessarily meaning to.</p>



<p>The FTC claimed that Epic Games was knowingly allowing children to ‘rack up unauthorised charges without any parental involvement’. It’s not the first company to adopt these tactics, nor will it be the last, but it’s one of the firms hit the hardest by legal action pursued by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>



<p>By way of a resolution, Epic Games agreed to discontinue the use of these shady tactics, and it noted that it would put in place a prompt requesting consent from the consumer before making any purchase. </p>



<p>Next week, 629,344 customers will be refunded an average of $114 – and this is just the first stop of the refund train.</p>
