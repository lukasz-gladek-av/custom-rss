<p>The PlayStation 3 (PS3) era could’ve been the end of PlayStation as we know it. That’s according to former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-playstation-30th-anniversary-interview-with-shawn-layden-it-was-a-fight-to-get-the-sony-name-on-the-machine-they-didnt-want-to-be-associated-with-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Layden spoke on a number of topics about the console that turned 30 on December 3. One of the topics, in particular, centered around the PS3 and its disastrous launch in 2006.</p>



<p>For those who either don’t remember or were too young, the PS3 was panned at its launch due to the console’s pricing, lack of launch titles, and development issues, among other concerns. It’s a moment in time that Layden said had people at the company “happy to have survived”.</p>



<p>“PS3 was Sony’s Icarus moment,” he said. “We had PS1, PS2… and now we’re building a supercomputer! And we’re going to put Linux on it! And we’re going to do all these sorts of things! We flew too close to the sun, and we were lucky and happy to have survived the experience, but it taught us a lot.”</p>



<p>Layden continued buy saying that Sony learned for the development of the PS4 that they don’t necessarily have to build everything for the console in-house. It’s ok to buy components if possible.</p>



<p>“You can manage the cost better,” he said. You can argue with vendors, get better deals instead of building your own thing.</p>



<p>“We also learned that the center of the machine has to be gaming. It’s not about whether I can stream movies or play music. Can I order a pizza while I’m watching TV and play? No, just make it a game machine. Just make it the best game machine of all time. I think that’s what really made the difference. When PS4 came out, it set us against what Xbox was trying to do. [They wanted to] build more of a multimedia experience, and we just wanted to build a kick ass game machine.”</p>



<p>The PS3 ultimately rebounded from its launch to sell 87.4 million consoles. That put it just ahead of the Xbox 360’s 85.7M in lifetime sales but below the Wii’s 101.6M.</p>



<p>What do you think of Layden’s view that Sony was happy to have survived the PS3 launch and era? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Announced on <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smilegate-makes-strategic-investment-in-dan-housers-absurd-ventures-accelerating-its-growth-in-the-global-gaming-market-302321072.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tuesday</a>, the partnership is being called a “strategic investment” by both sides that “aims to create vast and sustainable business opportunities”. Smilegate is the studio behind games such as Lost Ark and Crossfire.</p>



<p>“This collaboration with Smilegate was borne from a mutual respect and a philosophical alignment with founder Kwon, and the great passion he and his team bring to making AAA games,” Houser said via press release. “We both want to build interesting worlds and new player experiences.”</p>



<p>Joonhoo Sung, Smilegate’s CEO, added: “We are thrilled to collaborate with the developers behind globally renowned series that have millions of fans worldwide. Together with Absurd Ventures, Smilegate aims to deliver games that players across the globe will love. This partnership marks a critical milestone in Smilegate’s journey toward becoming a global IP powerhouse.”</p>

There was no update on what this investment from Smilegate will do for the development of their current game, or if things will change with how Absurd Ventures operates.</p>

<p>It has been confirmed by ESL FACEIT that IEM Dallas will run alongside DreamHack Dallas in Texas in May 2025.</p>



<p>From May 23 – 25, the world’s most prolific Counter-Strike teams will descend on Texas to take part in IEM Dallas, one of the most prestigious events in the CS2 esports calendar.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full story.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-iem-going-to-texas">IEM Going to Texas</h2>



<p>This year’s IEM Dallas event was a monumental spectacle, with the event going down to the wire between G2 Esports and Team Vitality. It ended up being a win for G2, putting an end to a cold period that had lasted since the team won at IEM Cologne in August 2023. </p>



<p>It effectively kickstarted a spree for G2, with the team going on to win big at the BLAST Fall Final and then the BLAST World Final later in the year. The squad also wound up in second place in Counter-Strike’s tournament at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>In a press release, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ESL FACEIT Group, the leading esports and video game entertainment company, today announced DreamHack Dallas and Intel® Extreme Masters (IEM) Dallas 2025 will jointly return to Texas’ Key Bailey Hutchison Convention Center on May 23-25. </p>



<p>The pair of events will rally tens of thousands of gaming and esports fans to witness top-tier competition, hundreds of their favorite creators, dozens of indie titles, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tickets will go on sale from December 5 – are you interested in heading to IEM Dallas? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>GSC has released a small update for STALKER 2 that addresses some issues with memory leaks, controls, AI, and missions.
