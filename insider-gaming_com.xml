<p>After weeks of rumors and leaks, Intel has officially unveiled its first Battlemage graphics cards. Two new GPUs are set to hit the market starting this month in the Intel Arc B580 and the Arc B570, both of which are built on the Xe2-HPG architecture.</p>



<p>Both of the new graphics cards are geared toward the entry- and mid-level market as opposed to the higher-end cards from AMD and Nvidia. </p>



<p>The Arc B580 is the first card to release on December 13 and will retail for $249. The graphics card features 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM with a 192-bit memory bus. It’s clock speed comes in at 2.67 GHz, just under the rumored 2.8 GHz from earlier leaks. However it could go higher depending on which board partner you purchase the graphics card from. It’ll also have a TBP (Total Board Power) of just 190W.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Moving on to the Intel Arc B570, the slighter lower-end card comes in at just $219 and will release on January 16. The Arc B570 has a slightly slower clock speed of 2.5 GHz and 10 GB of GDDR6 memory. It also sits on a smaller 160-bit memory bus with a max bandwidth of 380 GB/s. It’s TBP is also lower at just 150W.</p>



<p>Both cards are PCIe 4.0×8, and come with three DisplayPort 2.1 outputs and one HDMI 2.1 output.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege’s Y9S4 update drops <strong>today</strong>, with Ubisoft taking the game offline for up to 60 minutes to apply the super-sized patch. It ushers in Operation Collision Point, which brings a new Operator to the game, as well as a slew of new features, tweaks, and balances.</p>



<p>It’s the last major update of the year for Rainbow Six Siege – check out the Y9S4 patch notes below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-does-operation-collision-point-release">When Does Operation Collision Point Release?</h2>



<p>Operation Collision Point is released today, December 3 on all platforms. It’s a free-to-consume update that brings countless new features and changes to the game, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Blackbeard, a new Attacker</li>



<li>Player Protection updates</li>



<li>Ballistic Shield balances</li>



<li>Console to PC crossplay 1.0</li>



<li>Matchmaking improvements</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a serious update that has players excited. This is typical of Ubisoft, though. Every so often, the team releases a major update into the Rainbow Six Siege ecosystem that alters the playing field – it’s why Siege has stayed on top for almost a decade.</p>



<h3 id="h-y9s4-patch-size">Y9S4 Patch Size</h3>



<p>Here are the download sizes for the Operation Collision Point update:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ubisoft Connect: 73.99 GB</li>



<li>Steam: 14.8 GB</li>



<li>Xbox One: 34.4 GB</li>



<li>Xbox Series X: 40.7 GB</li>



<li>PlayStation 4: 39.90 GB</li>



<li>PlayStation 5: 36.74 GB</li>
</ul>



<p>It was noted that the download sizes are larger than usual because the team has completed a texture reforge.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/6MQfBtcDbLYv6CbQxZg3pF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Y9S4 patch</a> is huge both in size and in what it offers. From an Operator price decrease to new seasonal skins, and hundreds of bug fixes to the introduction of the Siege Cup ecosystem, players are being spoilt rotten by Ubisoft this month.</p>
