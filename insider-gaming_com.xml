            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fresh off the news that it had banned YouTuber and “predator hunter” Schlep from the game, Roblox has taken to its website to talk about the “removal of vigilantes” from the platform. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy post</a>, Roblox’s chief safety officer Matt Kaufman discussed the company’s policy regarding “vigilantes” and why they remove them from the game.</p>



<p><strong>“We have been monitoring vigilante activity on Roblox for some time,”</strong> Kaufman said. <strong>“These groups began by reporting safety concerns, commenting on news about Roblox, and challenging us to do better. We appreciated this feedback and used these reports to improve our safety systems.”</strong></p>



<p>Kaufman continued to say that, recently, activity within Roblox “evolved”. Rather than just report safety concerns, he said, these people began “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-legal-notice-banned-predator-hunter-freeschlep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impersonating children and actively sought to connect with adult users</a>“. The conversations would then mimic what they believed to be inappropriate behavior while actively encouraging others to connect on different social media and messaging platforms. These actions would bypass Roblox’s safety systems.</p>



<p><strong>“These were not one-off situations and we saw the behavior accelerating across many accounts,”</strong> he said. <strong>“This activity created an unsafe environment and normalized behavior that is both unacceptable on Roblox and is against our&nbsp;Terms of Use. Our policies prohibit directing other users off Roblox to another platform through chat and having/simulating sexually explicit conversations. These are serious policy violations that risk removal from the platform.”</strong></p>



<p>Kaufman said that none of the activities he mentioned were acceptable on Roblox. He said that the company has teams who are dedicated to reviewing and investigating the reports that are received. </p>



<p><strong>“When we find that violations have occurred, we act in accordance with our policies—up to and including permanently removing users from Roblox and reporting to law enforcement when warranted,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>Kaufman says that due to “privacy considerations”, Roblox can’t let users know if their reports led to any consequences. The company, he says, wants to protect the privacy of users as they work to keep them safe. Roblox, he said, submitted 254,522 reports in 2024 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) while also regularly meeting with the NCMEC to learn how to best support the agency and law enforcement.</p>



<p>It was said that Roblox understands the frustration from players in regards to how they handle reports of violative behavior that occurs outside of the game. Kaufman says that they would often be sent as screenshots from other applications, but they still do their best to investigate the reports. Action, however, can’t be taken without verification or similar behavior being observed within Roblox itself. </p>



<p>Despite these concerns from the community, Kaufman implored users to continue to report any and all concerns they may have so that they can “remove bad actors”.</p>



<p><strong>“Rather than taking actions that violate our policies and potentially creating additional risk, we encourage users to report issues through the official channels so we can investigate quickly and effectively,” </strong>he said. <strong>“We’ve designed our reporting tools to capture details and metadata that a screenshot cannot, including object IDs, avatar IDs, and context. This additional information goes a long way toward helping us investigate reported incidents.”</strong></p>

<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that Call of Duty and Battlefield complement each other in several ways. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta weekend 2</a> has arrived, with hordes of players pouring in to try out the new map and modes that have been added. With all the attention Battlefield 6 is getting, many players have already started drawing comparisons with Call of Duty, and here’s what the developers feel about it. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-is-unique-and-offers-things-no-one-really-can">“Battlefield is Unique and Offers Things No One Really Can”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1955668053250978274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jake Lucky</a>, Respawn Entertainment CEO Vince Zampella and Battlefield GM Byron Beede were asked whether they see Call of Duty as competition, considering that both had been part of the Call of Duty team in the past. Beede replied, stating  Battlefield and Call of Duty have both existed for so long together, and they “complement each other in different ways”. Battlefield has things that Call of Duty doesn’t, and vice versa. </p>



<p>Beede adds that Battlefield features elements like “destruction, the class system,” and more, which make it an “amazing experience.” The game is a competitor in a way, “like every other game’s a competitor kind of in a way”, but “Battlefield is unique and offers things no one really can”. </p>

<p>During the same interview, Zampella and Beede also touched on topics like community feedback, the class system, anti-cheat systems, the Battle Royale tease, and more. Players should also be aware that this interview was recorded during the first open beta weekend. </p>



<p>In contrast to what the developers have stated, former Blizzard boss feels Battlefield 6 will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-is-going-to-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year-according-to-former-blizzard-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boot stomp</a>” Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-avalon-map-campaign/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-and-multiplayer-will-merge-with-a-32-player-mode-on-%E2%80%98avalon%E2%80%99.1270368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will integrate the campaign’s final mission into a 32-player multiplayer experience for the first time ever in the series.</p>



<p>According to sources who wished to remain anonymous as they couldn’t talk about the game’s plans, Black Ops 7’s hotly rumored ‘Avalon’ map, which was initially planned as a Battle Royale map, will be the title’s 12th and final mission in the Black Ops 7 campaign.</p>



<p>It’s said that although some POIs in Avalon will be present as a part of the game’s campaign (which can be played in up to 4-player co-op), the fully fledged map will be the game’s ‘final mission’.</p>



<p>The final mission sounds awfully like an extraction-based shooter, where players will need to complete objectives and extract, but we’ll have to wait and see exactly what that means.</p>



<p>It was said that the mission will be ‘hardcore’ and similar to other extraction shooters on the market; if you’re killed and your squad is wiped, you will lose all your character’s progress.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-full-integration">Black Ops 7 Full Integration</h2>



<p>It’s said that the somewhat bizarre move for the multiplayer and campaign merge in Black Ops 7 is a part of the game’s full progression integration across all three game modes (campaign, multiplayer, and zombies). Where, no matter where or what you play, you’ll still progress.</p>



<p>That means that even during a campaign mission, players will still be able to level up their weapons, characters, and even the Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Personally, I find it a bit odd that Avalon is being used for the mode, and if this experience is connected to only the premium, perhaps the goal is to offer free-to-play weekends to entice paying players? But does Call of Duty really need that? </p>



<p>More information surrounding the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies will be released on August 19, with the announcement of multiplayer happening at Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>



<p>Whether Black Ops 7’s Avalon will be a future Warzone map is currently unclear. Let me know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;what you think.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embracer Moving Forward With “Targeted Cost Initiatives” And AI Use]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-moving-forward-targeted-cost-initiatives-ai-use/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-moving-forward-with-%E2%80%9Ctargeted-cost-initiatives%E2%80%9D-and-ai-use.1270311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embracer is, well, embracing more AI use moving forward as part of the company’s future. </p>



<p>In statements made during it’s latest earnings report, CEO Phil Rogers called AI an “increasingly supportive force”. He said that AI use, “smarter collaboration” and “increased streamlining” will “be key to unlocking value and expanding margins.”</p>



<p><strong>“Our ambition is simple and focused: lead with distinctive IP; deliver with clarity and discipline; and realize our full potential,”</strong> he said. <strong>“The choices we make now will determine not just what we achieve, but who we become.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding streamlining, Embracer, as it moves forward to becoming Fellowship Entertainment, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q1-april-june-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-75-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says that its focus will remain</a> on <strong>“continuous improvement as well as targeted cost initiatives.”</strong></p>



<p>These initiatives will target underperforming businesses that will allow them to <strong>“free up capital to deploy with better returns.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“These initiatives could potentially include divestments,”</strong> Rogers said without mentioning if it also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-let-go-nearly-2000-employees-in-the-last-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">means more layoffs</a> could come.</p>



<p>Right now, Rogers said, the company is facing what he calls a <strong>“pivotal moment”</strong> where Embracer needs to “sharpen [its] focus”. He said that the company will “double down” on what he believes is its greatest strength: <strong>“empowering talented teams to deliver unforgettable experiences based on globally loved IP.”</strong></p>



<p>Those IP include franchises like The Lord of the Rings,&nbsp;Tomb Raider,&nbsp;Kingdom Come Deliverance,&nbsp;Metro, and Dead Island, to name a few. Rogers says that the company is “laying the groundwork” for a better development environment for its titles that he believes is <strong>“one of the most exciting IP portfolios in the industry.”</strong></p>



<p>Embracer has nine AAA games in development and set for release without counting any projects financed by partners. A couple of those games, however, might slip into fiscal year 2028/29.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Embracer/Fellowship Entertainment, especially when it comes to AI use and these “targeted cost initiatives”? Let us know in the comments down below.</p>
