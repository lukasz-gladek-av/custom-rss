<p>The weekend is almost here, but before it comes, you need to smash a couple more NYT Connections puzzles! Fortunately, I’m on hand (as always) to bring you the best NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need to ace today’s challenge. If you’re stuck on today’s NYT Connections puzzle, this is the guide that you need.</p>



<p>Read on to secure the tips and answers that you need to keep that streak going.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-20">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 20)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #893:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARTY</li>



<li>KISS</li>



<li>ENAMEL</li>



<li>ESSAY</li>



<li>CROWN</li>



<li>DECAY</li>



<li>BRUSH</li>



<li>PASTE</li>



<li>ANY</li>



<li>SKIM</li>



<li>PLASTER</li>



<li>PULP</li>



<li>STICK</li>



<li>STROKE</li>



<li>ROOT</li>



<li>FIX</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of things you’d literally apply to bond surfaces; one is more “medical wall stuff” than “craft glue.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are words for a light touch; one of them can be romantic or just feather-light.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Mix inner anatomy and outer protection; two are internal tissues, two are what you see or what caps it.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Say them out loud. One hides a “decay” pun that echoes D-K, and another rhymes its way to S-A.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 20.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty DMZ is Coming Back Soon, But There’s a Catch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-dmz-coming-back-catch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-dmz-is-coming-back-soon-but-there%E2%80%99s-a-catch.1358827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that Call of Duty’s DMZ mode is returning in December, but there’s a huge catch. The once-popular extraction shooter platform first emerged in Modern Warfare II in 2022, but after a few months of updates, it eventually disappeared from the ecosystem, never to return – until now.</p>



<p>There’s a huge catch though.</p>







<h2 id="h-dmz-recon-coming-december-11th">DMZ: Recon Coming December 11th</h2>



<p>DMZ: Recon is a new extraction shooter experience coming to Call of Duty: Mobile in December. It’s a reflection of the DMZ title that was released alongside Modern Warfare II in 2022, albeit a ‘shrunk-down’ version.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It will land during COD Mobile’s Season 11 update, and like the original, it’s set to feature PvPvE gameplay. Unlike the original DMZ, it’s expected that there will be no punishment or negativity surrounding PvP, as that was a sticking point for fans of the first platform. This is reflected in there being no ‘team recruitment’ mechanics, which were in the first DMZ.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDutyMobile/comments/1oyh2hg/dmz_recon_is_official_heres_what_to_expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early impressions from COD Mobile leakers</a> suggested that DMZ: Recon will be entirely first-person and will feature an in-match buy store, just like the one found in the original DMZ mode. There will be boss characters, weapons can be levelled up in flight, and loot is based on a tier system that includes extremely rare collectibles.</p>



<p>Players can reportedly purchase vehicles on the fly, and as it’s a smaller experience, only eight teams of three will occupy each match.</p>



<p>It has also been suggested that two maps will emerge at launch on December 11th: Serpent Island and Building 21. It was also claimed from those attending preview events that players arrive in the game via a wingsuit, can use killstreaks, carry three weapons, and can extract using a helicopter system, just like the first game.</p>







<p>Are you happy to see DMZ coming back, even if it’s only in COD Mobile? Let your thoughts be known via the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
