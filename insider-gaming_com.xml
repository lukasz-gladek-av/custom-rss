<p>The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake has been in the pipeline for years from Ubisoft, but reports suggest that the sands of time could be running out on its release date—courtesy of a shadow drop.</p>



<p>A shadow drop never goes amiss. Last year’s Oblivion Remastered shadow drop drama was absolute cinema. When the moment came for Bethesda to drop one of the greatest RPGs ever onto all of our laps at a moment’s notice, the world lost its mind. The long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-rated-by-esrb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> isn’t <em>quite </em>on that level, but it would be incredible if Ubisoft dropped a late Christmas present.</p>

<p><strong>Insider Gaming cannot confirm or deny the existence of a Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake shadow drop happening imminently, but it would line up with the reported belief of a <strong>mid-January 2026</strong> release.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re an Insider Gaming regular, you know the site’s coverage of Ubisoft titles is exceptional. If you’re new here, IG has followed The Sands of Time Remake’s journey since the beginning. An exclusive story even revealed everything about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sands of Time Remake</a> and its shaky development.</p>







<p>On May 14, 2025, it was confirmed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake Would Release by April 2026</a>. Suddenly, we’re not too far from the end of the window.</p>



<p>After that, Insider Gaming dropped another exclusive, featuring an update on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sands of Time Remake update</a>. Sources revealed that the Sands of Time Remake was targeting a ‘<strong>mid-January 2026′</strong> launch. It’s believed that Ubisoft wanted to release the POP: The Sands of Time Remake before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leaks-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake</a>, and this could be the case.</p>



<p>But drama unfolded on January 15, when a report from the <a href="https://x.com/popuniverseX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@popuniverseX</a> account (which has been suspended as a result) revealed that a ton of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time images and files were uploaded between December 31, 2025, and January 13, 2026.</p>



<p>The most intriguing file was one that had “game-release-tomorrow” in it! </p>



<p>Make of this what you will. Can Insider Gaming say for certain that a Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake is happening for certain? No. But don’t be surprised if Ubisoft suddenly drops the announcement in the coming days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new developer diary video from Marathon provides players with a deep dive into the game’s Runner Shells. </p>



<p>With Bungie’s next first-person extraction shooter, Marathon, releasing in March 2026, the developers have been slowly sharing more details about the game. Last month, players were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-pricing-battle-pass-details-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">informed</a> about pricing details, battle passes, new features, weapons, improvements, and more. Now, the developers are going straight into Runner Shells, the biosynthetic bodies you will be playing as. </p>







<h2 id="h-each-marathon-runner-shell-has-its-own-archetype">Each Marathon Runner Shell Has Its Own Archetype</h2>



<p>In the universe of Marathon, players are transferred into biosynthetic shells known as Runner Shells to navigate the Tau Ceti system. Each Runner Shell has its own archetype, which may include roles such as intel gathering, combat disruption, or combat healing. Additionally, these shells are designed with distinctive silhouettes, allowing players to identify them from a distance and strategize accordingly.</p>



<p>Players can experiment with different playstyles using the game’s cores, implants, weapons, and mods. Additionally, players can look forward to visual customizations that will be revealed at a later date.</p>



<h2 id="h-runner-shell-cores-and-impants">Runner Shell Cores and Impants</h2>



<p>Players can use Cores and Implants to customize their Runner Shell’s playstyles in Marathon. Cores are designed for one Runner Shell, mostly, where they can “buff or modify” the shell’s ability. Implants, on the other hand, can be used by any Runner Shell, and they grant additional stats and a random perk. Higher-tier implants also feature a bonus fixed perk. </p>



<p>For example, if players are going for a mobility build, with cores they can turn the Vandal’s double jump into a triple jump, and with implants they can increase its base movement speed, jump height, and heat capacity. Cores, implants, weapons, and mods can be combined with Runner Shells in Marathon to create unique play styles that best suit the player. Players can check out the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFzR8bN13FA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dev diary</a> to learn more about these systems. </p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-marathon-runner-shells-archetypes-and-abilities">Marathon Runner Shells Archetypes and Abilities </h2>



<p>Bungie has provided details on the base archetype and abilities of Runner Shells in Marathon. You can check them out below: </p>



<p><strong>Destroyer</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Combat specialist</li>



<li>Armed with a personal defense barricade, missile systems, and movement thrusters, Destroyer shells are designed to bring the fight to enemy threats.</li>
</ul>



<p>Assassin</p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Shadow agent</li>



<li>Synthetic smoke deployment and camouflage technology allow Assassin shells to plan unseen strikes or take cover during hostile engagements.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Recon</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Intel specialist</li>



<li>Recon shells excel at identifying threats and tracking movements using echo pulses, tracker drones, and holographic footstep trails.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Vandal</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Combat anarchist</li>



<li>Vandal shells traverse ground at incredible speeds, using their advanced movement and knockback cannon to disrupt combat.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Thief</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Covert acquisitions</li>



<li>With enhanced visors and piloted butterfly drone, Thief shells can locate and acquire loot, then use their grapple to push an advantage or make an escape.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Triage</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Field medic</li>



<li>Triage shells help keep themselves and allies alive using deployable healing drones, onboard reboot abilities, and combat buffs.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Rook</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Archetype: Scavenger</li>



<li>The Rook frame is designed for scavenger mode, a unique way to play Marathon. As Rook, you’ll drop into a match that’s already in progress as a solo player. You won’t be able to bring a loadout, but you also aren’t risking anything, which makes Rook an excellent option for scavengers.</li>
</ul>



<p>Details about the Runner Shells were found through Bungie’s new <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/dev-insights-runner-shells-new-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. </p>
