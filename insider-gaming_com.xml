<p>Role-playing games, or RPGs, are one of the most popular genres of games out there. RPGs cater to everyone from kids to adults to the elderly—you just have to find the one that fits your playstyle best! That’s why we’re here to present the top five most influential RPGs of all time so you can see the game that’s right for you. These are listed in no particular order.</p>



<h2 id="h-five-rpgs-everyone-should-play-once-in-their-lifetime">Five RPGs Everyone Should Play Once in Their Lifetime</h2>



<h3 id="h-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-games-like-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Witcher 3</a>, developed by CD Projekt RED and released in 2015, is an action RPG where you play as the character Geralt of Rivia. Geralt is a Witcher, a monster slayer for hire, looking for his adopted daughter Ciri after she disappeared years before trying to escape the Wild Hunt, a group of spectral warriors led by their king, Eredin. Many other characters appear in this game, including, but not limited to, Yenefer of Vengerberg, Triss Merigold, Dandelion, Zoltan Chivay, and Vesemir. The player’s choices within the game can lead to several different endings!</p>



<h3 id="h-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/6-best-games-like-skyrim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyrim</a>, a 2011 action RPG developed by Bethesda Game Studios, is one of the most popular RPGs ever. Playing as the Dragonborn, a customizable character that can be one of nine different humanoid races, the player must save the world from Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon dead-set on destroying the world due to prophecy. Players can join many factions, side with a group for Skyrim’s civil war, choose to be good or evil, and choose from many different fighting or magic combat styles. Skyrim is popular because each player’s journey can end up differently, even if the main story concludes similarly each time.</p>



<h3 id="h-bloodborne">Bloodborne</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-games-like-bloodborne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne</a> is a 2015 action RPG developed by FromSoftware in which the player plays as a Hunter who fights through the city of Yharnam, attempting to find the source of the blood-borne plague affecting residents. Bloodborne is a Soulslike game, meaning combat is harsh, unforgiving, and relies on precise hits and timely dodging to avoid getting killed. The player character is quite customizable, allowing players to immerse themselves in the world of Bloodborne.</p>



<h3 id="h-diablo-ii">Diablo II</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Diablo II, a 2000 action RPG developed by Blizzard North, is centered around dark fantasy and horror themes and is comprised of four acts. Each act follows a predetermined path, but levels are randomly generated, allowing for a unique experience each time the game is played. The base game has five unique classes: The Amazon, The Necromancer, The Barbarian, The Sorceress, and The Paladin. The expansion Diablo II: Lord of Destruction adds two more classes: The Druid and The Assassin. The game’s purpose is to defeat Diablo in Hell and prevent his return, and each act in the game leads up to that final fight.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</h3>

<p>Final Fantasy VII is a 1997 RPG developed by Square (also known as SquareSoft) that follows the exploits of the character Cloud Strife, a mercenary trying to stop a megacorporation from using the planet as an energy source. Cloud fights alongside many characters who are also trying to save the planet. Many factions, including AVALANCHE, SOLDIER, and the Cetra, are in the game, all trying to fight against Shinra Electric Power Company and the Turks, a secret branch of Shinra’s security forces. The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen. While in “the field,” players can traverse areas found within the world map and explore, talk with characters, and advance the story through events. Of course, if the old-school graphics prove too much for you, there’s always the remake!</p>



<p>While these games are influential in many ways, they don’t even touch the number of RPGs available on the market. This list is meant to give you five very different types of RPGs, stories, and gameplay mechanics from some of the most influential companies and games.

<p>A massive leak of Halo content that contains development tools, unreleased content, and dev builds has leaked online.</p>



<p>The content is said to date back all the way to 1998 at Bungie, when the developers had just released Myth II: Soulblighter and were working on Oni and Halo: Combat Evolved.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1872351879843439101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VISCERAL</a>, the leak contains around 90GB of data and is said to have leaked because 343 Industries hired a group of modders to try and restore cut content and data from the old games. This was known as the Digsite project, with some users familiar with the project, including one modder who had worked on the project, <a href="https://x.com/DogbrainLudus/status/1872256501982839002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirming that the leak was genuine</a>.</p>



<p><em>As with all leaks of this nature, downloading them is at your own risk, and the files can be found on various social media platforms.</em></p>



<p>As for the Halo franchise today, 343 Industries renamed itself to Halo Studios in 2024 and continues developing the next Halo games. <span>As part of the announcement of its studio</span>‘s name change, the development also announced its games would be moving&nbsp;to Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries,” studio head Pierre Hintze said. “Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of&nbsp;how&nbsp;we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p>



<p>Will you be checking out more of the Halo leak? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
