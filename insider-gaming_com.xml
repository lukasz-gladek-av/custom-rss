<p>Your life is on the line in Half Sword: Two combatants, two weapons, one winner, and a lot of blood spilled. Half Sword is a combat game designed to unleash the sadistic and barbaric medieval animal in you, and multiplayer or co-op would make it even more of a blood-filled blast.</p>



<p>It may seem hard to believe, but civilization is <em>slightly </em>more civilized than it was a few hundred years ago—even if that is hard to believe. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/half-sword/" id="3509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half Sword</a> takes us back in time to a more open age where duels-to-the-death were as common as bread. It requires two people, but does Half Sword require human or AI opponents?</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-half-sword-in-multiplayer-or-co-op">Can You Play Half Sword In Multiplayer or Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A crushing defeat in more ways than one. Credit to Half Sword Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The white flag needs to be waved on Half Sword co-op or multiplayer for now, with developer Half Sword Games confirming that there is no multiplayer present at the game’s launch.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming will hand it over to the official Half Sword Discord <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1043854763189600337/1272470349245579396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> to clear this one up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We fully understand the appeal of multiplayer and especially PvP. However, we also wish to draw your attention to the fact that physics-based multiplayer on Unreal Engine 5 is as hardcore as it gets as far as development: it is no easy task &amp; Half Sword is our first game. We are focusing on single-player physics right now to build a strong experience aimed at offering hundreds if not thousands of hours of fun.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/half-sword-games/" id="3510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half Sword Games</a> is clearly putting a lot of time and effort into this project, with a view to this being a long-term goal. So, while there’s no multiplayer at launch, it’s not being ruled out.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-sword-multiplayer-release-date">Half Sword Multiplayer Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>According to the developer, a “polished multiplayer experience” is the long-term goal for Half Sword.</strong></p>



<p>The core focus is on single-player. Despite this being a game tailor-made for two real people, the physics and enormity of the gameplay mean a lot more work is needed to ensure a stable base.</p>



<p>The FAQ says: “Are we able to offer multiplayer at release: highly unlikely. Will we do our utmost to provide multiplayer after release: more likely.”</p>



<p>It does seem like Half Sword is destined for multiplayer, doesn’t it? There’s still plenty to enjoy, even if it is only a single-player game for now. Is a lack of multiplayer a dealbreaker?

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come: Deliverance PS5 Upgrade Revealed by PlayStation Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-ps5-upgrade-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1418782</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The PlayStation Store was recently updated with a new production description for Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and it unveils something fans have been curious about for a while. It points to a PS5 upgrade being released <strong>soon </strong>for the sensational medieval RPG, which will include 4K resolutions, a boosted framerate, and high-resolution textures.</p>



<p>This follows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-upgrade-could-come/">a rumor that surfaced</a> in October 2025 suggesting that such an upgrade would emerge early in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-kcd-is-getting-the-upgrade-treatment">KCD is Getting the Upgrade Treatment</h2>



<p>Last year, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II was released by Warhorse Studios, several years after the first game spawned off the back of a successful Kickstarter project. The sequel was a mindblowing title, bursting with cinematic storytelling, authentic combat sequences, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-kingdom-comes-tom-mckay-labels-game-success-a-fever-dream/">some of the best acting</a> we’ve seen in a hot minute in the gaming space.</p>



<p>Following in the footsteps of that delivery, the first title, released in 2018, appears to be getting a current-gen upgrade, thanks to the PlayStation Store.</p>



<p>It was recently discovered that <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/227410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a PS5 upgrade</a> is incoming for the nearly eight-year-old medieval RPG. On the game’s PS Store page, the product description was recently updated to include:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/RinoTheBouncer/status/2016556945323262317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rino</a> for the spot</em>)</p>



<p>It’s a safe bet it’ll also land on Xbox, of course.</p>



<p>It’s probably a stock-standard upgrade, and it’s not the re-release that some were hoping for, but that doesn’t take anything away from the thing. Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a masterful title that simply must be experienced, as it opens the door to the adventure that is Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, which is worth every one of the <strong>many </strong>hours you’ll sink into it.</p>



<p>That’s what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">our full review</a> said about it, anyway.</p>

<p>Reigns: The Witcher by Nerial and Devolver Digital releases for iOS, Android, Mac, and PC on February 25, 2026. </p>



<p>In recent days, we have been hearing a lot about the current and upcoming instalments of The Witcher series, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured expansion</a> for The Witcher 3 and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-could-spend-up-to-800-million-on-the-witcher-4-its-estimated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development and marketing budgets</a> for The Witcher 4. However, today we aren’t talking about any of these titles, but a spinoff within a choice-based title, Reigns. </p>







<h2 id="h-reigns-the-witcher-release-date-set-for-february-2026">Reigns: The Witcher Release Date Set for February 2026</h2>



<p>Nerial and Devolver Digital have teamed up with CD Projekt Red to introduce a new spinoff titled Reigns: The Witcher, as announced in the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9it7oMf0l00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a>. This game will incorporate Reigns’ signature decision-driven gameplay into The Witcher universe, featuring Geralt of Rivia as he navigates the ballads of Dandelion. Players will have the opportunity to explore a unique narrative experience, making choices that may involve running a hot bath instead of slaying monsters.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game will also feature beloved characters from the series, including Yennefer, Triss, and Vesemir. Players can look forward to numerous combat mini-games, where Geralt will face off against familiar foes such as ghouls and rotfiends. Ultimately, the decisions made throughout the game will have significant consequences; a wrong choice could provoke the mages, while the right choice could earn you respect among the nobles.</p>







<p>In other news, The Witcher 3’s rumoured expansion could take players to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3s-rumoured-expansion-could-take-players-to-a-new-region/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new region</a>. Additionally, Netflix’s live-action adaptation will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflixs-the-witcher-series-will-end-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conclude in 2026</a>.
