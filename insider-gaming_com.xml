<p>The voice actor who portrayed Lara Croft in the first game has been cast in Amazon’s live-action Tomb Raider series. </p>



<p>The Tomb Raider live-action series recently revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazons-tomb-raider-announces-multiple-castings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple castings</a>, including Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, Martin Bobb-Semple, Bill Patterson, and more. However, it seems that one of the names wasn’t included in this list, and it might be a very big one and a nostalgic voice that the die-hard fans might remember. </p>







<h2 id="h-keeley-hawes-joins-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Keeley Hawes Joins Live-Action Tomb Raider Series </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/38027622/keeley-hawes-amazon-prime-lara-croft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>, Keeley Hawes, who voiced Lara Croft in the original game, will star in Amazon’s live-action Tomb Raider series. However, she wouldn’t be playing the titular role of Lara Croft, as that has been reserved for Game of Thrones star <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sophie-turner-lara-croft-first-look-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner</a>. There’s also an image from the set that surfaced in the report, showing Hawes in a long raincoat and a shopping bag in her hand. </p>



<p>Readers have already started speculating what role she could be playing, with many guessing it could be Lara Croft’s mother, Lady Amelia Croft, the Countess of Abingdon. However, that hasn’t been confirmed yet. </p>



<p>Hawes has spoken about still meeting fans of the game, stating they are “some of the nicest people I have ever met.” These meet-ups usually go down with her “making them a new answering machine message”. She still sees that as a good thing, stating that fans are so passionate about Lara Croft, with the character being around for over 20 years, and was “a huge part of the teenage years of so many people.” </p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Bird City—New Headwinds Map Condition, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/</link>
            <guid>1417690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Map Conditions are a key part of what keeps ARC Raiders feeling fresh and exciting, as they can fundamentally change how a map is played. Not all of them are that drastic, though, and Headwinds’ Bird City is a simple but notable Minor Map Condition. </p>



<p>Headwinds is the first major update for ARC Raiders in 2026, and it brought with it a nice selection of content. The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy Display Project</a> is perhaps the star of the update, but don’t sleep on Bird City.</p>







<p>If you’re wondering what’s different with Bird City in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> and where you can play it, then you’re in the right place. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-maps-is-bird-city-on-in-arc-raiders">What Maps Is Bird City On In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Look out for the Bird Icon. Image by Insider Gaming. </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Bird City, the new Minor Map Condition in ARC Raiders, is exclusive to the Buried City map. </strong></p>



<p>Every hour, map conditions refresh in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-prime-specimen-arc-raiders-arc-deforester-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, with Major and Minor Conditions shifting between the line-up. If you’re looking to jump into Bird City, though, you’ll need to keep your eye on Buried City, as it won’t feature anywhere else.</p>



<p>The lore behind it is that when the Cold Snap defrosted, birds were able to return from their migration. Now they’ve returned in their masses, and they’re making nests all across Buried City—with loot ripe for the taking. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-changes-does-bird-city-make-in-arc-raiders">What Changes Does Bird City Make In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure>

</figure>



<p><strong>The main thing to look out for during the Bird City Minor Map Condition is the nests that are laid in chimneys across the map.</strong></p>



<p>Considering it’s only a Minor Map Condition, it makes sense that nothing drastic has changed, but it does pose a nice chance to earn some extra loot. The birds have laid nests across Buried City, and you can search them all for Trinkets and Epic Loot. It’s by no means guaranteed; in fact, it’s fairly rare, but these nests are more than easy to find, so get searching!</p>







<p>Here’s the full list of changes made to Buried City during the Bird City Minor Map Condition:</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased amount of Trinkets</li>



<li>Increased amount of Birds</li>



<li>Increased amount of Ziplines</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valve</a> is going to have to defend itself in court for its pricing and commission practices. A class action lawsuit in the United Kingdom (UK) brought against the company is looking for roughly $900 million (£656 million) in damages.</p>



<p>First filed back in 2024 by Vicki Shotbolt, the lawsuit claims that Valve charges “excessive commission charges” that lead to <strong>“an unfair price which is then passed on to consumers”.</strong></p>







<p>The <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2026-01/16407724%20Vicki%20Shotbolt%20Class%20Representative%20Limited%20v%20Valve%20Corporation%20-%20Judgment%20%28CPO%20Application%29%20%2026%20Jan%202026.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lawsuit also alleges</a> that Valve forces platform party obligations <strong>“that prohibit publishers from selling products through other distribution channels on better terms than the same Products are available on Steam.”</strong> They say that this practice is likely to restrict competition. </p>



<h2 id="h-valve-argues-that-there-s-not-enough-evidence">Valve Argues That There’s Not Enough Evidence</h2>







<p>Valve’s defense claims that the group suing the company can’t establish proper claims regarding its commission pricing due to the fact that the suit doesn’t “consider the effect of Steam Keys”.</p>



<p><strong>“Without a credible plan for taking Steam Keys into account, the PCR cannot establish Steam’s actual effective commission charge, and without this, the PCR cannot establish whether the commission charge amounts to an unfair price,”</strong> Valve argues.</p>



<p>They also say that suing group <strong>“failed to show a plan to determine which Steam Partners actually paid these allegedly unfair prices.”</strong></p>







<p>Despite these arguments and others, the London Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that the case must move forward. As of publishing, Valve has not responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit.</p>



<p>The case was filed on behalf of up to 14 million users, including minors. Shotbolt’s attorneys say that the average loss ranges between $30-$60 (£22-£44) per person.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-arc-raiders-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>High-level players seeking a greater challenge and impossible odds in ARC Raiders have a sadistic new mode to tackle—Solos vs Squads. It’s exactly as it sounds, and if you want to play the new game mode and see what it’s all about, read on for full guide details.</p>



<p>If you thought there was enough danger in ARC Raiders, think again. The January <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds Update</a> went overboard with a new Solos Vs Squads game mode. The nature of it has the community confused, though, so this should clear up any questions you have, fellow Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders">How To Play Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A simple toggle. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>After you’ve updated ARC Raiders to include the Headwinds Update, you should see a setting in the matchmaking box in the bottom corner saying ‘Solos vs. Squads,’ and this is the key to the difficult matchmaking you seek.</strong></p>



<p>Here are some quick steps to help you out:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up your copy of ARC Raiders.</li>



<li>Make sure the Headwinds Update is installed and ready to go.</li>



<li>Go to the main menu.</li>



<li>Select the matchmaking box in the bottom-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Highlight <strong>Solo vs. Squads</strong>.</li>



<li>Have it set to <strong>ON</strong>.</li>



<li>ARC Raiders will find a Solo Vs Squads match for you.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-what-level-do-you-need-to-be-to-play-solo-vs-squads-in-arc-raiders">What Level Do You Need To Be To Play Solo Vs Squads In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>You have to be at least Level 40 to queue up for Solo Vs Squads matchmaking in ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re Level 39, you’ll need to grind it out first. This isn’t a mode for newcomers or even relatively experienced players. Solo Vs Squads is a tough test with hardened players and veterans in mind. If you queue up, there’s a high likelihood you’ll be beaten and bested by macho squads keen to bully you. It’s a dangerous battlefield where humans are more dangerous than anarchic ARCs!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders">What Is Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This might be a fairer fight. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking means you’ll set foot on the grounds above Sperenza, and you will run into full squads as a solo player in ARC.</strong></p>



<p>There really is no other way to put this: Solo Vs Sqauds is not for the faint of heart. Real people will potentially pose a far greater problem than AI. You need to be extra cautious, and if you get into a firefight, you need to be prepared, because it will be a tough skirmish.</p>



<p>There are reasons to put yourself through this, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-should-you-play-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders">Why Should You Play Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The Solo Vs Squads playlist allows you to earn more XP for kills and extracts while traversing ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>You don’t get extra-special rewards for this game mode; literally, the only incentive is more XP, and that’s it. This might put many of you off immediately, and it’s likely not supposed to be the new mode everyone gravitates toward.</p>



<p>But as Embark has said in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes-solo-vs-squads-bird-city-open-parties-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds patch notes</a>: “Solo vs Squads is a new matchmaking option for our experienced and highly skilled players who enjoy the PvP aspect of the game. Solo Raiders level 40 and above will get the “Solo vs Squad” toggle above matchmaking to join the Squads queue and tackle squads of Raiders head-on. When opting in, players will receive +20% bonus XP at the end of the round on both successful extract, and defeat.”</p>



<p>Are you a high enough level to play? Is the extra XP worth the risk with no real rewards on offer? Let the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> know if you intend to ride solo, or if you have other ARC Raiders conversations you want to have!</p>
