<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sony-interactive-entertainment/" id="3274">Sony </a>has patented a new controller type that could revolutionize how gamers think about what a controller can be.</p>



<p><a href="https://sudoku-online.pro/pdfs/buttonless-sony-ps6-controller.pdf">According to a new patent</a> dated January 27, 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sony-interactive-entertainment/" id="52192">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> is presenting a very forward-thinking adaptive controller. In the pack, they describe the drawbacks to modern video game controllers, including difficulties with fixed layouts. For example, they present a hypothetical scenario in which controllers are too large or too small for some users, and highlight the need for game controllers that support different configurations. They also discuss the desire for improvements in the placement of joysticks or D-pads</p>



<p>The drawing shows the layout of a typical controller without fixed buttons, but with a digital screen that allows customization. It also shows different button and D-pad placements, and notes that a button press can be recognized by different movements, such as a tap or swipe.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Sony has registered a patent for an unusual gamepad without physical buttons.</p><p>It features a fully touch-sensitive surface that supports gestures such as taps and swipes, and it will be able to adapt to finger positions, dynamically changing the control zones. <a href="https://t.co/XnQLO18WfZ">pic.twitter.com/XnQLO18WfZ</a></p></div>— Gaming.Bo3.gg (@Gaming_bo3gg) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gaming_bo3gg/status/2017206220491239924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-sony-has-redefined-controllers-in-the-past">Sony Has Redefined Controllers in the Past</h2>



<p>Sony has always been innovative with their controllers. The current standard of twin analog sticks began with the DualShock controller, which, in and of itself, was an advanced take on the original PlayStation controller. Later, they would innovate with Sixaxis motion-sensing technology in their PlayStation 3 controller. The PS4 added a touchpad, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PS5 </a>added haptic feedback and dynamic triggers.</p>



<p>While there’s no way to know whether this controller patent will be realized, it shows that Sony is considering ways to be inclusive and allow players to choose their own configurations and play their way. </p>







<p>Also, one could argue that, with the rise of mobile gaming, a younger generation is already accustomed to virtual gamepads. At the same time, it’s a leap into the future that may be difficult for some.</p>

<p>WWE 2K26 launches on March 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. The series is officially leaving the last-gen Xbox One and PlayStation 4 behind after over a decade.</p>



<p>This year’s game features CM Punk as the game’s main cover athlete and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature wrestler in the game’s Showcase Mode</a>.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> is updating some of the most popular game modes in major ways.</p>



<p>It’s WWE Royal Rumble weekend, and that means that there is a major push regarding marketing for the upcoming WWE 2K26 video game. <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/wrestling/wwe/cm-punk-liv-morgan-bron-breakker-talk-wwe-2k26-as-new-game-info-released">New information from The Takedown on SI </a>confirms several updates coming to the game modes. </p>



<p>In addition to confirming several updates previously reported by Insider Gaming, new details give plenty for longtime fans of WWE video games to be excited about, as it pertains to customization, replay value, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-universe-mode-gets-a-draft-and-more">WWE Universe Mode Gets a Draft and More</h2>



<p>Universe Mode has been a focal point of WWE video games since 2010. Sandbox mode in WWE games lets players be the promoter they’ve always wanted to be, setting up cards, creating rivalries, managing injuries, and more.</p>



<p>This year, WWE 2K26 not only adds a Draft to Universe Mode to increase realism, but also introduces a new Universe Creation Wizard, additional promo types to add more drama to your rivalries, a “Watch Show” mode for those that like pure sim experiences, and more.</p>



<p>MyGM Mode, which acts as a more short-term brand management sim, is also getting some improvements. There will be support for more match types than ever, including intergender and eight-man matches, more shows per season, and new management challenges.</p>



<p>MyRISE, the game’s version of MyPLAYER from NBA 2K, also features major improvements, including the ability to continue their career mode beyond completing the campaign. This year’s campaign will also feature new decision-based storylines in which your choice to keep your customized WWE Superstar as a babyface or a heel will affect the story.</p>



<p>The Island mode will also come to PC for the first time ever.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-creation-suite-options-spark-new-life-in-wwe-2k26">New Creation Suite Options Spark New Life in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>In addition to all of those updates, there are major improvements to the Creation Suite. For the first time, there will be 200 Create-A-Superstar save slots. This is double the existing amount and provides plenty of options not only to create your own stars but also to download popular stars from other promotions. Additionally, Community Creations now supports 2,000 images, advanced body/face morphing, and two-tone hair blending for maximized Superstar and arena customization.</p>



<p>The game is scheduled to release to the general public on March 13, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/">if you pre-order a premium edition</a>, you can get Early Access. For more WWE 2K26, learn about the forthcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-is-going-to-have-a-ringside-pass/" id="173150">Ringside Pass.</a></p>
