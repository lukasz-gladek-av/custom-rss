<p>MultiVersus could be coming to an end. A new rumor from known MultiVersus leaker AusilMV suggests that the game’s upcoming Season 5 could be the last one.</p>



<p>“[MultiVersus] Season 5 may be the final season of MultiVersus, depending on how it performs,” <a href="https://xcancel.com/ausilmvs/status/1884840081761919172?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a> while prefacing that this isn’t confirmed yet.. “A notable source shared this rumor with me, stating that Season 5 may be a “last-ditch effort” for the game.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out Warner Bros. Games and developer Player First Games for comment on the rumor. Should a response be received, it will be amended to this story.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-year-in-review-multiversus-had-it-all-and-threw-it-away">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-multiversus-had-it-all-and-threw-it-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year In Review—MultiVersus Had it All And Threw it Away</a></h6>



<p>The idea that MultiVersus could be heading towards a tipping point shouldn’t come as much of a surprise to players and outsiders alike. Since the game launched with high player numbers nearly three years ago, its popularity has dwindled. The game saw a peak player count on Steam of 153,433 players before it fell by 99% within its first few months. </p>



<p>After it struggled to regain traction, Warner Bros. Games announced it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-to-shut-down-ahead-of-full-launch-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking the game down</a> in June 2023 after what it then started to call an “open beta” period. It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-release-date-announced-for-may-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">re-released in May 2024</a> with numerous updates and changes in the months since. However, it has yet to return to the numbers it had when it first launched and the hype from players was there.</p>



<p>MultiVersus Season 5 is scheduled to start in early February. It’ll be interesting to see what the developers have planned to try and get players to not only pick up their game, but stick around after.</p>

<p>An Associate Marketing Director at Ubisoft has claimed that Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown sold 1.3 million units in its first year.</p>



<p>First spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a>, the Associate Marketing Director’s LinkedIn profile says that the game sold 1.3 million units in its first year, a number not too surprising as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported in October 2024</a> that the game had sold approximately 1 million units in its first 9 months. The game<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-ubisoft-from-low-morale-to-internal-tensions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sold 300,000 copies</a> in its first month.</p>



<p>As reported then, the game failed to meet Ubisoft’s internal expectations, and a Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown sequel was not greenlit. Its team would move over to other Ubisoft projects, including Beyond Good and Evil 2, Project Over (a next mainline Ghost Recon game), and Project Steambot, and a Rayman Remake in development at Ubisoft Milan.</p>



<p>The game received generally favourable reviews on launch across all versions of the game on review aggregator Metacritic and while the game failed to miss internal expectations is unknown, it’s likely attributed to Ubisoft’s recent public perception, which has dwindled in recent years due to poor decisions and a lack of understanding the current gaming landscape. </p>



<p>As for other Prince of Persia projects, the Sands of Time Remake continues development after being rebooted and is slated for 2026. Ubisoft has opted to completely remove everything we know about the remake, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recasting the original actor Yuri Lowenthal</a>.</p>
