<p>The Far Cry extraction-based multiplayer shooter under codename Maverick has been rebooted, Insider Gaming has learned.</p>



<p>Project Maverick, which was initially intended as a multiplayer component to Far Cry 7 morphed into its own project in early 2023, but after internal review, the project has been rebooted.</p>



<p>That’s according to several sources familiar with the projects development, who said that the “writing was on the wall” for a number of months. It was said that the final nail in the coffin came after its dedicated tech team called Talisker (also the old name of Far Cry 7 before it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">morphed into two separate projects</a>), moved from Maverick to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully dedicated to Blackbird</a> in late December to ensure the project stays on track.</p>



<p>Maverick was going to be an extraction-based multiplayer shooter set in Alaska, where players would try to survive and extract in the harsh elements against wild animals, AI soldiers, and other players. </p>



<p>It’s understood that Ubisoft Montreal, the studio heading both Maverick and Blackbird (Far Cry 7) will take the multiplayer game back to prototyping with Ubisoft Sherbrooke. Ubisoft Berlin, who where also assisting on the games development has seen around a dozen or so developers move to Blackbird, and another dozen move to another project. However, its understood approximately 50 developers are now left without an assigned project and will likely be placed on viability this month.</p>



<p>The exact reason for Maverick’s reboot is unclear, but the decision seems to have been made as a part of Ubisoft’s new strategy to streamline its teams and projects amid the company’s struggles. That being said, some on the Blackbird project feel like a 2026 release date is still fairly optimistic, with the project bloating in headcount and budget. Teams on the project include Ubisoft Montreal, Ubisoft Berlin, Ubisoft Annecy, Redstorm, and the ‘Talisker team’.</p>



<p>That being said, the project has already started playtesting, with several sources telling Insider Gaming that the game played great and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes up the traditional Far cry formula</a> in a number of ways, from overall gameplay to the movement mechanics.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Ubisoft has yet to officially comment on Maverick or Blackbird.</p>

<p>VALORANT Patch 10.04 is officially live, and since it goes hand-in-hand <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a new Act</a>, it means that it’s a big one. The latest patch adds a dynamic, potentially game-breaking new duelist agent, major balance changes to existing agents, and some key changes to map pool.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into the full list of updates now live as of VALORANT Patch 10.04.</p>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-the-waylay-era">Welcome to the Waylay Era</h2>



<p>Waylay is the newest addition to the duelist class, and this new light-bending duelist from Thailand has “broken” written all over her. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-pros-say-the-next-duelist-will-be-an-even-more-annoying-jett/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The pros weren’t lying when they said she could replace Jett</a>, or be just as annoying. Her kit is designed to disrupt, hinder, and surprise enemy players.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Waylay Official Gameplay Reveal // VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/njK6KgRNr2k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Here are each of the abilities for Waylay, the newest VALORANT duelist:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Refract</strong>: Create a light beacon on the floor. Reactivate to return to the beacon, traveling as an invulnerable mote of pure light. This is like a stationary Yoru Gatecrash, but it affords the opportunity to gather info before returning to the starting point.</li>



<li><strong>Light Speed</strong>: It’s a Jett double dash. Waylay’s Light Speed can be used to jump over walls or push deep into a site during an execute. There are going to be so many highlight plays from this one.</li>



<li><strong>Saturate</strong>: Throw a cluster of light that explodes when it hits the ground, applying the Hinder effect to nearby players. Hinder slows enemy fire rate, recoil recovery, equip time, reload speed, movement speed, and jump speed.</li>



<li><strong>Convergent Paths</strong>: Waylay’s ultimate ability. Project a beam of light forward, which after a delay, applies Waylay with a speed boost and applies Hinder to enemies caught in the beam.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-valorant-10-04-balance-changes">VALORANT 10.04 Balance Changes</h2>



<p>Clove, Tejo, Iso, and Deadlock are the primary recipients of this patch’s balance changes. In this section, we dive into the major changes made to each of those four agents.</p>



<h3 id="h-clove">Clove</h3>



<p>Meddle, Clove’s Decay-applying throwable, now explodes 0.75 seconds after hitting the ground, instead of just a 1.3 second delay. The cooldown on their Ruse smokes has increased from 30 seconds to 40. Pick Me Up’s health buff duration has increased from eight seconds to 10, but the move speed durations drops from eight seconds to just three.</p>



<h3 id="h-deadlock">Deadlock</h3>



<p>GravNet is now Deadlock’s signature ability, costing no money at the start of the round and receiving a 40 second rechargeable cooldown. GravNet’s size has slightly decreased from 16m to 13m. Barrier Mesh now costs 400 credits.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-iso">Iso</h3>



<p>Iso now only gets one charge of his Undercut, but it now applies Suppression along with Vulnerability. The tagging on Double Tap has been changed, so he is now slowed more when his shield breaks. Iso will always have Double Tap applied now when he wins a duel in his Kill Contract ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-tejo">Tejo</h3>



<p>Tejo’s Guided Salvo missiles deal 65 points of damage and deal half damage to non-player objects. This changes has been made so that Tejo’s Guided Salvo does not successfully destroy Killjoy’s Lockdown.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-10-04-map-changes">VALORANT 10.04 Map Changes</h2>



<p>With the start of the new act, the VALORANT map pool is getting a change. <strong>Ascent and Icebox are back in</strong> the Competitive and Deathmatch queues, while <strong>Abyss and Bind are being taken out</strong>. Ascent is returning with a big change: the infamous B Main wall that players spam through with the Odin has been reinforced. Riot noted that all the spamming at this spot was “creating unhealthy gameplay and frustrating experiences.”</p>
