<p>Counter-Strike is a foundational part of the still fledgling esports scene, and throughout its various iterations, it has always attracted viewers wanting to bet. With hundreds of matches taking place across the world at different events each month, there’s no shortage of competition for viewers to bet on.</p>

<h2 id="h-can-you-bet-on-counter-strike">Can You Bet on Counter-Strike?</h2>



<p>Yes, viewers can bet on professional Counter-Strike matches. The Counter-Strike betting market has been around for a long time now, meaning there are a plethora of sites to use that offer different ways of betting. At this moment, it’s one of the largest aspects of the current state of esports betting.</p>



<p>Viewers can gamble on Counter-Strike match winners, map winners, exact map scores, over and under-round totals, individual player performances, as well as other markets. Depending on the site, players can bet using real money, cryptocurrency, or CS2 skins in their Steam inventory.</p>



<p>Traditional sportsbooks that are accessible on mobile apps like PrizePicks and Underdog have started offering Counter-Strike wagers as well.</p>



<p>Before wagering on a Counter-Strike match, it’s important to learn about responsible gambling practices. There are some golden rules to consider: </p>



<ul>
<li>Never use gambling to replace your primary source of income</li>



<li>Never bet more than you are comfortable losing. Gambling, no matter how sure you are of a bet or result in mind, is still a risk at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you are comfortable gambling and placing bets on Counter-Strike matches, then do your research into what site you want to use. Not all sites are available in every country, so players might be limited to sites they’re legally allowed to wager on. If betting on a specific player or team, shop around different Counter-Strike betting sites to find the best odds that give out the most winnings.</p>
