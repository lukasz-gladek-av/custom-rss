<p>The Stream Deck is a must-have item for any streamer, and while other products might offer the same service, it’s the best in the market. With programmable buttons that make it easier to switch between scenes, trigger on-screen effects, and more, it’s one of the best gifts for streamers.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-custom-gamer-tag-neon-sign">Custom Gamer Tag Neon Sign</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Anyone looking to jazz up their streaming set up should definitely take a look at the Custom Gamer Tag Neon Sign, which lights up the room and simultaneously acts as promotion for their brand. It’s the perfect background for a streamer, as it easily promotes their account in any clips that are cut.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-the-ultimate-streamer-s-log-book">The Ultimate Streamer’s Log Book</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Keeping ideas fresh is a tough challenge for any streamer or content creator, and finding the right approach can be tricky. That’s where The Ultimate Streamer’s Log Book comes in handy, providing over 100 stream challenges to help you stay organized and come up with fresh approaches.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-kdd-headset-stand-with-charging-station">KDD Headset Stand With Charging Station</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Any streamer or content creator needs to ensure they have all their required equipment fully charged and ready to go, which is where the KDD Headset Stand comes in perfectly. Equipped with 2 USB and 1 type-C charging port, it can be used to charge smartphones, tablets, headphones, controllers, and more, making it among the best gifts for streamers.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-overhead-camera-mount-with-ring-light">Overhead Camera Mount with Ring Light</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re thinking of doing top-down content, like pack openings or drawings, an overhead camera with a light is a must-have, and this has both in one. Compatible with iPhone and Logitech webcams, among others, this camera mount attaches to the desk and provides everything you need for a quick set-up.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-pqrqp-3-in-1-wireless-lavalier-microphone">PQRQP 3-in-1 Wireless Lavalier Microphone</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Recording content on the go means you should have a clippable microphone to block out background noise and focus on exactly the source you want, and this 3-in-1 microphone presents an affordable option. Compatible with iPhone, Android, cameras, and more, it’s the perfect tool for content creating on the go.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-frigidaire-retro-9-can-personal-fridge">Frigidaire Retro 9-Can Personal Fridge</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Long sessions on stream or editing content can be taxing, and you don’t want to have to keep on going in and out for refreshments. A mini fridge on hand is therefore advised, and the Frigidaire Retro 9-Can Personal Fridge has enough room to keep you going in a long stint, and a nice design to boot.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-elgato-prompter">Elgato Prompter</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Keeping engaged with chat is crucial for any live streamer or content creator, but you don’t want to crank your neck turning your head to different monitors. The Elgato prompter counters that, showing a live feed of chat to interact with, or, if recording content, showing a script to follow.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-neewer-collapsible-backdrop">Neewer Collapsible Backdrop</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A green screen might not be an immediate necessity but, once you start using it, you’ll never look the other way again. The Neewer Collapsible Backdrop has both green and blue screen, coming double-sided, and is easy to put up and store, all available for a decent price.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-elgato-4k-s-external-capture-card">Elgato 4K S External Capture Card</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A capture card is one of the most important items for any streamer or content creators, as it quickly captures all content from an external source, like a console, and connects it to PC and your stream. Without it, you’ll be limited on your options when streaming, and it should be one of the first things you pick up when you get started.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series Setting Possibly Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-setting-ancient-rome-report/</link>
            <guid>1367896</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The setting and time period of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series may have been revealed, according to a new report. Even more so, more information regarding the show’s development has emerged online.</p>



<p>Since 2007, the Assassin’s Creed series of games has been going rather strong, spanning eras of history with action-packed gameplay and gripping story. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ordered-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Netflix announced that it’s working with Ubisoft to develop a live-action Assassin’s Creed series. Multiple ones are apparently in the works, as revealed in the blog from July, but the biggest one just cast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actor Toby Wallace</a> as co-lead. Now, more information on <strong>the show’s setting has reportedly been revealed</strong>, and <strong>it’s one that fans have been asking for for a long time</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series-may-take-place-in-ancient-rome-according-to-new-report">Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series May Take Place in Ancient Rome, According to New Report</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report comes from <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-set-to-explore-ancient-rome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive from Nexus Point News</a>, which has previously leaked multiple game adaptations like God of War and Elden Ring. In the article, it mentions that sources have said what Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed’s setting will be: <strong>Ancient Rome</strong>. Specifically, <strong>the show is reportedly taking place between 54-68 AD</strong> during Emperor Nero’s reign. Both Nero and his mentor, Seneca, will be featured in the series. Filming is taking place in Italy, so it does line up there, if true. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the report says that Toby Wallace will be part of<strong> an ensemble cast</strong>, meaning there will be <strong>multiple leads</strong>. It’s important to note that <strong>Ubisoft and Netflix have not confirmed this news</strong>, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. Still, Ancient Rome has been asked for by fans for a long time. However, if true, it would mean players would likely not get to play in that time period like they’d hoped to. This would also mean that the show would feature an original story, which is a bit of a risky move. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see how the show shapes up.</p>







<p>What do you think of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed setting? Is Ancient Rome a good fit? If true, are you disappointed to not see it in the games? Is doing an original story worth it? Going with an ensemble cast?
