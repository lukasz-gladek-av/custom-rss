<p>A new leak has shared that Avowed will have 30, 40, and 60 FPS Modes for the Xbox Series X.</p>



<p>Also leaked was that 30 and 40 FPS modes will also be available for the Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>The news was shared by <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, who shared the information from someone who appears to have got a review copy of the game (which were sent out earlier this week).</p>



<p>Avowed faced some criticism in mid-2024 following an announcement via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBL4jTHs5w&amp;ab_channel=IronLordsPodcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Iron Lords Podcast</a> that the game would be “targeting a baseline of 30FPS,” even on the more powerful Xbox Series X. </p>



<p>“It’s a first-person, single-player game, you don’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-doesnt-need-60-fps-mode-says-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">necessarily need that 60 frames</a>. And that allows us to get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting and all this other stuff,” said Obsidian art director Matt Hansen. Of course, after the comments, social media blow up in rage at the lack of 60FPS, but it’s a feature that Obsidian has seemingly overcome.</p>



<p>Even so, Insider Gaming’s Senior Editor Grant-Taylor Hill got hands-on with Avowed at Gamescom 2024 and failed to see any issue with how Avowed ran. “Even in intense combat sequences filled with blasts of magic and clashing swords, the game looked brilliant on screen,” he said.</p>



<p>On social media, players seem to be happy with the leak, with some even going saying that 40fps is the best FPS for single-player console gaming.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, it’s currently unclear on if Avowed will be capped at 60FPS or not on PC.</p>



<p>Avowed releases on February 18, with its review embargo lifting on February 13. You can see more dates on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Calendar</a>. </p>



<p>What do you think of Avowed’s 30, 40, and 60 FPS options? Let us know what you think about this news on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Midnight Society has announced that it will be cancelling its NFT-backed extraction shooter, DEADROP, with 55 developers affected.</p>



<p>Announced on X (formerly Twitter), Midnight Society wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>Today we are announcing Midnight Society will be closing its doors after three incredible years, with an amazing team of over 55 developers contributing to our new IP DEADROP.</p><p>We are actively seeking other game studios that would be interested in offering employment opportunities to our talented team members.</p><p>If you know anyone who’s hiring please forward this message to them or DM us for direct intros.</p><p>We express our sincere gratitude to each and every one of our community members and deeply sorry we were unable to reach our ultimate goal.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>Midnight Society was originally founded by Robert Bowling of Call of Duty fame and content creator Dr Disrespect. However, following a series of allegations being levelled at the streamer last year, it was announced that Dr Disrespect would no longer be working at the studio.</p>



<p>After those events unfolded, Midnight Society’s leadership team insisted that Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm was little more than an influencer and marketer for the brand, but the shamed streamer claimed he was much more important to the project. Could his removal from the company have been a factor in this house of cards collapsing in on itself?</p>



<p>DEADROP was poised to be a ‘vertical extraction shooter’ fused with the blockchain and featuring NFT-driven mechanics. In a series of ‘snippets’ released during the game’s development cycle, players were invited to get early access to the title – myself included – and it wasn’t anything to write home about.</p>
