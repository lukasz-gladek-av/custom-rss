<p>I wasn’t cool enough to play the original release of The Thing, but I am old enough to stay up late and play scary games in the dark now, which means The Thing Remastered, the restored cult classic, was on my to-play list immediately. On launch, it ran smoothly, with minor bugs and glitches to contend with, but that’s to be expected of a two-decade-old game, right? Well, Nightdive Studios continuously proves itself as a top-tier studio, and now they’ve pushed The Thing Remastered Patch 1.1 to resolve so many issues!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-thing-remastered-patch-1-1-notes">The Thing Remastered Patch 1.1 Notes</h2>



<p>As you can see from the massive list of patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958970/The_Thing_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">originally posted to Steam</a>, Nightdive broke the mold and decided to address everything from achievement woes to game crashes to Steam Deck performance. That last change is definitely welcome, as it’s where I tend to play the survival horror the most.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at the entire list of patch notes:</p>



<p><strong>General</strong>:<br>– Fixed the Conspiracy Theorist achievement. Old saved games are retroactively fixed!<br>– Updated Colins Fate achievement description.<br>– Fixed a softlock where Stolls would stop running to the black tech lab door.<br>– Fixed a crash after detonating the C4 on the airstrip level.<br>– Fixed a rare intermittent crash when fighting Thing beasts.<br>– Added a “Most Recent” button to the load game menu, so it’s easier to load your latest save.<br>– Autosaves now contain the name of the level they were saved on, instead of just “Autosave”.<br>– Fixed a bug where characters would sometimes become unable to step up onto higher surfaces after falling off of the curbs in the roadway tunnel.<br>– Fixed a crash when quitting the game.<br>– Fixed a bug where bindings would be missing from the input options on first launch.<br>– Fixed a crash in Strata Medibay when Fisk dies before telling you the code.<br>– Fixed Blake’s hand clipping with his sleeve in the first cutscene with Faraday.<br>– Fixed a bug where the second camera angle would fail to activate during the weather station cutscene, allowing you to interrupt it and recruit yourself.<br>– Improved performance when querying dynamic game options.<br>– Moved the game version information to the options menu, off of the interstitial screen.<br>– Decreased the visibility of the game version information so it is less intrusive.<br>– Reimplemented the pan upwards when the game over screen is visible.<br>– Added support for autoexec.cfg, allowing users to customize console variables not usually marked as saved to kexEngine.cfg.</p>



<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>:<br>– Fixed an oversight where weapon firing rates were not properly respected when mashing the fire button. Excluding the pistol.<br>– Ammo and health dispensers now dispense fewer clips and medipacks depending on the difficulty. This can be changed at any time during game play.<br>– Marked some grenades as “volatile” so that they explode when damaged, like the original game, to fix a quirk where grenades placed for cinematic purposes would not explode.<br>– Changed the direction Blake faces after ending the cutscene in the weather station level.</p>

<p><strong>Levels</strong>:<br>– Fixed an oversight where an explosive barrel would explode when passing through the tripwire of an already exploded trip-mine charge in the penultimate level.<br>– Hid the out of bounds “Back Door Key” item that looked like a document in the submersible level.<br>– Fixed inaccurate collision in the first level, where characters would appear to sink into the snow.<br>– Fixed collision in the watchtower on the third level where you could get stuck in the handrail.<br>– Renamed Carter in the Strata Medibay level to Hawk, to utilize a set of unused voice lines.<br>– Added the missing green light to a save terminal in the third level.<br>– Fixed two computers in the weather station level that did not have an ID set for the Conspiracy Theorist achievement (given automatically to old saves).<br>– Shimmied a medipack dispenser down in the level following Strata Medibay that was WAY too high up.<br>– Fixed bad collision on the external stairs in the weather station.<br>– Flipped a few ammo boxes which were facing the wrong direction.<br>– Fixed several collision bugs in the Norwegian outpost where you could fall off of the world and walk underneath the building.<br>– Fixed sounds across several levels that would duplicate forever, causing the game to eventually fall silent.</p>



<p><strong>Display</strong>:<br>– Fixed the depth of field effect sometimes creating bright flickering pixels.<br>– Fixed the glass on the doors in the submersible being opaque.<br>– Improved normal maps on many posters and boards.<br>– Gave Whitley new trousers.<br>– Changed the on-screen watermark in the editor build, so it doesn’t confuse people.<br>– Performance improvements when using the D3D11 renderer.</p>



<p><strong>Sound</strong>:<br>– Fixed a bug where speech audio would sometimes not follow the speaker.</p>



<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong>:<br>– Fixed the framerate being locked to half the screen refresh rate while using the Vulkan renderer, when launched outside of the Steam client.</p>
