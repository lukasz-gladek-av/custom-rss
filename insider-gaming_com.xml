<p>During the Fallout Day Showcase, Bethesda Game Studios unveiled a <strong>new trailer for Fallout 4</strong>, ten years after it hit the market in 2015. The trailer, which was kind of better than anything published before the game came out, revealed that an ANNIVERSARY EDITION is coming to the market on November 10.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition of Fallout 4 will come with all expansions, plus Creations is being added to the game, bringing a whole host of curated expansions, mods, and other upgrades and changes.</p>

<p>Today’s Fallout Day bonanza included a stunning announcement: Fallout 4 is coming back with an Anniversary Edition. It has been ten years since the best-selling title dropped, and it’s still one of the most popular Fallout experiences ever made.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition comes with all DLCs and expansions released for the game in the years that followed the launch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>



<li>Far Harbor</li>



<li>Automatron</li>



<li>Nuka-World</li>



<li>Contraptions Workshop</li>



<li>Wasteland Workshop</li>



<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>
</ul>



<p>More than 150 Creations will be added to Fallout 4 via the Anniversary Edition, and Bethesda also revealed that the game will feature <strong>unreleased items</strong>, just to keep things feeling fresh. These items will be discoverable through a new menu, added in an upcoming update to Fallout 4 – you won’t need the Anniversary Edition to obtain this content.</p>
