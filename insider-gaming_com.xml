<p>Xbox owners could be getting their hands on more PlayStation-exclusive games in 2025. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/inside-the-risky-strategy-that-will-define-xboxs-next-decade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new report</a> from Jez Corden of Windows Central, sources have told him that there will be “more unannounced and previously PlayStation-exclusive games” coming to Xbox Series X|S next year. </p>



<p>News of PlayStation exclusives coming to Xbox shouldn’t surprise anyone. Over recent years, both sides have continued to release games on the competing platforms. Recently, Genshin Impact finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made its debut</a> on Xbox after being console exclusive to PlayStation since 2020. Another PlayStation exclusive,&nbsp;Predator: Hunting Grounds, released on Xbox in 2024 after four years as a Sony exclusive.</p>



<p>As of now, it’s unclear if Corden is referring to first-party or third-party games making their way to Microsoft’s consoles.</p>



<p>On the other side of the coin, Microsoft is bringing exclusives like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> to PlayStation 5 in 2025. There are also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored plans</a> for Forza Horizon 5 to make its way to the console as well.</p>

<p>One of the most popular memes is making its way to Fortnite as Skibidi Toilet is coming to the game. According to Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1869022252060365263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, a Skibidi Toilet bundle will be available in the game starting on Wednesday, December 18.</p>



<p>Players will be able to buy the full bundle for 2,800 VBucks or a la carte. The main piece of the bundle is a Plungerman skin for 1500 VBucks that includes a LEGO variant and a Skibidi backpack. Also available is a Skibidi Toilet backpack for 600 Vbucks and a Plungerman’s Plunger pickaxe for 800 Vbucks.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Epic Games has yet to confirm the release of the bundle. If and when that happens, this article will be updated with full details.</p>



<p>The continued growth of Skibidi Toilet shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone. Earlier this year it was announced that a Skibidi Toilet TV show and movie were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skibidi-toilet-movie-and-tv-show-are-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the works at a major studio</a>.</p>

<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a game that some might not have expected to see happen after the dissolution of Google Stadia and its studios shortly after the launch of its predecessor, Journey to the Savage Planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, after Typhoon Studios was shut down in 2021, its founders started another studio called Raccoon Logic and acquired the rights to Journey and the planned sequel. Now, over three years later, Revenge of the Savage Planet is on its way to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC in May 2025.</p>



<p>I was recently invited to a preview event for the game to get a more detailed look at the gameplay, a few missions, weapons, enemies, the planets you’ll visit, and more. While I didn’t get to play the game firsthand, I was shown over 30 minutes of gameplay that left me excited with what I saw and wishing I was shown more.</p>



<h2 id="h-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-preview">Revenge of the Savage Planet Preview</h2>



<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet is built in Unreal Engine 5 – specifically, 5.3 – and features a vibrant world with unique creatures and over-the-top animations that could best be described as goofy. There are four main planets with a secret fifth planet that you unlock “if you figure out the mysteries of the world and find it yourself”.</p>



<p>As opposed to the first game in the series, this game moves to a third-person perspective. Creative Director Alex Hutchinson said the developers made the move for a few reasons, including opening up for more character customization, better platforming, and better for seeing things that can happen to players such as catching on fire or slipping. With the move to third-person, the game removed the slap mechanic in favor of keeping the kick that can send creatures launching high into the air. It was done because kicks looked “funnier” in third person than a slap did, Hutchinson said.</p>



<p>As far as what players can expect with gameplay, Hutchinson said that Revenge of the Savage Planet is a “Metroidvania at heart”. You have to get new weapons and equipment, upgrade your skills, and uncover coordinates for the new planets to progress forward. There’s also character customization and home customization that lets you express yourself in the way you see fit.</p>



<p>Each planet has its own unique creatures that vary between friendly and hostile. Some will just roam around you while others will go out of their way to attack. One example on the desert planet is a beetle that digs its horn into the ground to help it flip and try to hit you with its back.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Exploration Is The Name Of The Game</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game features a map that the team debated adding. Hutchinson said they didn’t want players to play the game through a map. To avoid that, Raccoon Logic made it so the map reveals itself as you go to various areas rather than being available from the get-go. That’s part of the game’s ultimate goal as well. The developers don’t want you to get through the planets in one fell swoop while you play. With the various locations, they said that the goal is to distract you with everything around you. Each planet has a number of secrets to unlock and special areas to explore that will keep you from getting what you need in order to return to Earth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking of exploration, the planets have a layered environment, giving you more areas to visit and traverse. Some have you bouncing through a fungi canopy while others have you gliding through the sky to get to your destination.</p>



<p>The game can be played alone or with a friend either locally or online with cross-play support. Despite talks of potentially allowing for four-player co-op, Racoon Logic said that the decision to limit it to two-player was a creative choice. They found that players are more likely to talk and interact more with one other play than with a group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding game length, Raccoon Logic says tests have shown it taking around 20 hours to 100% the game while some have completed the main story in 15 hours. This is by design as the studio wanted to keep it realistic to complete where it didn’t feel like a chore or burden to get through. To hit that time frame, the game’s difficulty scale isn’t one to push players away. Rather than a traditional scale as you progress, Revenge of the Savage Planet’s difficulty will adjust based on how efficient you are as you play. The more efficient, the more challenging it can be. Still, they didn’t want the game to be too challenging for anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not about challenge, it’s more about exploring,” Hutchinson said while adding that they view the game as something for all ages. “We’re not Dark Souls, we’re ‘Light Souls’.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, I was left excited about what Raccoon Logic has built with Revenge of the Savage Planet. The planets, for the areas shown, look great — there’s an ice planet that wasn’t shown but was talked about that I’m really interested in visiting — and the gameplay appears fun and accessible. One thing I would’ve liked to see more of during my time around the game, though, was its satire and humor. Journey to the Savage Planet was a bit hit or miss in that area. So, I’m hoping the writing is a bit better this time around. That said, humor is subjective so I know what I may find funny or not likely won’t be the same as you or someone else playing the game.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, the game will be coming to PC and consoles when it launches. For those on consoles, it’s currently planned to launch at a locked 30 frames per second (FPS). They are looking at getting it to 60 FPS on the systems, but it’s not something in the cards just yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing that the game will feature are platform-specific costumes at launch. For example, those on Xbox will have a Red Ring of Death costume available exclusively to them. Eventually, the plan is to bring every outfit to every player, but, at the start, they want to give players a unique feel depending on what they choose to play on.</p>



<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet launches in May 2025, so stick with Insider Gaming for a full review around release.</p>

<p>Certain meta decks dominated Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s early weeks, but the release of Celebi ex prompted a new meta deck in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket, and we have a walkthrough of our best deck, and how to get it.</p>



<p>Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a> expansion brought about a new, complete <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-card-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set of cards</a>. Alongside fiery new ex pulls and stunning Full Arts, one card arguably stands out above the rest—Celebi ex. Mew may be the cover star of Mythical Island, but Celebi ex has a certain quality, making it a necessity for the best grass decks.</p>



<p>I present to you our best Celebi ex meta deck, how to get the card, and how to get the most out of it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-celebi-ex-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to Get Celebi ex in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The heart of this deck. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Celebi ex can either be pulled from Mythical Island booster packs in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket, or crafted using Pack Points.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not a Premium Pass promo card like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-promo-10-mewtwo-card-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewtwo 10 card</a>, and there is no special challenge to get a Celebi ex. You need to get lucky with a Mythical Island booster pack and score one of the multiple ex designs, or save up 500 Pack Points—<strong>for Mythical Island, not Genetic Apex</strong>—and purchase it.</p>







<p>The best Celebi ex meta deck requires <strong>two each of Celebi ex</strong>, <strong>Snivy</strong>, <strong>Servine</strong>, <strong>Serperior</strong>, one <strong>Dhelmise</strong>, and one copy of <strong>Mystical Island’s</strong> <strong>Exeggcute</strong> and <strong>Exggecutor</strong>.</p>



<p>Grass decks are boss, but to get the top cards, they’re normally Two-Stage Evolutions—which isn’t ideal in a very RNG-orientated card game. So, for my best Celebi ex deck, I want a good mix of Basics and later evolutions.</p>



<p>Here’s my best Celebi ex Meta Deck I recommend using.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-celebi-ex-type-alternatives-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Celebi ex type alternatives in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The main alternative to Celebi ex has to be <strong>Venusaur ex</strong>—another hard-to-get card if luck isn’t on your side.</p>



<p>You can charge up a Venusaur ex fast using the deck’s Serperior emphasis. Players might prefer this as Venusaur trumps Celebi ex’s HP with a whopping <strong>190 HP</strong>. This makes the card extra tanky, and while its Giant Bloom attack <em>only </em>(in the context of a Stage 2 ex) does 100 damage, <strong>it recovers 30 HP with every attack</strong>—prolonging its life. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-celebi-ex-deck-so-powerful-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Why is Celebi ex Deck so Powerful in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>The star of the show is Celebi ex. The reason? <strong>Serperior’s Jungle Totem ability</strong> makes it so “Each Grass energy attached to your Pokémon&nbsp;provides 2 Grass Energy. This effect doesn’t stack.” This effectively makes it the <strong>grass equivalent of Garvedoir</strong>, only, you can’t have two Serperiors at once both using Jungle Totem—just the one.</p>



<p>Now, you can stack energy on Celebi ex, making its Powerful Bloom move deadly. Here’s a description of the attack, “<strong>Flip a coin for each Energy attached to this Pokémon. This attack does 50 damage for each heads.</strong>“</p>



<p>You need to focus on building up a Celebi ex, all the while trying to speed through Snivy’s evolution line until it becomes Serperior. Having two lots of each highlighted Pokémon gives us better chances of pulling them faster. To fill out the deck, Dhelmise has great HP for a Basic, and if you don’t have Celebi ex yet, its main attack can also be charged up to great effect.</p>



<p>Finally, I prefer the Mystical Island Exeggcute and Exggecutor for a couple of reasons. While I love Exeggcutor’s EX card from Genetic Apex, it was very luck-dependent, and <strong>its ex status risks a two-point loss</strong>. The Mythical Island Exeggutor has 130 HP as a non-ex (we love this) and its main attack is another that can be charged through Serperior.</p>
