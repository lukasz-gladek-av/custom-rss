<p>The Holiday season covers the months of November, December, and January. Most of the biggest game releases happen outside of this period, but there’s still plenty of the best games releasing in Holiday 2025.</p>



<p>As 2025 begins to wind down, players are peppered with massive games from August through to October. The season starts again around February and March. Sandwiched in this is the Holiday season, and 2025 still has the odd homerun to knock out of the park first.</p>



<p>Also, for even more holiday shopping guides, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a>&nbsp;for the best deals available.</p>

<h3 id="h-football-manager-26">Football Manager 26</h3>

<p>Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It’s incredible to think it’s been two years since the last FM game. But Sports Interactive finally dropped Football Manager 26, and while it’s <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-is-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-rated-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the worst games ever rated on Steam</a>, it’s selling like hotcakes!</p>







<p>It would make a nice present under the tree, and is sure to eat up any free time you have.</p>







<h3 id="h-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h3>

<p>The Dynasty Warrior-like combat and gameplay aesthetics are back in The Legend of Zelda, thanks to Age of Imprisonment. It carries on the spin-offs’ focus on large-scale combat over cave exploration and puzzles, but it makes for one of the most unique Zelda games of all time.</p>







<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More Call of Duty. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ranked-play-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is the next Call of Duty game, and it doesn’t matter how it reviews, it’s guaranteed to be under most Christmas trees for Holiday 2025. It doesn’t have to be the best game; it just has to be Call of Duty—which it is. Insider Gaming understands this, which is why you can get money off the heavy-hitter below.</p>







<h3 id="h-kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A nice surprise. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stand back, Mario Kart World, there’s a new racing game speeding onto the Nintendo Switch 2. Mario Kart World was the guaranteed winner for the Switch 2 in 2025, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/controversial-kirby-air-riders-bikini-skin-has-already-been-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a> whistled through and turned out to be a pleasant competitor. It brings back a fairly niche franchise into the mainstream again.</p>







<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Samus strikes again. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-new-unlisted-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> journey has been stressful, but potentially rewarding. Metroid Prime 4 was starting to slip into the void and become another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-evil-2-still-advertising-new-job-roles-after-17-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>. It finally reappeared, and now it’s set to grace Nintendo Switch 2 consoles for the Holiday 2025 season, and it’s one of the most anticipated games—one you should probably buy if you have the console!</p>







<h3 id="h-code-vein-nbsp-2">Code Vein&nbsp;2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More pain. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Code Vein was Bandai Namco’s solo attempt to crack the Souls genre market. It didn’t quite reach the levels of a FromSoftware game, but its enchanting art style and sales were enough to captivate Bandai into giving the franchise another chance. Code Vein 2 is one of 2026’s first big games.</p>

<p>The new update and patch notes for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Version 1.02, are out now for Nintendo Switch 2. With it, new quests, weapons, and fixes have been added.</p>







<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-announced-at-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the newest entry</a> in the Hyrule Warriors spinoffs for The Legend of Zelda. In it, fans get to see the original Guardians that took a stand against Ganon, which is shown in flashbacks in Tears of the Kingdom. The Musou hack-and-slash combat and colorful visuals are well worth it, especially on Nintendo Switch 2, but now, there’s a lot more to get excited about with Version 1.02.</p>



<p>For Version 1.02 of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, available now, there’s some new content to enjoy. The biggest of all are new battles and quests, which are unlocked after beating the main story. New stylish Sync-Strike Attacks between Zelda and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-new-trailer-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calamo</a> have been added, as well as the Longsword of Light for Rauru. Furthermore, some improvements to split-screen and UI have been addressed and fixed.</p>
