<p>PlayStation Plus’s free monthly games for this month have been revealed, and they arrive on November 4. </p>



<p>It is finally that time of the month when we get to see what the next set of free games is arriving for PlayStation Plus subscribers. We already knew BlueTwelve Studio and Annapurna Interactive’s Stray would be part of the collection through a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-november-headline-game-has-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent leak</a>. Now, the other 2 other games have been revealed as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-plus-essential-games-for-november-include-stray-ea-sports-wrc-24-and-tabs">PlayStation Plus Essential Games for November Include Stray, EA Sports WRC 24, and TABS</h2>



<p>As mentioned previously, Stray is the headline for PlayStation Plus in November 2025. Along with Stray, the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-stray-ea-sports-wrc-24-totally-accurate-battle-simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> reveals that EA Sports WRC 24 and TABS (Totally Accurate Battle Simulator) will be arriving on November 4, 2025. These games will be available to all PlayStation Plus subscribers, including Essential, Extra, and Premium/Deluxe members.</p>



<p><strong>Stray</strong></p>



<p>For those unaware, in Stray, players get to play as a cat in an ancient, decaying cybercity. You get to explore the murky environments and the seedy underbelly of this city as you unravel its mystery. At the same time, you get to be a cat, as you interact with different elements of the world in playful and fun ways. </p>



<p><strong>EA Sports WRC 24</strong></p>



<p>EA Sports WRC 24 is an award-winning offshoot of the Dirt Rally series, where players can drive WRC, WRC2, and Junior WRC cars from the 2024 season. This instalment also debuts the builder mode, which allows players to design and drive their dream rally car, and to rewrite history through recreations of recent events and significant historical highlights in Moments mode. Additionally, players can try out Championship, Time Trial, Cross-platform Multiplayer, Regularity Rally, and a detailed livery editor. </p>



<p><strong>TABS Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</strong></p>



<p>Last but not least is a physics-based battle simulator where players get to be the leaders of red and blue wobbles from ancient lands, spooky places, and fantasy worlds. There are over 100+ types of wobblers to try out, and if players get bored with them, they can always design new ones in the unit creators. There’s also an online multiplayer mode to test your mettle against friends and strangers. </p>

<p>We are finally returning to the streets, as NBA The Run, an upcoming 3v3 online title from Play by Play Studios, is scheduled to release in 2026. </p>



<p>NBA 2K26 has been released and has already become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game in the United States for 2025</a>. However, even after that game, players have been craving a classic NBA Streets experience, and now, Play by Play Studios has arrived to fill that void. Learn more about the fast-paced, online 3v3 street basketball game, NBA The Run, below. </p>



<h2 id="h-nba-the-run-will-have-players-playing-against-nba-stars-and-all-new-street-legends">NBA The Run Will Have Players Playing Against NBA Stars and All-New Street Legends</h2>



<p>In NBA The Run, players will explore a collection of legendary outdoor courts to indulge in some 3v3 basketball action. You will get to play against a roster of NBA legends along with a set of Street Legends, which are “fictional players with big personalities, wild skills and stories to tell.”</p>



<p>The developer’s goal is to make all aspects of the game enjoyable, which is why Defense has been designed to be as fun as Offense. Defence will need skills like anticipation, timing, and impact, while players use moves such as massive blocks, lightning steals, shoves, dives, and more. Offense is going to help players make their highlight reels with all kinds of flashy moves, including Double alley-oops, posterizing dunks, off-the-backboard passes, step-back threes, and ankle-breaking combos.</p>

<h2 id="h-nba-the-run-will-feature-rollback-netcode-low-latency-cross-platform-play-and-knockout-tournaments">NBA The Run Will Feature Rollback Netcode, Low-Latency, Cross-Platform Play, and Knockout Tournaments</h2>



<p>To make the experience “fast, fluid, and connected,” the game features low-latency, cross-platform gameplay that is always in sync. Knockout Tournaments will be the major competitions in NBA The Run, where players can enter bracket-style events solo (controlling your whole team) or in squads (one player per teammate). The tournaments will include new Randomized Rules — from Dunkfest to Speed Round and will last 2-5 minutes. </p>
