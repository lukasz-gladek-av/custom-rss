<p>Overwatch has kick-started a new era for the hero-shooter by dropping the “2” and launching a new year-long Reign of Talon story arc. Gone are the days of Season-long narratives, as Blizzard has grander plans for the plot of Overwatch.</p>



<p>From now on, every year will be split into six Seasons, as a year-long narrative unfolds. This starts with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-season-1-2026-release-date-countdown-exact-start-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-season-1-2026-release-date-countdown-exact-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 (2026) of Overwatch</a>, and a new story arc will begin with Season 1 in 2027.</p>







<p>The Reign of Talon is the first story, so it’s time to unpack what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-x-fortnite-collaboration-dropping-in-months-its-claimed/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-x-fortnite-collaboration-dropping-in-months-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch</a> has planned for the year 2026.</p>

<p>Season 1 of Overwatch is when the Reign of Talon story arc begins, and Blizzard is kicking it off with a bang. A wealth of new content is arriving in Overwatch, including the likes of five new Heroes launching all at once! The full list of content for Season 1 includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 New Heroes</li>



<li>Conquest Event</li>



<li>Hero Sub-Passives Feature</li>



<li>New Stadium Hero: Vendetta</li>



<li>New Stadium Feature: Hero Builder</li>



<li>New Mythics</li>



<li>Overwatch X Hello Kitty And Friends Collab</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-season-2-2026-roadmap-content-explained">Overwatch Season 2 2026 Roadmap Content, Explained</h2>



<p>Details regarding the following Seasons of Overwatch get thinner and thinner the further 2026 progresses, but Season 2 still has a fair bit of information. The number of new Heroes drops to one per Season, but there’s an Anniversary event that could be exciting.</p>







<p>Judging by the Roadmap, Season 2 can be expected to begin in the middle of Spring 2026. Here’s all of the confirmed content so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Hero</li>



<li>Overwatch 10 Year Anniversary</li>



<li>Post Match Accolades</li>



<li>New Stadium Hero: Ramattra</li>



<li>New Mythics</li>



<li>OWCS Champions Clash</li>



<li>+ More</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-season-3-2026-roadmap-content-explained">Overwatch Season 3 2026 Roadmap Content, Explained</h2>



<p>Season 3’s highlight is easily the confirmation of a new map, though another Hero is also to be expected. The Roadmap suggests that Season 3 should begin at the start of Summer, 2026, and here’s what content should be released:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Hero</li>



<li>New Map: Japan Night</li>



<li>OWCS at eSports World Cup</li>



<li>New Mythics</li>



<li>+ More</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-season-4-2026-roadmap-content-explained">Overwatch Season 4 2026 Roadmap Content, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s going to be a busy year. Image by Blizzard.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Information pertaining to Season 4 of Overwatch is much drier than the others, but it can be expected to launch in the middle of Summer, 2026. Here’s what’s been confirmed so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Hero</li>



<li>Blizzcon</li>



<li>Overwatch World Cup</li>



<li>+ Much More</li>
</ul>



<p>That wraps up the announced content for Overwatch in 2026, but there are still two more Seasons that remain unaccounted for. They’ll likely release in Fall 2026 and Winter 2026, leading directly into the new story arc in 2027.</p>

<p>Overwatch has dropped the “2” as the live-service hero-shooter kickstarts a new era for the franchise. Season 1 is where it all begins, and it’s just around the corner. </p>



<p>It’s one of the biggest updates <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-x-fortnite-collaboration-dropping-in-months-its-claimed/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-x-fortnite-collaboration-dropping-in-months-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch</a> has ever seen, with five new Heroes launching at once, as well as a host of other gameplay changes. Being an Overwatch fan hasn’t been this exciting in a very long time, and thankfully, you won’t have to wait too long to jump in.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has the Overwatch Season 1 (2026) release date and exact times listed below.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-overwatch-season-1-2026-release-date">What Is The Overwatch Season 1 (2026) Release Date?</h2>

<p><strong>Overwatch Season 1 (2026) will begin on February 5, 2026, though the date could change depending on where you live in the world.</strong></p>



<p>Blizzard is using a global release structure for Overwatch Season 1, meaning all players from across the world can jump into the new Season at the same time. However, for some of you out there, that might mean waiting until February 11.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-season-1-2026-start-times">Overwatch Season 1 (2026) Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Season 1 of Overwatch kicks off at 11 AM PT on February 10, with simultaneous launch times across various time zones. </strong></p>







<p>All of the start times for Overwatch Season 1 across major regions are shown in the table below. If you’re not covered by one of these regions, be sure to adjust for your time zone.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-trophy-list-achievements/</link>
            <guid>1426381</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Like previous games in the series, you need to <em>earn </em>the Nioh 3 Platinum Trophy and get all the Achievements—it’s not just handed out. The lengthy list is a sumptuous slog, and you’ll need a lot of patience and precision to clear it up.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/nioh-3/" id="170917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a> is another in the long line of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-upcoming-soulslike-games-2026/" id="172993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslikes</a>, which means it’s very hard. One false move is death in this game, and it’s the most compelling, cathartic, and crushing experience imaginable—but fun (mostly). If you’re not content with just completing Nioh 3, and you seek a further challenge, you should track down and obtain every Nioh 3 trophy and achievement.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-nioh-3-trophies-amp-achievements-and-how-to-get">All Nioh 3 Trophies &amp; Achievements And How To Get</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get ready for a fight. Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-nioh-3">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements In Nioh 3?</h2>



<p><strong>You need to earn 51 Nioh 3 PlayStation Trophies if you want the Platinum Trophy.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a nice distribution of Bronze, Silver, and Gold trophies, with plenty of Gamerscore to obtain. PlayStation users have the usual ‘one more trophy’ to earn, thanks to the PlayStation Platinum.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-any-missable-trophies-in-nioh-3">Are There Any Missable Trophies In Nioh 3?</h2>



<p><strong>Thanks to Insider Gaming’s playthrough of Nioh 3, getting the Platinum Trophy along the way, we can confirm there are no missable trophies, meaning you can get everything in one playthrough without worry.</strong></p>



<p>Missable trophies and achievements are the bane of a hunter’s existence. Thankfully, we didn’t find any to be missable, so it can be one in one playthrough, if you have the time and skill!</p>



<h2 id="h-nioh-3-platinum-difficulty-rating">Nioh 3 Platinum Difficulty Rating</h2>



<p><strong>For experienced Nioh players and Souls fans, the Platinum Difficulty Rating is a solid 7/10, but for newcomers and those of you who struggle more with Soulslikes, it has to go up to an 8 or a 9/10.</strong></p>



<p>It’s an unforgiving game with a higher skill gap. Yes, you can level up and find better equipment, but it still might not be enough at times, and you might lose hours to the same boss. But it’s all doable, and the Platinum Trophy requires a completionist playthrough.</p>



<p>Good luck!</p>



<p>Let IG know how you get on with the game. If you get all the trophies and achievements, please share your achievement (see what we did there?) via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<p>Nioh 3’s move to an open-world structure means you’ll go globe-trotting and even time-traveling across different maps. The Warring States is a nice introductory setting, and it’s rife with collectibles and secrets.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/nioh-3/" id="170917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a> Trophy List requires a lot of work, as does a completionist run of the game. Nioh 3 has missions, bosses, Kodama, Shrines, Hot Springs, Enemy Bases, and even more for you to find. The Warring States is a big location, and our two-fold map highlights every landmark and activity.</p>







<h2 id="h-full-warring-states-map-in-nioh-3-northern-region">Full Warring States Map In Nioh 3—Northern Region</h2>



<figure><figcaption>North. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, the Warring States region is so big that it’s almost impossible to get everything in one image. This is why we’ve split the map into a North and South divide, and you can see the Nioh 3’s Warring States content from the top half.</strong></p>



<p>There is something almost everywhere, and if you study the image long enough in your hunt to complete everything, you should be able to identify any missing spots on your own map.</p>

</ul>



<p>If you reach Exploration Level 4 in a sub-region, it automatically reveals the remaining collectibles. Bear this in mind if you’re still struggling to find anything!</p>







<h2 id="h-full-warring-states-map-in-nioh-3-southern-region">Full Warring States Map In Nioh 3—Southern Region</h2>



<figure><figcaption>South. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming promised you the second half of the Warring States map and all of its remaining collectibles, and here it is, and here they are.</p>



<p>Chances are you’ve already uncovered and explored a lot of it first, as it’s primarily where you start Nioh 3. It’s easy to miss the odd path or easy secret because of a lack of the requirement for Spirit Veins and warding off ominous enemy threats.</p>

</ul>



<p>Worst case, wait until you’re a higher level, and come back to the Warring States later on, as enemy levels stay locked and don’t scale naturally.</p>



<p>Let IG know if you have any issues tracking down Warring States’ collectibles using this map. The region is one of the game’s several large locations, so let the team know if you need more help with maps or Nioh 3 in general. There’s one excellent way to do so: Using the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<p>Nioh 3 lets you effortlessly dual-wield Samurai and Ninja builds, and the Souls title has a huge arsenal of weapons. Some are objectively better than others, which is why this guide will help guide you.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of room to experiment with how to eliminate Yokai. You can opt for Low Stance barrages with lighter, faster weapons, or you might enjoy the thrill of doing massive damage with big Axes, for example. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/nioh-3/" id="170917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a>‘s weapon pool is healthy, but only a handful are top of the food chain.</p>

<p><strong>The two best Samurai weapons you should focus on using in Nioh 3 are the Axe and Spear.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-axe">Axe</h3>



<p>If you obtain an Axe, any other weapon rarely overpowers it from an Attack standpoint. It’s literally a giant Axe designed to carve and crucify opponents. You don’t even want to think about wasting Low Stance on it either; committing to an Axe build means staying in the middle ground, or ideally, unlocking and prioritizing High Stance to deal the most damage.</p>

</ul>



<p>Not only is its default Attack power unmatched, but huge Axe attacks can break enemy guards and destroy stamina. The <strong>Lumber Chop Swift</strong> is a charging attack you can unlock. It consumes a hefty amount of Ki, but it can one-shot many mobs and deal huge damage to bosses.</p>



<h3 id="h-spear">Spear</h3>



<p>Easily the greatest strength of Spears is their reach. If you’re not keen on parries and getting too close to enemies, you can poke and prod from a distance with the Spear. Big charging attacks are the perfect recipe to dip in, do a chunk of damage, and quickly duck out again. </p>



<p>Its versatility and slightly better mobility mean it’s also easier to reel off a mini-flurry of strikes—once again keeping a nice distance between you and your enemy, thanks to the extra frames. <strong>Twirl II</strong> is a great skill that increases your Attack and potency during a fight.</p>

<p><strong>The Tonfa and Talons are comfortably the best options for the nimbleness of a Ninja in Nioh 3.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-talons">Talons</h3>



<p>You could argue that the Talons and Tonfa are fairly interchangeable, but one of the biggest qualities of Talons is strong combos, which can absolutely decimate enemy Ki. This leaves them open to generous windows where you can inflict damage and make use of regular Grapple attacks to chop that HP bar down.</p>

</ul>



<p>Many skills are effective for the Talon, but the <strong>Beyond Infinity</strong> unlock is the clear winner. If your timing is on point, you can link multiple attacks together, each as devastating as the last.</p>



<h3 id="h-tonfa">Tonfa</h3>



<p>Again, the Tonfa is another dual-weapon capable of inflicting great HP and Ki damage. They scale with Strength, so if that’s a crucial stat for you to level up, a good Tonfa might be the ideal choice for you.</p>



<p><strong>Dragon Slayer II</strong> is a hot pick for skills. You’re one good parry/deflect away from rebuttling with a big counterattacking move, increasing your Attack, and beginning another combo of strikes.</p>



<p>It’s all subjective at the end of the day. What works for IG might not work for you, and vice versa. So, this is where you’re encouraged to share your favorite weapons to use in Nioh 3 and what you think dominates the game easier.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report has claimed that long-awaited PlayStation 5 version of Starfield will be releasing in April 2026.</p>



<p>That’s according to a new report from <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/398522/potwierdzamy-starfield-na-ps5-premiera-za-rowne-dwa-miesiace.html" type="link" id="https://www.ppe.pl/news/398522/potwierdzamy-starfield-na-ps5-premiera-za-rowne-dwa-miesiace.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PPE</a>, which obtained internal documentation from a video game distributor revealing that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield is scheduled to launch on the PlayStation 5</a> on April 7, 2026.</p>



<p>While not confirmed in the report, it’s likely that the PlayStation 5 release will be a part of the long-awaited ‘Starfield 2.0’ update, which was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown to the press a few months ago</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that PPE has had a good track record of leaking information related to physical game releases, however yesterday’s Take-Two Interactive call debunked their claims that GTA 6 would avoid physical game releases on launch.</p>



<p>That being said, PPE did provide a screenshot of what appears to be an internal system, showing that Starfield is going to release on April 7.</p>



<p>It isn’t quite clear what the update will bring, but according to rumours, Starfield’s massive update is set to deliver a major overhaul to the game, in addition to its second major expansion, ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear whether the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured Switch 2 version</a> of the game will also release at the same time. <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/02/04/exclusive-microsoft-plans-starfield-launch-for-playstation-5/" type="link" id="https://xboxera.com/2024/02/04/exclusive-microsoft-plans-starfield-launch-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a> was the first to report on a planned Starfield version for the PlayStation 5 in February 2024.</p>
