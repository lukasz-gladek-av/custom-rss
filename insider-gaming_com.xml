<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s modding community has already created a mod for Goku’s new Super Saiyan 4 transformation from the Daima series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spoilers ahead for the players that haven’t caught up with the new Daima series yet, but Goku reached his iconic Super Saiyan 4 transformation again during the latest episode,’ Awakening’, and the form is canon this time. The new Goku SSJ4 Daima transformation draws a lot of inspiration from its GT counterpart, but it is also different in some ways, such as the colours and Goku still being short. The modders have perfectly captured Goku SSJ4 Daima’s essence in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ubisoft has a big launch on the new through Rainbow Six Siege X—a successor to 2015’s Siege. More original Siege content is on the way, but it looks like Rainbow Six Siege X is replacing its predecessor, and offering big upgrades.</p>



<p>Fun Fact: I got Rainbow Six Siege shortly after release and ended up selling it a few months later because <em>I couldn’t stop playing it</em>. Siege greatly disrupted my single-player gaming, and I decided to end the relationship. I fondly look back on those early days, and 10 years later, the game is as celebrated as ever. It’s a huge esports hit, the gameplay is still strategic and intricate, and tens of thousands of players still hop on each day.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege 2 rumor</a> gained huge traction in January 2025. The leak came to fruition with the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege X</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-rainbow-six-siege-x-release-date">Do we Know The Rainbow Six Siege X Release Date?</h2>

<p><strong>There is no release date locked in for Rainbow Six Siege X, nor a vague release period.</strong></p>



<p>Common sense suggests Siege X will likely be released following the conclusion of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-y10s1-reveal-prep-phase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege Y10</a>. This isn’t factual though, so be sure to check back as we update you.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date">When is The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase Date?</h2>



<p><strong>The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase is penciled in for March 13 at 10 AM PT / 6 PM CT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT.</strong></p>



<p>A <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/4IUTIzwOdeRG4l3ms7h1Dz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft article</a> confirmed Siege’s X Showcase date. “A new era of&nbsp;Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;will be revealed on <strong>March 13</strong> at the Siege X Showcase,” it said. The Showcase will show us every aspect of Siege X and its new changes compared to the original.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase">How to Watch Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase</h2>



<p><strong>Ubisoft has confirmed you can check out the full Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase by watching the action unfold on the Ubisoft Twitch Channel.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft Rainbow6 Twitch Channel</a> is the home of all things Rainbow Six Siege. So it makes sense for Siege X to be unveiled here. It remains to be seen if any YouTube channels also broadcast the Showcase.</p>



<p>Keep your eyes peeled for alternative sources—as will we.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x">What is Rainbow Six Siege X?</h2>



<p><strong>Rainbow Six Siege X is described as a “major evolution” of Siege, but it isn’t considered a sequel or normal update.</strong></p>



<p>Ubisoft game director Joshua Mills revealed Siege X aims to keep <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege around for the next 10 years</a>. He raised expectations for Siege X at the Rainbow Six Invitational: “It is not Siege 2, and it’s not just another update. It’s a major evolution. We’re expanding and reinforcing the very foundation of Siege to ensure it remains the pinnacle of tactical PvP first-person shooters.”</p>



<p>“Graphical and audio upgrades, deepened tactical gameplay, and new ways to play the game,” are also at the forefront of Siege X’s marketing ahead of the Showcase.</p>



<p>Check out its first teaser trailer below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I imagine Siege X is following in the footsteps of Overwatch 2 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-hits-all-time-player-peak-on-steam-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS2</a> by being a massively upgraded free-to-play enhancement of the original. If so, we can start dreaming of the new content, gameplay mechanics, and much more Ubisoft has in store.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s no secret Ubisoft needs a big win in the next year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> might not be enough, but Siege continues to do the business. Does the prospect of X get you amped up? Which new features and twists does Siege X need to separate itself from the OG Siege?</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to jump into Rainbow Six Siege now if you haven’t already. Let’s answer some common questions about Siege: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-rainbow-six-siege-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Does it have crossplay?</a> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is cross-progression enabled?</a> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-a-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">And is there a Rainbow Six Siege Campaign?</a></p>
