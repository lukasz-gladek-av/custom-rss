<p>Battlefield 6 players will be able to access two new game modes and a new map during the upcoming open beta weekend. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s open beta was the biggest beta test yet for the franchise, bringing in over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam alone. However, it did come with some minor issues that developers are figuring out, including “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-are-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-time-to-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpectedly fast</a>” time to death. Developers will try to iron out any problems they can before the next BF6 Open Beta weekend arrives, featuring a new map and modes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t deny FBC: Firebreak is ambitious, even if it is a game no one was necessarily clamoring for. The latter part of this is now evident, as Remedy has given deeper insight into FBC: Firebreak’s underwhelming launch and plans for the IP.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-fbc-firebreak-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> was Remedy’s first new release since the Game of the Year-contending <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-over-2-million-copies-and-is-finally-profitable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>. Firebreak is set in Control’s (another Remedy IP) world and is a team-based FPS. This is quite a bold shift from the company’s other games. We’ve seen from gameplay and matches that the game has potential, but its launch has failed to land.</p>



<h2 id="h-fbc-firebreak-receiving-major-update-in-september">FBC: Firebreak Receiving Major Update in September</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Firebreak hasn’t caught yet. Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s quite damning to hear that the FBC: Firebreak “launch underperformed.” This is the official word from Remedy’s Jan-Jun 2025 financial <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>.</p>



<p>“On Steam, which was planned as the primary consumer sales channel on PC, the launch underperformed. The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews.”</p>



<p>The company was happy that “The launch succeeded technically, reaching over 1 million players in its first 10 days,” but goes on to say: “Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak.”</p>



<p>The majority of the shooter’s revenue has come from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-xbox-game-pass-playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus</a>-subscribing users. Firebreak was free on both services at launch.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the adversity, Remedy believes FBC: Firebreak is a “solid game” the team can build on: “Looking ahead, a larger ‘Major Update’ late September will be the next key step for&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak. This will be supported by targeted marketing activities, which we expect to drive interest in the title. We are committed to continuing to work on&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game.”</p>



<p>Do you think Firebreak can bounce back? With so many live-service games out there, it’s tough to stand out. Let me know if you think it can by heading to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Remedy has been distracted by other games in recent years. But Control 2 is one of the company’s biggest upcoming projects, and not only have we learned new details about the game’s progress, but the company has announced a huge milestone for the franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-ultimate-editions-new-update-introduces-hideo-kojima-mission-for-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control</a> felt interesting until the game’s final moments: The puzzles, the paranormal activity in the environment, and your powers. It felt like something was <em>always </em>happening. It could see-saw from horror to hot action in a heartbeat. The demand for a second game has been strong for a while, and it appears the sequel is getting closer.</p>

<p>The 2025 Remedy Half-year financial report told us several things: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar and Remedy are working together on the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake</a>, the Control franchise has surpassed 5 million lifetime copies sold and counting, and Control 2 is coming along nicely.</p>



<p>Here’s the official <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">word</a> on Control 2’s development: “Control 2&nbsp;development is on track towards meeting its next milestones. The focus is now on the gameplay, environments, and missions. Work continues on developing the game into a strong commercial offering.”</p>



<p>The next milestones could be an official reveal trailer or even a gameplay reveal right out of the gate. I think it’s safe to assume from this that we’re still quite some way off from Control 2 hitting shelves and digital storefronts, though.</p>



<p>One thing’s for sure: Remedy has a lot on its plate with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreaks-new-patch-introduces-faster-progression-and-economy-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, the Max Payne Remake, and Control 2.</p>



<p>What did you love most about the first Control? For me, it was all of it, to be honest. I want to hear what you think, and you can get a conversation underway courtesy of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake.1267815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake is still moving along nicely, according to Remedy in its 2025 half-year financial report. It’s also been revealed that Rockstar Games and Remedy Entertainment are teaming up for the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake.</p>



<p>Remedy’s work on the original Max Payne games was exceptional. Both games sold well and became iconic for their revolutionary bullet-time feature (popularized by The Matrix) and their unique presentation and style. Remedy handed over the franchise to Take-Two, leading to Rockstar Games handling Max Payne 3—another success.</p>



<p>We learned early details about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-gives-update-on-control-2-and-max-payne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake in 2023</a>, and the game went into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-2-is-now-playable-as-max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full production in 2024</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-max-payne-1-amp-2-remake-remains-in-full-production">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake “Remains in Full Production”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could it lead to a Max Payne 4? Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remedy’s “Half year financial report January–June 2025” covered many aspects of Remedy, including upcoming projects. There was a new update on the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake, revealing a cool detail.</p>



<p>“The&nbsp;Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake&nbsp;project continues its progress and remains in full production. In the second quarter, the team built on steady momentum from earlier in the year. Collaboration with Rockstar Games remains close and productive, ensuring alignment as the project advances toward its next major phase,” the statement <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>



<p>This means both of Max Payne’s key developers are working together on the project. It’s unclear if this is a 50/50 split of the workload or how much input either team is contributing.</p>



<p>Regardless, long-term Max Payne fans should rest easy knowing Remedy and Rockstar Games are on the case. Can the two companies synergize perfectly to recapture the Max Payne magic? Or do you think there could be some crossed wires? Share your thoughts through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s forum</a>.</p>
