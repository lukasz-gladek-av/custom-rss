<p>The Splinter Cell movie that was slated to star Tom Hardy has been cancelled, according to one of the film’s producers.</p>



<p>Twelve years after it was first reported as in development, producer Basil Iwanyk was asked about the state of the movie. In his response to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, Iwanyk confirmed that the movie wasn’t happening due to not being able to “get it right”.</p>



<p>“That movie would have been awesome… Just couldn’t get it right, script-wise, budget-wise,” Iwanyk said. “But it was going to be great. We had a million different versions of it, but it was going to be hardcore and awesome. </p>



<p>“That’s one of the ones that got away, which is really sad.”</p>



<p>The news of the movie’s demise shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Since being announced over a decade ago, there had been nary an update on it’s status. It’s likely that most fans that heard about it complete forgot by now.</p>



<p>If the cancellation of the Splinter Cell movie has you upset, however, don’t be too upset. Ubisoft is continuing work on its remake of the first Splinter Cell, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently targeting for a 2026 release date</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Splinter Cell movie being cancelled? Let us know below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment, known for fantastical RPGs like The Outer Worlds and Pillars of Eternity, returns in 2025 with a first-person RPG that many believe may rival The Elder Scrolls. That may feel a little generous, but if you’ve ever played Pillars of Eternity, then you know the team is adept at world-building and lore, making for a truly unique and captivating role-playing game experience. But for now, we must wait and prepare. To that end, here’s your first look at the Avowed system requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-these-are-the-avowed-pc-system-requirements">These Are the Avowed PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>We’re still months from the release of Avowed, but Obsidian Entertainment finally unveiled the game’s system requirements ahead of time. Overall, they’re relatively approachable, especially on the low end, but man, storage space requirements have quickly ballooned in size in recent years. You’ll soon need an entire SSD for a single game, just you wait and see!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements-nbsp">Minimum System Requirements&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 with updates</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 / Intel i5-8400</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD RX 5700 / Nvidia GTX 1070 / Intel Arc A580</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 75 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements-nbsp">Recommended System Requirements&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 with updates</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X / Intel i7-10700K</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Graphics: AMD RX 6800 XT / Nvidia RTX 3080</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-to-play-while-we-wait-for-avowed">What to Play While We Wait for Avowed</h2>



<p>Seeing as Avowed doesn’t release until February 18, we still have a few months until we can dive into the fantasy world. That’s plenty of time to beat another large-scale RPG or two in the meantime. To help you prepare, we recommend the following RPGs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong></li>



<li><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Outer Worlds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pillars of Eternity</strong></li>



<li><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon’s Dogma 2</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The Outer Worlds doesn’t take too long to complete, but you can easily spend hundreds of hours exploring every nook and cranny in all of the other recommendations!</p>



<p>What other titles would you recommend while we wait for Avowed? Let us know in the comments below, or start a thread about the upcoming RPG in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Grove Street Games’ lead has addressed the removal of their name from the credits of the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition. Fans pointed out that it was only partially removed.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/boss-of-developer-behind-gta-trilogys-original-poorly-received-launch-laments-being-removed-from-games-credits-even-though-he-wasnt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Thomas Williamson, the head of Grove Street Games, recently <a href="https://x.com/TSWilliamson/status/1857124999045222581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">addressed</a> the removal of his company from the credits of the GTA Trilogy following the latest update. You can find his complete statement below.:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Speaking entire hypothetically: It’s a dick move to remove primary developers from credits in an update, especially when an update includes hundreds of fixes that were provided by those developers that stayed out of players’ hands for years.”</p>

<p>Phil Spencer recently discussed the reasons for not releasing a mid-gen refresh console for Xbox Series X/S like the PS5 Pro, stating it’s “harder to show the benefits” for such consoles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>, Phil Spencer was asked why Xbox wasn’t working on a mid-gen refresh like the PS5 Pro. In response, Spencer stated that Xbox thinks “about hardware that can create unique value” for the players or creators on its platform. The company doesn’t need to work on “incremental hardware” for its benefit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil Spencer asked whether a new mid-gen device provides players with “a unique experience on screen in some way”. He stated that “it’s less like the old days” when going from the original Xbox to 360 meant moving from “standard definition to high definition”.” He concluded by stating, “Now, it’s harder to show the benefits” for mid-gen consoles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, Spencer also confirmed that Xbox would “definitely do more consoles in the future, and other devices”. Spencer means the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld-confirmed-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Handheld</a> by “other devices”, which was confirmed during another interview a few days ago. However, this console will not arrive for a few years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Phil Spencer has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-wasnt-due-to-game-quality-phil-spencer-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed wasn’t delayed due to game quality</a>.
