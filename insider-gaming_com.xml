<p>For years, the Halo Insider Program has enabled loyal fans to hear about the latest Halo playtests. It’s been discovered that PlayStation owners on PS4 and PS5 will be able to take part in future test sessions.</p>



<p>The Halo news keeps coming thick and fast—especially if you’re on PlayStation! First, the bombshell announcement that we knew was coming—but still hit hard all the same—was that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Remake is coming to PlayStation 5</a>. It’s the latest ground to be broken between Xbox and PlayStation. We’ve now seen for ourselves that PS4 and PS5 gamers can even test Halo before new games launch.</p>

<figure><figcaption>This gives us new energy. Credit to 343</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s likely many of you have been part of the Halo Insider Program for a while. One of the biggest perks is the ability to “Participate in public ‘flights’ (hands-on playtests) of in-progress Halo game releases and provide feedback to our development teams.”</p>



<p>Ordinarily, this benefit has been reserved for Xbox and PC owners. This is no longer the case as the Halo Insider Console Flighting settings on your personal account now have new options.</p>



<p>We’ve tested this out ourselves, logged in, and can confirm you’ll now see some new PlayStation options for Halo Insider:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PlayStation 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 4 Pro</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Even last-gen users won’t miss out! Check out <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">grunt.api</a>‘s post to see it for yourself.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Alongside <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, rumors are swirling that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-live-service-rumor-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a live-service Halo game is possibly in the works</a>. There could be even more stuff happening behind the scenes that we’re not aware of yet. All this means is there’s a good chance new Halo content is on the way that needs testing, and PlayStation gamers will get to help.</p>



<p>Is this the best time to be a PlayStation fan? Will you pick up Halo: Combat Evolved remake or test out new Halo titles on PS4 or PS5? Let us know, and share your thoughts on how bizarre this all is via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sharkmob has announced the imminent end of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt, a free battle royale title with a vampiric twist. The game launched in 2021 but was sunsetted in a way in 2023 when the team announced it would no longer be providing updates to the game.</p>



<p>Now, the squad at Sharkmob is preparing for a complete shutdown, taking the servers offline and jamming a stake into the heart of Bloodhunt for good on April 28, 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-bloodhunt-laid-to-rest">Bloodhunt, Laid to Rest</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent release</a>, the team at Sharkmob revealed the incoming shutdown of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>. Your feedback, creativity, and enthusiasm for our game has meant the world to us. However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable.</p>



<p>This has led us to make the difficult decision to take&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>&nbsp;offline.</p>



<p>The sun is now going to rise over Prague. We will be taking down the&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>&nbsp;servers on April 28, 2026, after which the game will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The release mentioned that the game will remain <strong>fully playable </strong>until that date, but when it comes around, the game will no longer be available to download or play. To prepare for the shutdown, Sharkmob has delisted tokens, but the in-game store will remain open if you want to spend any residual credits you might have.</p>



<p>In the closing words of the release, Sharkmob wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for being with us on this journey. We hope your memories from the rooftops and back alleys of Prague will stay with you as they have with us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2022, Bloodhunt launched on Steam, moving out of early access and pulling in quite a few players for a niche, indie battle royale game. It peaked at 29,475 players on Valve’s flagship platform, but checking the numbers now, just 603 concurrent users were logged on in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>Bloodhunt hasn’t broken 1,000 concurrent players on Steam since October 2024.</p>

<p>Fortnite’s regular slew of updates continues, and fresh off the back of another Fortnitemares event, the final part of Chapter 6 will begin after a special live event to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>



<p>Following on from the Star Wars-themed mini-season earlier this year, The Simpsons will drop with a special Springfield map to explore, including various POIs, alongside a new Battle Pass, weapons, and more content.</p>



<p>A special live event is planned in Fortnite to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season, and we’ve got all the details on what time you need to be in the game to catch it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-fortnite-live-event">When is The Fortnite Live Event?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It was all yellow. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Epic Games has confirmed the live event for Fortnite ahead of The Simpsons mini-season will take place on Saturday, November 1.</strong></p>



<p>The long-awaited, and heavily rumoured, Simpsons-themed season will bring down the curtain on Chapter 6, with one month of themed content before the jump into Chapter 7 in December.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1982818597702713829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games’ tweet</a> confirming the live event announced that the alien duo Kang and Kodos will have a “special announcement” for players to watch in-game, which will likely be followed by a period of downtime before The Simpsons mini-season kicks off properly.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-is-the-fortnite-live-event">What Time is The Fortnite Live Event?</h2>



<p><strong>The live event ahead of The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite will begin at 11 AM ET, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>Expect the servers to be extremely busy, as they always are for the live events, and enter the game in advance of that time to secure your spot. At this stage, it’s unclear whether PvP will be turned off for the duration of the event to allow players to tune into the action without the threat of elimination.</p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve highlighted the start time of the Fortnite live event in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Fortnite Live Event Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 2</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>A new report says a new Xbox Partner Preview is scheduled for November and will focus heavily on Xbox Play Anywhere games. </p>



<p>Xbox has been in the news recently due to fresh details about its next-gen consoles. The president has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-confirms-series-x-s-successors-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the successors to the Series X/S consoles are in development, and a new report also says that games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-insomniacs-spider-man-will-be-playable-on-next-xbox-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War and Insomniac’s Spider-Man will be playable</a> on them.

Moreover, third-party titles from Microsoft’s publishing partners are going to be a focus of this event, and “will feature almost entirely (if not actually entirely)&nbsp;Xbox Play Anywhere&nbsp;titles.” </p>



<p>The report also mentions other upcoming events where Xbox will have a presence. The first event is this month itself, with IGN hosting the ID@Xbox showcase on October 28, 2025. This event will also focus on Xbox Play Anywhere and should feature announcements for Game Pass, Cloud Gaming, PC, and console players. </p>



<p>Moreover, Xbox is expected to have some kind of presence at The Game Awards, scheduled for December 11, 2025. However, it is not known what Microsoft will feature at the event.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-season-2-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has sucked in trainers from across the world, and Season 2 of Ranked is now right around the corner with a fresh batch of rewards to claim.</p>



<p>The first Pokémon release on Nintendo Switch 2, albeit still available on the original console, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-week-sales-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached some impressive sales milestones</a>, and the four-player PvP offerings have sucked plenty in for the grind.</p>



<p>If you’re ready to dive back into Ranked in pursuit of the next batch of rewards in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Earn the right. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 2 of Ranked in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A begins on November 4, immediately following the conclusion of Season 1 Ranked.</strong></p>



<p>It may seem like it has come around swiftly, with it only being a few weeks since the release of Legends: Z-A, but it appears, at least initially, that Ranked seasons in the title will transition rather quickly.</p>



<p>Based on the information we have from Season 1, each season in Ranked will last for around four weeks. However, this may be extended later in the game’s lifespan, depending on what else Game Freak have cooking.</p>







<p><strong>Although not officially announced, we expect Season 2 of Ranked in <strong>Pokémon</strong></strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A to begin at 6 AM UTC on November 4—the same time that Season 1 began.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows a breakdown of when you can expect Season 2 of Ranked in Legends: Z-A to begin in your time zone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Season 2 Ranked Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Nov. 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 4</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>The biggest reward available in Legends: Z-A’s Season 2 of Ranked is Delphoxite, which is required to unlock Mega Delphox in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Just like Greninjite in Season 1, Delphoxite is exclusively available in Ranked play during Season 2, meaning you’ll have to delve into online play against players around the world to unlock the reward.</p>



<p>It’s yet to be confirmed, but we expect the requirements to be the same as earning Greninjite in Season 1, meaning you’ll have to reach at least Rank K to obtain the item.</p>



<p>Other rewards include Rare Candies, EXP. Candies, and items will also be distributed as rewards for reaching the various levels of ranked, but full details will be shared upon release.</p>
