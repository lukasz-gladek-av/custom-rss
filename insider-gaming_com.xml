<p>Hello everyone, and welcome to Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast. Each and every Friday, myself (Mike Straw) along with my co-senior editor Grant Taylor-Hill and senior producer Albert Perkins as we discuss the latest in video game news, events, rumors and more.</p>



<p>From friendly debates to challenges for the audience, you don’t want to miss a single thing from Insider Gaming Weekly. Even Insider Gaming Co-Founder Tom Henderson will stop by from time to time to talk the latest in gaming rumors that players need to know about.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-debut-episode">The Debut Episode</h2>



<p>It’s the debut edition of Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast. Mike Straw, Grant Taylor-Hill, and Albert Perkins talk the Xbox Developer Direct, Assassin’s Creed Shadows previews, Dragon Age’s shortcomings, and even dive into the latest rumors with Tom Henderson.</p>



<p>Oh, and we find out what classic franchise Grant has never played…</p>



<p>There’s also the first round of our guessing competition where you have to guess the game three specific sounds come from. Correct answers will  be entered into a future raffle for game of your choice. Submit your sound competition entries or leave your feedback at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9dedf2f9fefceee9ddf4f3eef4f9f8efb0fafcf0f4f3fab3fef2f0">⁠<span data-cfemail="21514e454240525561484f52484544530c46404c484f460f424e4c">[email&nbsp;protected]</span>⁠</a>. </p>
