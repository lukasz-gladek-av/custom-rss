<p>Step aside, my collection of gaming headsets, there’s something new and even more immersive in town.</p>



<p>I was recently lucky enough to review the OXS Thunder Pro+ ‘gaming sound system’, an innovative piece of technology that fuses a phenomenal soundbar with the ‘world’s first wireless satellite neck speaker’ to promote <strong>the most immersive </strong>sound experience you can get in gaming.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full OXS Thunder Pro+ review and find out if it’s worth the hefty investment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-generation-sound">Next-Generation Sound</h2>



<p>I’ve always been a headset-focused kind of gamer, but in the last few weeks, I’ve been toying with the OXS Thunder Pro+, a multi-functional, multi-dimensional gaming sound system that works on so many levels. Presently, the soundbar is sitting under my main monitor, a placement that’s facilitated by the device’s relatively unassuming profile.</p>



<p>It might boast some of the most powerful sound output I’ve ever heard, but it’s just 24 inches wide and 3 inches high, which means it’ll fit nicely into almost any gaming space. It’s an attractive unit, too. It looks like something from the future, and it features customisable RGB lighting that is a must-have for many gamers out there.</p>



<p>In terms of the on-board audio, the OXS Thunder Pro+ soundbar has 7.1.2 Dolby Atmos built-in, with multi-directional speakers taking full advantage of eight precision-tuned drivers to ‘create a lifelike 3D soundscape’, as the manufacturer says. It does feel like that when you’ve got the thing switched on and pumping out anything from music to the cacophony of a game of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Another huge win is the accessibility of the device. It can be connected to almost anything through a range of methods, including Bluetooth, optical, HDMI, and USB. There’s a handy control unit that handles power and volume, and there’s also a remote in the box. </p>



<p>It’s a one-touch operation that never ceases to amaze me, and the connectivity and responsiveness of the device are off the charts.</p>



<p>Here are some numbers to consider:</p>



<ul>
<li>96dB output</li>



<li>Bluetooth 5.0</li>



<li>Peak power output – 160W</li>



<li>DSP onboard</li>



<li>HDMI eARC for better console connectivity</li>



<li>50% smaller than competing soundbars, and weighs barely 6.5 KG</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-fully-tested">Fully Tested</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The neck speaker system hasn’t been much of a game-changer</figcaption></figure>







<p>I put the OXS Thunder Pro+ through its paces, connecting it to a PlayStation 5, mobile devices, and of course, my PC. I found that my favourite ‘preset’ was RAC, which is designed for racing games but works so well across a variety of genres. From deep, booming bass to a depth of audio and clarity the likes of which I’ve never heard in a sound system, the OXS Thunder Pro+ constantly impressed me.</p>



<p>The 40W bass woofers and neodymium drivers are put to work regardless of what you’re playing, watching, or listening to.</p>



<p>Also, there’s a PC app in case you want to go a step further and fully customise the lighting and equalisation, too. I’m not a sound nerd so I haven’t played with this, but the app is intuitive and easy to use.</p>



<p>If I have one complaint, it’s that the ‘satellite neck speaker’ doesn’t seem to be at all worth the investment. If you only want to buy the soundbar, it’ll set you back $599.99, but adding the neck speaker bumps that up to $699.99.</p>



<p>As a neck cushion, it’s close to flawless. It has a unique silicone covering that feels wonderful to the touch and has a nice cooling effect, and it’s ergonomic and comfortable in all gaming conditions, but the onboard speakers just aren’t it. It’s supposed to promote ‘3D surround sound’, but you can barely hear the speakers and they’re very tinny and underpowered.</p>



<p>If I’m being brutally honest, I’d say that the OXS Thunder Pro soundbar is <strong>well worth the investment</strong>, but lumping on the extra $100 for the neck speaker probably isn’t a shrewd purchase. Unless you want a <strong>very </strong>comfortable and durable neck cushion, then you’re fine.</p>



<p>What really should be possible is controlling the volume of the neck speakers <strong>separately </strong>from that of the soundbar. Even with the soundbar blaring, the neck speakers are almost inaudible. </p>



<h2 id="h-switching-off">Switching Off</h2>



<p>So, let’s sum up this OXS Thunder Pro+ review:</p>



<ul>
<li>The sound quality of the bar is nothing short of flawless, and even when it’s <span><strong>booming</strong></span>, the speakers can handle the throughput without crackling or vibrating too much.</li>



<li>It looks phenomenal and futuristic, and with the RGB included, it’s so nicely at home in a gaming setup.</li>



<li>The levels of accessibility and compatibility are unparalleled and the OXS Thunder Pro+ will become the beating, thumping heart of your audio ecosystem.</li>



<li>It doesn’t necessarily provide the surround-sound audio of a headset, so it’s not ideal for competitive shooters, but for everything from casual multiplayer to single-player epics, it’s <strong>perfect</strong>.</li>



<li>The neck speaker unit is a waste of time unless you want a $100 cushion that can play some tinny audio behind your ears.</li>
</ul>



<p>My verdict? <strong>Buy</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve got $600 to burn and want a top-notch gaming soundbar that’ll blow your hair back with both audio quality and onboard features, the OXS Thunder Pro won’t let you down.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/faze-optic-combo-flank-invitational/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/faze-optic-cdl-combo-wins-25-000-flank-black-ops-6-invitational.1025925/</guid>

<p>One of the nastiest teams in competitive Call of Duty was recently assembled to compete in The Flank’s $25,000 Black Ops 6 Invitational.  The four-way combination of Dashy, Drazah, Simp, and Shotzzy proved too much for the competition to overcome, and this dream team managed to dominate so effectively that their opponents rage-quit in the final seconds.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-dynasty-has-been-cemented">‘The Dynasty Has Been Cemented’</h2>



<p>… is what Simp cried out as the final seconds of a ridiculous round of Hardpoint closed out on Skyline. The scoreline was separated by such a huge distance that the team of Scrap, Crimsix, Insight, and CleanX couldn’t compete. By the end of the series, the FaZe-OpTic team was just having a blast and picking up an easy payday.</p>



<p>It’s not all bad, though – the second-place finish was taken in good spirits by the likes of Crimsix, the winningest competitor in Call of Duty history and an esports legend:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Got 2nd in The Flank invitational #2. My teammates played insane. Thank you to those who tuned into the stream! But not bad for a pro race car driver.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On October 30, the first Flank tournament was won by Ghosty, Scrap, Gwinn, and TJHaly, so while Scrap was forced to rage-quit this follow-up event, he at least got <strong>something </strong>in the bank. </p>



<p>That’s not the end of all things, though – the crowning gem of The Flank’s Invitational series is yet to take place. From November 5 – 6, $50,000 will be on the line in the final round of the tournament, and once again, it’ll be played by randomised teams, which means anything is possible.</p>



<p>Presently, Activision is yet to reveal the schedule for the 2025 CDL season, so once The Flank’s Invitational series is wrapped, we’re back to wagers and scrims.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-return-of-the-max.1025922/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been almost a decade since the first Life is Strange title hit platforms worldwide, and in that time, several follow-up games have been released to flesh out the universe. However, for many, the first game is by far the best and most memorable, and much of that can be attributed to the stellar story laid out by the lead characters: Max Caulfield and Chloe Price.</p>



<p>On October 29, Deck Nine and Square Enix released Life is Strange: Double Exposure, bringing back the Max Caulfield character for the first time since 2015 (except for a brief reappearance in 2018). This all-new game represents a fresh dynamic for the character and the series, and it delivers in every way imaginable.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beautifully-mysterious">Beautifully Mysterious</h2>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a touch of fan service mixed with an honest attempt to expand a universe that has unravelled over a decade. There’s no doubt that bringing Max Caulfield back was a shrewd move by the developer, as this is the character that kickstarted the entire franchise in 2015.</p>



<p>As a die-hard fan of the Life is Strange series, I sat down with my copy of Double Exposure (on PlayStation 5) and dove in expecting nothing but good things. The series as a whole has ebbed and flowed, but in my opinion, there has never been a <strong>bad </strong>Life is Strange game.</p>



<p>Fortunately, my expectations were met and exceeded in Double Exposure.</p>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure has been built in Unreal Engine 5, which promotes a sumptuous visual palette that players will be pleased to explore. The original game featured a rather simple aesthetic and little in the way of animations, but Double Exposure is fully motion-captured and everything from the in-game interactions to the facial animations are nothing short of flawless.</p>



<p>Now more than ever, the characters’ emotions are being pulled to the surface.</p>



<p>Of course, where a Life is Strange game shines is in the story, and Double Exposure has twists, turns, and opportunities to explore off the beaten path in droves. It took three years to assemble this game, and it shows – there’s plenty of meat on the bones here and full completion of the five-chapter title will take around ten hours.</p>



<p>And with Life is Strange <strong>being </strong>Life is Strange, you’re encouraged to go back around and try approaching the game from a different angle, making new choices that open up fresh paths through the title.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-action-will-have-consequences">This Action Will Have Consequences</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Deck Nine has established something special with Double Exposure, and we now know it’s not the end for Max Caulfield. This isn’t a spoiler as it was announced by Square Enix, but the character <strong>will return </strong>in future games, which is nothing but a win for all involved.</p>



<p>As I played through Life is Strange: Double Exposure, I found it extremely difficult to be critical of the game. If I have any concerns, they’re mostly centred around the game’s audio. I felt at times that the audio balancing was a little strange, and in one scene, voices could be deafening, while in the next, they’d be whisper-quiet.</p>



<p>At one point, I had a bug that made one character’s voice muffled as though they were standing three rooms over and talking to me through the walls.</p>



<p>It’s not enough to take away from the wonderful set pieces, unique story elements, and phenomenal acting, though. I believe that Double Exposure features the best acting work in the series, and the whole ‘between two worlds’ mechanic is brilliantly done, encouraging players to constantly poke and prod to capture all the small details.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>As a Life is Strange fan, I can’t recommend this game enough. Beyond that, even if I weren’t a fan, this is a solid creation from a dedicated team, backed by a brilliant cast and a stellar engine that makes the game look unbelievably good at times. It’s <strong>well worth </strong>the investment. Max Caulfield is back and she’s better than ever, and that’s all the average fan should need to know to pick up their copy.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the quadruple-threat collection I expected, but Epic Games has gone ahead and done it anyway. On social media, images have surfaced showcasing the Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Juice Wlrd, and Ice Spice skins coming soon to the world’s most popular battle royale game, and fans are excited, to say the least.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-run-it-back-with-snoop-eminem-ice-spice-and-juice-wrld-in-battle-royale?lang=en-US&amp;sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite blog</a>, Epic unveiled the collection of skins and new locations debuting soon in the Chapter 2 Remix. From Snoop Dogg’s ‘Doggfather’ mansion to Eminem’s restaurant, ‘Mom’s Spaghetti’ in the Grotto, there’s plenty to explore in the coming weeks with this update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-interesting-update">Interesting Update</h2>



<p>Players will have to contend with these artists as enemies in Fortnite, with each character taking over a unique, on-theme location and dropping rare loot upon defeat. For instance, if you slay Eminem, he’ll turn around on a dime and help you out, offering you the Mythic RG Minigun.</p>



<p>Through November, each new week will be dedicated to the arrival of a different artist. First, players will fight Snoop Dogg, then Eminem, and in the third week, they’ll contend with Ice Spice on Shark Island. </p>



<p>In the fourth and final week, players will come face to face with Juice Wrld, but instead of fighting him, Epic has arranged a tribute to his legacy, offering a unique ‘Slayer Juice Wrld Outfit’ to any player logging in during a specific window. He’ll also be the frontman for the Remix: The Finale live event on November 30.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to this hip-hop collaboration in Fortnite? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> which skin you’re most excited to cop.</p>
