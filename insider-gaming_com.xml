<p>Although we are yet to receive an official announcement for Dispatch’s release on the Switch and Switch 2, we already know the launch date. Spotted by <a href="https://www.vooks.net/dispatch-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vooks</a>, the Australian Nintendo <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/aocs/70050000064441" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eShop</a> has been updated with a new listing for Dispatch with the January 2026 release date.
