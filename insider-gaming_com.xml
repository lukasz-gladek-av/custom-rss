</ul>

<li>Made a range of quality-of-life improvements to game audio and commentary.</li>



<li>Made performance optimisations to custom characters.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that meant players that quit out of online games on PlayStation weren’t being punished, and the win was not being correctly awarded to the remaining player. This now works as expected.</li>

</ul>

<p>The former Marathon game director, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who was fired from Bungie</a> early this year for alleged inappropriate contact, has spoken publicly about the allegations. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/oryxeleven/status/1867248221967560952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Christopher Barrett talked about how “difficult and painful” the last nine months have been since leaving Bungie while announcing that he has filed a lawsuit against both Sony and Bungie.</p>



<p>He claims that the claims and “attacks” are unfounded and damaging his reputation.</p>



<p>“The past nine months following my departure from Bungie have been very difficult and painful for me as I’ve had to endure rampant speculation, unfounded attacks on my reputation, and innuendo about what happened behind the scenes to cause me to be fired after 25 years of loyal service,” Barrett said. “I want to thank everyone who has been there for me.”</p>



<p>He continued: “I’ve eagerly awaited the opportunity to get the truth out there and tell my side of the story, and now is that time. Today, I filed a lawsuit against Sony and Bungie to hold them accountable for their conduct and the damage that has been done to my reputation and my career.”</p>



<p>For those unaware, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that at least eight females came forward with allegations against Barrett. An internal investigation would discover that Barrett would call lower-level employees attractive while also asking them to play truth or dare. In addition, Barrett reported flaunted his “wealth and power” within the company while hinting that he could help people advance their careers.</p>



<p>For his side, Barrett says that his name will be cleared as the lawsuit plays out.</p>



<p>“I am confident that the facts are on my side and look forward to clearing my name through the legal process,” he said. “Because this is a pending legal matter, there is nothing else I can say about it at this time.”</p>
