<p>You’re almost through the first week of December, and you’re a few steps closer to the festive window that we all love. Before you get there, you’ve got a few more NYT Connections puzzles to complete, and naturally, that includes today’s puzzle. Below, I’ve sketched out the best NYT Connections hints and solutions you’ll find anywhere.</p>



<p>If you’re being hampered by today’s puzzle, be sure to read on for the NYT Connections hints you need to get through it and keep your streak running.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-4">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 4)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #907:</p>



<ul>
<li>DRAW CLOSE</li>



<li>PUZZLE</li>



<li>ROSTRUM</li>



<li>NUZZLE</li>



<li>GUZZLE</li>



<li>IKEA FURNITURE</li>



<li>MUZZLE</li>



<li>LEGO SET</li>



<li>HOLD TIGHT</li>



<li>KNOCK BACK</li>



<li>MODEL</li>



<li>SPOON</li>



<li>SWILL</li>



<li>BEAK</li>



<li>POUND DOWN</li>



<li>PROBOSCIS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all different ways people might physically draw close to one another for comfort or affection.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>These words all describe drinking something quickly, often in large amounts or without pause.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all items that don’t come ready-made — you have to put the pieces together yourself.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These words are all different names for the protruding facial structure of animals.</em> </li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 4:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-4-907">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 4 (#907)</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[A Console Nobody Has Heard of Just Topped PS5 in Sales in the US]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/console-nex-playground-topped-ps5-sales-us/</link>
            <guid>1372561</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Circana’s most recent release of hardware sales in the United States just revealed a tantalizing tidbit about an unknown piece of hardware that’s making waves this holiday season. In a post on social media by Circana’s Mat Piscatella, it was revealed that the <strong>NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System </strong>outsold the PlayStation 5 during the week ending November 22, 2025.</p>



<p>The NEX Playground came in just behind pole position, held by the Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle, this year’s hottest Christmas gift.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-nex-playground">What is the NEX Playground?</h2>



<p>Mat Piscatella’s telling post on social media revealed that the <strong>NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System </strong>beat the PS5 Slim Digital in sales in the United States midway through November, prompting many to ask what the device even is.</p>











<p>The NEX Playground has been around since 2023, but it’s gathering steam now ahead of this year’s holiday season. It’s part of a new line-up of interactive games consoles designed for families and young gamers, allowing them to turn their televisions into engaging experiences without the need for controllers.</p>



<p>It’s like the Kinect, Eye Toy, or PlayStation Camera, but you don’t need a console to make it work, as it <strong>is </strong>the console.</p>



<p>It’s an AI-powered device that sits next to your television, offering a range of games like Fruit Ninja, Bluey Bust-a-Move, NHL Puck Rush, and Barbie Dance Party, all of which encourage young players to get up, get moving, and enjoy video games more interactively. It also has a bolt-on subscription that users can opt into to secure more games.</p>



<p>The NEX Playground costs just $249, which makes it a considerably cheaper option compared to the Nintendo Switch 2 ($500) or the PS5 Slim Digital ($449).</p>



<p>Circana’s Mat Piscatella followed up his simple sales report with a comment that read, ‘MOTION CONTROL IS BACK.’</p>







<p>Are you investing in a NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System for your family this Christmas?

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s ‘Good Ending’ Has Been Unlocked, and It Almost Suggests a Sequel]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-good-ending-almost-suggests-sequel/</link>
            <guid>1372555</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov has been dominating the extraction shooter space for many years, and midway through November, it hit the long-awaited 1.0 release window that pushed it out as a ‘finished’ game. In the weeks that followed, the game’s best players have busied themselves with completing the game’s all-new story-driven campaign, seen as the ultimate challenge for Tarkov fans.</p>



<p>The first completion came earlier this week, with streamer ‘Tigz’ being dubbed the first in the world to see Tarkov through to the end. Other streamers and players followed, but recently, a Chinese streamer proved to be the first to capture unlocking the game’s best, and reportedly <strong>hardest</strong>, ending – <strong>Savior</strong>.</p>



<p>This was the first <strong>PvP </strong>unlock, while the first PvE unlock, recognized as the world’s first <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/1996179962685178266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Battlestate Games</a>, was by a player named Tsukinogi.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-s-best-ending-has-been-secured">Escape from Tarkov’s Best Ending Has Been Secured</h2>



<p>On BiliBili, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nE2YBGEWr">an hour-long VOD</a> was posted from the perspective of a Chinese streamer, Youmoxiangche, who goes by the in-game username ‘NeverPlayScav’.</p>



<p>In this video, we saw a tense battle through Terminal rage as the player pushed towards what’s widely believed to be the <strong>best </strong>of Escape from Tarkov’s four endings: Survivor, Fallen, Debtor, and Savior.</p>



<p>The worst endings are <strong>Debtor </strong>and <strong>Fallen</strong>, while <strong>Survivor </strong>is seen as being a middle-of-the-road victory, and <strong>Savior </strong>sits atop the pile as the best outcome. In the Savior ending, the player character is welcomed onto the ZUBR Boat after extracting through Terminal, fighting through Scavs, RUAF, and Black Faction enemies in a PvE environment.</p>



<p>As they’re ushered onto the boat, the vessel’s captain tries to assassinate them, but is caught and killed by a friendly RUAF soldier who assures the player that nobody is left on the boat but allies. As they head topside for a smoke, more bodies are seen being dumped into the river through Tarkov.</p>



<p>At that moment, jets fly overhead and drop what appears to be a <strong>nuclear warhead </strong>on the city of Tarkov, and the soldier quips that they managed to escape just in time. As the image fades to black, the player character receives a unique ring, and the RUAF soldier utters the words that it’s up to them to decide their own fate now.</p>



<p>It almost suggests a sequel of sorts could be coming. The RUAF squad, along with the PMC protagonist, zip off into the sunset, and the soldier says:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What matters is we’re alive, and now we’ll take down those bastards from TerraGroup. The whole world will know the truth.</p>



<p>From here on, we decide our own fate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We know that Battlestate Games is working on ‘other games’ in the Escape from Tarkov universe, and that DLC will be delivered now that the 1.0 version of the game is out, but is this our first indicator as to what that might look like?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Starladder Budapest Major Stage 3 Predictions Are Running Wild]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starladder-budapest-stage-3-predictions/</link>
            <guid>1372510</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Starladder Budapest Major is unravelling as we speak, and the third stage is set to kick off <strong>today</strong>. The predictions for the third stage of this $1.25 million Counter-Strike 2 tournament are getting too close to call, but there are some frontrunners. It’s shaping up to be a brutal proving ground for the game’s heaviest hitters, but how might the tournament’s underdogs fare?</p>



<p>This final Swiss Stage will decide the eight playoff contenders, and the earliest signs we have point to the likes of NAVI, FaZe, and Vitality as frontrunners, which many might have predicted, but the likes of Passion UA and 3DMAX still have the potential for an underdog upset.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-will-make-it-to-the-playoffs-in-budapest">Who Will Make It To The Playoffs in Budapest?</h2>



<p>Stage two of the Budapest Major was a pretty dramatic affair. The squads lined up needing three wins to proceed to the third stage, and the likes of NAVI and FaZe Clan both produced perfect records, effortlessly walking into the next phase.</p>



<p>The three ‘underdog’ sides in this event, Team Liquid, Passion UA, and 3DMAX, all produced decisive last-minute wins, eliminating Astralis, M80, and NiP in a sweep that few saw coming.</p>



<p>As we go into the third stage, these are the teams lined up to compete:</p>



<p><strong>Invited</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vitality</li>



<li>G2</li>



<li>Spirit</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Falcons</li>



<li>PaiN</li>



<li>MongolZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Stage Two:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>NAVI</li>



<li>FaZe</li>



<li>Liquid</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>



<li>Imperial</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Parivision</li>
</ul>



<p>The matches lined up for stage three are already looking tasty, but all eyes will be on Vitality vs FaZe as the pick of the bunch. This is FaZe’s resurgence versus Vitality’s consistency, following a year of incredible results with ZywOo at the helm.</p>



<p>In terms of predictions, it’s easy to see NAVI, FaZe Clan, Vitality, and G2 Esports in the playoffs, with Liquid, UA, and 3DMAX coming in as dark horses.</p>



<p>The predictions don’t end with this article, though.
