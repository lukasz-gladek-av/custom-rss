You can find his complete statement below.:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Speaking entire hypothetically: It’s a dick move to remove primary developers from credits in an update, especially when an update includes hundreds of fixes that were provided by those developers that stayed out of players’ hands for years.”</p>

They mentioned that the developers are still credited in the final credits but have been removed from the initial splash screen.</p>

<p>Phil Spencer recently discussed the reasons for not releasing a mid-gen refresh console for Xbox Series X/S like the PS5 Pro, stating it’s “harder to show the benefits” for such consoles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>, Phil Spencer was asked why Xbox wasn’t working on a mid-gen refresh like the PS5 Pro. In response, Spencer stated that Xbox thinks “about hardware that can create unique value” for the players or creators on its platform. The company doesn’t need to work on “incremental hardware” for its benefit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil Spencer asked whether a new mid-gen device provides players with “a unique experience on screen in some way”. He stated that “it’s less like the old days” when going from the original Xbox to 360 meant moving from “standard definition to high definition”.” He concluded by stating, “Now, it’s harder to show the benefits” for mid-gen consoles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, Spencer also confirmed that Xbox would “definitely do more consoles in the future, and other devices”. Spencer means the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld-confirmed-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Handheld</a> by “other devices”, which was confirmed during another interview a few days ago. However, this console will not arrive for a few years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Phil Spencer has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-wasnt-due-to-game-quality-phil-spencer-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed wasn’t delayed due to game quality</a>.

<p>In recent years, the United Kingdom’s gaming scene has been shaken by a dwindling count of in-person events. It was tough coming out of COVID-19, but for a while, a decent spread kept gamers across the nation entertained. We had EGX, Insomnia, WASD, and a few other, smaller events scattered here and there.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Insomnia disappeared following a round of layoffs at the event’s parent company. Now, after months of speculation, it has been revealed that WASD London, which first took place in 2022, has been struck from the schedule forever as the organiser enters liquidation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-nothing">To Nothing</h2>



<p>In October, EGX surfaced as it does every year, but it was twinned with MCM, the nation’s biggest comic con event. It was suspected that this was to help keep both events afloat, and while the turnout was solid, the future of EGX is also under threat.</p>



<p>The Insomnia Gaming Festival, which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year, was due to take place in September, but the expected show dates came and went without a word being uttered.</p>



<p>Now, WASD London’s organiser has entered liquidation, with the firm’s co-founder lamenting the state of the scene:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(The) increasing costs and less demand for stand space means running events is just not viable for us anymore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For a while, WASD London was becoming a spearhead event in the city. It welcomed both top-tier titles and indie developers, helping to cast a light on lesser-known games with small (or no) budgets while also allowing players to enjoy the next biggest games.</p>



<p>At past WASD events, I was fortunate enough to be one of the first people in the country to play Dead Island 2 and Lords of the Fallen. I maintain that when it peaked, WASD London was one of the best industry events in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>In a comment posted <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxvxzp909o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on a BBC article</a>, one indie gaming aficionado expressed their concerns about the sustainability of these events:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that bigger gaming companies are running their own digital events, there’s no reason for them to spend time, money, and resources on being present at in-person events.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pretty soon, all we’ll have that’s anywhere close to the UK will be Gamescom – but the saving grace there is that it’s effectively the world’s biggest gaming expo right now.</p>

<p>Obsidian has revealed the minimum and recommended system requirements for running Avowed on a PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avowed is an upcoming fantasy RPG with a vibrant open world that you can experience from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-deep-dive-video-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-person and third-person perspectives</a>. Many players have wondered what specifications they might need to experience the game as the developers intended. Fortunately, Avowed’s minimum and recommended PC requirements are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">out now</a>; check them out below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 10/11 with updates</li>



<li>Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 / Intel i5-8400</li>



<li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li>Graphics: AMD RX 5700 / Nvidia GTX 1070 / Intel Arc A580</li>



<li>DirectX: Version 12</li>



<li>Storage: 75 GB available space</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 10/11 with updates</li>



<li>Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X / Intel i7-10700K</li>



<li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li>Graphics: Graphics: AMD RX 6800 XT / Nvidia RTX 3080</li>



<li>DirectX: Version 12</li>



<li>Storage: 75 GB available space</li>
</ul>



<p>The requirements aren’t too demanding, with players only needing an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 / Intel i5-8400 and AMD RX 5700 / Nvidia GTX 1070 / Intel Arc A580 to run the game. At the same time, 75 GB of storage space, 16GB of RAM, and DirectX Version 12 are essential for both Avowed’s minimum and recommended PC system requirements.</p>
