<p>Sucker Punch has been tight-lipped about Ghost of Yotei so far, but we’re keeping an eye on the Ghost of Tsushima 2 sequel. The stealthy standalone follow-up has a few details out in the public already, and it’s looking promising.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a> was a fun surprise announcement during the Sept. 24, 2024, Sony State of Play. Ghost of Tsushima cemented Sucker Punch as a stalwart of a studio following years of success with Sly Cooper and inFamous. Now, it’s back with Ghost of Yotei, and a certain Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-shadows-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> is making Ghost of Yotei more intriguing by the day.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the latest Ghost of Yotei reveals and announcements.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Ghost of Yotei is Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Expect Ghost of Yotei to be just as impactful. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ghost of Yotei doesn’t have a release date yet, but its initial reveal trailer claimed a 2025 release is on the cards for the open-world game.</strong></p>



<p>The first trailer was stunning, it was captivating, and it shockingly had a release period. After nearly three minutes of eye-opening action and drama, Ghost of Yotei’s Announce Trailer had a simple message: “2025.”</p>



<p>As of writing, we’ve not heard too much about Ghost of Yotei since. The calendar year is stacked with new games, but Sony’s catalog of hardware-selling goliaths is probably a bit more barren than most would have thought. A delay or a development hiccup could scupper Ghost of Yotei’s 2025 release date, and we’ll update this guide if this is the case.</p>



<p>Also, I’d wager Sucker Punch wants breathing space between Ghost of Yotei and Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows. There are a lot of similarities between both titles, so waiting until Shadows releases is the prudent play.</p>



<p>You can check out the full announcement trailer below—thanks to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation YouTube account</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-ghost-of-yotei-platforms">All Ghost of Yotei Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Ghost of Yotei is currently only scheduled to release on PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>There isn’t a PlayStation 4 port scheduled—which makes sense given the supposed scale of the title—but an eyebrow or two might be raised at a lack of a PC launch. Ghost of Tsushima eventually released on PC a few years after its initial debut.</p>



<p>With Sony’s continued philosophy to bring its exclusives to PC after a while, it’s likely Ghost of Yotei will follow in the footsteps of its predecessor and release on PC later on.</p>



<hr>



<p>More Ghost of Yotei information is sure to drop as 2025 progresses. Could the Ghost of Tsushima successor end up being PlayStation’s star attraction this year? Or does Sony need to deliver more exclusive news? </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-players-bet-on-themselves-new-jersey/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-jersey-betting-bill-could-permit-esports-players-to-wager-on-themselves.1126110/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-players-bet-on-themselves-new-jersey/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been discovered that a newly proposed bill in the state of New Jersey could allow esports competitors to <strong>wager on themselves and their teams</strong> if successfully implemented. This bill would be integrated alongside new ‘esports-specific skins’ that would permit licensees to offer odds on esports betting markets in the state.</p>



<p>This news comes almost six years after the state’s first legal esports wager was placed at the Borgata Casino in Atlantic City. In 2021, the state opened its doors to esports betting as part of the legal sports betting portfolio in the region, but things are still developing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-half-the-industry">Half the Industry</h2>



<p>In the most recent edition <a href="https://sharpr.substack.com/p/stake-strikes-viral-gold-with-drake?open=false#%C2%A7nj-bill-will-introduce-esports-specific-skins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of the Sharpr newsletter</a>, it was revealed that New Jersey lawmakers are working on a unique bill that would introduce something quite bizarre. If successfully passed, esports competitors (of legal betting age) could bet on (or against…) themselves or their teams.</p>



<p>It’s hard to see how that <strong>couldn’t </strong>go wrong – it’s a recipe for disaster, surely.</p>



<p>In the report from Sharpr, it was claimed that the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement will have the power to authorise venues holding esports events to accept exclusive wagers on the <strong>outcome </strong>of said events.</p>



<p>The primary sponsor of the bill, William Moen, explained that this is a step to ‘capitalise on an emerging industry.’</p>



<p>It’s a relatively well-known fact that esports betting makes up around 50% of the industry’s overall revenue – a substantial sum. Behind esports betting sits merchandising, ticket sales, sponsorships, and broadcast rights, but the esports industry is still not entirely profitable.</p>



<p>Last September, at ESI Lisbon, an expert panel featuring representatives from GRID, Kambi Abios, and BETER expressed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/growth-of-esports-betting/">billions are being made in wagers</a> and that the esports betting market is no longer ’emerging’, as Moen puts it.</p>



<p>This latest bill proposed in New Jersey seems like a wrong turn, but the state has been at the forefront of esports betting for a while, so there must be some method to the madness.</p>



<p>Admittedly, it’s not the first time something like this has existed. In the past, some sites have offered players the ability to place wagers on themselves in certain games, charging them with completing challenges to receive a payout. That’s entirely different to betting on yourself as a pro esports player in a competitive environment, though.</p>
