<p>Atomfall’s long-awaited release is considered low-key to many. It hasn’t received as much attention as other AAA rivals, but it should. So let’s see if it has Early Access to punch yourself a one-way irridatiated ticket to England. </p>



<p>We’ve bigged up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> at Insider Gaming and believe its potential is boundless. Our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-played-again-most-anticipated-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview build</a> playthroughs have shown us the alternate lands of the UK for ourselves. Cumbria is usually one of England’s top hotspots for luxury, peace, and comfort. In Atomfall, it’s a literal fight for survival.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve wishlisted Atomfall or contemplated securing a pre-order, we’ve got everything you need to know about Atomfall and Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-atomfall-early-access">Can You Play Atomfall Early Access?</h2>

<p><strong>Atomfall has an Early Access option, meaning you can jump into the survival-RPG game before most people.</strong></p>



<p>Certain editions are slapped with exorbitant price tags—leaving players unwilling to part with large sums of money. However, Atomfall’s editions are more generous and include bonuses such as Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-atomfall-early-access">How to Get Atomfall Early Access</h2>



<p><strong>You need to pre-order either Atomfall Deluxe Edition or the Quarantine Edition to assure yourself of Early Access.</strong></p>



<p>There are three Atomfall editions to consider. But remember that <strong>only two of them have Early Access</strong>: The Deluxe and Quarantine Edition. The Standard Edition is an option, but only comes with pre-order bonuses and the game.</p>



<p>Furthermore, <strong>Atomfall Quarantine Edition is a PC-only version</strong> exclusively available in the <a href="https://shop.rebellion.com/products/atomfall-quarantine-edition?utm_source=LinkTree&amp;utm_medium=Atomfall&amp;utm_campaign=Quarantine+Edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebellion Store</a>. </p>



<p>I wholeheartedly recommend you weigh up the pros and cons of getting Atomfall Early Access first. Then you can move onto the decision of choosing between the Deluxe and Quarantine Edition—unless you’re a console player, in which case the choice is easy!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-atomfall-early-access-start">When Does Atomfall Early Access Start?</h2>



<p><strong>Atomfall Early Access gets underway on March 24.</strong></p>



<p>This is three days before the official March 27 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfalls-release-date-has-been-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. Depending on how excited you are and eager to get started, 72 hours is a lot. The extra price of admission is worth it for players desperate to see the aftereffects of the Windscale nuclear disaster.</p>



<p>You get more benefits in addition to Early Access, such as a Story Expansion Pack and in-game weapons and goodies. I’ve provided you with the information you need, so my job is done.</p>



<hr>



<p>We also have a detailed guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-atomfall-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall’s Xbox Game Pass</a> criteria. Plus, if you haven’t already, look at the RPG through a juicy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-atomfall-trailer-shows-games-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay features trailer</a>.</p>

<p>Palworld players can finally play with friends across platforms, as a new crossplay update is planned for late March.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld’s Crossplay update will allow players to access multiplayer across all platforms and transfer Pals between worlds. Crossplay will be available on all the platforms the game released on, including Steam, Xbox, PlayStation 5, and Mac. More details about the update will be revealed on the day it is released.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PocketPair wishes to celebrate the new feature’s arrival in the community by offering a flat <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1899808005153251468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">25% discount</a> on Palworld on the PlayStation Store and Steam. The offer ends on March 27 on the PlayStation Store, and players are speculating that’s when this update will arrive. Currently, the developers haven’t provided a concrete release date for crossplay in Palworld.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld is following its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-reveals-new-roadmap-for-one-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-anniversary roadmap</a>, which was released early this year. Co-op crossplay and world transfer for pals have arrived, and now we are waiting on new collaborations and content partnerships. The developers are also continuing to work on introducing new Pals and features for players to try out in the game.</p>



<p>In other news, Palworld and Nintendo’s court battles continue as the latter has received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new patent</a> to help their case against Pocket Pair. Also, the game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-32-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 32 million players</a> within the first year. What are your thoughts on Palworld receiving crossplay later this month?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>In a new interview, Hideki Kamiya has explained in more detail on his decision to leave PlatinumGames in 2023.</p>



<p>Speaking with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/09/150183.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Spark</a> and picked up on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-on-leaving-platinumgames-i-couldnt-allow-myself-to-kill-my-soul" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Hideki Kamiya went into depth about his reason on leaving PlatinumGames in 2023.</p>



<p>“The reason I left PlatinumGames was because the company’s way of thinking was gradually shifting towards a modern model of game development that doesn’t place importance on the creators’ individuality,” he said.</p>



<p>He continued, “Even if it meant the end of my career as a creator, I couldn’t allow myself to kill my soul in order to work in an environment that I didn’t agree with.”</p>



<p>Hideki Kamiya was one of four founders of PlatinumGames, which was founded in October 2007. After leaving the studio, Kamiya went on to found CLOVERS inc. </p>



<p>Earlier this month, Kamiya <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed interest in wanting to return to developing Scalebound</a>, a game that was in development in partnership with Xbox and announced in 2014. The game was cancelled by Microsoft in 2017 for apparent issues with Unreal Engine and a lack of experience at the studio creating some of the games core elements. In addition, it was also said that the game couldn’t live up to the players high expectations.</p>



<p>As for if Scalebound will happen again remains to be seen, but for now, we’ll have to wait for CLOVERS or Kamiya to announce their first project.</p>



<p>What do you think of Kamiya leaving PlatinumGames? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Pokemon Go developer Niantic has confirmed that Monopoly Go maker Scopely has acquired its games business for $3.5 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Confirming <span>last month’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-niantic-close-to-selling-games-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, Scopely has acquired Niant</span>ic’s game business, which includes titles like Pokemon GO, Pikmin Bloom and Monster Hunter Now. Their companion apps and services, including Niantic Campfire and Wayfarer, will also fall under Scopely’s umbrella after the $3.5 billion deal. Scopely has confirmed that “All Niantic game-making team members, along with tenured leaders Kei Kawai and Ed Wu”, will continue to develop and operate their beloved experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ed Wu, the Pokemon GO lead, has <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/moving-to-a-new-home-2025?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> the acquisition and believes it “will be a positive step” for the community and the game’s future. Ed Wu also assured players that the entire Pokemon GO team would stay together through this partnership, and with Scopely ’s “commitment, experience and resources,” they would make Pokemon GO the best it can be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scopely’s <a href="https://www.scopely.com/en/news/scopely-to-acquire-niantic-games-business-which-includes-pokemon-go-one-of-the-most-successful-mobile-games-of-all-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement post</a> also provides statistics about Niantic’s game business, including numbers for Pokemon GO, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now. Pokemon GO has over 20 million weekly active players and has been in the top 10 since its launch. Its trainers have explored more than 30 billion miles together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pikmin Bloom players completed 3.94 trillion steps in 2024 and hit its highest active player count last year. Monster Hunter Now launched with surpassed 15 million downloads in 7 months, and over 50% of the audience played the game every day of the week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You and a squad can channel your inner repo man in 2025’s hit horror spectacle. REPO encourages groups of players to form, forage, and flee, and if it’s free and costs nothing, it would be all the more sweet. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> started strongly, instantly gaining a few thousand players daily thanks to its advertised brand of silliness and scares. Within days, its community had exploded, achieving over a hundred thousand players and counting. You can’t help but laugh at REPO—before you inevitably shriek—and the addictive gameplay loop means replayability and longevity aren’t an issue.</p>



<p>More and more players are keen to get involved, and a low-cost entry point (potentially free) could be massive for its long-term success.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-repo-on-steam">How Much is REPO on Steam?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One more piece of loot. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>REPO costs $9.99 or £8.50 on Steam—the horror title isn’t free to play.</strong></p>



<p>Low-budget indie titles from growing studios are unlikely to make a project free-to-play. The company needs to make money, especially if it isn’t reliant on a microtransaction-driven economy. A $9.99 or £8.50 price tag is great value for what you get with REPO.</p>



<p>We’ve highlighted Steam as REPO is only available on PC for now. A future port can’t be ruled out, but there’s currently no talk of it coming to consoles. Never say never, and if it blows up enough, a future port can’t be ruled out.</p>



<p>There’s already a stellar amount of content in the game. What’s more is developer semiwork is blown away by the game’s success and is not content to sit around and leave players to grow tired of the existing features.</p>



<h2 id="h-future-repo-content-roadmap">Future REPO Content Roadmap</h2>



<p><strong>New enemies, levels, general content, and bug fixes are on the way in REPO.</strong></p>



<p>“Hey everyone, thank you so much for playing R.E.P.O. we are completely shocked and overjoyed with the response! Here’s a video with an update on what we are up to! We plan to release a video every week to make sure you guys are all up to date with our plans!” said the developer on a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3241660/view/515203741912138911?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">March 7 Steam post</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you have paid for REPO, or you’re planning on it, this is a great time to invest in the hit indie title.</p>
