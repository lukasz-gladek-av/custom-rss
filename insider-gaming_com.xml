<p>Last night, OpTic Gaming’s Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez published a lengthy video exploring the ‘curse’ that lingers over OpTic Texas in the Call of Duty League. Hours later, the team suffered another loss, hitting a map record of 0-18, which is one of the worst records in the history of Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>Not only that, but in the series against the LA Theives, the most dominant team in the CDL right now, OpTic’s Kenny secured the lowest KD in competitive COD history. Curse or not, something has to change for OpTic Texas, which is on an unrivalled bad luck run.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-to-bottom">Top to Bottom</h2>



<p>Last year, OpTic Texas claimed the Call of Duty League Championship, the most prestigious award in the ecosystem. The team netted the first world title for OpTic in Call of Duty in several years, and everyone lauded this incredibly talented team.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and the fans are rebelling against the same roster, which has put up one of the worst records in competitive history. In the last batch of matches played, OpTic Texas has gone 0-18, failing to secure a single map in six fixtures.</p>



<p>It was noticed shortly after the recent match finished that Kenny had dropped a 0.3 KD ratio, which is, according to statistics aggregation platforms, the lowest kill-death ratio in Call of Duty esports history. That’s a record set by a two-time world champion, which just seems bizarre at this point.</p>



<p>In the round of Hardpoint against LA Thieves, Kenny set a woeful record, pulling just <strong>11 kills </strong>in what was a complete thrashing from the Thieves.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/">recent video published by HECZ</a>, the OpTic Texas team was all smiles as they pondered what could be wrong, with the entire office believing that a curse was upon the squad. Fans worldwide are pleading for a change, but nobody has a solid grip on what needs to be altered to get OpTic Texas winning maps.</p>



<p>What’s worse is that in just a few days, Major II will unravel in Texas, backed by OpTic. The team will start in the worst position at its home event and will have just <strong>one chance </strong>to stay in the running.</p>



<p>What do you think needs to change at OpTic Texas?</p>
