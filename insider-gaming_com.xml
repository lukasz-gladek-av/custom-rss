<p>It wasn’t long ago that Baldur’s Gate 3 took the gaming world by storm, thrusting the CRPG genre into the mainstream. Since then, developer Larian has introduced countless content updates, expanding the already massive RPG tenfold. But it’s not done yet. Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/top-10-baldurs-gate-3-mods-on-mods-io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mod support</a>, which they revealed is doing exceptionally well, with over 70 million downloads total, the studio unveiled Baldur’s Gate Patch 8. It’s coming in 2025 and includes photo mode, cross-play support, and 12 additional subclasses!</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-coming-to-baldur-s-gate-3-in-patch-8">Everything Coming to Baldur’s Gate 3 in Patch 8</h2>



<p>Patch 8 promises to be a massive experience for anyone still enjoying Baldur’s Gate 3 or planning on returning in the new year. According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, we can expect cross-play support, photo mode, new subclasses, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements galore. For now, let’s focus on the prominent new features, such as:</p>



<h3 id="h-cross-play-support">Cross-Play Support</h3>



<p>Full cross-play support is coming to Baldur’s Gate 3, allowing anyone to play between PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and yes, even Mac. This support features cross-platform progression, allowing you to progress through your campaign no matter where you play.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the game’s multiplayer lobbies will allow you to invite players from any system through the Larian Network!</p>



<h3 id="h-photo-mode">Photo Mode</h3>



<p>As someone who adores taking screenshots in-game, I love it when a studio includes photo mode. Previously, snapping a screenshot in Baldur’s Gate 3 felt like a chore, as you must contend with the menu and panned-out camera, but that’s about to change in Patch 8 with a full-fledged photo mode. It features:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Camera Settings</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lens Settings</strong></li>



<li><strong>Scene Settings</strong></li>



<li><strong>Post Processing Effects</strong></li>



<li><strong>Frames</strong></li>



<li><strong>Stickers</strong></li>
</ul>







<h3 id="h-12-new-subclasses">12 New Subclasses</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bard </strong>– College of Glamour</li>



<li><strong>Barbarian </strong>– Path of Giants</li>



<li><strong>Cleric </strong>– Death Domain</li>



<li><strong>Druid </strong>– Circle of Stars</li>



<li><strong>Paladin </strong>– Oath of the Crown</li>



<li><strong>Fighter </strong>– Arcane Archer</li>



<li><strong>Monk </strong>– Drunken Master</li>



<li><strong>Ranger </strong>– Swarmkeeper</li>



<li><strong>Rogue </strong>– Swashbuckler</li>



<li><strong>Sorcerer </strong>– Shadow Magic</li>



<li><strong>Warlock </strong>– Hexblade</li>



<li><strong>Wizard </strong>– Bladesinging</li>
</ul>



<p>Before Patch 8 is available to everyone in 2025, the studio will undergo extensive stress testing to ensure it’s ready for the community. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elon-must-ai-game-studio/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elon-musk-says-he%E2%80%99s-going-to-launch-an-ai-game-studio-to-%E2%80%9Cmake-games-great-again%E2%80%9D.1046811/</guid>

<p>Elon Musk has said on X (formerly Twitter) that he’s going to launch an AI game studio to “make games great again.”</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1861801046949191686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet</a>, Musk says that there are “too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations” and that xAI will soon have its own game studio.</p>



<p>What such a game studio will look like is unclear, but in recent years, game studios have increasingly relied on AI to cut spiraling costs and help with creative ideas. One such project to leverage AI is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-alterra-animal-crossing-inspired-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s new ‘Alterra’ project</a>, which heavily used AI during the creative and ideation process to create its characters named ‘Matterlings’. </p>



<p>Earlier this month, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-top-20-diablo-4-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed that he was somehow a top 20 Diablo 4 player</a> despite him running companies including Tesla, SpaceX, X, and more. The billionaire also dabbled in streaming, too, with his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first stream on X pulling 1.3 million watchers</a>. To put that into perspective, xQc has a recorded peak of 312,158, DrDisrespect reached heights of 363,980, and Ninja hit 616,693, to name a few big streamers.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Musk is serious about an AI game studio, but knowing him, he probably is.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-night-ops-launch-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-night-ops-launch-trailer-is-a-mini-action-movie-and-i-love-it.1046808/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-night-ops-launch-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Gray Zone Warfare’s Night Ops update goes live today, and it’s the biggest overhaul the game has seen since being released in April 2024. This sizeable – and free – update introduces a day-night cycle, but it also brings in some new weapons, tweaks to the game’s AI, many quality-of-life improvements, and some all-new mechanics.</p>



<p>It’s a sizeable update that I was fortunate to preview in August at Gamescom and in the last few days using a private server provided to me by MADFINGER.</p>



<p>Night Ops is finally here, and it will change how you experience Gray Zone Warfare.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-darkness-falls">When Darkness Falls</h2>



<p>The launch trailer for Night Ops is nothing short of a mini-action movie, and the cinematic quality of it represents something I’d watch as a feature film. It’s one of the best productions the team has put together since the game was released in April.</p>







<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gray Zone Warfare: Night Ops Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHd8fSP-gik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In the short showcase, we get a peek at Night Ops in all its dark and gloomy glory. The day-night shift will bring about a paradigm shift, with players venturing out into the darkness of Lamang to take on all comers and tackle new quests that can <strong>only </strong>be completed at night.</p>



<p>With night mode comes a range of attachments and items to combat the darkness, and from what I’ve seen, MADFINGER has worked tirelessly to make night vision aids as realistic as humanly possible. Exploring a dark jungle with nothing but a torch and a rifle feels intense, and slapping on a set of NVGs makes you feel as though you’ve entered a new world.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare still isn’t perfect, though. I had a few frame rate drops and some audio bugs when I was playing, but I <strong>was </strong>using a pre-release version of the Night Ops build, so I can chalk my performance issues up to that — hopefully. Otherwise, I had a blast diving back into Gray Zone Warfare to experience the Night Ops update, and I’m sure you will too.</p>

<p>There’s another leak surrounding the upcoming Intel Arc Battlemage graphics cards. According to a new report making the waves, at least one price for the Intel Battlemage has appeared online.</p>



<p>According to known leaker <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861755473718108511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Momomo_us</a>, there will be an Intel Arc B580 Limited Edition GPU available when the new graphics cards launch. Based on the information found, the B580 Limited Edition will cost roughly $250. They’ve found it online for as low as $246 in some places, as well.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Should the leaked pricing be accurate, the Intel Arc B580 will cost more than what A580 did when it launched in 2023 at $179. It will still be less than the $289 of the Intel Arc A750 when that launched in 2022.</p>



<p>The Intel Arc B580 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-reveal-imminent-more-intel-arc-battlemage-details-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to feature 20 Xe2 cores</a>, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a clock speed of 2.8GHz, and more. Latest reports suggest a reveal will happen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime in December</a> before Nvidia and AMD announce their new graphics cards in January.</p>



<p>It’s currently unknown how many Intel Battlemage GPU SKUs will be released. Intel has not commented on any of the rumored details of its new graphics cards.</p>
