            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-winter-twitch-drops-event-starts-december-30.1068003/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that Escape from Tarkov‚Äôs Winter Twitch Drops campaign will start on December 30, all but confirming that the wipe will take place a couple of days before. It‚Äôs a tradition at this point ‚Äì these campaigns always start a day or two after the game has undergone a platform-wide reset known as a ‚Äòwipe‚Äô.</p>



<p>This wipe will be accompanied by the 0.16 update, a supersized overhaul that promises to introduce a slew of new weapons, balances, and a rework of Customs, one of the game‚Äôs fan-favourite maps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-with-the-wipe-comes-a-drop">With The Wipe Comes a Drop</h2>



<p>On the Escape from Tarkov website, it was revealed that the Winter Drops campaign will run from December 30 to January 4, and then the Escape from Tarkov Arena drops campaign from January 4 to January 8.</p>



<p>The developer advised streamers <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/event/wintertwitchdropsevent?utm_source=x_post&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=winter_drops_24-25&amp;utm_term=link_1&amp;utm_content=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to enrol if they want to participate</a> in the campaign, with content creators being assigned time slots based on their availability. It‚Äôs easy to envision some of the biggest streamers who‚Äôll get a spot in the Winter Drops campaign ‚Äì this is the time of the year when they make the most money.</p>



<p>The likes of Landmark, Pestily, WillerZ, Glorious, StankRat, Gingy, and Trey will likely all be doing round-the-clock Tarkov streams in support of the wipe and the Twitch Drops campaign.</p>



<p>It hasn‚Äôt been confirmed what rewards viewers will receive, but last year, users had to rack up dozens of watch hours to unlock random gift drops in Escape from Tarkov. Some viewers unlocked thousands of rounds of ammunition, while others got packs of noodles or something to that effect.</p>



<p>Battlestate wrote on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the approach of the New Year holidays, one of the most anticipated events of the year for our community is kicking off ‚Äî the annual Twitch Drops Event. This is a great opportunity to receive in-game gifts and enjoy the festive season.</p>

<p>It has been confirmed: Johnny Silverhand and ‚ÄòV‚Äô from Cyberpunk 2077 are heading to Fortnite soon. It seems bizarre that a character who was iconic for rebelling against corporations and consumerism would appear in a game like this, but here we are. It hasn‚Äôt been confirmed when the characters will arrive in Fortnite, but it should be soon.</p>



<p>In a short teaser uploaded on social media, Epic Games revealed the characters ‚Äì the female variant of V, and the standard model of Johnny Silverhand, who Keanu Reeves famously played in the 2020 open-world RPG.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-night-city-meet-fortnite">Night City, Meet Fortnite</h2>



<p>This will be the second time that Keanu Reeves has appeared in Fortnite. In 2019, the actor was introduced to the Fortnite universe as John Wick, arguably one of his most famous roles to date, beyond playing Neo in The Matrix franchise.</p>



<p>He‚Äôll surface in Fortnite as Johnny Silverhand, one of the most major characters in Cyberpunk 2077 and the catalyst for the events that unfold throughout the game. Also being added is ‚ÄòV‚Äô, the game‚Äôs protagonist. While neither gender is canonical, Epic Games has opted to include the female variant in the upcoming crossover.</p>



<div><article><p><span>We‚Äôre expecting some guests from Night City üåÜ </span></p></article></div>







<p>It‚Äôs not yet confirmed what‚Äôs coming in the bundle, but we‚Äôve seen snippets online showing Cyberpunk 2077‚Äôs ‚ÄòMantis Blade‚Äô weapons as a pickaxe replacement.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1hjz19e/cyberpunk_x_fortnite_collab_skins_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a leak on other social media platforms</a>, the character models were reportedly revealed, along with the blades, a back bling, and weapon wraps.</p>

<p>Palworld‚Äôs Feybreak update has arrived with v0.4.11, and it introduces a new weapon called Meowmeow as the first instalment of their Terraria collab. The update also introduces a new island, fresh features, areas, pals, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-s-meowmeow-is-a-bullet-firing-melee-weapon-nbsp">Palworld‚Äôs Meowmeow is a ‚ÄúBullet Firing Melee Weapon‚Äù&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Through the Feybreak update, players can now try out Meowmeow from Terraria in Palworld. This is a ‚Äúsmall tease of the collab,‚Äù with more to come in 2025. For those wondering, this ‚ÄúBullet Firing Melee Weapon‚Äù is actually a sword that makes cat sounds when you attack. When the player swings the blade, a cat projectile with a rainbow trajectory is thrown at the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-feybreak-island-new-mechanics-and-more">Feybreak Island, New Mechanics and More</h2>



<p>The next big part of the Palworld update is the Feybreak Island itself, a land filled with new mysteries, challenges and goals. Additionally, there‚Äôs a new faction that you need to look for on this island, the Feybreak Warriors. These pesky individuals have taken over the island with the power of their missile battery camp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The update has also added new mechanics such as Expeditions, Research, Predator Pals, and Bounty NPCs. Players also receive a new raid called Xenolord, where they must defeat a mechanical dragon controlling the Xeno army. There‚Äôs also a Random Pal mode that randomises Pal Spawns. You can filter it by region or keep it entirely random for some chaos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Palworld Feybreak update adds much more content, such as the ability to create new weapons, the addition of new strongholds and stronghold bosses, items, unique skills, player changes, increased cap level, bug fixes, and so on.

<p>Black Ops 6 is getting a Double XP sweep starting tomorrow, December 24. Although it hasn‚Äôt been announced by Treyarch (or any Activision studio), there‚Äôs a listing for a Double XP event on the Black Ops 6 menu, and it says it‚Äôs starting tomorrow. This will be the latest in a long line of such events that have run since the game dropped in October.</p>



<p>Some could argue that Treyarch has put on <strong>too many </strong>Double XP events, reducing the efficacy of the ‚Äòspecial period‚Äô that allows players to get more out of their grind. Others have argued that the Double XP events are ‚Äòfixed‚Äô and that they don‚Äôt offer the full boost of experience points you‚Äôd expect.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-xp-incoming">More XP Incoming</h2>



<p>The next Black Ops 6 Double XP event is set to start tomorrow, December 24. That‚Äôs per a placeholder on the Black Ops 6 menu ‚Äì it‚Äôs yet to be announced by Activision.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 has started struggling in recent weeks, ebbing away from the claims that it‚Äôs the ‚Äòbest Call of Duty game in years‚Äô, and that‚Äôs mostly because the title is <strong>plagued </strong>with cheaters. It was admitted by the Call of Duty team that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-anti-cheat-not-good-enough/">they ‚Äòmissed the mark‚Äô</a> with the game‚Äôs anti-cheat mechanic, which means it‚Äôs hard for anyone to have any faith in the product right now.</p>



<p>To that end, some pro players and streamers have started abandoning Black Ops 6 in favour of other games. Most recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nadeshot/">Nadeshot gave up on streaming</a> Black Ops 6 and relocated to Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>In any case, Black Ops 6 is getting a new Double XP event from tomorrow, December 24. It comes at a time when many new players ‚Äì the age-old ‚ÄòChristmas noobs‚Äô ‚Äì will be joining the ecosystem. However, thanks to SBMM ‚Äì which definitely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-black-ops-6-have-sbmm-answered/">exists in Black Ops 6</a> ‚Äì you won‚Äôt bump into them unless you‚Äôre pretty awful at the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sega-subscription-service-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-could-create-a-new-game-subscription-service-report-says.1067889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sega-subscription-service-claim/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A recent report suggested that Sega, the Japanese gaming giant, could produce a standalone game subscription service based on the extensive library it has built up over the years. This would likely see its games withdrawn from similar subscription schemes live today, capitalising on the growth of the operating model.</p>



<p>The gaming world is no stranger to such service. Today, Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Rockstar Games, PlayStation, and Xbox all offer gaming-based subscription programs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-undisclosed">Undisclosed</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgnj7e8028o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with the BBC</a>, Sega‚Äôs president, Shuji Utsumi, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôre thinking something ‚Äì and discussing something ‚Äì we cannot disclose right now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was talking about subscription-based products, and reportedly mentioned that they‚Äôre ‚Äòvery interesting‚Äô and that Sega is ‚Äòevaluating some opportunities‚Äô.</p>



<p>These days, the average gamer is surrounded by subscription-based schemes, and the rise of the live-service game has meant that we‚Äôre all putting money into a pot every few weeks over a long period, rather than paying for something once and then never again.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs one of the most common operating models in the gaming world right now.</p>



<p>Between Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, some 80 million gamers worldwide are subscribed to a service that delivers free games every month and gives them access to repositories filled with games both old and new. </p>



<p>Ubisoft has a service that operates in much the same way, as does Electronic Arts with EA Play.</p>



<p>Sega entering the subscription market might not be the move everyone had on their cards, but why shouldn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs free game and the market is wide open for such schemes right now.</p>



<p>Sega has been running since the 1960s, and in the 1990s, it really dominated the gaming industry. There are <strong>a lot </strong>of classic franchises sitting in that Sega library that would flesh out a subscription service quite nicely.</p>

<p>A reputable movie insider has said that more Indiana Jones games are in development.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs according to DanielRPK, who <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1870926309842473117?t=nxgc-3ez5wVn75-3JoS6Hg&amp;s=09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted</a>, ‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôre getting more Indy games.‚Äù</p>



<p>While there isn‚Äôt much to go on at face value, DanielRPK has had a knack for getting some tidbits from movies and games over the years, so his comment should suggest that some projects could have been greenlit behind the scenes.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, it‚Äôs only been two weeks since the Indiana Jones and The Great Circle released, so whether or not the game‚Äôs positive reception and/or sales led to more games being approved remains to be seen.</p>



<p>One thing is for sure, though ‚Äì if the games were approved recently, we‚Äôre likely several years away from seeing another released.</p>



<p>The game description for Indiana Jones and The Great Circle reads, ‚ÄúUncover one of history‚Äôs greatest mysteries in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle‚Ñ¢, a first-person, single-player adventure set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark‚Ñ¢ and The Last Crusade‚Ñ¢. Get ready to don your fedora and whip as you step into the shoes of the legendary archaeologist ‚Äî Indiana Jones‚Ñ¢. Embark on an epic globetrotting adventure in a race against enemy forces to uncover the secrets of the mysterious Great Circle.‚Äù</p>

<p>Fallout 4 has some fantastic factions that make up the backbone of the game itself ‚Äì without them, there would essentially be no story for the player to experience. However, there‚Äôs a point of contention within the community as to which Fallout 4 faction is ‚Äòthe best‚Äô. It‚Äôs mostly a subjective debate, but in this list, we‚Äôre seeing every major Fallout 4 faction ranked from worst to best. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ranking-fallout-4-s-factions">Ranking Fallout 4‚Äôs Factions</h2>



<p>Out of all the Fallout 4 factions, we‚Äôve zeroed in on the ‚Äòmain‚Äô groups that contribute the most to the story, so don‚Äôt be disappointed if your all-time favourite fringe faction doesn‚Äôt make the cut. Leave a comment stressing who you think should make the list and we‚Äôll consider adding it!</p>



<p>Here we go ‚Äì every major Fallout 4 faction, ranked <strong>from worst to best</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-railroad-worst">4. The Railroad (Worst)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Railroad might have some admirable goals in mind, but this basement-dwelling, secretive organisation that distrusts the player from the word ‚Äògo‚Äô is typically left standing in the nuclear dust in Fallout 4. They only care about helping synths, and that‚Äôs a huge sticking point for much of the Commonwealth. </p>



<p>There‚Äôs a sweet bonus in the ‚ÄòBallistic Fiber‚Äô mod you can unlock for siding with The Railroad, but it‚Äôs enough to save the faction.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-the-institute">3. The Institute</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Institute ‚Äì arguably the most important Fallout 4 faction because of where it fits into the story, but it‚Äôs called ‚ÄòThe Boogeyman of the Commonwealth‚Äô for a reason. It terrifies people, and some of the experiments it carries out are nothing short of abhorrent. With that being said, the whole ‚Äòpreservation of science and rebuilding the world‚Äô bit is positive and a huge redeemer for the faction.</p>



<p>There‚Äôs a huge amount of work needed in The Institute‚Äôs PR department, but the upkeep of a hyper-clean, flawless scientific facility some 200 years after the nuclear apocalypse is something that can‚Äôt be discredited.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Honourable Mention: Gunners</em></strong></h3>



<p><em>In Fallout 4, the Gunners are akin to the Raiders, but they‚Äôre more military-based in their appearance and how they operate, and they facilitate the backstory of one of the game‚Äôs best companions, MacCready. They often pair up with the likes of Assaultrons and bring the force of a well-trained unit to any fight.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-2-brotherhood-of-steel">2. Brotherhood of Steel</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Brotherhood of Steel is easily the most recognisable Fallout 4 faction ‚Äì it‚Äôs probably the most iconic faction from the franchise, period. In Fallout 4, the Brotherhood of Steel ‚Äòchapter‚Äô that arrives to shape up Boston is unfortunately quite bigoted and fascist-like in how it goes about its mission, but there‚Äôs something valiant about wanting to rid an entire region of mutated, cannibalistic, and intensely violent creatures, right?</p>



<p>As a special mention, it‚Äôs worth stressing that their arrival in the Commonwealth Wasteland is one of the most epic moments in Fallout history.</p>

<h3 id="h-honourable-mention-atom-cats"><em>Honourable Mention: Atom Cats</em></h3>



<p><em>No Fallout 4 faction is cooler than the Atom Cats. They‚Äôre a real live bunch, you dig? With their customised suits of power armour and their ‚ÄòGreased Lightning‚Äô vibe, they‚Äôre instantly likeable and probably way more chilled out than they should be, given their surroundings.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-1-minutemen-best">1. Minutemen (Best)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>As we see every major Fallout 4 faction ranked, we can‚Äôt help but list the Minutemen at the top of the pile. This selfless faction exists to unite settlements across the Wasteland, pulling together with community spirit and ensuring that everyone has a voice ‚Äì and a home. There‚Äôs no sinister sub-plot, no underlying regime ‚Äì it‚Äôs just regular folks trying to get by and share what they have with those that need it.</p>



<p>Out of every major Fallout 4 faction, the Minutemen are deserving of the top spot. They might not boast vertibirds or next-generation scientific technology, but they‚Äôre decent people, and they‚Äôre triers, and that‚Äôs all that matters. </p>
