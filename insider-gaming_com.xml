<p>It’s been a big year for Nintendo with the release of the Switch 2 and a host of games from some of the biggest IPs, giving you plenty of options when deciding which Nintendo Switch games to consider gifting this holiday season.</p>



<p>Below, Insider Gaming has highlighted some of the best Switch and Switch 3 games to gift in 2025, including major recent releases and must-haves from Nintendo’s extensive catalogue.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-nintendo-switch-games-to-gift">Best Nintendo Switch Games to Gift</h2>







<figure></figure>



<p>The newest entry in the long-standing Pokémon franchise, Legends: Z-A brings players back to Kalos’ Lumiose City and features the return of Mega Evolutions, including favorites from the past and new additions. With open-world exploration and real-time balance mechanics, Legends: Z-A breaks off from the standard Pokémon script, yet impresses as one of the best games in the franchise’s history.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mario Kart 8 seemed to go on forever, but, after many years of waiting, 2025 finally saw the arrival of Mario Kart World on Nintendo Switch 2. While it’s not available on the original Switch console, Mario Kart World is a must-have for any Switch 2 owner, providing plenty of enjoyment solo or against other players.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>After an extended stint in early access, Hades 2 fully released a 1.0 version this year and Switch players are the first to be able to jump in as the title is a timed console exclusive. The roguelike game is great to play on Switch, with the ability to play on the go, and the biggest challenge you’ll likely face is putting it down.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although now five years old, Animal Crossing: New Horizons continues to be a must-play title, standing as one of the best available on the Switch, and there’s even more content right around the corner. The big 3.0 update next year brings Switch 2 improvements to the game, but there’s also a bunch of new free additions for players across both generations of console.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another title that stands as a must-have for any Switch player, Tears of the Kingdom is widely regarded to be one of the greatest games of all time. There’s so much to do that you’ll lose hours and hours in the game, with a gripping story to complete and a near-endless amount of side quests and exploration to tick off.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros Ultimate</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though it celebrates a seventh birthday this year, and is likely due to be replaced by a successor in the coming years, Super Smash Bros Ultimate remains the best in show in the brawler scene, and has a stacked roster like no other. Unlocking everyone is quite an undertaking, but it’s worth it and provides a fun challenge to the single-player push.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>This two-in-one bundle has hours of entertainment through arguably the best Mario titles ever created, and the fact it’s at an affordable price makes it even more enticing. Super Mario Galaxy paved the way for the modern generation of titles and, while they may be old news by now, they’re worth picking up if you haven’t already.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it. On paper, PowerWash Simulator 2 may not sound like the most thrilling adventure, and you’d be right, but what it does offer is relaxing gameplay that hits the spot every time you boot it up. There’s nothing else quite as satisfying as finally finishing a big job in PowerWash Simulator 2, and it’s well worth trying out.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree is the latest instalment in the beloved franchise that has been testing friendships for generations, and it’s another must-have title for any Switch owner. With an array of mini games, plenty of boards to work through in matches, and unrivalled multiplayer, Super Mario Party Jamboree needs to be near the top of your wishlist.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Epic Games CEO recently commented on AI disclosure for game stores, stating it makes no sense as it will be involved in almost all future production. </p>



<p>The gaming industry has conflicting views about AI use in development at the moment. Some seem to be for it, with companies like Ubisoft pushing for full-scale AI-driven <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-ai-teammates-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research projects</a>. The Witcher 3 director also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about</a> AI in development, stating he doesn’t feel “that games created with only AI will have soul.” Now Tim Sweeney has shared his two cents on AI in game development and store disclosure. </p>







<h2 id="h-epic-games-ceo-says-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production">Epic Games CEO Says AI Will Be Involved in Nearly All Future Production</h2>



<p>The CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, recently responded to a comment on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that said Steam and other digital marketplaces “need to drop the ‘Made with AI’ label.” Sweeney said that he agrees with that comment, adding that the AI tag is “relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation.”</p>



<p>Sweeney added that AI disclosure “makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.” When another user spoke about customers deserving to know, Sweeney poked fun at those statements, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993890431462166818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stating</a>, “Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses. Customers deserve to know lol.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses.

<p>Talking about AI in game development, Activision was recently under fire by the community for using generative AI <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to create their calling cards</a> for Black Ops 7. The controversy received so much attention that it prompted a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response from US Congressman Ro Khanna</a>. He stated that “we need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits.”</p>

<p>The Pokémon TCG has seen a popularity boom once again in 2025, making products harder and harder to source, but there are some Black Friday deals to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Pokémon has moved the TCG into the Mega Evolution era, following the return of Mega Evolution Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which is expected to remain until the release of Gen 10, expected later next year. </p>



<p>Sets continue to come out thick and fast, but, with the first line of Ascended Heroes products not landing until the end of January, there’s a bit of breathing room to take a look at the best Black Friday deals available—and don’t forget to look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s other holiday guides</a>.</p>

<p>Finding Pokémon products in stock has been a struggle for collectors this year, and will likely remain the case over the Black Friday and holiday season. There are, however, some deals out there to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Admittedly, products don’t seem to be available at MSRP, even on places like Amazon, but there are some savings available. If you’re particularly after packs to rip, there are several options available, and, for the bigger collectors seeking a larger prize piece, the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection is worth pulling the trigger on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>CD Projekt Red has told fans not to expect any new showcases of The Witcher 4 during The Game Awards next month, despite being nominated for an award.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 faces stiff competition with the likes of Marvel’s Wolverine and Grand Theft Auto 6 to be crowned the Most Anticipated Game at the 2025 awards show, but no matter the outcome, there won’t be any Witcher 4 reveals.</p>







<h2 id="h-witcher-4-skipping-the-game-awards">Witcher 4 Skipping The Game Awards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No show. Image via CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure>



<p>Joint-CEO of CD Projekt Red, Michal Norwakowski, <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter</a> to thank fans who have voted for Witcher 4 in the running for the award, but stated the team won’t be bringing any new content this year.</p>



<p>The post read: “I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards. Thanks to everyone who has already voted – your support means a lot to us.</p>



<p>“We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.”</p>



<p>The first trailer for The Witcher 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-witcher-4-trailer-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted at The Game Awards last year</a>, while the latest sneak peek behind the scenes came in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-gameplay-revealed-at-state-of-unreal-tech-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Unreal showcase</a> this summer. </p>



<p>A significant amount of hires have been made by the studio, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/60-developers-join-cd-projekt-red-for-witcher-4-cyberpunk-2-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 60 joining back in August</a>, and the latest major acquisition came earlier this month with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hiring of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s lead gameplay designer</a>.</p>



<p>The title is the long-awaited sequel to the critically acclaimed The Witcher 3, which was initially released in 2015. However, no release window has been announced yet for the title.</p>

            <guid>1366507</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The holiday season is upon us, and sales are starting to hit the entire gaming hobby, including a huge price drop for Battlefield 6 just in time for Black Friday.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is one of the biggest titles to release this year, achieving critical acclaim, and even more content is on the horizon with seasonal content. If you’ve not yet jumped in and purchased the title, this is the best opportunity to do so.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-half-price-on-playstation-5">Battlefield 6 Half-Price on PlayStation 5</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cut price. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Amazon has slashed the price of <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-ps-5-amazon-us/">Battlefield 6</a></strong> on PlayStation 5 to just $35, half the price of the launch cost and a whopping drop on the previous low price found earlier in the week.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for players on Xbox Series X|S and PC, the cut-price sale of Battlefield 6 on Amazon only applies to the PS5 version, but it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for similar price drops over the Black Friday weekend.</p>



<p>Stock is likely to be limited, however, so if you’re sat on the fence about picking up Battlefield 6, it’s best to act fast, otherwise, you’ll likely regret it.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has plenty to offer and, while the single-player campaign is fun at times, nothing beats multiplayer in the title, with combat on the ground and in the air. That’s not it, though, as datamines have previously revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naval warfare content is already in development</a>, having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-teases-naval-warfare-is-coming-to-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously been teased by EA</a>.</p>



<p>Season 1 in Battlefield 6 kicked off on October 28, launching the REDSEC Battle Royale mode, which is free to play, new maps, new game modes, and new weapons.</p>



<p>The season is expected to close towards the end of January, expected around the 20th, with more additional content then being brought to the game in Season 2 and beyond.</p>

Creatures Of Sonaria is a popular survival RPG experience on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-letter-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> where players take on the roles of various mythical beings. Although many Roblox games tend to be quite basic and generic in their gameplay, Creatures Of Sonaria is a welcome change to that frustrating trend. With a highly immersive world full of secrets to explore, this game has something for every kind of player.&nbsp;</p>







<p>To start, the Creatures Of Sonaria map is absolutely massive, featuring various terrains and atmospheres. Simply exploring every nook and cranny of the map will take players plenty of time. Another element of the game that makes it highly immersive is the fact that there are over 300 playable creatures. Not only that, but each of these beings also has its own individual abilities and unique traits, making the gameplay experience highly customizable. There’s also a solid Gacha system in the game, which players can use to get new and powerful beasts.&nbsp;</p>
