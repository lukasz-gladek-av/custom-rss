<p>The Game Awards 2024 was raised in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the showcase. It was an ambitious event all around, and many viewers rated it higher than any iteration in history. Collectively, we saw dozens of awards handed out (which not everyone agreed with, admittedly) and many games either revealed or updated with new trailers.</p>



<p>It has been revealed in data collected by Streams Charts that this year’s The Game Awards was the most-watched edition ever, topping more than <strong>four million </strong>concurrent viewers. The growth was aided by co-streamers and watch parties, which are fast becoming some of the most entertaining ways to watch streams online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bigger-than-ever">Bigger Than Ever</h2>



<p>The Game Awards played host to some massive announcements and trailers, such as The Witcher 4, Naughty Dog’s new game, a new Virtua Fighter, and Mafia: The Old Country.</p>



<p>It was potentially the most electric edition of The Game Awards we’ve ever seen, and Geoff Keighley’s team spared no expense in piecing together an all-singing, all-dancing event featuring a star-studded lineup of guests.</p>



<p>In a report published <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/game-awards-2024-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Streams Charts</a>, it was revealed that The Game Awards (across top channels) racked up a combined peak concurrent viewership of 4,003,578 users. It had a total watched hours count of 15,267,555, and 1,498 channels were logged broadcasting the event in some way.</p>



<p>In total, The Game Awards was on air for just south of five hours, and while the top channels for the broadcast were the official ones, the likes of IGN, Asmongold, and Moist Cr1TiKaL pulled in massive audiences while reacting to the showcase.</p>



<p>How did you rate this year’s The Game Awards? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-cdl-skins-coming-to-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On November 12, Activision revealed the full line-up of CDL skins, but fans worldwide are <strong>still waiting </strong>for them to be delivered in Black Ops 6. While this year’s CDL skins aren’t as gaudy or ‘interesting’ as they have been in recent years, fans are still eager to represent their favourite CDL teams in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>With that being said, when <strong>are </strong>the CDL skins coming to Black Ops 6, and how much will they cost when they arrive?</p>



<p>Read on to find out what we know.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cdl-skins-release-date-in-black-ops-6">CDL Skins Release Date in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed by Activision when the CDL skins will be released in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>If we use last season’s release schedule as a representative example, we can determine that it might still be a couple of weeks until they arrive.</p>



<p>Last season, the action commenced on December 8, 2023, and the MWIII CDL skins were released on January 8, 2024. </p>



<p>The current season started on December 6, so it could be the first week of January that the team skins arrive once again. It was mentioned that it would be ‘later in season one’ that the CDL skins would drop, and that’s more or less where we are now that the ‘Season One Reloaded’ update has arrived.</p>



<p>If you’re holding out to know when the CDL skins are coming to Black Ops 6, take note – it could be another few weeks.</p>



<p>Which skin will you be purchasing once they’ve dropped? There isn’t much variation between the various CDL skins this year, but it’s still nice to see the teams represented, and of course, the organisations benefit from the sale of the skins.</p>



<p>On that note, how much do the CDL skins cost?</p>



<p>Typically, a CDL skin pack – which comes with the base skin, weapon camos, stickers, emblems, and calling cards, retails in the COD store for around $11.99. They can’t be purchased with COD Points – only real-world money.</p>



<p>Let us know which team you’re representing in Black Ops 6 when the CDL skin packs drop.</p>

<p>TSM has announced the benching or dismissal of its Danish Counter-Strike 2 roster ahead of the 2025 season. In a post on social media, the organisation revealed an intention to ‘evaluate roster moves’ before the next year of competitive events kicks off.</p>



<p>To that end, Valde, niko, and Rejin (coach) have all been let go, while sirah, acoR, and Zyphon have been benched pending further decisions. The players aren’t sitting around and waiting, though – acoR has already taken to socials to announce his decision to seek a new team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-is-what-it-is">‘It Is What It Is’</h2>



<p>Speaking on social media about the sudden decision, Frederik ‘acoR’ Gyldstrand wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We didn’t get the players that were planned when I joined the team which did make the start feel weird.</p>



<p>We had a decent period i nthe start, we managed to make the RMR with no time to practice.</p>



<p>After the benching of Altekz it took a long time to get back on track with sirah. Though it did feel like we were getting back on track in the end, but <strong>it is what it is</strong>.</p>



<p>I am looking for a new team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was just a few days ago that TSM brought to an end the all-female CS2 team, TSM Impact. However, it’s worth stressing that this is a different scenario, as TSM intends to stay in the CS2 scene with a male team, but it’s not yet known what that squad will look like when the 2025 season opens up.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/tsmreport/status/1867990639188791782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TSM simply wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today we part ways with Valde, niko, and a CS Head Coach Rejin. We would like to thank them for their hard work throughout the year, and wish them all the best going forward.</p>



<p>We have also opted to bench sirah acoR, and Zyphon while we evaluate our next roster moves ahead of the 2025 season.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What do you think the future of TSM looks like in Counter-Strike? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/m0nesy-g2-eliminated-faze-shanghai/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/m0nesy-g2-eliminated-faze-shanghai/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>G2 Esports has officially been eliminated by FaZe Clan at the Perfect World Shanghai Major. Tomorrow, FaZe Clan will face off against a dominant Team Spirit, and it could be a day that makes history, with $500,000 sitting on the line for the grand victor.</p>



<p>It has been a whirlwind tournament thus far, and many competitors have gone home with their heads hung in disappointment. One player who felt the blow this weekend was G2’s Ilya ‘m0NESY’ Osipov, who parted ways with a message of sore emotions following his loss.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-faze-clan-vs-spirit-for-it-all">FaZe Clan vs. Spirit For It All</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan wiped out G2 with a 2 – 0 win in Shanghai to qualify for the grand final against Team Spirit.</p>



<p>It was a wash on the first map, but G2 showed up a little tighter in the second round – but it wasn’t enough, unfortunately. In a slick finish, FaZe Clan’s Robin ‘ropz’ Kool came out to play, racking up 50 kills across the two maps and cementing himself as one to watch in the grand final.</p>



<p>M0NESY took it hard, though, taking to social media to write:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t find the words to describe my feelings. I’m very angry with myself, forgive me for my terrible performance this month. This is the end and the beginning of something new.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everyone wants to see if Team Spirit’s donk will have what it takes to achieve the incredible and win a CS2 Major during his rookie season. It has been a phenomenal year for the young star thus far, and securing the top spot in Shanghai would be a fantastic way to close out 2024.</p>



<p>He’s not alone in those aspirations, though. On FaZe Clan’s side, David ‘frozen’ Čerňanský is also seeking his first Major win.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan might be coming in hot off a win, but this year has been a tough one for the squad against Team Spirit. In terms of head-to-head, Team Spirit has managed to overcome FaZe Clan three times in the last 12 months.</p>



<p>If I was a betting man, my money would be on Team Spirit to secure the Major win.</p>

<p>Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky and Hunter Grooms went on a worldwide saga this year, travelling around the planet and attending some of the most prestigious events in the realms of gaming and esports. From the first EWC in Saudi Arabia to the Six Invitational in Sao Paolo, the pair truly put the ‘world’ in Gaming World Media.</p>



<p>Here’s a breakdown of their favourite favourite gaming events from 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gwm-s-favourite-events-from-2024">GWM’s Favourite Events From 2024</h2>



<p>It was a remarkably busy year for the Gaming World Tour – but these events represent the best of the best.</p>



<h3 id="h-g-star-korea">G-STAR (Korea)</h3>



<p><em>G-STAR was our first event in Korea. It was incredibly opening to just how prevalent gaming culture is there. Not only did we get to enjoy the convention that was stacked with game devs, but we also had the opportunity to talk to some of our biggest names like Jang Wonyoung and Kim Yeji.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-six-invitational-brazil">Six Invitational (Brazil)</h3>



<p><em>This event likely had one of the best esports environments we will ever witness. The arena in Sao Paolo was full of energy with fans bringing in flags and drums, and the final matchup included two twin brothers, both from Brazil, on opposing teams.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia">Esports World Cup (Saudi Arabia)</h3>



<p><em>The Esports World Cup was one of the events we were able to get the most up close and personal with, meeting competitors from both Warzone and League of Legends. For Warzone, we were able to organise interviews with competitors like JoeWo, Breadman, and Jukeyz, as well as getting to see the Falcons dominate and entertain with some trash talk.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-evo-united-states">EVO (United States)</h3>



<p><em>This was the first EVO we attended, and it didn’t disappoint. EVO is run in a really interesting way that encourages a bit more of the ‘roots’ of esports, where you have people crowding around random tables on the floor to watch as people compete, and it eventually builds up to a massive crowd watching the main stage. We were able to see Punk, Nitro, and SonicFox take home big, passionate wins.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-thunderpick-world-championship-germany">Thunderpick World Championship (Germany)</h3>



<p><em>The Thunderpick World Championship was hosted on an incredibly small scale, boiler room-esque venue. We witnessed The MongolZ take home the win alongside a crowd that absolutely favoured them and wasn’t afraid to show it.</em></p>



<p>What was your favourite esports or gaming event of 2024? For me, it was Gamescom in Cologne. This year marked my first attendance of the event and it was mind-blowing in every respect.</p>

<p>Following a stunning run in Shanghai that saw Team Spirit eliminate both Liquid and MOUZ, the squad has secured a prestigious place in the tournament’s grand final. The team will be joined by either FaZe Clan or G2 Esports once the remaining semi-final fixture wraps up in just a couple of hours.</p>



<p>It has been a stellar run thus far for Team Spirit, and the squad has contributed to some of the most-viewed matches in the tournament until now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-to-play-for">Everything To Play For</h2>



<p>The Perfect World Shanghai Major has a $500,000 grand prize waiting for the victor, and at this point, it could be Team Spirit, FaZe Clan, or G2 Esports that lifts the trophy. It has been a relatively close-matched event thus far, and some players are appreciative of the challenge.</p>



<p>For instance, FaZe Clan’s <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40552/karrigan-i-want-vitality-g2-and-spirit-why-not-make-it-the-hardest-major-playoff-run-ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Karrigan</a> – one of the most storied competitors in CS history – set out a path ahead of him and his team that many would fear:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I want Vitality. I want G2 in the semis, and I want Spirit in the final. That’s three teams we normally haven’t beaten the whole year, why not make it the hardest Major playoff run ever? I’m down for that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Team Spirit’s qualification into the grand final wasn’t easy going for the squad. MOUZ put up a solid fight, particularly in the opening round on Nuke. This map saw Spirit’s prodigy, donk, secure his second-worst performance of the year, emerging with a rating of just 0.36 and a KD of 6 – 17.</p>



<p>The team regained, of course – and now they sit poised to secure the biggest single prize they’ve ever nabbed in Counter-Strike esports.</p>



<p>How do you think the grand final will unfold? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/huke-optic-kenny-pickup-cdl/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-perfect-player-for-us%E2%80%99-optic-kenny-talks-about-huke%E2%80%99s-sudden-cdl-pickup.1061601/</guid>

<p>In recent days, the Call of Duty League scene has been up in arms about the widely debated sudden ‘dismissal’ of Pred from OpTic Texas. The rumours circulated like wildfire after the Australian pro player was removed from OpTic Texas’ starting roster and Cuyler ‘Huke’ Garland was picked up.</p>



<p>Last night, Huke debuted (again) with OpTic, going face-to-face with Vancouver Surge, his old team, and promptly impressing fans everywhere with how quickly he gelled with the team. In some ways, it was a homecoming for Huke – but some OpTic Texas fans are still displeased with how Pred is being treated in the wake of his removal.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-can-do-whatever-we-want">‘We Can Do Whatever We Want’</h2>



<p>In a post-match interview, OpTic’s Kenny, a two-time world champion, explained why Huke was such a solid pickup following the team’s win over Vancouver Surge:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think Cuyler (Huke) was the perfect player for us.</p>



<p>We can do whatever we want because our pacing is just so fast.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Huke’s dominance was displayed perfectly during the fixture against Vancouver Surge. It wasn’t a close match-up by any means, with OpTic Texas losing the opening Hardpoint and then proceeding to wipe the floor with Surge at every given opportunity, starting with a 6 – 1 scoreline in Search.</p>



<p>Like Shotzzy, Huke has insane movement capabilities, and Black Ops 6’s Omnimovement mechanics have only served to heighten those in-game talents.</p>



<p>Of course, if Vancouver Surge had beaten OpTic Texas following the Huke pickup, fans in the Green Wall would have been singing a very different tune. Regardless of the circumstances, it would have been nothing but slander and accusations against the squad for dropping Pred.</p>



<p>Do you think grabbing Huke was a good move for OpTic Texas? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
