            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-copilot-for-gaming-announced-as-the-%E2%80%9Cultimate-gaming-sidekick%E2%80%9D.1133577/</guid>

<p>Microsoft has unveiled Xbox Copilot for Gaming, a new tool aimed towards being a the “ultimate gaming sidekick” for players. </p>



<p>In an appearance on the official Xbox Podcast, Xbox Corporate Vice President of Gaming AI Fatima Kardar unveiled the AI-powered tool to the world. The announcement also included a detailed post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>



<p>“This AI-driven sidekick is designed to be your personalized gaming companion, helping you get to your favorite games faster, coaching you to improve your skills, and connecting you better with your friends and communities,” Jeff Rubenstein, director of Xbox editorial, said. “Copilot for Gaming will be there when you need it but out of the way if you don’t.”</p>



<p>During the podcast, an concept example of how the new tool could work was shown using Minecraft.  In the game a player picked up wood and entered a prompt asking “Okay, I’ve got some wood. What do I do with that?” Copilot for Gaming answered by explaining how to turn the gathered oak logs into wooden planks.</p>



<p>Another example shown involved Overwatch. A player asks the tool for help on who to pick after the hero they wanted, Echo, was already selected.</p>

<p>“Echo’s taken, but Cassidy would be a solid pick with this team,” Copilot says. “His mid-range hit scan and Mercy’s damage boost will work great on Ilios Ruins. Plus you’ve done great with him on this map before.” </p>



<p>After the player dies during the game, Copilot explains that it happened because they stayed in the fight for too long and suggested to regroup with their team the next time they are in a similar situation.</p>



<p>The tool will even let you pull up situation-specific advice for the game and moment you are in, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>Everything shown during the podcast were proof of concepts and not actual gameplay uses. As far as a release date, Copilot for Gaming will start in a slow rollout on mobile devices for members of the Xbox Insider Program “soon”. A release on other devices and then to the general public will happen “gradually”.</p>

<p>The First Berserker Khazan looks as beastly as the creatures that inhabit the game. But it could be bad news for Khazan’s PC specs and various system requirements. Let’s take a look and see if it’s as powerful as it looks.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t be a year in gaming without one or two AAA titles fighting for the Soulslike crown. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is looking to challenge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> in 2025. The latter is established, but Khazan looks promising. Featuring a story of revenge and retribution, The First Berserker Khazan has a clear-cut and combat-heavy tale to tell.</p>



<p>It’s a huge step forward for developer Neople, and I’m here to reveal whether Khazan’s system requirements will trouble your hardware.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-minimum-requirements-on-pc">The First Berserker Khazan Minimum Requirements on PC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>With great power comes great specs and requirements. Credit to NEXON</figcaption></figure>



<p>The minimum PC specs are probably what you need to consider if you crave more souslike action and don’t care how it looks. It also goes without saying this only applies to PC players. You need to remember Khazan’s trailer and gameplay footage has likely been rendered with the highest-possible settings.</p>



<p><a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a> may not look as pretty using minimum PC requirements, but it’s better than nothing. Here’s every minimum spec and what you need to be able to play it.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Minimum PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 64bit 22H2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 3 1200 / Intel Core i3-6300</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">Arc A580 / GeForce GTX 970 / Radeon RX 580</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">12 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">70 GB</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-recommended-requirements-on-pc">The First Berserker Khazan Recommended Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>The minimum settings are quite generous. I think most (if not all) players should have no problem running The First Berserker Khazan. They should also be able to make it pop—even with inferior gear. But if you have an impressive rig running a lot of juice, you’re probably here for the recommended specs.</p>



<p>Here’s each setting and what it would be handy to have to ensure Khazan is smoother than a hot knife through butter.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Recommended PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Recommended Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 11 21H2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 5 3600 / Intel Core i7-6700K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">Arc A750 / GeForce RTX 2070 / Radeon RX 5700XT</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">70 GB</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
