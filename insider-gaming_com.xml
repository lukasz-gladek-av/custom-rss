<p>New claims have hit the internet that the Marvel Rivals developers are adding fake heroes within its game files to confuse and catch leakers, or are they?</p>



<p>The discussion first appeared on the Marvel Rivals Leak discord channel, where data miner and leaker Keone posted that NetEase is likely adding fake heroes to the game in order to confuse data miners.</p>



<p>“Hello everyone, it has come to our attention that the devs have set up characters to catch leakers, not only the ones in the code – but potentially insider sources, too. Kang will probably explain this more as we go on, but here is the current list as far as we can figure out,” Keone explained. He then posted a picture of the characters which he believes will not be coming to the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-fake-heroes-being-planted-in-marvel-rivals">Are There Fake Heroes Being Planted in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>But the story doesn’t quite end there, as X0X Leaking Team member&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zvis_ceral</a>, who is also a dataminer stepped in to elaborate. </p>



<p>“This is not a 100% confirmation that they are all coming or when they will come. This is just to show off that these actually exist,” he said. He continued with a thread of heroes and code:</p>



<div><article><p><span>This is not a 100% confirmations that they are all coming or when they will come. 
This is just to show off that these actually exist. 🧵

All Hero tags can be found in: Marvel/Content/Marvel/Data/DataTable/MarvelHeroTable

Ability Tables are to long to fit the screenshot, will… </span></p></article></div>



<p>While it would be uncommon but plausible for developers to add fake code to their games to catch leakers intentionally, it doesn’t quite make sense as to why they would. After all, the “real” heroes that are making their way to the game would still have to be in the code and would be leaked before their official announcement anyway.</p>



<p>While I don’t consider myself a tech guru when it comes to datamining, to me, it seems like this is all just code related to game development and not necessarily some huge plan from the developers to screw over leakers. All the game code tells us (and is the case for all game leaks that come via game code) is that certain things were in development and planned at one point or another. Whether they release or not is unclear unless the code specifically says.</p>

<p>So, are Marvel Rivals planting fake heroes? I don’t think so. Personally, I think people have misinterpreted the game code and what it means in some way.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Marvel Rivals leaks? Do you think some have been fake-planted? </p>
