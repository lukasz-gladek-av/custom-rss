<p>During today’s earnings call, Sony revealed that the PS5 has sold over 75 units in its lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During Sony’s <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a> today, the gaming and network services segment was the highlight of the show. PS5 crossed the 75 million milestone by selling 9.5 million units in Q4. PlayStation Networks’ monthly active users were up, too, increasing from 118 million in FY23 Q3 to 129 million in FY24 Q3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s not all; PS5 and PS4 topped 95.9 million units sold in software, gaining a 6.2 million increase from last year’s 89.7 million. During this time, 11.6 million units of first-party games were sold, which decreased from 12.3 million last year. Moreover, out of the 95.9 million, 74% were full-game digital software downloads, down from last year’s 77%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to PlayStation 5’s growing sales, the current-generation console is just 1.5 million units behind the PS4 in outselling it during the same period. The console manufacturer believes that this number will only increase with the release of first-party games like Ghost of Yotei and third-party games like GTA 6.&nbsp;</p>
