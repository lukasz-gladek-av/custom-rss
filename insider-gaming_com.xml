<p>A new FAQ from Playground Games has revealed that to play Forza Horizon 5 on the PlayStation 5, players will need a Microsoft account.</p>



<p>The news, which has started to be picked up online (thanks <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/03/08/a-microsoft-account-will-be-required-to-play-forza-horizon-5-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XboxEra</a>), shows in the <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/03/08/a-microsoft-account-will-be-required-to-play-forza-horizon-5-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> that the upcoming port will require a Microsoft account.</p>



<p>It reads, ‚ÄúQ: Do I need a Microsoft account to play Forza Horizon 5 on PlayStation 5?‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúAnswer: A: Yes, in addition to a PSN account you‚Äôll need to link to a Microsoft account in order to play Forza Horizon 5 on PS5. This process begins the first time you start up the game on your console.‚Äù</p>



<p>This isn‚Äôt the first time that an Xbox game coming to the PlayStation 5 has required an account, though, so this isn‚Äôt new. A Microsoft account is needed for the likes of Sea of Thieves and similarly, even for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 version of Minecraft.</p>



<p>So fear not, this isn‚Äôt a new requirement just for Forza Horizon. However, we have contacted Xbox in the hopes to receive comment to clear the air just in case this was a mistake. Should clarification be given, we‚Äôll update the article.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 5 is set to release for the PlayStation 5 on April 25, 2025.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up Forza Horizon 5 for the PS5? Let us know down below, and in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was released little more than a month ago, storming up the charts and becoming known far and wide as a contender for many Game of the Year awards. It stunned players with its depth, visual splendour, and intense realism, and with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense roadmap ahead</a>, the game has plenty of life left in its medieval lungs.</p>



<p>Since Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 hit the market, one of the game‚Äôs most prolific actors, Luke ‚ÄòLordHansCapon‚Äô Dale, has positively exploded. He has become a superstar streamer in a matter of weeks, pulling in and retaining an audience and securing solid accolades in no time at all.</p>

<h2 id="h-content-fit-for-a-lord">Content Fit for a Lord</h2>



<p>Luke Dale portrays Hans Capon in the Kingdom Come universe, and he‚Äôs front and centre as the game kicks off, with many of the second title‚Äôs most pivotal moments revolving around his existence. In the first game, which dropped back in 2018, he was someone to be hated, but in KCD2, he‚Äôs a lovable rogue who you‚Äôll go to great lengths to keep safe.</p>



<p>In the days that followed the launch of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on February 4, Dale kickstarted a streaming campaign that saw his popularity levels skyrocket across Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>In January 2025, the talented actor streamed the first Kingdom Come title in anticipation of the follow-up, netting a peak viewer count of around 350 viewers. Little more than two weeks later, he was picking up peak figures of 20,000 viewers. In one post on social media, Dale revealed he was in the 0.01% of streamers on Twitch by numbers alone.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Dang. I‚Äôm in the top 0.01% of streamers in the world ü´∂ 

Shall we get to number 1? </span><a href="https://twitter.com/KaiCenat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KaiCenat</a><span> I‚Äôm coming for you bro üëä </span></p></article></div>







<p>It didn‚Äôt end there, though.</p>



<p>Luke Dale, who went so far as to get a Kingdom Come tattoo while live, went from 32,000 subscribers on YouTube when the game dropped to 102,000 subscribers at the time of writing. He racked up 15,000 followers on Twitch in around two weeks and managed to secure a Twitch Partner spot after streaming Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 just <strong>eight times</strong>.</p>



<p>Before 2025, he‚Äôd streamed just three times, <a href="https://streamscharts.com/channels/lordhanscapon/streams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to StreamsCharts</a>. That‚Äôs one hell of a hot streak.</p>



<p>It helps that Dale is genuinely a nice guy with a penchant for performing, and his role as Hans Capon in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is fantastic and bursting with clippable, quality sequences.</p>



<p>If you want to follow Luke Dale‚Äôs latest streams, you can find him on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LordHansCapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lordhanscapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a>.</p>
