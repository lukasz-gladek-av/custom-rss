<p>The 2024 PlayStation retrospective is now available, allowing PS4 and PS5 owners to check their stats throughout the year.</p>



<p>Since the feature was introduced, it has been widely anticipated by fans because of its social contagion. In this day and age, who doesn’t like to brag on social media, right?</p>



<p>The initiative allows players to see the hours played, the number of trophies obtained, the most played games of each month and other details. To celebrate the occasion, PlayStation is also releasing an avatar code that appears on the screen at the end of your retrospective.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://wrapup.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2024 PlayStation Wrap-Up</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>An interesting feature is that the retrospective also serves to determine the player’s preferred style. If you’ve played a lot of RPGs or JRPGs, you’ll be categorized as a Role Player, for example.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the site is overloaded. The situation should normalize over the course of the day when the number of simultaneous accesses begins to drop.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of the use of the algorithm, the Wrap-Up also indicates a selection of PS Plus games that are ideal for the player based on the titles they have tried throughout the year.</p>

<p>At the Perfect World Shanghai Major, a Mongolian Counter-Strike 2 team is doing the unthinkable. The MongolZ have accomplished a feat that no other team from the Asia region has ever done before, in a manner that no team in the world has done in more than half a decade.</p>



<p>Just a few weeks prior, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mongolz-wins-thunderpick-world-championship/">The MongolZ claimed their largest prize pool winnings ever</a> at the Thunderpick World Championship. But something even more unimaginable is still possible for them.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-job-s-not-done">Job’s Not Done</h2>



<p>By qualifying for the playoffs of the Perfect World Shanghai Major, The MongolZ became the first Asian Counter-Strike team to do so in Major history. Dating back to 2013, the playoff field has always been dominated by European teams, with one or two North and South American teams sneaking in regularly. Asian teams typically compete alongside Oceanic teams in Major qualifiers, but in the rare occasions were an Asia-Pacific team reaches playoffs, it’s always been an Australian roster until now.</p>



<p>The fashion in which The MongolZ reached the playoffs is also a historical feat. The Major utilizes two 16-team Swiss stages to determine who goes to playoffs. The MongolZ went 3-0 in both the Opening Stage and the Elimination Stage, beating the likes of Heroic, GamerLegion, MOUZ, and G2 Esports. The last time a team went 3-0 in two Swiss Stages at the same Major was at the FACEIT London Major in 2018, when Team Liquid accomplished that feat. G2 did it as well at the ELEAGUE Boston Major prior, which was the first Major to utilize the two Swiss stages.</p>



<p>Fittingly, The MongolZ made playoffs at the first Counter-Strike Major to be held in Asia. The team’s 19-year-old rising star Sodbayar “⁠Techno⁠” Munkhbold <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40498/techno-on-playing-in-front-of-the-asian-crowd-its-a-big-advantage-for-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said the crowd has been “a big advantage”</a> for the team. That advantage should increase as the event transitions over to the larger Shanghai Oriental Sports Center for playoffs.</p>



<p>Do you have The MongolZ going all the way in your pick ‘ems? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-2-focuses-on-customization-and-expressing-yourself/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>CD Projekt Red has announced full details for Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2. Releasing Today (December 10), Update 2.2 is known as the “Express Yourself” patch that adds a number of capabilities for players in areas such as car customization, photo mode, and character creator. </p>



<p>The update is available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Starting with car customization, players will now be able  to update more cars with more colors and designs. There’s also a new “Twintone” feature that allows players to scan any car in the world, and transfer the scheme and color over to their own vehicle. Lastly, in regard to vehicles, Johnny Silverhand can now be a passenger in  your car.</p>



<p>With Photo mode, the developers have added a number of new options for players including a new drone mode that allows for more range and movement when setting up a photo. There are also new lighting updates along with the ability to add up to three NPCs to  your photo. Once you’re happy with your pictures, you can hang them in your apartment or upload them to a gallery for other players to see.</p>



<p>The game’s character creator has been updated to include over 100 new assets as well as a complete character randomizer. There were also updates that the team didn’t want to talk about during the reveal stream. </p>



<p>The full patch notes are available via <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/update-2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While players will no doubt be a bit disappointed to not get any PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements or a New Game+, the additional customization features should breath some extra life into the four-year-old game. </p>



<p>With Update 2.2, CD Projekt Red didn’t confirm that this will be the final update for Cyberpunk 2077. They did say that that “maybe” there would be another surprise or two in the future. However, as the team puts the focus on the game’s sequel Project Orion, it could be assumed that time working on the first game is winding down. </p>



<p>Speaking of the game’s sequel, the game likely won’t arrive until after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-production-cd-projekt-red-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next installment of The Witcher</a>, currently known as Project Polaris.</p>
