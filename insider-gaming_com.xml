<p>When Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024, it was penned as being ‘an intense tactical FPS’ with some extraction elements mixed in. In the months that followed, changes were deployed, and updates were rolled out, evolving the game immeasurably in its first year on the market.</p>



<p>I’ve caught up with the developers at MADFINGER Games on multiple occasions, and during my most recent chat with the team, I learned that they’re now perfectly happy to call Gray Zone Warfare an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>But it’s more than that – it’s the <strong>world’s first open-world extraction shooter</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-evolutionary-year">An Evolutionary Year</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare has <strong>stacks </strong>planned for the year ahead. The developers have worked tirelessly with the community to introduce a long line of changes and upgrades to improve the senses of immersion, challenge, and engagement in the fictional world of Lamang.</p>



<p>It might have blown by the average fan, but Gray Zone Warfare’s core description on Steam was updated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/">at the end of 2024</a> to reflect the new attitude towards the game. It went from being described as an intense tactical FPS to being dubbed an open-world extraction shooter emphasising realism.</p>



<p>That was the first indication of MADFINGER’s pivot, but my recent chat with Rick Lagnese, the PR and Communications Director at the firm, set the story straight. The developer is now on board with being branded an extraction shooter, and it’s now striving to redefine what that tag means.</p>



<p>That’s something that I learned first-hand <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when I spoke to Marek Rabas</a>, MADFINGER’s CEO, at Gamescom 2024. </p>



<p>In recent years, we’ve seen plenty of extraction shooters emerge and then fall flat. Some have been extinguished after mere weeks on the market, but Gray Zone Warfare has continued to innovate and exceed expectations after almost a year. There’s a dedicated community supporting the ongoing evolution of the game, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-roadmap-revealed/">the roadmap</a> is looking <strong>tasty</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve not played Gray Zone Warfare and you’re a fan of extraction shooters, now is the time to get on board. There are major changes lined up that are set to challenge the existing paradigm and alter the gameplay loop.</p>



<p>I’ll have all the latest for you in the coming days.</p>

<p>The Finals burst onto the scene with its unique blend of map destruction, arcade-like gameplay, and blaring sounds and visuals, but let’s look at The Finals’ player count in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s so hard for new shooters in the live-service online multiplayer sphere to stand out. Call of Duty rules the roost, and the likes of Marvel Rivals, Fortnite, and Overwatch own large market share segments. So it was quite the feat for The Finals when it arrived in 2023 to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge acclaim and hefty player numbers</a>. This was despite reservations and emerging details of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-use-of-ai-isnt-going-away-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI use in The Finals</a>.</p>



<p>The first few weeks of a hyped multiplayer title are usually the best. Everyone checks in to see what it’s about, how it plays, and numbers eventually dwindle. So we’re here to analyze The Finals’ player count numbers to see how it’s faring.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-finals-player-count-in-2025">The Finals Player Count in 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a scene. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Using Steam Charts, we can see February 2025 had an average of 11,760 players in The Finals—reaching a peak of 19,499 users.</strong></p>



<p>The first thing to note about The Finals player count numbers is <strong>this doesn’t factor in PlayStation or Xbox users</strong>. There’s no reliable piece of software capable of telling us this data, and it’s been this way for years. It’s baffling—given this age of technology—but this is the reality.</p>



<p>Any official figures come from <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2073850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Finals’ Steam Charts page</a>, and this has the game’s monthly figures going back to its December 2023 launch. The Finals achieved its <strong>all-time peak of 242,399 players</strong> during its debut month. Compared to its most recent month (as of writing), its <strong>recent monthly peaks are nearly 90% down since launch</strong>.</p>



<p>It took just two months for The Finals player count numbers to see a huge drop-off. From December 2023 to February 2024, the shooter went from <strong>120,211 players on averag</strong>e to <strong>24,848</strong>. </p>



<p>March 2024 saw an average of <strong>21,712</strong> in-game users, and the monthly average has <strong>never gotten back over 20K</strong>.</p>



<p>This makes it all sound negative, but for a relatively new shooter in a feisty market, it’s doing well. The last few months have seen a <strong>peak</strong> of nearly 20,00 players or more, and it continues to tick along. Remember, this doesn’t include PlayStation or Xbox figures, meaning there’s still a fair few thousands logging in each month.</p>



<p>The start of 2025 has been slightly worrying though. <strong>The Finals has dipped below 12K</strong>, and continues to dwindle month by month. With more seasons and content on the way, these figures should receive a new boost every so often.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-finals-worth-playing-in-2025">Is The Finals Worth Playing in 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>The Finals’ gameplay and nuances make it worth playing in 2025, but it could depend on Battlefield 6’s success.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a> showed no matter how tight your game is, if there’s not enough content, players don’t like it, or other games are doing it better, people won’t play. I think The Finals has a terrific niche in its <strong>level destructibility</strong>—a unique selling point mastered only by the Battlefield series.</p>



<p>EA’s Battlefield has been absent and fairly anonymous for several years, due to the failings of Battlefield 2042. But Battlefield 6 AKA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2025</a> is currently testing the waters with its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-first-playtest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> program. Pre-release footage has already shown destruction is the name of the game, and EA and DICE want their crown back.</p>



<p>The Finals is free-to-play, which always makes it a great bargain. However, with more games coming out, and Battlefield on the way, Embark might have to do something special if The Finals’ player count monthly numbers continue to diminish, and Battlefield 6 makes a huge splash. </p>



<p><strong>I recommend playing The Finals while you can, because it might not be around forever given today’s toxic and volatile climate.</strong></p>

<p>We have the 2025 player count figures for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-are-playing-warzone-right-now-player-count-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Warzone</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-count-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s numbers</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> players this year too.</p>



<p>I’ve been quite surprised by The Finals’ success and longevity so far. Do you think it has the potential to reach the next level? Or is it solid enough to maintain The Finals player count enough to help it stay in a crowded online scene? Drop a comment and share your thoughts.</p>
