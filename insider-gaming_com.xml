<p>It wasn’t the quadruple-threat collection I expected, but Epic Games has gone ahead and done it anyway. On social media, images have surfaced showcasing the Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Juice Wlrd, and Ice Spice skins coming soon to the world’s most popular battle royale game, and fans are excited, to say the least.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-run-it-back-with-snoop-eminem-ice-spice-and-juice-wrld-in-battle-royale?lang=en-US&amp;sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite blog</a>, Epic unveiled the collection of skins and new locations debuting soon in the Chapter 2 Remix. From Snoop Dogg’s ‘Doggfather’ mansion to Eminem’s restaurant, ‘Mom’s Spaghetti’ in the Grotto, there’s plenty to explore in the coming weeks with this update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-interesting-update">Interesting Update</h2>



<p>Players will have to contend with these artists as enemies in Fortnite, with each character taking over a unique, on-theme location and dropping rare loot upon defeat. For instance, if you slay Eminem, he’ll turn around on a dime and help you out, offering you the Mythic RG Minigun.</p>



<p>Through November, each new week will be dedicated to the arrival of a different artist. First, players will fight Snoop Dogg, then Eminem, and in the third week, they’ll contend with Ice Spice on Shark Island. </p>



<p>In the fourth and final week, players will come face to face with Juice Wrld, but instead of fighting him, Epic has arranged a tribute to his legacy, offering a unique ‘Slayer Juice Wrld Outfit’ to any player logging in during a specific window. He’ll also be the frontman for the Remix: The Finale live event on November 30.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to this hip-hop collaboration in Fortnite? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> which skin you’re most excited to cop.</p>

<p>Prime Gaming is a sweet deal for anyone already subscribed to Amazon Prime. It’s arguably one of the best aspects of the service for a gamer, as the platform offers up stacks of free games every month for you to download across a range of platforms. It’s a shame that the games are almost always exclusive to PC players but never mind.</p>



<p>Amazon has revealed a hefty assortment of games coming to the platform <strong>for free </strong>in November – check out the full list below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-free-game-on-prime-gaming-in-november">Every Free Game on Prime Gaming in November</h2>



<p>There are some seriously tantalising titles coming to Prime Gaming through November.</p>



<p>As usual, the release of these games will be staggered, and to pick up a certain game you’ve got your eye on, you might still need to wait a few weeks before it’s available. Also, you’ll need to be willing to use a series of platforms and storefronts to redeem the games – GOG, Epic Games, and Amazon Games, for instance.</p>

<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds beta is here and players are <strong>pouring </strong>onto the platform, soaking up every ounce of the free-to-play trial. On Steam, a whopping 463,000 concurrent players were recorded enjoying Capcom’s upcoming title, putting it in the platform’s top four games by player count in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>It’s storming up the charts on other platforms, too. The launch of the Monster Hunter Wilds beta has even dwarfed the likes of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which was released just yesterday.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-numbers-running-wild">Numbers Running Wild</h2>



<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds beta is great, but it’s not running well on PC. Players have reported widespread issues, including an unpredictable frame rate and a bizarre problem that’s turning enemies into polygonal nightmares.</p>



<p>Many have written the game off because of the somewhat exorbitant system requirements, so that might go some way to explaining the issues. However, Capcom has assured users that it’s acting on all the feedback received during the beta, and the base game is ‘already better’ because of it.</p>



<p>The team has been quick to address the biggest issues through support functions on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you’re experiencing issues in the Steam version of the Open Beta Test, please check out our Troubleshooting &amp; Known Issues guide: <a href="https://t.co/KNr7t4ECRS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bit.ly/OBTsupport</a>.</p>



<p>The issue of afterimage noise occurring in certain environments when Frame Generation is enabled will be fixed in the full game, which is already in a more improved state compared to the beta test.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, the support options are pretty thin, directing players to generic troubleshooting articles that offer advice that’s not at all tailored to the game or any specific problems. </p>



<p>Despite the technical issues, the Monster Hunter Wilds beta continues to perform well, numbers-wise. At the time of writing, 144,000 players were logged into the game on Steam alone, and on Twitch, it’s beating Counter-Strike, Escape from Tarkov, and Apex Legends.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be in our hands and on our consoles and other assorted platforms in little more than a month. It was over a year ago that Bethesda Game Studios lifted the lid on Indy’s next adventure – and subsequently revealed that the iconic adventurer would be played by none other than Troy Baker.</p>



<p>However, in the months leading up to the production of the game, Bethesda’s Todd Howard was against signing the superstar actor for the lead role.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-people-chose-you-every-time">‘People Chose You Every Time’</h2>



<p>Troy Baker is one of the most storied voice actors in the industry. From BioShock to Shadow of Mordor, and from The Last of Us to inFamous, he has been around the block more than a few times.</p>



<p>I was fortunate enough to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-troy-baker-james-cox-grand-theft-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chat with Troy Baker</a> recently about a new cyberpunk-themed project he worked on.</p>



<p>It seemed like an obvious choice to pair Baker with Jones, as almost anything the actor touches turns to gold. But Todd Howard, one of Bethesda Game Studios’ most senior heads, originally rejected the idea of hiring Baker.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/indiana-jones-todd-howard-bethesda-troy-baker-1235146294/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Rolling Stone</a>, Todd Howard and Troy Baker were captured offering their thoughts on the same page. It was revealed that the pair hadn’t properly met before they touched base regarding the role of Indiana Jones. It was stated that Howard outrightly told Troy over a video call that he ‘wasn’t what they wanted’.</p>



<p>This was despite audiences reacting positively to Baker’s performances:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>‘We felt for this project and the time period it was set in, we cast a pretty wide net,’ </em>Howard says. <em>‘I’ll have you know, we did a blind taste test, and people chose you every time.’</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ultimately, the team – and Todd Howard – opted to bring in Troy Baker to perform the role of the legendary treasure hunter. </p>



<p>Do you think they made the right decision? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
