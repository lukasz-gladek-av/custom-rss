<p>A CS2 skin wear rating is a crucial component in determining the value of the skin itself. Counter-Strike’s massive skin economy is made up of hundreds of thousands of skins. The wear rating of a skin can determine whether a skin is worth tens, hundreds, or even thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>Let’s take a deep dive into what CS2 skin wear rating is, what determines it, and how it affects a skin’s price.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-cs2-skin-wear-rating">What is CS2 Skin Wear Rating?</h2>



<p>A wear rating is <strong>a numerical value, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, that determines the amount of wear on a specific CS2 skin</strong>. The higher the wear rating, the more used and rugged it appears. The lower the wear rating, the more new and clean it appears. Wear rating is also commonly referred to as float value.</p>

</figure>



<p>The wear rating directly determines what a skin’s exterior classification is:</p>



<ul>
<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.00 to 0.07 are considered Factory New</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.07 to 0.15 are considered Minimal Wear</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.15 to 0.38 are considered Field-Tested</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.38 to 0.45 are considered Well Worn</strong>.</li>



<li>Skins with a wear rating of <strong>0.45 to 1.00 are considered Battle-Scarred</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<p>For virtually all skins, items that are Factory New buy and sell for much higher than any of the other exteriors. Then it’s usually a sharp drop to Minimal Wear prices, and then another sharp drop to the higher wear exterior prices. Skins that are closer to the 0.00 rating will sell for much more, even more than other Factory New skins. If you’re looking at Factory New skin listings on the marketplace, the cheapest ones are the ones closest to the 0.07 threshold.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-determines-cs2-skin-wear-rating">What Determines CS2 Skin Wear Rating?</h2>



<p><strong>A CS2 skin’s wear rating is determined when it is opened from a case</strong>. Skins are not guaranteed to be Factory New or Minimal Wear when opened from a case. It’s also a common misconception that CS2 skins degrade over time with use. Wear rating does not increase over time with use.</p>



<p>Many skins can only be opened within a specific exterior classification. Doppler knives, among <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-expensive-counter-strike-skins-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most expensive CS2 skins</a>, can only be opened as Factory New or as Minimal Wear, for example.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced that it has appointed a group of “leading advisors” to assist with exploring company options moving forward. The news comes as part of a special strategic update provided by the company on Thursday.</p>



<p>“Following the strategic and execution reviews initiated by the Executive Committee a few months ago, Ubisoft is taking decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation,” the company said via press release shortly before the call took place.</p>



<p>During the call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that this group of advisors will “review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders.” He didn’t give details as to who these advisors are, but did say that things will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors.</p>



<p>Guillemot says that he’s confident that this decision will “position Ubisoft for a stronger future” in the years to come, and that he’s confident there are “several potential paths” forward for the company.</p>







<p>As far as more information into what these paths are, Guillemot wouldn’t divulge. He was asked multiple times for more clarification, but said that he couldn’t say more and wouldn’t comment on “specific rumors” that were circulating. He reiterated, however, different options were being explored.</p>



<p>“We are limited in what we can say today,” he said while stating that the process has already been started with the advisors.</p>



<p>One of those potential paths is rumored to be a buyout by Chinese company Tencent. Guillemot was asked specifically about that possibility as well as the company being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-chinese-military-blacklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added to a “Chinese Military Blacklist”</a> by the United States government. Guillemot, once again, declined to comment on either front.</p>



<p>The update regarding the state of the company comes as Ubisoft announced another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay for Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. Guilletmot said that the delay was part of the company’s “renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences”.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Ubisoft as a company in 2025? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s release date brings with it bloodshed and battles. Warhorse Studio’s brand of historical warfare and realism has proven to be successful, so we’re here to take a look at Deliverance 2’s launch window and available platforms.</p>



<p>The first visit to Kingdom Come wasn’t overly loved by critics, but fans loved it. Its developer revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance has sold 8 million copies</a> and counting. The 2018 RPG made its mark, and then some. Now, the eagerly awaited sequel is preparing to unsheath its blade and plunge it deep into any who have the gall to come back for a second helping.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest releases coming in early 2025</a>, and is set to wrap up the events of the original.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-s-release-date">When is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An epic war is coming. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is scheduled to launch on February 4</strong>.</p>



<p>It was announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-one-week-earlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deliverance 2 would be released a week earlier</a> than planned, and it’s set to expand on almost everything that made the original so popular.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has been hard at work on the sequel since the first game dropped. The studio has grown from 11 people to over 250, and Deliverance 2 is what the company wanted the original to be like—from the words of creative director Daniel Vávra in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R48DEEjyS5k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s Official Game Reveal Trailer</a>.</p>



<p>There’s improved NPC behavior, better real-world interactions, an emphasis again on sleep and food, and new weapons are included such as crossbows and firearms.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-time">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is likely to be released at midnight worldwide</strong>—unless Warhorse Studios says otherwise.</p>



<p>Most games have a universal midnight release schedule for each region. Deliverance 2 doesn’t seem to be any different, so, for the time being, presume Delliverance 2 is releasing at midnight in your time zone. If you’re in New Zealand, you’re laughing, anywhere else, and you’re playing catch up!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-platforms">All Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s day-one launch platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor (for now), Deliverance 2 is restricted purely to next-gen consoles and formats. 2018’s first entry has versions on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Amazon Luna, and Nintendo Switch. The final format on this list was a newcomer—only debuting on Jun. 10, 2021—which means Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 could opt for extra platforms in the future as well.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’ve already described the newest Kingdom Come as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Purest Evolution of a Stellar RPG” in our preview</a>. Do you think it can live up to the original? Or is it going to be a King without a Kingdom?</p>



<p>Keep up to date with everything Deliverance 2 including its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC specs</a> and how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhorse-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immersive</a> the sequel is shaping up to be. </p>
