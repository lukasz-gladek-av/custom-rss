<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has topped a new record on Steam thanks to Rockstar Games’ sale, where the game is just $15.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Red Dead Redemption 2 currently sits with a peak concurrent player count of 86,717 according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1174180/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, topping its previous record of 77,655 in November 2023.</p>



<p>Its success comes from the recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/rockstarpublishersale2025?snr=1_4_4__118&amp;tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Games Steam sale</a>, where you can save up to 80% off on Rockstar Games. Red Dead Redemption 2 seems to be one of the better deals at a 75% discount and for a game considered as a masterpiece (and still very much holds up today, may I add).</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 first released in October 2018 on consoles, and released one year later for PC on November 5, 2019.</p>



<p>The western-themed action-adventure would go on to win over 175 game awards and by June 2024 has sold over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-millions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">67 million units worldwide</a>.</p>



<p>As for what’s next with Rockstar Games, everyone is waiting for an update on the highly anticipated GTA 6, which will undoubtedly be The Game of the Year, no matter which year it launches. At the time of writing, the game is still slated to launch in 2025, but Rockstar Games’ lack of update has understandably got gamers, and the industry as a whole, wondering if a delay is imminent.</p>



<p>Its delay and lack of updates even resulted in one developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching ‘Grand Taking Ages’ on Steam</a> as a parody.</p>
