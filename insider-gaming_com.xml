<p>There are so many indie games, but it feels like not all of them get the attention they probably deserve. The Awesome Console Showcase 2025 was designed to showcase those games, and it did so with its debut broadcast on Tuesday, October 28.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtXqQbu1oPU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">broadcast started</a> at 2pm ET/11am PT, and, over the course of 25 minutes, featured games from indie studios coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo. Included in the 18-game showcase were Antonblast, Bad Cheese, Laysara: Summit Kingdom, and more.</p>



<p>You can check out everything that was announced during the event below, including the full showcase. Be sure to let us know your thoughts on the showcase in the comments, or join this and more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.
