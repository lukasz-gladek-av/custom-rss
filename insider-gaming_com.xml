            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The head of Assassin’s Creed has reportedly left Ubisoft after the launch of the company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-company-officially-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new subsidiary with Tencent</a>.</p>



<p>According to reports, franchise vice president and executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté is no longer with the company. The news was broken to the company via an internal email. </p>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the memo sent</a> to staff and first reported by IGN, Vantage Studios’ co-CEOs Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot said that Côté was offered a leadership role within the company, but he declined the opportunity. It was a decision that the studio leads say they were “disappointed” by. They added that Côté had “<strong>his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios’ creation and future.”</strong></p>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, an Ubisoft spokesperson said,<strong> “Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025,&nbsp;Marc-Alexis Côté&nbsp;has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors.”</strong></p>



<p>Côté&nbsp;first <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcalexis/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">joined Ubisoft in 2005</a> as a software engineer. Over the last 20 years, he had moved up through the company as a lead programmer, level designer, game director, and executive producer. Games produced under his watch include Assassin’s Creed III, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, among others. </p>



<p>Since 2022, Côté&nbsp;has been responsible for the “overall strategy for the Assassin’s Creed franchise”. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon content is ramping up ahead of the huge 30th anniversary of the franchise next year, with new titles and spin-off games announced, along with a host of leaked content that creates a huge roadmap.</p>



<p>Huge leaks in the Pokémon community are nothing new, but the latest batch has seemingly outlined the next half a decade for fans, covering big secrets all the way up until the 11th Generation.</p>



<p>We’ve got a detailed breakdown of all the confirmed Pokémon titles set to release on the horizon, followed by the content said to be in the works, with a full roadmap.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-confirmed-pokemon-game-amp-dlc-in-roadmap">Every Confirmed Pokémon Game &amp; DLC in Roadmap</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More to come. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>







<p>Already confirmed and available to pre-order, Mega Dimension is post-game DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with Hoopa playing an integral role. From the few reveals we’ve had so far, we know that we’re getting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-announced-featuring-two-mega-raichus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two forms of Mega Raichu</a> in the first step of Pokémon the roadmap.</p>



<p>The release window for Mega Dimension has not been announced yet, but it’s likely to either come before the end of 2025 or early in 2026, with other big releases lined up for later in the year.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokopia">Pokopia</h3>



<p>Pokopia is the first confirmed Pokémon title for 2026, with the new spin-off title putting players in control of a Ditto that has assumed a human form. This farm-life sim is a new venture for the franchise, with big comparisons to Animal Crossing.</p>



<p>A release window has not been revealed for Pokopia, though we’ll likely hear confirmation at the big 30th anniversary Pokémon Day, with Pokopia taking a slot earlier in the year before the expected release of Gen 10 in the latter half (more on that later).</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-champions">Pokémon Champions</h3>



<p>Pokémon Champions is set to make a big change to the competitive scene of the franchise, which, moving forward, will not be played on the latest instalment of games and instead come in the free-to-play title.</p>



<p>Again, a release window has not been confirmed for Pokémon Champions, but the Pokémon World Championships 2026 VGC section will be played on the title, so it will need to launch early enough in the year for players to get used to it and for any issues to be ironed out.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-leaked-pokemon-games-amp-dlc-in-roadmap">All Leaked Pokémon Games &amp; DLC in Roadmap</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big twist. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-dlc">Pokopia DLC</h3>



<p>In the latest round of huge leaks for the franchise, DLC for Pokopia <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977791170093687087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was mentioned</a>. No details have been shared on this, nor do we know the release window, but it seems likely that any Pokopia DLC will land before the launch of Gen 10.</p>



<p>Pokopia DLC looks set to be the first big piece of leaked content on the Pokémon roadmap, though there is plenty more to come.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-wind-amp-waves-gen-10">Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves: Gen 10</h3>



<p>Gen 10 in 2026 is all but guaranteed, with Pokémon celebrating a 30th anniversary next year, though it’s still yet to be fully revealed. Similarly to specific release dates for announced titles, expect news to come in February’s birthday bonanza.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huge leaks have emerged</a> though, detailing everything from the game’s location to new mechanics, along with big new features that will be elaborated on in future generations of the game. Though a release window is uncertain, expect it to land at the back end of 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-wind-amp-waves-dlc">Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves DLC</h3>



<p>Pokémon has moved away from the previous model of enhanced games or third titles in a generation with extra content to a DLC approach, witnessed in Sword and Shield, then replicated in Scarlet and Violet, and, of course, there’s the Mega Dimension DLC for Legends: Z-A.</p>



<p>In Gen 9, the first part of DLC came almost a year after the launch, with the second part a few months later. It remains to be seen whether a similar approach will be taken in Gen 10, or whether the DLCs will be spaced out more. Expect these to come in 2027.</p>







<p>Reportedly scheduled for either 2027 or 2028, per the leaks, the third game in the Pokémon Legends series will see players return to Galar, the Gen 8 region, travelling 1,000 years in the past. This would be the second major time-reverse in the Legends series, following on from Legends: Arceus.</p>



<p>Again, the release window isn’t set in stone, though it likely depends on where other titles land. The original Legends game released in the first-quarter of the year, while Legends: Z-A releases in Q4. The big difference, however, is Arceus arrived the same year as Scarlet &amp; Violet.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-seed-multi-region-mmo">Pokémon Seed: Multi-Region MMO</h3>



<p>With a reported 2028 or 2029 release window, Pokémon’s big MMO project, said to be internally codenamed as Seed, could be the biggest advancement of the franchise yet by connecting various regions of the Pokémon world together and encorporating MMO themes—which are initially said to be introduced in Gen 10.</p>



<p>The huge connected region is said to incorporate all of the Pokémon regions set in Japan, which are Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh, alongside Kitakami, which featured in Scarlet &amp; Violet DLC.</p>



<p>A similar approach could then be taken for the European-based regions of Galar, Kalos, and Paldea, though that’s just a theory for now.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-gen-11">Pokémon Gen 11</h3>



<p>Said to be arriving in 2030, which would fit perfectly into the four-year cycle Pokémon has settled into in the modern era between generations, Pokémon Gen 11 is the next big step for the franchise—and it doesn’t seem that far away.</p>



<p>At this early stage, no major details are known about what Gen 11 of the Pokémon franchise could entail, particularly given the huge advancements that are seemingly being planned for the years to come.</p>
