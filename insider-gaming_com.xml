<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s Valley of Memory update is a supersized overhaul that comes with a stack of Trophies and Achievements that you can unlock <strong>for free</strong>. It’s a sizeable expansion that takes players to an all-new region of the 2023 open-world title, presenting them with a splinter story that Ubisoft isn’t charging a penny for.</p>



<p>In this guide, learn how to unlock all Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory Trophies and Achievements.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-assassin-s-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-trophies-amp-achievements">All Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<p>Fans were surprised when Ubisoft announced Valley of Memory so far after launch, as Assassin’s Creed Mirage received very little in the way of updates after launch, save for the typical New Game+ kind of content.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of Trophies and Achievements in Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Lost and Found</strong></td><td>Return all stolen goods to Hind</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Once Upon a Time</strong></td><td>Listen to all folktales</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pro Musician</strong></td><td>Collect all Oud melodies</td></tr><tr><td><strong>If I Recall Correctly</strong></td><td>Replay an Animus Sequence</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Perfect Memory</strong></td><td>Complete all sequence challenges</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Playback</strong></td><td>Unlock all Animus Sequence rewards</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Taste Your Own Medicine</strong></td><td>Poison a Poisoner</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Like a Local</strong></td><td>Complete all the AlUla territories</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make a Break</strong></td><td>Escape the AlUla prison</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Turn the Page</strong></td><td>Say goodbye to Is’haq</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Give it the Slip</strong></td><td>Escape the AlUla prison undetected</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>It’s not a huge list, but considering Valley of Memory is a completely free expansion, it’s a decent list of Trophies and Achievements to chase. Fans were mostly surprised that Ubisoft decided to tack this expansion onto Assassin’s Creed Mirage, which is more than two years old at this point.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory will be released as a free-to-download update on all platforms on November 18. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ll be playing the new expansion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Our first look at Yoshi and Bowser Jr. from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie comes from, well, a grocery chain. The film, set to release April 3rd, 2026, has yet to get a full trailer, but the new listing may hint at it coming sooner than we thought.</p>



<p>Illumination and Universal Pictures went big with The Super Mario Bros. Movie back in 2022. The first film based on a Nintendo IP in decades, it became the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6718170/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-grossing video game adaptation</a>&nbsp;of all time. A sequel was quickly greenlit and, earlier this year, was revealed to be called The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Story details were thin outside of using Super Mario Galaxy, but we now have some more content from an unlikely source: slice-and-bake cookies.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-look-at-yoshi-and-bowser-jr-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-leaked-online">First Look at Yoshi and Bowser Jr. from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Leaked Online</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leak comes from an unlikely source: Tops Markets. The East Coast grocery chain put up a new listing for “Pillsbury The Super Mario Galaxy Shape Sugar Cookie Dough”. It’s still up, <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">linked here</a>, if you want to look at it, but it’s out of stock. On the box, we have the best look at Yoshi, who is at the end of The Super Mario Bros. Movie via a cracked sewer egg. His design differs a bit from his video-game counterpart with smoother texturing and flatter eyes. </p>



<p>On the back, there’s a fun little maze to fill out. We do get to see some of the worlds Mario and Yoshi will be traveling to, though it’s hard to tell if they come from Super Mario Galaxy or its sequel. However, one icon should be familiar to fans: Bowser Jr.’s graffiti tag. The character, the son of Bowser (played in-film by Jack Black), had yet to be revealed, so his inclusion here is all but confirming his appearance. </p>



<p>A trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to come out soon</a>, possibly with the upcoming Wicked: For Good film. With April 2026 almost here, marketing is set to start and, unfortunately for Nintendo, happened a bit too early. Regardless, we have yet to see Yoshi and Bowser Jr. in action, but it’s good to know some new faces are along for the intergalactic ride.</p>



<p>What do you think of Yoshi’s look in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie? Are you going to be picking up the Pillsbury cookies? When do you think the trailer will come out?

<p>Use these Roblox Get Stronger Every Second monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash, Strength, Multipliers and much more.</p>



<p>Get Stronger Every Second is a popular simulator game on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-blade-x-zombies-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> that requires players to get stronger and gain more health by managing their weight and defeating enemies. This, in turn, allows players to progress through the game by destroying the map, thereby enabling them to get ahead of the competition. Although there is more than one way to go about playing Get Stronger Every Second, one thing that all players must do in common is make use of codes to get their hands on free rewards. These rewards, which can be claimed through the ‘Shop’ tab within the game, could prove to be extremely beneficial, especially to newer players just starting their Roblox journey.&nbsp;</p>
