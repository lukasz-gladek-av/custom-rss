The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is Getting a New Ban System, But Players Don’t Think It’s Tough Enough]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ban-system-not-enough/</link>
            <guid>1417837</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders underwent a major update today as Embark Studios delivered Headwinds, the first of <strong>four </strong>content drops coming between now and April. It introduced seven new quests, a minor map condition, two new Augments, and some other bits and pieces. The team at Embark also revealed that, very soon, a new anti-cheat <strong>ban system </strong>will be implemented to combat malicious players.</p>



<p>In a footnote in the patch notes for the recent ARC Raiders update, the team explained that a permaban is the result of a cheating spree, but players don’t think getting to that point is happening <strong>fast enough </strong>for it to be effective.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-need-tougher-anti-cheat">Does ARC Raiders Need Tougher Anti-Cheat?</h2>



<p>Over the festive period, ARC Raiders players were suffering under the weight of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploits, cheaters</a>, and a bit of content stagnation brought on by everyone at Embark Studios going off on a well-deserved break.</p>



<p>Now that they’re back, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive roadmap</a> has been revealed, detailing content up to April 2026.</p>



<p>Today, the first part of that roadmap, an update dubbed ‘Headwinds’, was delivered. It introduced some fresh content, a map condition that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fills Buried City with birds</a>, and seven short new quests for players to conquer. It effectively opens up some of the game’s lore, too.</p>



<p>However, one element in the recent patch notes hasn’t filled players with the joy that the positive notes have.</p>



<p>Almost at the end <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-13-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of the update</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A three strikes progressive ban system is in the process of being implemented. Bans will progress from 30 days, to 60 and finally a permaban for repeat offenders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Those who tussled with these more malicious players in recent weeks feel that the ban loop isn’t strong enough for anyone <strong>caught cheating</strong>. The item was subtitled ‘Anti-Cheat’, but it reads like this is a <strong>general </strong>approach to banning players caught breaking the rules, and not <em>just </em>cheaters.</p>



<p>In any case, a cheater being banned for just 30 days feels like little more than a slap on the wrist. The second infraction earns them a 60-day penalty, but it takes <strong>three offences </strong>for them to receive a permanent ban. That’s three times that somebody could be caught <strong>using cheats to manipulate the game </strong>before Embark Studios says, ‘Enough.’</p>



<p>Other extraction shooters, like Escape from Tarkov, issue permanent bans upon <strong>a single detection </strong>of cheating, and they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheaters-banned-battlestate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly reveal which users</a> have been kicked from the game. Sure, they might make a new account and come back, but the strong-arm approach is there at the initial stage.</p>







<p>Do you think ARC Raiders needs tougher anti-cheat, and that Embark Studios is risking displeasing the majority of its userbase? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>IEM Katowice is officially no more, and the competition has moved to Krakow for 2026. This monumental change seemed drastic at the time, but fans are now readying themselves to visit a new city for this supersized tournament. In this guide, we’re breaking down everything you need to know about IEM Krakow 2026, including the schedule, teams competing, and where to watch it.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in IEM Krakow betting or just want to watch your favourite teams and players enjoying Counter-Strike 2 action live on stream, read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-schedule-and-location">IEM Krakow 2026 Schedule and Location</h2>



<p>IEM Krakow 2026 will take place at the TAURON Arena in the city of Kraków, Poland. It’s set to run from January 28th to February 8th, and in that time, 24 teams will fight for the lion’s share of a massive $1 million prize.</p>



<p>Here’s the <strong>IEM Krakow 2026 schedule and format:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Play-In Stage</strong></p>



<p>During this stage, 16 teams come together for the Play-In round, which features a double-elimination bracket and a series of best-of-three matches. It’s a whittling round here, and only the top eight will make it through to the next round to face the higher-seeded competitors.</p>



<p><strong>Group Stage</strong></p>



<p>The Group Stage includes the eight successful teams from the Play-In Stage and the eight that had already qualified with a higher seeding for IEM Krakow. The teams will compete along another double-elimination pathway, with each group being made up of eight teams in total.</p>



<p>The Group Stage <strong>winners </strong>go through to the semi-finals, the <strong>runners-up </strong>advance to the Quarterfinals as <em>high seeds</em>, and the <strong>third-place teams </strong>go through to the Quarterfinals as <em>low seeds</em>. Only the top three teams from each group will land in the Playoffs.</p>



<p><strong>Playoffs</strong></p>



<p>The Playoffs will crown the champion at IEM Krakow 2026. This is a single-elimination bracket with a best-of-five grand final that will see six teams fight for the grand prize – $400,000.</p>



<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-teams">IEM Krakow 2026 Teams</h2>



<p>Here is the full list of the teams qualified to compete at IEM Krakow 2026:</p>



<p><strong>Directly Qualified</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Team Vitality</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Team Spirit</li>



<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>The MongolZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Play-In Teams</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Aurora Gaming</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Legacy</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>



<li>Astralis</li>



<li>PARIVISION</li>

<li>paiN Gaming</li>



<li>FUT Esports</li>



<li>Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>



<li>BC.Game Esports</li>



<li>NRG</li>



<li>GamerLegion</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-predictions">IEM Krakow 2026 Predictions</h2>



<p>Team Vitality enters the running as the primary title contender, despite recent losses. For a safe IEM Krakow bet, you’d consider backing them, or for similar odds, Team Spirit. FURIA has been on a resurgence of late, and the Brazilian roster could make for a middle-of-the-road bet if you’re playing outrights.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, a swing-tier squad like Team Liquid and Ninjas in Pyjamas could manufacture an underdog win that could result in a nice return for Counter-Strike betting fans.</p>

<p>It’s time to crawl out through the Fallout one more time with episode 8 of Fallout Season 2. Amazon’s stunning adaptation is reaching its conclusion, and Season 2’s episode 8 release date draws closer than a Bloatfly to your irradiated presence.</p>



<p>The Ink Spots famously sang about not wanting to set the world on fire, and yet, Amazon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> adaptation has constantly been on fire. Every episode has knocked it out of the park. Fallout Season 2 has been a joy to watch from start to finish, and the high stakes are about to be raised one more time in New Vegas.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-season-2-episode-8-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Episode 8 will show great steel once more. Credit to Amazon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Tuesday, February 3, is the official release date for Fallout Season 2, episode 8.</strong></p>



<p>The last couple of episodes of Season 2 have been rejigged by Amazon slightly. But you have no excuse for missing it now with this information! The reason for Amazon’s tinkering with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-episode-7-release-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode 7</a> and episode 8 was “Due to strong participation and interest,” which, in short, was to make it available for more regions earlier and cut down on potential spoilers.</p>



<p>No one wants a finale ruined for them, making this a commendable gesture by Amazon.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-episode-8-start-times-amp-dates">Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Start Times &amp; Dates</h2>



<p><strong>The United States claims the first release time for Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 with a 6 PM PT start time on February 3. Insider Gaming has also provided more time zones for you to check out, including GMT and AET.</strong></p>



<p>It’s the United Kingdom who are probably most at risk for an episode 8 spoiler due to the 2 AM start time! Whereas many other regions are getting more favorable start times.</p>



<p>Take a look at this table and see when Season 2 episode 8 airs for you.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Region</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Dates &amp; Release Time</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">6:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">8:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1:00 PM—February 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM—February 4</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If episode 8 is even half as good as the rest, then Fallout’s newest batch of TV is about to go out with a Megaton ending, atomic bomb-sized bang.</p>
