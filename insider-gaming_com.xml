<p>Crystal Dynamics, the developers behind the recent Tomb Raider games, has announced that it has held layoffs at the studio.</p>



<p>In an announcement on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_this-morning-crystal-dynamics-made-the-difficult-activity-7310735917680377859-DthD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, the studio said that it made the “difficult decision” to let go 17 people from the company. In it’s statement, they said that the decision wasn’t made “lightly”.</p>



<div><p>“Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success,” the statement reads. “It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.</p><p>“We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach.”</p></div>



<p>The statement ended with the studio saying that it “remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games” nor does it change any of their current projects.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Crystal Dynamics for more details on the support and “transition packages” the impacted employees are receiving. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>



<p>Crystal Dynamics is just the latest studio to hold layoffs in 2025. As of publishing, <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">roughly 1,500 confirmed jobs</a> have been lost across nearly 50 companies this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-inzoi-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained.1146285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-inzoi-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Denuvo continues to be brought up with every new PC release, and Inzoi is another instance. The life simulator is being compared to The Sims in terms of scale and superiority in the genre, but it could be hampered by Denuvo software.</p>



<p>For all the childish talk of the “PC master race” over the years, PC players get the short end of the stick much of the time. While the platform is undoubtedly the best way to experience games (if you can afford the hardware), it also has drawbacks. It’s late to many AAA ports, is often poorly optimized for the format, and has to contend with Denuvo issues.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-inzoi-come-out-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> has taken 2025 by storm—highlighted by its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam wishlist numbers</a>—but let’s see if it’s fallen victim to Denuvo.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-denuvo-used-in-inzoi">Is Denuvo Used in Inzoi?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Phew. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s good news as I can confirm Inzoi doesn’t support Denuvo, so you don’t have to worry.</strong></p>



<p>Invoi has a lot going on at any one time. So I can see why you’d be concerned if Inzoi used Denuvo as part of its configuration. Thankfully, the developer has confirmed that Denuvo isn’t supported, but this hasn’t always been the case.</p>



<p><strong>Previously, the game has included Denuvo</strong>, but it was removed during Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-was-denuvo-removed-from-inzoi">Why Was Denuvo Removed From Inzoi?</h2>



<p><strong>Denuvo was removed from Inzoi after negative feedback from the community and the developer wanting players to have more freedom for “long-lasting enjoyment for the community.”</strong></p>



<p>Inzoi suddenly added Denuvo overnight during the Early Access period, and this did not go down well with players. It took Inzoi Studio less than 48 hours to see the error of its ways and undo the action.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://80.lv/articles/breaking-inzoi-developer-removes-denuvo-following-players-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80LV</a>, Inzoi producer and game director Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim had this to say: “”Our initial application of Denuvo on our main development build made it so that the inZOI: Creative Studio demo build, a branch from the main build, was also applied with the same anti-tamper,”&nbsp;<strong>Kjun wrote</strong>. “Unfortunately, we failed to properly inform our players of this application during the demo period, and we sincerely apologize for that oversight.”</p>



<p>They explain that a lack of Denuvo “increases the risk of the game being cracked and illegally distributed after release,” but the team is encouraging “Inzoi to become more freely configurable – unlocking new ways for players to shape new experiences for other players.”</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you happy Inzoi Studio has reversed its decision? Do more developers and publishers need to sacrifice the need for Denuvo’s anti-tampering, anti-pirate software to ensure a smoother PC experience? Share your thoughts with us.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yotei’s senior communications manager has just reconfirmed that the game is still looking at a 2025 release window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sucker Punch’s senior communications manager, Andrew Goldfarb’s recent post on <a href="https://x.com/garfep/status/1902455637679943833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X </a>(via The Gamer) reconfirms Ghost of Yotei’s plans of release in 2025, as he is looking for “an experienced community and support specialist “ to help launch the game “this year”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghost of Yotei, the sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, was revealed last year during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation’s State of Play</a> event. Sucker Punch arrived with a full-fledged trailer at the showcase, providing players with a glimpse of what to expect with the new adventure set in the lands surrounding Mount Yotei. Interestingly, towards the end of the trailer, they announced that Ghost of Yotei will be released in 2025.&nbsp;</p>
