<p>It has been confirmed by Esports Charts that the League of Legends World Championship, which wrapped in London, England tonight, has secured a new esports world record. During the final game of the last series in the tournament, a whopping 6.94 <strong>million </strong>users tuned in worldwide, smashing the records set by last year’s LoL Worlds.</p>



<p>If the power of League of Legends esports wasn’t already evident, this record has cemented it.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-constant-growth">Constant Growth</h2>



<p>League of Legends is, by numbers, the biggest esports title in the world. This monumental event that was capped off with a grand final in London was an eye-opener to the power of esports, even amidst the ‘esports winter’ that’s refusing to fully thaw.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://escharts.com/news/2024-league-legends-worlds-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Esports Charts</a>, it was confirmed that this final series peaked at 6.94 million viewers, which is a new world record that won’t be beaten any time soon. In the last few weeks, more than 190 million hours of game time were watched, and the average viewership throughout the month-long tournament exceeded 1.7 million.</p>



<p>There are no games out there that do it quite like League of Legends.</p>



<p>The tournament was streamed across various platforms, but it dominated on YouTube. More than half the peak viewer count was logged on the platform, with Twitch sitting in second place, which isn’t all that typical for esports. This is likely because at the start of the year, Twitch revealed it was ‘pulling out’ of South Korea.</p>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship was a wonderful event from start to finish. It heralded the fifth trophy for T1 Esports – and the fifth for Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok, often considered the GOAT of the esports world.</p>
