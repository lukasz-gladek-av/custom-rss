<p>Escape from Tarkov’s mysterious new map started this morning as just that – a mystery. Now, it has been blown wide open, with one streamer being the first player in the world to gain access to Terminal. The new map was introduced with Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update, but until now, it has remained sealed.</p>



<p>In a move that was recognized by Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio powering Escape from Tarkov, TIGZ gained access to Terminal and experienced the endgame mission for the first time.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-do-you-get-into-terminal-in-tarkov">How Do You Get Into Terminal in Tarkov</h2>



<p>To gain access to Terminal in Escape from Tarkov, you first need to complete all the prerequisites, including the entire campaign chain that you’re taken along by the choices you make in the main game. Once you’ve fulfilled the required criteria, you’ll need to head to Shoreline between 22:00 and 04:00 and use the TRANSITION POINT that’s outside the Terminal gate.</p>



<p>This is the same gate you would have needed to scout very early in the game.,</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/RealTigz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RealTigz</a> I saw that! Congratz on the first Terminal run!<br>Better luck next one!</p>— Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1995493411688939886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>If you’ve met the criteria, you’ll transition and enter Terminal, being presented with a cutscene that kicks off the end of the game in The Ticket.</p>



<p>Your sole objective will be to head through Terminal and get to the Zubr boat, the only extraction point from Terminal, and from Tarkov as a whole. It’s a PvE environment, and a war is raging as Terminal comes under siege, forcing the player to contend with a staggering number of enemies while also having <strong>no equipment</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2632622304">TIGZ might have been the first</a> to enter Terminal, but he didn’t manage to complete the mission, as he died shortly before wrapping it up and was kicked back to the main menu.</p>



<p>It’s indicative of what Nikita said about a small portion of the player base being able to resolve the final mission in Escape from Tarkov. It’s nails, and there is an onslaught of enemies to contend with, the likes of which you’ve never seen before.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Chapter 7 The Last Chapter of Fortnite? Fortnite Final Chapter Rumor, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-chapter-7-the-last-chapter-of-fortnite/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new adventure has commenced with the start of Chapter 7 Season 1 in Fortnite, bringing a fresh experience to the game, but questions are circulating on whether this is the last chapter of Fortnite.</p>



<p>Considerable changes have been made with the launch of Chapter 7, including the destruction of the beloved Battle Bus, and the ongoing evolution of the Epic Games title leaves the door open for significant expansion in the future.</p>



<p>With Fortnite’s history of Chapters and Seasons now long established, questions continue to emerge on whether Chapter 7 will be the final Chapter, and Insider Gaming has collected all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-chapter-7-the-last-chapter-of-fortnite">Is Chapter 7 The Last Chapter of Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>End of an era? Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no indication that Chapter 7 will be the final Chapter in Fortnite’s long-established schedule, though there is always the chance that Epic Games mixes it up.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite Chapters have been in place since October 2019, when the standard season approach was revamped. From then on, rather than having singular seasons like ‘Season One’, Fortnite moved into a Chapter and Season approach with the launch of Chapter 2 Season 1.</p>



<p>Since then, Epic Games has settled into an annual update in Chapters, bringing a new map, a revamped loot pool, and major gameplay changes to the scene, which have helped to keep Fortnite alive and fresh. However, as next year marks seven years since this process began, it could be revamped.</p>



<p>Even if a revamp was on the cards, Fortnite would not be disappearing. Instead, any change would just be to the approach of naming individual Seasons and Chapters, but even that is unlikely, as the current approach helps to avoid any confusion between previous seasons and ongoing ones.</p>



<p>The addition of Fortnite OG as a permanent mode has also proven to be extremely popular, and allows Epic Games to reuse old assets and bring a fresh approach to historic seasons in the past.</p>



<p>Additionally, rumors of a final chapter in Fortnite have persisted throughout the years, with similar questions asked about whether Chapter 6 would be the final Chapter.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-fortnite-do-in-the-future">What Could Fortnite do in The Future?</h2>



<p><strong>If Fortnite were to make a major change in the structure of Chapters, it would likely be to reference the evolution of the game away from the Battle Royale experience.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite now caters to a wide array of players, with LEGO Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, and Rocket Racing as established modes separate from Battle Royale, while the likes of Reload, Blitz, Delulu, and Fortnite OG provide a different gameplay experience. Alongside this, there’s an endless supply of creative maps offering RPGs, Tycoons, and much more.</p>



<p>The biggest aspect in the works, however, is Epic Games’ huge partnership with Disney. In February 2024, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/disney-buys-1-5-billion-stake-in-epic-games-will-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1.5 billion deal was announced</a> between Disney and Epic Games, with the investment coming alongside plans to create an ‘expansive’ universe within Fortnite where various IPs are found.</p>



<p>Epic Games and Fortnite already have a wealth of experience working with Disney, with regular collabs and themed seasons taking place over the years, and this would ramp that up significantly.</p>

<p>During a new interview, the Metal Gear Solid series producer spoke about how difficult it was to port MGS 4: Guns of the Patriots to current-gen consoles and systems. </p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake was recently released and had a successful launch, selling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-sold-over-1-million-copies-in-2-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1 million copies in just 2 days</a>. It seems fans want to play the next parts as well; however, after the producer’s comments, it appears that developing a current-gen port for MGS 4: Guns of the Patriots isn’t as easy as it looks. </p>







<p>During a new interview with a Japanese publication called <a href="https://t.co/MsrWWmYbRW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Real Sound</a>, Metal Gear Solid series producer, Noriaki Okamura, was asked about MGS 4 coming to current-gen consoles. Okamura first stated that “the hardware at the time required a very particular design to produce 3D performance with the technology available at the time.” Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots was a PlayStation 3 exclusive title, released in 2008. </p>



<p>Okamura added that Metal Gear Solid 4 also has “quite a unique code,” and these factors make it “tough to bring it over now”, the producer said laughingly. The producer’s statement doesn’t outright reject the idea of a port, but does reveal that it won’t be easy if they plan to do so. </p>



<p>In other news, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-deltas-fox-hunt-mode-gets-october-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer mode</a>, Fox Hunt, was released this October. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-x-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-crossover-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a> is going to feature a Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater crossover soon.
