            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Leslie Benzies, co-founder and co-CEO of Build a Rocket Boy, the developer behind MindsEye, is reportedly on ‘temporary leave’ from the firm. This was confirmed by the <strong>other </strong>CEO, Mark Gerhard, who recently revealed an alleged €1 million plot to sabotage BARB and MindsEye.</p>



<p>Per an email from Gerhard to the wider company, Benzies is taking a ‘well-earned temporary leave to recharge after more than a year of working around the clock.’ But following that, Gerhard stressed he’d be guiding the company forward and signed off his email as ‘CEO’ and not ‘co-CEO’.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-did-leslie-go">Where Did Leslie Go?</h2>



<p>It has been a tough few weeks for the team at Build a Rocket Boy. After the disastrous launch of MindsEye, the studio’s inaugural game, and several bouts of layoffs, the team was hit again by yet another scandal earlier this month. Leslie Benzies, formerly of Rockstar North fame, found himself accused of sexual assault in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-accused-sexual-assault-in-epstein-files/">recently uncovered ‘Epstein file.’</a></p>



<p>He categorically <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ex-rockstar-north-president-denies-epstein-files-allegations/">denied the assault</a> but confirmed he was in a consensual relationship with his accuser.</p>



<p>In a new report published by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/can-build-a-rocket-boy-save-itself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry</a>, it was revealed that an email posted by Mark Gerhard after an all-hands call confirmed Leslie Benzies’ temporary departure from the company.</p>



<p>Gerhard worded the email quite strangely, making it sound like the absence might be a little longer than you might assume:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>He has our deepest gratitude, and with the leadership team and your support, I will guide us forward.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report expanded with comments from former and current employees at BARB, one of whom explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think BARB survives this crisis. I believe the end is coming for BARB, and it’s not heralded by saboteurs, but by Mark and Leslie themselves.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That was in response to Gerhard’s claim of having evidence that Build a Rocket Boy and MindsEye were subject to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/">a ruthless and targeted campaign</a> to bring the brand down. Insider Gaming recently published a report detailing this exact claim.</p>

<p>The latest patch update for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/apex-legends/" id="27">Apex Legends</a> features new Meshes, audio updates, weapon updates, and so much more.</p>



<p>On February 9, Apex Legends announced the launch of their latest season: Breach. With the new season comes a range of updates, including the all-new Hardlight Mesh. These meshes serve as destructible, breachable windows. They are translucent, block projectiles, and affect player movement.</p>



<p>They allow players to create new entry points and attack angles, and they rebuild after a significant delay following damage. Controller Legends can also reinforce them to become more sturdy and allow them to bunker down, delaying enemy assaults.</p>







<p>In the latest patch, there are also updates to different Legend types. The Fuse type has received major updates, particularly to its ultimate, which now drops a mortar that detonates on impact, then sprays smaller bombs around its landing point. Additionally, they’re no longer slowed by explosive damage, have faster weapon stow time, and more.</p>



<p>The Apex team described the Catalyst type as “needing help for a while.” They can now reinforce up to four doors, have a maximum of three traps, and work in a larger area.</p>







<h2>Audio Updates Included Also</h2>



<p>Additionally, the Apex team announced audio updates for season 28. There are now more audio customization options, providing finer-tuned control over: Legend Dialogue, Ping Dialogue, and Announcer Dialogue.</p>



<p>Players can check out the full patch <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/breach-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820">Embark Studios</a> is encouraging players to team up with strangers in the next <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> event, which launches tomorrow, February 10.</p>



<p>The Shared Watch event was announced in a social media trailer and will run through February 24. </p>



<p>While not specified, the caption states that players will clean up with strangers to turn their barrels on the machines, hinting at a PvE event. Still, people in the comments were asking for clarification as to whether this would be a PvP event.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>You watch my back, I'll watch yours – that’s how Speranza keeps ticking 🫶<br>Join your fellow Raiders in celebrating the Shared Watch; team up with strangers, turn your barrels on the machines, and earn rewards in the process.</p><p>The Shared Watch Event begins tomorrow! <a href="https://t.co/ssYtkLxZ4r">pic.twitter.com/ssYtkLxZ4r</a></p></div>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2020905547927552273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-what-follows-this-event-in-the-arc-raiders-roadmap">What Follows This Event in the ARC Raiders Roadmap</h2>



<p>Following the conclusion of the shared watch event on February 24, players can sign up for the second in-game Expedition on February 25. The event will begin on March 1. This time around, ARC is introducing a Skill Point catch-up system, which will allow players to reclaim some coins they missed during the first Expedition. </p>



<p>Each missing Skill Point from the first Expedition now only requires 300k stash value, and any Coins collected will first count toward the second Expedition before being applied to previously missed Skill Points.</p>
