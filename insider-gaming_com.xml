<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is a powerful console and looks to be a huge improvement over the first Switch, but the cost of Switch 2 physical and digital media has left a sour taste in the mouths of players and potential buyers.</p>



<p>The Switch 2—almost known as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-was-almost-named-super-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Nintendo Switch</a>—has gone from being an unknown entity to being given an imminent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. I’m happy, fans are, and the thought of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-120fps-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">120 FPS, 4K &amp; HDR</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-is-getting-a-new-3d-adventure-on-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is bliss.</p>



<p>What isn’t bliss is the projected prices of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> games. We’re entering a new era of gaming, but it could be a scary one for wallets and bank accounts.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-do-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost">How Much Do Nintendo Switch 2 Games Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Will you buy straight away? Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 games are expected to cost between $70-90 for base copies of games.</strong></p>



<p>This figure could vary based on the physical nature of the game, as well as how much Nintendo possibly values the license—let me explain. </p>



<h3 id="h-increased-rrp">Increased RRP</h3>



<p>A ton of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games were announced during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>. Some of the biggest reveals included <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> (AKA Mario Kart 9) and the aforementioned Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>



<p>Mario is a launch-day title, whereas Donkey Kong arrives later. But the key thing to note is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of both games</a>. The official Nintendo website states <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mario Kart World</a> has an MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price) of <strong>$79.99</strong>, with the physical edition costing an even steeper <strong>$89.99</strong>.</p>



<p>Over the years, it’s become traditional for digital games to be more expensive than physical media. Personally, this has never made sense to me as physical media requires shipping and practical manufacturing. But now it seems the tide is turning somewhat.</p>



<h3 id="h-franchise-status-could-affect-price">Franchise Status Could Affect Price</h3>



<p>Mario Kart World looks to be getting the full-price treatment. If we compare it to Donkey Kong Bananza—another first-party Nintendo series—it’s currently locked in at <strong>$69.99</strong> for digital and <strong>$79.99</strong> for physical.</p>



<p>I’m not here saying Mario Kart is a superior franchise to Donkey Kong in any way, but the evidence suggests that’s how Nintendo views Donkey Kong Bananza compared to Mario Kart World. The company believes Mario Kart will sell many more copies than DK, hence the price point difference.</p>



<p>This likely means the $80-90 RRP <strong>won’t apply to all games and franchises</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-nintendo-switch-2-game-costs-compare-to-switch-1">How do Nintendo Switch 2 Game Costs Compare to Switch 1?</h2>



<p>If we compare Mario Kart World to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the former has an MSRP of <strong>$79.99 for the digital edition</strong>, whereas The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is <strong>$69.99 for a digital copy</strong>.</p>



<p>Nintendo is notorious for keeping the cost of its AAA titles the same. The top-tier games don’t get permanently discounted like Sony would God of War or Horizon. So there’s a clear difference of $10 between the two, showing you game media prices are going up.</p>



<p>The famed “$100 game” might, unfortunately, be closer than you think.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been fully revealed with all of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-features-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bells and whistles</a>, and one thing that stood out was the console’s battery life.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/tech-specs/?srsltid=AfmBOooxo0wVjRc2ml5KgPabZ0zRKqus_UgaTAA9k8ROq4mfc7XlpIk5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">specs released</a> on Nintendo’s website, the Switch 2 will have a more powerful battery than the original Switch. The new system features a 5220mAh Lithium-ion battery which is more than the 4310mAh&nbsp;battery of the Switch and 3570mAh of the Switch Lite. </p>



<p>When it comes to actual battery life, Nintendo says that the Switch 2 has a range from 2-6.5 hours. The company says that the times are “rough estimates” and that “the battery life will depend on the games you play.”</p>







<p>Should you need to charge your system, it will take around three hours to fully charge the console while the system is in Sleep mode. Should you actively be playing in TV mode, charging will take longer.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 features a larger 7.9-inch 1080p LCD Screen that keeps the same overall size of the original Switch. The screen also supports HDR and up to 120 frames per second (FPS). Other features of the new system include 256GB of built-in storage, 4K at 60 FPS when docked, built-in microphone, two USB-C ports, and more. The Nintendo Switch 2 will also support MicroSD Express memory cards, meaning that the MicroSD cards compatible with the current system will not be supported.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Nintendo Switch 2 battery life? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>New leaks have revealed that Battlefield 6 will indeed have a free-to-play Battle Royale coming to the game.</p>



<p>The information originates from several different dataminers, who have been able to datamine Battlefield 6 having gained access to the files via Battlefield Labs. Last week, over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 concept art images of Battlefield 6 leaked</a> because of dataminers.</p>



<p>Allegedly, the datamines reveal that a Battle Royale gamemode will be coming to Battlefield 6, which was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously exclusively reported by Insider Gaming</a>. </p>



<p>According to the datamines, the gamemode (which Insider Gaming understands to be in development by Ripple Effect), will have a lot of traditional features that you’d come to expect from a Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Such features include solo, duo, trio, and squad matches, an armor system, call-ins, loot rarity, update kits and weapons, and a shrinking zone. </p>



<p>Also mentioned was a “free-to-play component”, which is understood to be the core Battle Royale experience. Gauntlet, another mode that Insider Gaming reported on in the past was also mentioned and referred to in some of the game files.</p>



<p>As for if a Battlefield Battle Royale experience for Battlefield 6 can be success or not is unclear, but this time around DICE and EA seem to be doing the right thing by at least making the experience free-to-play. It’s believed such a decision was made by Byron Beede, the new General Manager of the franchise and who had been previously leading live service for Call of Duty.</p>



<p>It seems that this time around Battlefield wants to follow a similar to model of Call of Duty and Warzone, where the free-to-play experience brings in the players, with the hope that some cross progression and customization can eventually convert players into premium purchases of the full game with its campaign and multiplayer. </p>

<p>April 2 will go down in history as a monumental day for the Nintendo Switch 2. We finally got a deep insight into the console specifications and how it will perform, but I did not have the Switch 2 nearly being called the Super Nintendo Switch on my bingo card.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 has a release date</a>, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eye-watering price tag</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price of games</a> is a serious conversation to be had. The name of the Switch 2 has barely mustered a whisper, though. We all assumed it would be called the Nintendo Switch 2, it ended up being called the Nintendo Switch 2, and this very nearly wasn’t the case.</p>



<p>An interesting developer interview shows history could’ve looked very different. </p>



<h2 id="h-we-nearly-had-the-super-nintendo-switch-instead-of-the-switch-2">We Nearly Had The Super Nintendo Switch Instead of The Switch 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It would have been cool. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">special interview</a> with Nintendo developers Kouichi Kawamoto, Takuhiro Dohta, and Tetsuya Sasaki was released on the Nintendo website shortly after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 Direct</a> showcase.</p>



<p>Many questions and musings about the Switch 2’s development were posed. Topics covered include cross-platform capabilities between the Switch 1 and Switch 2, improvements in the Nintendo Switch 2, and the device’s name.</p>



<p>One interview question stood out: “However, we haven’t touched on the name yet…How did you land on the name Nintendo Switch 2?” </p>



<p>The answer was interesting: “There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one. We even considered ideas like “Super Nintendo Switch.” However, Super NES, which came out after the NES, couldn’t play NES games. Since Switch 2 can play Switch games, it didn’t feel right to use the same naming convention as Super NES. Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we’d like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo.” So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2,” said Kawamoto.”</p>



<p>So there you have it! The name “Super Nintendo System” was on the cards, but I question how close we were to the name. Nevertheless, it’s a cool detail and one to remember as trivia for obscure Nintendo quizzes in the future.</p>



<p>Should it have been called the Super Nintendo System? Would it have been a neat throwback to yesteryear? Let us know over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-has-put-in-an-offer-to-acquire-the-entire-tiktok-platform.1153071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-big-acquire-tiktok-platform/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As the TikTok ban looms in the United States following President Trump’s extension of the shutdown, Amazon has reportedly made an eleventh-hour bid to acquire the entire platform. This news comes from the New York Times, wherein it was also revealed that <strong>nobody appears to be taking the offer seriously</strong>.</p>



<p>In recent months, a few potential buyers have been touted in the press, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">Bobby Kotick</a> and the owners of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kick-intends-to-buy-tiktok-us/">Kick.com</a>.</p>



<p>Could Amazon be about to acquire the biggest video-sharing platform in the world?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-last-minute-purchase">Last-Minute Purchase</h2>



<p>Amazon could be set to acquire TikTok to prevent the platform from being eradicated from the United States – and to pry it from the hands of its Chinese owners. TikTok faces a nationwide ban in America following concerns being raised regarding the inherent security of the app, given the ties it has to Beijing.</p>



<p>The recent article posted in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/media/amazon-tiktok-bid.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New York Times</a> explains that ‘parties who have been involved in the talks do not appear to be taking Amazon’s bid seriously’.</p>



<p>That might be down to how the bid has surfaced:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The bid came via an offer letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, according to a person briefed on the matter.</p>

<p>Attempts to reach ByteDance (TikTok’s owner) and Amazon have been fruitless, and nobody has any insight into how much Amazon has put forward for the acquisition or to what extent it <strong>could </strong>go ahead. </p>



<p>Amazon already owns Twitch, the premier streaming site that outclasses competing platforms like YouTube and Kick.com. If it were to acquire TikTok, it would have a dominant hold over content creators and streamers worldwide. </p>



<p>Unfortunately for Amazon, TikTok might not be for sale in the first place. In a statement released on January 18, ByteDance revealed a willingness to let TikTok go dark in the United States if the government enforced the ban.</p>



<p>Do you think Amazon buying TikTok is a shrewd move? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you wanted to indicate the power of the Nintendo Switch 2, look no further than this tidbit – <strong>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is coming to Switch 2 when it launches on June 5.</strong> The impending arrival of CDPR’s open-world epic was revealed today during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, stunning fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Dozens of games were revealed for the Nintendo Switch 2, including both brand-new titles and re-releases of older games, like Star Wars: Outlaws and Hogwarts Legacy.</p>



<p>Am I going to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 just to experience Cyberpunk 2077 from an all-new angle? Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a rags-to-riches story like no other. When it debuted in 2020, it was a shambolic title that left people bewildered. It crashed in terms of reviews, fell down the charts, and came under fire from investors and shareholders.</p>



<p>Today, it’s considered one of the best open-world RPG titles ever made.</p>



<p>The turnaround is one for the history books, and although development has officially stopped on the game to facilitate the next title (and The Witcher 4), there’s one last run around the block left in the tank for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>It was revealed earlier today that Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5 when the console hits the market. The Ultimate Edition is the best way to experience the game, given that it’s bundled with Phantom Liberty, a phenomenal expansion that was the first and last major piece of DLC for the game.</p>



<p>Netizens were quick to make jokes about the processing power of the Nintendo Switch, suggesting that Cyberpunk 2077 will look nothing short of laughable on the handheld console, but the new unit has a little more under the hood than the predecessor. It won’t look as good as it can on other platforms, but that’s the sacrifice you make for the convenience of gaming on the go.</p>
