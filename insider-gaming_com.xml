<p>Co-op games are alive and well, and many more are scheduled to be released in 2025 to fraternize with friendships and reinforce relationships—maybe. 2025’s co-op titles ensure plenty of reason to be optimistic if you enjoy playing on a couch with a friend, or online.</p>



<p>I come from a generation of playing PlayStation 1 and 2 games with friends in co-op. The feeling of sitting next to someone and experiencing the same whirlwind of emotions together as you beat a level is something the intangible nature of online co-op can’t replicate. However, I choose online co-op over no co-op at all—which is the way the games industry seemed to be heading for a while.</p>



<p>The art of co-op continues to thrive, and 2025’s biggest partner-up titles are already stirring up emotions again.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-co-op-games-releasing-in-2025">Biggest Co-op Games Releasing in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Who are you? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4 is cutting back on the toilet humor</a>, but this shouldn’t detract from what is sure to be another wild Pandora ride. Co-op has been a big aspect of the series since its debut, encouraging you to team up with other Vault Hunters and take out gun-wielding corporate stooges, and deranged Psychos. Borderlands 4 looks to be more of what we’ve become accustomed to, and I’m so glad I can use a plethora of inane weapons to destroy with friends.</p>



<h3 id="h-killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Ew. Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>As an FPS enthusiast, I really can’t wait for Killing Floor 3. If you love first-person shooters with gory action, gratuitous violence, banging soundtracks, and replayability, Tripwire Interactive’s Killing Floor 3 is the answer. Its stylings and gameplay share a lot in common with modern DOOM, sure, but this isn’t a bad thing. In a world rife with hero, extraction, and military shooters, Killing Floor 3 is a gruesome breath of blood-soaked air. Lock and load with a squad of up to six friends to take down Zeds.</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Disgusting and delightful. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Low and Alone are the new and curiously named protagonists of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>—with the emphasis being on the plural. There are <em>two main characters</em> to escort through a seemingly inescapable journey of hell this time around; and you can do this on your own, switching between the two, or have a second person join you. It’s probably better for your sanity if you have someone to hold onto during Little Nightmare 3’s decidedly hairier moments.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dual dissection. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Dying Light franchise continues with 2025’s The Beast. This standalone sequel sees Kyle Crane return to the main title role—hero of the original—and it’s set some 13 years later. Kyle is a grizzled, zombie-killing veteran at this point, but a second pair of veteran-like hands doesn’t go amiss. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> supports co-op, and buddying up improves your survival chances during the series’ neverending outbreak.</p>



<h3 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</h3>



<figure><figcaption>How to make the best better. Credit to Bandai Namco &amp; FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign was easily one of the most shocking announcements from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>. A fascinating crossover featuring FromSoftware’s Elden Ring world, and the influence of action experts—Bandai Namco Entertainment. It’s not DLC, this is a fully-fledged game, and one of the biggest differences between Nightreign and traditional Elden Ring is co-op. Nightreign allows you to team up into a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trio</a> (not two, sadly) and enjoy the splendor and sickness of an alternate Limgrave in harrowing harmony.</p>



<h3 id="h-stage-fright">Stage Fright</h3>



<figure><figcaption>This ain’t no kitchen. Credit to Ghost Town Games Ltd.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to describe the angst and frustration caused by your fiancé failing to execute a last-minute beef patty throw to earn full stars on a level—but this was part of Overcooked’s charm. Ghost Town Games cooked up magic with the cooking simulation franchise, and the studio is moving to pastures new with Stage Fright. The team’s creativity looks to be in full effect here with Stage Fright promising two distinct worlds playing out side-by-side, and you need to solve puzzles and escape predicaments with a co-op cohort. This is one to keep an eye on for sure.</p>



<h3 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We want a dragon. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, what better way to round out this list? Hazelight Studios is masterminded by the enigmatic auteur Josef Fares. The charismatic director has helmed iconic co-op games, including Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, A Way Out, and It Takes Two—proclaimed GOTY by The Game Awards in 2021. Now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> has the impossible task of trying to one-up It Takes Two, but the early signs are promising, and this task might be possible. It’s designed purely with co-op in mind, and has you taking part in a ton of mini-games and trying out many gameplay-shifting concepts. Split Fiction’s expectations are high, and it includes the lauded “Friend’s Pass” system again—meaning you only need one copy!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/use-the-uchigatana-in-your-new-elden-ring-build-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If your <strong>Elden Ring</strong> build revolves around the Samurai class and move set, chances are you want to track down and equip a second Uchigatana. Even if you’re not playing Samura, knowing where to find the Uchigatana in Elden Ring proves worthwhile, as it is a durable, quick weapon that scales with Strength and Dexterity.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-the-uchigatana-in-elden-ring"><strong>Where is the Uchigatana in Elden Ring?</strong></h2>



<p>You can find the Uchigatana one of two ways, either as starting equipment for the Samurai class, as previously mentioned, or out in the world via a dungeon.</p>



<p>For the latter, <strong>you’ll find the Uchigatana in Deathtouched Catacombs</strong>, in Stormhill, Limgrave, where you’ll have to defeat a few skeletons and activate a lever to unlock the door leading into the hall.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Within the catacombs, fight through the undead until you discover a dead body handing over the edge of the floor. It’s here that you’ll find the Uchigatana.</p>







<h2><strong>How Good is the Uchigatana?</strong></h2>



<p>The Uchigatana in <em>Elden Ring</em> is one of the best early-game weapons, as it is viable for both Piercing and Slash Damage. Furthermore, its Weapon Skill, <strong>Unsheathe</strong>, can help you down most bosses with relative ease early on.</p>



<p>Thankfully, you can <strong>upgrade the Uchigatana using Smithing Stones</strong>, which makes it stronger overall. Over time, the blade will cause bleed buildup, which is ever-useful when dealing with bosses with an increased health pool.</p>



<p>And yes, you can infuse the Uchigatana with <strong>Ashes of War</strong>. These include the likes of Sword Dance, Vacuum Slice, Bloodhound’s Step, Raptor of the Mists, Lighting Slash, Flame of the Redmanes, Carian Grandeur, Bloody Slash, and Seppuku, among countless others.</p>

Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is scheduled for release in April 2025, and will be the first release for the series since Fatal Fury: First Contact in 1999.

<p>Stardew Valley has hit another sales milestone. According to the game’s developer ConcernedApe, the game has sold over 41 million copies as of December 2024.</p>



<p>That total puts it roughly 11 million more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-30-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “over 30 million”</a> it surpassed earlier 2024. According to the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>, 26 million of the 41 million copies have been sold on PC while another 7.9 million were sold on Nintendo Switch. </p>



<p>Released in 2016, Stardew Valley was a solo-developed game that has continued to see major updates nearly nine years later. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-latest-stardew-valley-console-update-is-massive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last major update</a> — 1.6 — saw new festivals and events added along with hundreds of other changes.</p>



<p>In addition to game updates, the game continues to hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-hits-all-time-player-count-eight-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new player count records</a>. Even the music has found its place in the hearts of players with <a href="https://www.stardewvalleyconcert.com/news/new-tour-announcement-sos-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a full orchestra tour</a> performing the game’s soundtrack. Lastly, a recent study found that Stardew Valley was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-best-game-reducing-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best game for reducing stress</a>.</p>
