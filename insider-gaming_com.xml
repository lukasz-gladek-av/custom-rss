<p>Before <strong><em>Fallout 76</em></strong> introduced its Wastelanders update on April 14th, 2020, the massive wasteland of Appalachia felt overwhelmingly bleak and lonesome. It was up to the players and their limited interactions with each other to populate the post-apocalypse with stories and memories. But with Wastelanders, Bethesda introduced countless NPCs to flesh out the game world, along with a few notable allies and romanceable partners.</p>



<h4 id="h-who-wants-to-survive-in-the-wasteland-alone-when-spunky-sofia-daguerre-awaits"><strong>Who wants to survive in the wasteland alone when spunky Sofia Daguerre awaits?</strong></h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>One such ally is Sofia Daguerre, an astronaut with the U.S.S.A. space program. In 2103, she and her ship crashed into Appalachia. Unaware of the recent global nuclear meltdown, Sofia tucked herself away in a Free States bunker until the player discovered her and filled in the details of what went wrong with the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-can-you-find-sofia-daguerre-in-fallout-76"><strong>Where Can You Find Sofia Daguerre in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<p>If you’ve spent any time exploring Appalachia, chances are you’ve unlocked The Mire. You’ll wind up traveling here around level 20 to 25, give or take. Coincidentally, that’s when you’ll receive the quest to recruit Sofia Daguerre.</p>



<p>Once you follow the radio signal included with the quest, you’ll track her last-known position to an Abandoned Bunker just north of a hunter’s shack in the northeast of The Mire. It’s near East Ridge Lookout.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-recruit-sofia-daguerre"><strong>How to Recruit Sofia Daguerre</strong></h2>



<p>Once you’ve located the Abandoned Bunker and worked your way inside, you’ll find Sofia Daguerre injured and sitting on the floor in the final room.</p>



<p>She’ll speak with you momentarily, and then you’ll drop the bomb, explaining how the world came to nuclear war and nothing is left but wasteland and magical pipes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If only it were as simple as starting a conversation to recruit Sofia Daguerre, however. Instead, she’ll task you with the first quest in her quest line. Commander Daguerre asks you to track down the crashed ship she was aboard.</p>



<p>Thankfully, it’s close. Simply head southwest until you reach Gulper Lagoon. From there, head west. You’ll see the crashed ship in the distance. Inside is a flight recorder; take that with you because she wants the information stored within.</p>



<p>We hope you’re prepared because upon activating the flight recorder, you’ll have to wait for the download, which takes two minutes to complete. During this time, a few Super Mutants ambush the player. It’s an easy enough fight if you’re stocked with ammunition or rocking a super sledge.</p>



<p>Upon completion, return to Sofia with the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that’s not the end of the recruitment quest. Did you think it was that easy? Not quite!</p>



<p>Next, Sofia will ask you to locate an encryption key. It’s on a U.S.S.A. robot south of Gulper Lagoon. It’s a generic retrieval quest with zero surprises.</p>



<p>Upon returning the key, Sofia Daguerre will thank you, and you can recruit her to your C.A.M.P.!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-sofia-daguerre-at-c-a-m-p"><strong>How to Get Sofia Daguerre at C.A.M.P.</strong></h2>



<p>Like other companions in <em>Fallout 76</em>, to activate Sofia Daguerre at your C.A.M.P., you’ll first have to build the appropriate item. In this case, it’s a command console. You should have plenty of resources to make the computer by this level in your journey.</p>



<p>From there, you can continue her quest line and tackle a few radiant objectives.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-quests-in-sofia-daguerre-s-quest-chain"><strong>What Are the Quests in Sofia Daguerre’s Quest Chain?</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>Crash Landing</li>



<li>The Woman Who Fell to Earth</li>



<li>One Small Step</li>



<li>In Case of Emergency</li>



<li>Bring Home the Beacon</li>



<li>The Universe Conspires</li>



<li>Hope Remains</li>



<li>Search and Destroy</li>



<li>Heavy Eyes</li>



<li>Patently False</li>



<li>Privacy Violation</li>



<li>Contractually Obfuscated</li>



<li>Boot Camp</li>



<li>Past Expiration</li>



<li>No Brainer</li>



<li>Calling Long Distance</li>



<li>Who Sat Down Beside Her</li>



<li>Lab Rat</li>



<li>Mission Out-of-Control</li>
</ul>



<p>As you can see, companion Sofia Daguerre includes several quests to complete her story arc. That’s not to mention the various radiant quests, including Data Driven, Faint Signal, and Glitchcraft.</p>



<h2 id="h-did-you-recruit-sofia"><strong>Did You Recruit Sofia?</strong></h2>



<p>Did you follow all the steps to recruit Sofia Daguerre in <em>Fallout 76</em>? If not, which companion did you opt for? Let us know in the comments!</p>

<p>Microsoft’s Q2 2025 (October – December 2024) has revealed Xbox’s gaming revenue declined, but saw slight growth in via game pass.</p>



<h2 id="h-cut-to-the-chase">Cut to the Chase</h2>



<p>Xbox’s key points for Q2 2025 are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gaming revenue declined 7% (down 8% CC)</li>



<li>Xbox content and services revenue grew 2% driven by growth in Xbox Game Pass</li>



<li>Xbox hardware revenue declined 29%</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-does-it-mean">What Does it Mean?</h2>



<p>It’s always hard to judge the long term effects of quarterly financials as they don’t paint a broader picture of the company as a whole. On first impressions, Xbox content and services revenue growth by 2% seems like a good indicator for Xbox Game Pass, but during the months in which the hotly anticipated Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 released, I would have expected a little more movement. However, its growth matches Microsoft’s guidance at 2%</p>



<p>Xbox’s revenue decline is something that we should hopefully see changed in the coming months, as Xbox’s new strategy is to release its games across more platforms and thus, increase revenues. But again, it’s somewhat surprising considering a big quarter with Call of Duty. </p>



<p>Xbox’s hardware revenue decline shows a sharp decrease at 29%, which is frankly a shocking statistic during the holiday period. For context, Xbox hardware grew by 3% during the same quarter last year. That being said, Xbox’s new focus on the cloud will undoubtedly have an negative impact on hardware sales.</p>



<p>Would you this of Xbox’s financial results for Q2 2025? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Is there anything like the refreshing taste of an ice-cold Nuka-Cola after finishing an Expedition to Atlantic City? But what if you’re craving something different, like a Nuka-Cola Wild? Here is where to find Nuka Cola Wild in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-nuka-cola-wild-in-fallout-76"><strong>Where to Find Nuka Cola Wild in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<p>You can find <strong>Nuka Cola Wild in Fallout 76</strong> by purchasing one from <strong>Bubbles </strong>at <strong>The Whitespring Resort</strong>. Alternatively, you can find a single bottle at <strong>Eta Psi House</strong> on <strong>Fraternity Row</strong>, just inside the basement, with all of the Nuka-Cola merchandise and theming.</p>



<p>If you intend to visit Bubbles and buy their stock of Nuka-Cold Wild, along with all the other unique flavors, you better bring a fat stack of caps. At almost 40 caps per bottle, Wild will set you back somewhat!</p>



<p>But what makes Nuka-Cold Wild so unique and refreshing? It’s the company’s answer to the ever-popular Sunset Sarsaparilla from out west, toward New Vegas. The soda pop features a distinctive flavor profile meant to compete with Nuka-Cola’s direct competitor, the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company, after the former failed to buy out the latter in a corporate takeover.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-make-your-way-to-huntersville-in-fallout-76-for-power-armor-and-loot">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/huntersville-in-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Make Your Way to Huntersville in Fallout 76 for Power Armor and Loot</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-nuka-cola-wild-stats-in-fallout-76"><strong>Nuka Cola Wild Stats in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to its unique flavor and color, Nuka-Cola Wild has distinct effects that make it ideal for anyone traveling alone in Appalachia for extended periods.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Effects</strong></td><td><strong>Water</strong></td><td><strong>Disease</strong></td><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td><strong>Value</strong></td></tr><tr><td>+5 Rads<br>+40 HP<br>+25 AP</td><td>15%</td><td>0%</td><td>1</td><td>38</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The massive boost to Hit Points and Action Points makes Nuka-Cold Wild in Fallout 76 the go-to beverage for those running low on Stimpaks or running various perks that boost the effects of food and drink items.</p>



<p>The +5 Rads isn’t too terrible, either. You can deal with a bit of radiation, right?</p>



<p>What flavor of Nuka-Cola do you think would taste best in the real world? Let us know your thoughts in the comments, and share a few screenshots of your character in Fallout 76 over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>!</p>

<p>Several Bend Studio contractors have reported on their LinkedIn profiles that they will no longer be working at Bend Studio from February 14.</p>



<p>The news comes just two weeks after it was reported that PlayStation had cancelled two of its live service projects, one of which was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service God of War game</a> by Bluepoint, while the other appeared to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-live-serivce-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service military shooter</a>.</p>



<p>The number of those effected is currently unclear, but according to some posts, only a handful of contractors were given full-time opportunities, while others where let go.</p>



<p>Bend Studio’s game cancelled means that the studio has not published a game since Days Gone in 2019, which sold 7.32 million units by February 2022, a number obtained by the Insomniac Games leaks.</p>



<p>With current game development timelines, it means that almost certainly it will be a decade between Days Gone and whatever is next for Bend Studio.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on if anyone at Bluepoint, who were working on a live-service God of War title has been effected.</p>



<p>What do you think Bend Studio will be working on next? Would you like to see Days Gone 2? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
