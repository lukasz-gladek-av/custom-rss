<p>Ark: Survival Ascended, the controversial upgrade of the 2015 survival game, is getting a major expansion in November titled ‘Lost Colony’. It’s the first expansion designed specifically for the evolved version of the game, and it’s laying the foundations for the eventual release of Ark 2, which still doesn’t have a date.</p>



<p>It was mentioned by Studio Wildcard, the developer behind the Ark ecosystem, that Lost Colony will ‘connect the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and lead into the events of Ark 2.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-connections">Connections</h2>



<p>The link between Ark: Survival Ascended and Ark 2 is front and centre in Lost Colony, which features the vocal talents of Auli’i Cravalho, of Moana fame. She represents Meeka, a character revealed in the 2022 trailer for Ark 2, which also starred Vin Diesel. </p>



<p>To kick off 2025, Studio Wildcard revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2399830/view/526457668016013820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a two-year roadmap</a> for Ark: Survival Ascended that runs until December 2026. It’s relatively safe to assume that Ark 2 won’t be released before then, but if the later updates for Survival Ascended aren’t all that meaningful, perhaps Studio Wildcard could manage with a skeleton crew working on the ‘old game’.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583650/ARK_Lost_Colony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lost Colony</a> looks like a unique expansion at first blush. It’s fused with anime-style cutscene pieced together by MAPPA, a Japanese studio famed for the likes of Attack on Titan and Chainsaw Man. It’s being dubbed a ‘massive canonical expansion pack’ that’ll ease players into the impending world of Ark 2.</p>



<p>Players will get to explore Arat Prime, a frozen wasteland while battling their way through new enemies, exclusive ability trees, and fresh building systems. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Lost Colony and the release of Ark 2? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with Epic Games around Escape from Tarkov Arena, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov explained just how long it takes to develop a single weapon for the popular extraction shooter series. Escape from Tarkov has been on the market for almost a decade, and in that time, it has amassed a staggering arsenal of weaponry, but it’s not all that easy to add <strong>more</strong>.</p>



<p>Typically, new weapons will be introduced with major updates to the game – otherwise known as ‘wipes’. The weapons, Buyanov says, can take <strong>several months </strong>to be designed, created, coded, and balanced in Escape from Tarkov, and by association, Arena.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-putting-in-the-effort">Putting in the Effort</h2>



<p>In the discussion <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-interview-nikita-buyanov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Epic Games</a>, Buyanov, who heads the studio at Battlestate Games, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a long and complex process that requires many iterations. We have a large team of game designers and testers who constantly check and refine the balance. We also carefully listen to feedback from our community. Many people are passionate about&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>&nbsp;and eagerly share their comments and impressions with us.</p>



<p>It’s a very slow and meticulous process.</p>



<p>To fully implement a single weapon in the game, with textures, animations, and all the details, takes about two to three months. It depends on the specific weapon. The fastest one we ever made took about a month, but we already had the animations ready. However, for example, belt-fed machine guns <strong>take an average of four months</strong> to complete.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He stressed that the team has a perfectionist attitude towards new weapons because they’re all ‘gun nerds’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We shoot real firearms very often. This is especially helpful for our programmers who work on the gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p>When you fire a real weapon, you hear it, smell the gunpowder, feel the weight, and experience the recoil, something in your mind shifts, and you start approaching weapon creation in the game with much greater attention to detail.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the extraction shooter might not agree with the perfectionist claims, but the weapons in Escape from Tarkov are being adjusted and balanced all the time in a bid to keep as many people as possible happy. Every time a major update surfaces, it seems a new meta emerges, and that’s often by design.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released this week, ushering in a new generation of Ubisoft’s open-world flagship franchise. In the run-up to the game’s release, the title (and Ubisoft itself) has been criticised numerous times for historical inaccuracy and faced intense backlash from ‘anti-woke’ grifters. </p>



<p>It was recently claimed by sources speaking to a French outlet that Ubisoft has prepared an anti-harassment plan, and that lawyers stand at the ready to pursue anyone attacking the company’s employees on social media.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-preparing-for-the-inevitable">Preparing for the Inevitable</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has already faced mass blowback, which has almost always been related to Yasuke, the African samurai representing one-half of the game’s dual protagonist operating model.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is no stranger to facing aggression online at the hands of keyboard warriors, but the chatter around Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been much more volatile than with any other game in the series.</p>



<p>In the report from <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/assassin-s-creed-shadows-pour-ubisoft-il-s-agit-de-sortir-de-l-ombre-ou-d-y-plonger-un-peu-plus_AV-202503170023.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BFMTV</a>, it was claimed by unnamed Ubisoft employees that an anti-harassment plan has been presented to the CSE in Canada – the Communications Security Establishment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s an initiative from Canada. There’s a team that monitors networks and acts quickly in the event of a targeted attack. Unlike what we’ve had before, this is serious.</p>



<p>Messages posted by internet users on X, Reddit, or even videos on YouTube will be closely monitored by a dedicated unit in order to respond quickly to the slightest problem. </p>



<p><strong>Lawyers are already ready</strong> to file complaints in the event of proven harassment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another claim stressed that Ubisoft has ordered a social media blackout of sorts, advising employees to <strong>not mention </strong>that they work at the company online to avoid harassment.</p>



<p>In a statement handed to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-shadows/ubisoft-anti-harassment-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, Ubisoft’s representatives backed up the initiative to keep employees safe but didn’t mention the specific plan:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our stance has always been that team members’ social media channels are their own. Our top priority is the safety of our employees, including online, which is why, as a standard practice across Ubisoft, we offer guidance on navigating social media, digital safety, and support for team members’ well-being. </p>



<p>We also share resources to help prevent and protect against online harassment, something our teams have unfortunately faced.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released worldwide on March 20. Stay tuned, because later today, my full review of the game will go live and you can get my full impression.</p>

<p>Within the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-esports-organizations-are-flocking-towards-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fledgling pro Marvel Rivals scene</a>, almost all of the pro players play on mouse and keyboard, but one of the best Vanguard players is dominating with a controller in their hands. This rising superstar on the sticks is already playing, and winning matches for a massive esports organization, and showing all the controller players out there that a pro dream is possible for them.</p>



<h2 id="h-meet-ttk-the-marvel-rivals-vanguard-star-playing-on-controller">Meet TTK, the Marvel Rivals Vanguard Star Playing on Controller</h2>



<p>On March 13th, 2025, the 100 Thieves organization officially entered Marvel Rivals, signing a stack of insanely talented newcomers that had been playing under the name Mutants. At the Vanguard position, this 100T roster features Eric “TTK” Arraiga, and the “TopTierKid” is a menace on Magneto and Doctor Strange. And if it wasn’t obvious already, he’s dominating on controller.</p>



<p>In early February, prior to signing with 100T, TTK <a href="https://x.com/TTKIsAvailable/status/1887285537637101796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> to be the first player to reach the number one player rank on two platforms at the same time. He backed this claim up withs screenshots showing himself at the number on spot on both PC and Xbox, with 313 combined competitive wins between the two platforms. According to fellow 100T teammate Vincent “Vinnie” Scarantine, it was one of the best controller-wielding pro players of all-time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/formal-coming-back-to-cod-scump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpTic legend Matthew “FormaL” Piper</a>, that put in a good word at 100T about the roster. TTK’s play also drew attention from content creator star TimTheTatman, who spectated him on stream and covered him in a video that garnered more than 528K views.</p>

<iframe title="SPECTATING THE NEW #1 PLAYER IN MARVEL RIVALS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pE7hO_RRJ28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Fast forward to the 100T roster’s first week of pro play, and the team is already making a case to be considered the best in North America. They are 5-0 and have only dropped two maps, and they’re the number one seed in the playoffs of the NA Marvel Rivals Invitational. During their wins against the likes of Sentinels and FlyQuest, TTK is out-damaging the opposing tanks, and even some of the Duelists on the scoreboard with Magneto and Doctor Strange.</p>



<p>As Marvel Rivals’ pro scene continues to grow, could more controller players reach the upper echelon? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
