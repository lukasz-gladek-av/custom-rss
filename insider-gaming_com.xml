            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon fans appear to have hit the nail on the head with a huge fan theory regarding Pokémon Pokopia, with leaks confirming the speculation.</p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases on March 5, 2026</a>, putting players in control of a playable Ditto that has transformed into a human, with the game’s setting showing islands filled with Pokémon but no humans in sight.</p>



<p>That has led to intense speculation that Pokémon Pokopia takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, and a fresh leak seems to confirm that environment.</p>







<h2 id="h-leaked-pokemon-pokopia-map-shows-post-apocalyptic-kanto">Leaked Pokémon Pokopia Map Shows Post-Apocalyptic Kanto</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Posting on X, <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1996007165002199320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CentroLeaks</a> shared what is claimed to be the Pokémon Pokopia map, and the translation shows that a post-apocalyptic adventure through Kanto is on the cards.</p>



<p>Areas on the map include Fuschia, with “dried up and unfertilized fieldland,” Pewter, “an abandoned mine covered by rocks,” and, perhaps the most telling of them all, the Viridian Area with a “never-ending burning forest of ash.”</p>



<p>All of those areas are well known in the Kanto region, with Fuschia City being the home of the Safari Zone, Pewter City presenting the first gym badge test against Brock, and Viridian Forest being one of the first areas players explore in the world of Kanto.</p>



<p>Additional content, reportedly arriving in DLC or as part of post-launch updates, includes areas for Cerulean, Cinnibar, Lavender, and Celedon.</p>



<p>Ever since the first trailer of Pokémon Pokopia appeared, fans have theorized that the game’s setting would be a post-apocalptic version of Kanto, with major hints including a destroyed first-generation Pokédex and the remnants of buildings like Pokémon Centers.</p>



<p>Fans have also theorised that Peakychu, the mysterious ghost-like version of Pikachu, is the deceased version of Red’s partner Pokémon Pokopia, and Mosslax, a Snorlax covered in greenery, is the same Snorlax that players in the Kanto region are tasked with waking up by using the Pokéflute.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether those theories are true, and it could be that Pokémon Pokopia takes place in an alternate universe away from the main franchise. </p>



<p>While this may seem far-fetched, Pokémon has blown open the doors to craziness with the likes of time-travelling in Pokémon Legends: Z-A and wormholes in Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon.</p>

<p>LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is finally getting the long-awaited, and heavily rumored, Ninjago collab next week, with the official account posting the first teaser.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s LEGO-themed survival mode is now entering its second full year since release, and, after a period of a huge drop in updates to the mode, the biggest collab so far is poised to be introduced.</p>







<h2 id="h-lego-fortnite-ninjago-coming-december-11">LEGO Fortnite Ninjago Coming December 11</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New island? Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a teaser post on Twitter, the official LEGO Fortnite account told players to “get ready to master a new adventure in Odyssey,” which will arrive on December 11.</p>



<p>Although it did not mention Ninjago outright, there were big teasers in the emojis that were posted alongside the message, showing an ice cube, a lightning bolt, a cloud, and a Ninja.</p>



<p>The post also confirms when Fortnite’s first major update of Chapter 7 Season 1 will be, which will also see the return of Fortnite OG with a new season, and will set the scene ahead of the Winterfest event later this month.</p>



<p>Rumors of a Ninjago collab coming to LEGO Fortnite have been widespread for a while, and the arrival of the collab will be the biggest update since the Lost Isles update in September 2024.</p>



<p>Since then, the only major update to the mode was the addition of split-screen support, and there had been discontent among the community for the lack of content updates.</p>



<p>However, the Ninjago update on December 11 should appease those concerns with a host of new content, similar to what was introduced in the Lost Isles update and the LEGO Star Wars update.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Horses Is The New Viral Horror Game Banned On Steam & Epic Games Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/horses-is-the-new-viral-horror-game-banned-on-steam-epic-games-store/</link>
            <guid>1371412</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Horses was banned at the final hour by Steam and the Epic Games Store due to the game’s unsettling and controversial content, but you can still buy the viral horror title.</p>



<p>The initial premise of Horses seems quite simple: You’re on a two-week break working at a farm. You perform standard tasks, such as feeding the farmer’s dog and tending to the ‘horses.’ It becomes quickly apparent that they aren’t normal horses, and the game quickly descends into a host of horrifying and inhumane themes.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-deals-holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and Epic didn’t like this much.</p>







<h2 id="h-you-can-still-buy-horses-elsewhere">You Can Still Buy Horses Elsewhere</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Yes, a carrot. Credit to Santa Ragione Game Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Mere hours before its launch, <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Horses</a> was banned from Steam and the Epic Games Store. If anything, this has furthered the game’s profile with people desperate to understand why.</p>







<p>Take a look at this content warning on the Horses website to get an idea of what to expect:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This game contains scenes of physical violence, psychological abuse, gory imagery (mutilation, blood), depictions of slavery, physical and psychological torture, domestic abuse, sexual assault, suicide, and misogyny.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Insider Gaming has seen lots of the game’s footage and the aforementioned content—it’s just as perturbing and disturbing as you can imagine. The Epic Games Store says Horses is still “Coming Soon,” but you don’t have to wait, as the horror game is available to buy on GOG. </p>



<p>The ban decisions could be overturned in the future, especially if Santa Ragione Game Studio fights back, and popularity in the title explodes. Insider Gaming will continue to monitor Horses’ status.</p>



<p>If you’ve played Horses, now’s your chance to share. Is the full game as psychologically damaging as it’s made out to be? Was Steam and the Epic Games Store right to ban it?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/</link>
            <guid>1371409</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An artist whose art was stolen by Bungie’s Marathon has now claimed that the issue with Bungie and Sony has been resolved to her satisfaction.</p>



<p>The news came more than six months after the artist took to <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to say that Bungie had used the assets she created in 2017 without permission. Back then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/artist-accuses-bungie-of-plagiarizing-work-for-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she claimed</a>, “The Marathon alpha released recently, and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017.”</p>







<div><p>The claim was almost immediately picked up by Bungie, who said,</p><p>“We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game.</p></div>



<p>This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to @4nt1r34l to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.</p>



<p>As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission.</p>



<p>To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions.</p>



<p>We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.”</p>



<div><p> But now, the issue has been fully resolved, with the artist saying,</p><p>“The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.”</p></div>



<p>As to the extent the issue was resolved, that will likely never be shared, but Sony and Bungie have seemingly gone to great lengths to ensure the artist has been fully compensated and/or reached an agreement. </p>







<p>Bungie’s Marathon is scheduled to release by the end of this fiscal year (by April 1st, 2026).</p>



<p>What do you think the artist got to resolve the issue? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a>.</p>
