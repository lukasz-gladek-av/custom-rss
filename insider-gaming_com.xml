<p>Hours ago, Steam hit a new milestone – <strong>40 million peak concurrent users </strong>online on the platform. This monumental figure was secured with 12 million players worldwide being <strong>in a game </strong>as the total number crept over the 40 million mark.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, the most recent estimates suggest that Microsoft has sold around 30 million Xbox Series consoles since they debuted in 2020. That means that even if every person who ever bought an Xbox Series X or Series S were to log on simultaneously, they’d still need <strong>10 million people </strong>to hit Steam’s peak player count.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impressive-stuff">Impressive Stuff</h2>



<p>Steam is a powerhouse of a platform, and PC gaming is exploding. Recently, it was revealed in a data-driven report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-gaming-outperforming-consoles/">PC gaming has been outpacing</a> ‘living room console’ revenue since 2011. Collectively, the PC gaming market has earned 225% more than ‘combined console’ spend in the last decade or so.</p>



<p>If you think about it for a moment, it becomes pretty incredible.</p>



<p>At one point in the last few hours, <strong>40 million people </strong>were online on Steam all at the same time. That’s more than the population of Canada, and it almost beats the population of Greece, Portugal, Hungary, and Switzerland <strong>combined</strong>.</p>



<p>It was recently estimated that Microsoft has managed to shift around 30 million Xbox Series consoles since 2020, pacing far behind Sony with more than 70 million PlayStation 5 sales. That means that more people are using Steam right now than have purchased Xbox consoles in a five-year window.</p>



<p>It’s apples and oranges as Steam has built up that repository of users over a <strong>very long period</strong>, but it’s certainly indicative of the wider power of PC gaming. It has even been estimated that Xbox Game Pass has around 34 million subscribers, so Steam trumps that as well.</p>



<p>Are you one of the 40 million? Let us know what you use Steam for in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-cena%E2%80%99s-gta-6-post-has-fans-speculating-like-crazy.1123446/</guid>

<p>Recently, John Cena blew minds across the WWE universe after turning against Cody Rhodes at the Elimination Chamber PPV. This major heel turn comes as his retirement tour unfolds, and while many predicted it, it’s still surprising.</p>



<p>Following the win at Elimination Chamber, the 47-year-old superstar took to social media to post a promotional image of Grand Theft Auto 6 with no caption or context. This has fuelled speculation online, with fans of both the franchise and the iconic athlete believing that John Cena could be in GTA 6.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-highly-unlikely">Highly Unlikely</h2>



<p>Nobody understands why John Cena would post a promotional image for GTA 6 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/johncena/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on his Instagram page</a>, but he did it, and that’s all we know.</p>



<p>To be fair, his bio suggests we should anticipate posts like this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These images will be posted without explanation, for your interpretation. Enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s up to us to decide what the post means, then.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many have surmised that it’s Cena’s take on the ‘before GTA 6’ meme that has run rampant on social media in the past few months.</p>



<p>‘We got a John Cena heel turn before GTA 6’, kind of thing.</p>



<p>It’s not unheard of for celebrities to appear in a Grand Theft Auto game, but it <strong>is </strong>unlikely that Rockstar Games or Take-Two would have ‘allowed’ Cena to make the post if he were involved with the game. That’s just too much of a spoiler.</p>



<p>Cena has more time on his hands now, so perhaps he has lent his voice and acting talents to the next iteration of the Grand Theft Auto series. Who knows? He appeared in PGA Tour 2K23, and Take-Two was the publisher for WWE games for many years, so he has a connection to Take-Two in some way.</p>



<p>What role could you see John Cena taking up in GTA 6? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-minor-ii-la-thieves-win/</link>

<p>The LA Thieves have secured their first sizeable win in the 2025 Call of Duty League season, beating Vancouver Surge in the grand final of Minor II. The series came down to the wire, with Vancouver riding high on a string of wins that exemplified how dominant the amended roster has been recently.</p>



<p>Vancouver Surge was able to overcome Boston, FaZe, and Toronto before putting up one hell of a fight against the LA Thieves in the grand final. Ultimately, it was LAT that walked away with the $20,000 prize and the 30 CDL points that pushed the squad into second place in the season standings.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minor-win-major-gains">Minor Win, Major Gains</h2>



<p>The CDL Minor structure is a brand-new concept for the 2025 season. It’s designed to split up the qualifying stages and give players a cash prize to work towards, and it’s a ‘winner takes all’ event. Each stage will have a Minor and a Major, and the first one, which took place before Major I in Madrid, was claimed by Atlanta FaZe.</p>



<p>This time around, it was the LA Thieves that shone, with the team having earned a bye thanks to their seeding in the regular season. The squad picked apart Cloud9 and the Royal Ravens to unlock the grand final, at which point they stomped Vancouver Surge to claim the number one spot.</p>



<p>It was a clockwork tournament for the LA Thieves, but other teams didn’t fare so well.</p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe struggled to hit the mark and collapsed against Vancouver Surge, taking it to a game five and falling short in the final SnD. OpTic Texas clashed with Falcons and secured a win but lost with a 0 – 3 scoreline against Toronto Ultra.</p>



<p>The fixture against the Vegas Falcons saw history <strong>almost </strong>being made. The Falcons put up a solid fight in the opening Hardpoint and managed to secure a 3 – 0 win in Control. The first round of Search also went down to the wire, with round eleven being needed for OpTic Texas to win the game.</p>



<p>That could have been a <strong>very </strong>different story.</p>



<p>We now look to Major II, which will take place from March 20 – 23 in Texas. The power players could be starting to shift, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-plummets-map-win/">OpTic Texas will be in trouble</a> if it doesn’t sharpen up ahead of the home Major.</p>

<p>Small Indie Company has revealed that We The People will be playable during Steam’s Zombie Fest event, which starts on May 26 and runs to June 2. We The People is a tactical first-person shooter that has been in development for a few years at Small Indie Company. It’s inspired by games like Escape from Tarkov, Fallout, and Rainbow Six, and at first blush, it looks great.</p>



<p>I was fortunate enough to put the team at Small Indie Company to a few questions back in 2023. What I learned about We The People excited me, and in the latest devlog, the squad revealed the innovations and enhancements applied to the developing title over the last few months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-evolving">Evolving</h2>



<p>We The People will launch on Steam in early access <strong>when it’s ready</strong>. There’s no date for the game to hit the market just yet, but a playable demo will surface on May 26, giving gamers a limited window in which to test out the latest upgrades.</p>



<p>In a devlog posted on March 1, which was the first posted since April 2024, the team revealed what it had been working on for almost a year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Our Biggest Update Yet | Devlog #5 | We The People" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bw9Gn3k3Sf8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The key upgrades to We The People are centered around immersive in-game elements like recoil, weapon malfunctions, and suppression mechanics. The team has also fine-tuned throwables and the inventory menu, as well as optimised environments and tweaked movement mechanics.</p>



<p>This is all based on feedback secured during the last playtest.</p>



<p>We The People is set in a post-apocalyptic rendition of the United States, and that wasteland, you’re ‘one of the few left amongst the living dead’. I learned how all this would work when I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-the-people-game-interview/">caught up with Small Indie Company in 2023</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>In many ways, we acknowledge we’re standing on the shoulders of giants like EFT and DayZ, and want to pay homage to them, show a level of irreverence for the work they’ve done and continue moving the extraction genre forward in a meaningful way.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re looking at We The People as a love letter to the genre, something that people will get to watch grow over time.</em>&nbsp;<em>We know what we want to provide in terms of a&nbsp; minimum viable product leading to our Early Access launch on Steam, as well as long-term plans for the game’s evolution over time</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Back then, I learned that the plan is to host in-game auction houses that operate on a peer-to-peer level, as well as vendors, dedicated questlines, and progression systems. There are desires to build out a safe zone which acts as a ‘hub’ central to the extraction shooter formula.</p>



<p>We The People <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2261560/We_The_People/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be wishlisted on Steam</a> ahead of the next playable demo going live.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Twisted Metal Reboot Would Have Been a Third-Person Battle Royale, Images Reveal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twisted-metal-cancelled-battle-royale/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twisted-metal-reboot-would-have-been-a-third-person-battle-royale-images-reveal.1123098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twisted-metal-cancelled-battle-royale/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In February 2024, we reported on the cancellation of a new Twisted Metal game. The project was scrapped just a couple of months before the debut of the Twisted Metal live-action adaptation. The news came hand-in-hand with the revelation that a whopping 900 employees would be laid off, almost wiping out the studio making the game. </p>



<p>Not much was known or revealed about Twisted Metal when it was cancelled. It was confirmed that it had been in development ‘for some time’, but that’s as far as we got. Now, thanks to a former developer from Firesprite, the studio that was working on Twisted Metal, we know much more about the ill-fated title.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battle-royale-of-course">Battle Royale, Of Course</h2>



<p>On the portfolio site of a former UI lead who worked at Firesprite between 2022 and 2023, a few blurred images of the Twisted Metal title, along with a bit of context, were discovered.</p>



<p>Here’s what the UI programmer, Hugo Silva, <a href="https://www.hugoflsilva.com/project/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote about Twisted Metal</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Project Copper was a 3rd person vehicular action combat game, it was based on a classic IP owned by PlayStation developed by Firesprite (PlayStation Studios) it had 3rd person shooter mechanics wrapped with 3rd person vehicle combat with the objective of being the last one standing.</p>



<p>I joined the team as the Lead UI Programmer and had to create the base UI system to be within the company moving forward, after establishing the system I had to start working on the bespoke needs of the project while managing the UI code team and being the bridge with the UX and UI art teams.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The images are branded with the blocker ‘UNDER NDA’, but it’s not exactly difficult to work out what game he’s referring to based on the information provided.</p>



<p>Sadly, the screenshots reveal something that could be stripped clean out of Fortnite, which is hardly impressive. The third-person perspective fused with vehicular combat and boots-on-the-ground fighting mechanics is hardly a fresh concept, and it might not have moved mountains were it ever released to the wider market.</p>



<p>Do you think a Twisted Metal battle royale would have done well? Let us know in the comments what you think.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-teases-%E2%80%98verdansk-collection%E2%80%99-that%E2%80%99s-set-to-drop-on-march-10.1123095/</guid>

<p>If you head to the Call of Duty merch store, you’ll be met with a pop-up promoting the ‘Verdansk Collection’, which comes with the tagline ‘drop back in’. There’s also a countdown set to expire on March 10, which has many thinking that the return of Verdansk will be formally announced on that day.</p>



<p>It has long been rumoured that Verdansk will make a grand return on March 20, five years after it first appeared when Call of Duty: Warzone debuted worldwide. It was Insider Gaming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively revealed the plans</a> to bring back Verdansk, the iconic first map in the insanely popular battle royale game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-coming">It’s Coming</h2>



<p>The prompt on the <a href="http://shop.callofduty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty shop</a> bears an iconic throwback to Verdnask – an image of the damn and the crashed plane in the wastelands beneath. It’s a snowy vista that we’ve all seen time and again, and on March 10, the full ‘Verdansk Collection’ will be revealed, whatever it may contain.</p>



<p>Fans have been chomping at the bit to get back to Verdansk since it was removed from the game in 2021. I’ve maintained that we don’t miss Verdansk, but the vibes we experienced playing it with our friends for the first time. The world was a different place back then, struggling under the weight of COVID-19, and Warzone made for a flawless escape from all that.</p>



<p>However, it’s not all sunshine and lollipops, as some prolific creators have stressed that even Verdansk isn’t enough to bring them back, given the state of the game. It’s no big secret that Warzone still has issues with performance, network stability, and cheaters.</p>



<p>Let’s hope all that is resolved (big hope) by March 10 – and even more so by March 20.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-looks-like-daily-rewards-are-coming-back-to-call-of-duty.1123023/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/daily-rewards-coming-back-to-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a post published on social media by a Call of Duty dataminer, it was suggested that a daily rewards system could be coming to Black Ops 6 when season three drops in March. The season is expected to bring back Verdansk in Warzone for the first time since 2021, so it makes sense that teams are anticipating ways to retain players to make the comeback much more worthwhile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-day-new-rewards">Every Day, New Rewards</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 doesn’t feature a daily login bonus system – even the free rewards periodically unlocked in the store have been paltry. Most players report getting endless strings of Double XP tokens and nothing else, whereas in previous games, players could get charms, sprays, calling cards, and emblems, all for free.</p>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1895867334948241728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post from realityuk_</a> on Twitter, that might be set to change.</p>



<p>While the dataminer has uncovered nothing more than a menu and a prompt, it’s enough to assume that daily rewards are coming back when season three hits later this month.</p>



<p>In one image, Reality found a ‘Daily Login Reward’ pop-up that read:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To earn all rewards, log in on 7 seperate days before unclaimed rewards expire.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This hasn’t been addressed or even alluded to by the teams working on Black Ops 6, and as it’s a datamined asset, it’s worth taking the imagery with a pinch of salt. These things are always subject to change, unfortunately.</p>



<p>It’s nice if it’s true, though. Despite the state of Warzone right now, the return of Verdansk is guaranteed to bring players flooding back, and nothing makes players happy like free items.</p>



<p>It was suggested recently by a Call of Duty leaker that Verdansk is returning to Warzone as ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/">pretty much the OG version</a>‘ that was released in 2020. That was when Warzone was created, becoming one of the most popular battle royale games in history as tens of millions of players flocked to the title.</p>



<p>Will you be taking advantage of free daily rewards if they come to Black Ops 6? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
