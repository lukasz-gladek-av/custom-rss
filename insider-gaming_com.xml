<p>Reliable industry insider Jez Corden has revealed details about Fable’s alpha gameplay footage, indicating that the game’s style is similar to CD Projekt Red’s.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmNZUoJnqdg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Xbox Two</a> podcast (as shared by <a href="https://x.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1858632263761883513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ZakkenKloot</a> on X), Jez Corden discussed seeing some alpha gameplay footage for Fable and expressed his excitement by describing it as “fantastic.” However, Corden is uncertain about the timeline for this alpha build.</p>



<p>Corden discusses how the alpha gameplay footage of Fable contains elements reminiscent of “CD Projekt Red DNA.” He explains that Playground Games has hired several developers from CD Projekt Red, including a combat designer.</p>



<p>From the combat footage, he can identify where the inspiration originates. While the gameplay isn’t an exact replica of The Witcher, it features similar mechanics. Furthermore, the footage looks “super polished” for an alpha build.</p>



<p>Moreover, Corden revealed that Fable’s alpha gameplay footage showcased various weapon types, including bows and arrows, spells, and melee weapons—similar to those used by Geralt. He also discusses the design of certain enemy types, featuring comedic and frightening elements for chickens and werewolves. Overall, he felt that the gameplay looked impressive, and the combat was “very tight” for an alpha build.</p>



<p>In other news, Alan Wake 2 has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1.8 million copies</a>. Also, Pokemon TCG Pocket reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed $120 million in earnings</a>.

<p>The Indie Game Awards have announced the full list of award categories and nominees for its inaugural show on December 19.</p>



<p>In total, there are 15 awards up for grabs at the event with 63 games vying for awards in music, gameplay design, innovation, narrative, and more. Two awards, Storyteller and Industry Impact, didn’t have a list of nominees announced. Instead, those two awards will be announced specifically during The Indie Game Awards show.</p>



<p>“Narrowing down 365 days of remarkable indie games across the 15 categories was a gargantuan task for our curation jury,” The Indie Game Awards co-creator Mike Towndrow told Insider Gaming. “But the list we’ve landed on is a killer reflection of how much the indie scene has stepped up this year. </p>



<p>He added: “Take the Game of the Year category, for example. Those 10 games represent an incredibly diverse range of elements we all look for when discussing some of the greatest games of all time. They’re a perfect snapshot of how indies continue to push the boundaries and drive the industry forward.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, Game of the Year, the biggest award of the show, has 10 games nominated. Those games include 1000xRESIST, ARCO, Animal Well, Balatro, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Neva, Nine Sols, UFO 50, Mouthwashing, and Crypt Custodian.</p>



<p>“Our goal is for The Indie Game Awards to become the definitive annual celebration of the indie scene,” Towndrow said. “That endgame vision is made possible through the deep collaboration we’ve built with fellow indie showcases, organizations, journalists, content creators, and, of course, the developers themselves. </p>



<p>“And this is just the beginning. We’re more motivated than ever to expand that collaboration and scale, bringing even more individuals into the fold to make The IGAs a staple of the indie scene—a celebration that breaks through into the wider gaming industry.”</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of nominees below. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of The Indie Game Awards when they air on December 19 at 7pm ET.</p>
