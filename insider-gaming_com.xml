<p>Most members of The Seven were taken over by The Herald’s Chrome in Chapter 3, Season 4. They were absent from the game for nearly 3 years before the February road map revealed their return. </p>

<p>More layoffs have hit the gaming industry.</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, Ubisoft has laid off 40 employees at its Toronto studio. The job cuts are reportedly part of larger cost-saving initiatives. Other parts of these initiatives have included the closure of Ubisoft Halifax, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">cancellation of multiple projects</a>, and other major restructuring measures.</p>



<p>“This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected,” Ubisoft said in a statement before confirming that they would help support these employees through their transition.</p>



<p>Ubisoft also confirmed that the company is still working on the remake of the original Splinter Cell game. The remake was announced in 2021, and no gameplay footage has been revealed yet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ubisoft is not the only company facing major changes and cuts in 2026. Wildlight Entertainment, makers of Highguard, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-failed-layoffs/" id="176078">announced mass layoffs</a> less than a month after that game launched.</p>



<p>Riot Games recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">downsized the team</a> developing the 2XKO fighting game. Moonshot Games, the developer of Wildgate, also recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wildgate-developer-moonshot-confirms-layoffs/" id="171549">confirmed several layoffs.</a> GTFO developer 10 Chambers was also hit with a significant restructuring, recently<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gtfo-developer-10-chambers-confirms-mass-layoffs-in-major-restructuring/" id="176851"> confirming a large number of layoffs.</a></p>







<p>The layoffs are not only exclusive to the game development side of the industry. Clickout Media, owner of sites such as The Escapist and Esports Insider, is undergoing mass layoffs amid a pivot to AI-generated content.

            <title><![CDATA[What Is The Prototype In Poppy Playtime Chapter 5?]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There aren’t many games out there with a more horrifying story than Poppy Playtime: orphans taken in only to be experimented on and converted into horrifying, life-sized toys. It’s enough to make anyone’s skin crawl, but there’s one that stands out from the rest—the Prototype.</p>



<p>Forget Huggy Wuggy and his grizzly smile, or Catnap’s hauntingly vacant eyes, it’s the Prototype that’s the real monstrosity. Although he’s long been teased throughout the previous chapters, he’s finally had his big reveal in Chapter 5, and it was well worth the wait. </p>







<p>But it wasn’t just his appearance that was shown off, as some significant lore was dropped, and it’s something every fan needs to know. If you’re interested, read on, but be warned! There are plenty of spoilers ahead for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-prototype-look-like-in-poppy-playtime">What Does The Prototype Look Like In Poppy Playtime?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sorry Huggy! Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>After years of waiting, the Prototype has finally been revealed in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5, and he’s as monstrous as you could ever imagine. </strong></p>



<p>The Prototype is a towering mechanical-organic monstrosity with a cracked porcelain jester face locked in a wide grin. Its thin torso reveals a faintly glowing core, while long skeletal arms end in sharp, needled fingers. Below the waist, its body fuses into a spider-like machine built from factory scrap, giving it multiple jointed metal legs and an unsettling, towering presence.</p>

</ul>



<p>What makes the creature especially disturbing is how it upgrades itself by scavenging the remains of other toys. Embedded into its frame are salvaged parts like the arms of Mommy Long Legs, Kissy Missy, and Huggy Wuggy, along with a purple fur hide, red gas canisters, and the emitter taken from CatNap.</p>







<p>All in all, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the Prototype is a menacing villain, but it’s the creature’s origin that’s somehow even more haunting…</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-the-prototype-in-poppy-playtime">Who Is The Prototype In Poppy Playtime? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t hold her too tight, she might crack… Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s revealed in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 that the Prototype is actually Experiment 1006, with the human identity of Oliver Ludwig, son of Elliot Ludwig and (likely adopted) brother to Poppy Ludwig, who was the inspiration for the Poppy Playtime dolls.</strong></p>



<p>It would explain why the Prototype is seemingly protective of Poppy, and he even appears confused and distraught when he cracks her porcelain head at Lily Longbraids’ tea party, as if it were an accident. </p>

</ul>



<p>Of course, there’s still confusion surrounding what the Prototype wants, but it could explain why they presented themselves to the protagonist as a child named Ollie in Chapter 3—maybe it wasn’t entirely fake after all, and there’s still some remnant of Oliver inside the Prototype?</p>



<p>That’s for the theorists amongst you to decide, although more is bound to be unveiled in what will eventually be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 6 of Poppy Playtime</a>. Until then, there’s plenty of room to speculate—that’s most of the fun, right?</p>
