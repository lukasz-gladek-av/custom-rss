<p>Team Vitality has secured a prestigious place in the grand final of the Budapest Major after a thrilling semifinal victory over Team Spirit, one of the favorites to go all the way. In one of the most anticipated fixtures of the tournament, the powerhouse platform of Vitality easily overcame Team Spirit, issuing a 2-0 sweep to kick the Russian side out of the running.</p>



<p>Now, Team Vitality will wait patiently in the grand final slot, and Natus Vincere and FaZe Clan will duke it out for a shot at the grand final and the $500,000 prize.</p>



<p>If you want to place a wager on what’s left of the playoffs, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025.

<h2 id="h-team-vitality-navi-and-faze-remain-in-budapest">Team Vitality, NAVI, and FaZe Remain in Budapest</h2>



<p>Team Spirit had one heck of a run thus far, with donk going so far as to set a new record, but it wasn’t enough to beat Vitality to the punch in Budapest. The first map of the series, Mirage, proved to be a tenuous enough battle, going long into overtime, but the second map, Dust II, was much easier for Vitality to handle.</p>



<p>Vitality has had a remarkable run in Budapest. The team failed to secure a perfect record in the tournament’s third stage ahead of the playoffs, but the squad has made up for that in the bracket by refusing to drop a single map.</p>



<p>The streak has been enough for ZywOo to rack up a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zywoo-secures-record-for-best-map-performance-starladder/">new single-map Major record</a>.</p>



<p>In our recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/budapest-semi-finals-predictions-and-betting-tips/">predictions piece for the semi-finals</a>, we accurately predicted that Team Vitality would make it through to the grand final, and we also suggested that Natus Vincere would rise to meet them. The accuracy of that prediction will be revealed very soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic Director Says Game Will Release Before 2030]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-release-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Star Wars: The Old Republic Director, Casey Hudson, has hit back on the rumors and speculation that his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-years-away-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game will not release until at least 2030</a>.</p>







<p>Speaking on X, Hudson said, “Don’t worry about the “not till 2030” rumors. Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!”</p>



<p>Of course, the post was met with a lot of optimism from players, with some jokingly saying it means the game is confirmed to launch in November – December 2029.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-4-years-of-development-doable">Is 4 Years of Development Doable?</h2>



<p>One of the most serious questions asked after Hudson’s tweet was whether a four-year development cycle is even feasible in this day and age—Afterall, Hudson’s studio, Arcanaut Studios, only formed in the summer of this year. </p>

<p>Typically, AAA games of Star Wars: The Old Republic’s magnitude would usually take between 6 and 8 years of development. This includes the conceptualization and research of the project, which can take a couple of years. It’s possible, given Hudson’s previous work, that the game could already be good to go in terms of what it will be, and the only thing needed is the talent to make it. </p>







<p>Regardless, Hudson’s denial of the rumors in the grand scheme of things squashes negative talk of the game, and even if the game does end up releasing in 2030 and beyond, by that point… Who really cares?</p>



<div><p>On the game’s announcement, Aranaut said on the game,</p><p><strong>“Blending innovative storytelling, memorable characters, and heart-pounding combat,&nbsp;Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic&nbsp;will immerse you in an unforgettable experience where every decision deepens your journey toward the light…or the darkness</strong>.”</p></div>
