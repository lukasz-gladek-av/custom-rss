            <title><![CDATA[Battlestate Head Responds to Tarkov Support Ticket in the Most Nikita Way Possible]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlestate-nikita-respond-tarkov-support-ticket/</link>
            <guid>1443049</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In case you’re not at all connected to the extraction shooter space, you should know that Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlestate-games/" id="1450">Battlestate Games</a>, can be a little confrontational on social media. The prolific developer, who has more than 350,000 followers on Twitter (now X) alone, has long been known for having zero filter when it comes to public-facing comments.</p>



<p>From suggestions on how to improve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> to condemnation of how Battlestate handles in-game issues, Nikita stares down hundreds of targeted posts and comments every day. Recently, one of those incoming comments was regarding a support ticket for Tarkov, which Nikita responded to in classic fashion.</p>







<h2 id="h-inflammatory-isn-t-the-word">Inflammatory Isn’t The Word</h2>



<p>On social media, Nikita Buyanov found himself, as he often does, sharing teaser clips of upcoming Escape from Tarkov updates. He often shares short mash-ups of real-world scouting, team activities, development footage, and weapons and attachments that are about to land in Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter game.</p>



<p>He did just that on February 21, uploading footage teasing the upcoming Tarkov event that will welcome Icebreaker to the game in a new, super-sized event.</p>



<p>In the comments, <a href="https://x.com/JborgKasper/status/2025177817642598489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one user wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have been playing this game since 2019 and been supporting in, and im not getting the support i think i should!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nikita, being a man of the people, took an interest in this user’s comment and asked what he needed from him. Lo and behold, a support ticket reference was handed over, and it took Nikita just an hour to deduce what was going on:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>you used radar cheat</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The response has since racked up 150,000 impressions, many of which are the result of Nikita’s fans backing him in this very ‘Tarkov-like’ scenario. Many praised Nikita’s transparency and bagged on the original poster for exposing themselves. Shortly after, the player who posted the comment declared they’d never cheated in their lives, but it’s not hard for Battlestate to detect such activity.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape From Tarkov With Nikita - EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcetkc8gq1w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov has long had a problem with cheaters, which Nikita himself has referred to as fighting a multi-headed hydra. It’s the fight of a lifetime for many multiplayer-focused developers, but Battlestate Games and Escape from Tarkov often get it in the neck more than your average studio.</p>



<p>Of course, Nikita went a bit wavy shortly after, when another user commanded him to get off Twitter and optimise Escape from Tarkov, to which <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/2025236246625484871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he responded</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>don’t f***ing tell me what to do boy. i want to sit on twitter a little, before i will go and personally optimize the game</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Nikita</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Digital Price Surfaces Online At £89.99]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-digital-price-appears-online/</link>
            <guid>1443046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eagle-eyed gamers eager to determine the pricing structure for this year’s release of Grand Theft Auto 6 have stumbled on a digital listing for the game on Xbox. While it’s almost certainly a placeholder, the listing has the price of the standard game at £89.99, which would likely result in a $99.99 price tag in the United States.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that the same site also has an option to purchase a PC code for the <strong>Rockstar Games Launcher</strong>, and that version is boasting a more acceptable pricing point of £60.99, a random number indeed.</p>







<h2 id="h-placeholder-prices-are-pretty-common-for-gta-6">Placeholder Prices Are Pretty Common for GTA 6</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first proposed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">GTA 6</a> pricing point we’ve seen in recent months, and it certainly won’t be the last.</p>



<p>The latest indication regarding GTA 6’s expected price comes from Loaded, formerly CD Keys. The digital storefront has long been a purveyor of game and DLC codes for almost every major platform in the space. It’s favored heavily by PC gamers because it often offers cut-price codes, even at launch.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 surfaced recently on the site, bearing an £89.99 tag for the Xbox version of the game, and a £60.99 tag for the <strong>PC </strong>code.</p>



<p>Right now, there’s no indication that GTA 6 will be launching on PC alongside console platforms in November. We’ve also seen <strong>no confirmation </strong>from Rockstar or Take-Two regarding the game’s price, which has long been a point of contention in the gaming space.</p>



<p>For some, this could be the most expensive ‘standard game’ ever released, with the bottom-most tier of the game running up a bill of anything from $70 to $100. If Loaded’s placeholder price is any kind of accurate, we’ll see the price edge towards the latter end of that scale.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Digging deeper into the <a href="https://www.loaded.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-pc-rockstar-games-launcher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTA 6 Loaded listing</a>, we can see basic descriptors about the game. There’s a summary, screenshots procured from Rockstar’s official slate, and information suggesting it will come with online multiplayer at launch.</p>



<p>It’s nothing to write home about, and you could bet safe money on this being an arbitrary placeholder, but you never know, right?</p>



<p>Case in point, Loaded also has a listing <a href="https://www.loaded.com/state-of-decay-3-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for State of Decay 3 on PC</a>, and that’s one of the most veiled games in the business right now. It was announced years ago and doesn’t have any kind of release window, but Loaded believes it’ll drop at £19.99 when it hits, which is almost <strong>definitely </strong>incorrect.</p>



<p>How much do you think GTA 6 will end up costing? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>New Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma discusses what she likes in video games. She also admits she’s got a lot to learn in her new role.</p>



<p>Asha Sharma became the head of Xbox on February 20, 2026, following a shake-up that saw Phil Spencer retire and Sarah Bond leave the company. She’s tried to be an engaging CEO in her first 24 hours, outlining her<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai/" id="178392"> vision for AI in Xbox’s future</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-ceo-responds-to-fans-desire-for-console-exclusives/" id="178442">responding to gamers on social media</a>. Still, her background at Microsoft saw her leading the CoreAI division.</p>



<p>Before Microsoft, she held top positions for Instacart and Meta. While those are successful companies, they don’t exactly scream “gaming.” As such, Sharma knows she has a lot to learn in her new position.</p>







<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-on-what-she-likes-to-see-in-video-games">Asha Sharma on What She Likes to See in Video Games</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a>, Sharma was quoted as saying that she likes games with deep emotional resonance. She also touted the game Firewatch as a game that resonated with her emotionally.</p>



<p>Sharma plans to win over core Xbox gamers and earn the right to be trusted. She hopes to develop consistency over time that will lead to a stronger relationship with the player base. “I’m coming into gaming as a platform builder,” Sharma noted.</p>



<p>In response to a social media comment, she even listed her three favorite games: Halo, Valheim, and GoldenEye.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Moving forward, she will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/matt-booty-full-memo-following-promotion-to-cco-of-microsoft-gaming/" id="178377">work closely with Matt Booty</a> to enact her initiatives. Sarah Bond will assist her and provide guidance during the transition before her exit from Microsoft.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 will once again include MyFACTION, a single-player mode that competes with NBA 2K’s MyTeam and EA Sports FC’s Ultimate Team. It offers a collection-oriented experience centered on in-game trading cards. </p>



<p>Players start with a specific pack of wrestlers and then use in-game points or virtual currency to purchase new packs that improve their team.</p>



<p>As with most sports and live-service games in 2026, microtransactions are part of the experience. In the case of WWE games, microtransactions will allow you to get a specific card of a specific player needed for a specific event. Now, the team behind the mode is discussing their philosophy on microtransactions in MyFACTION.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-designer-says-they-try-to-provide-extra-benefits-for-players-who-pay-for-myfaction-content">WWE 2K26 Designer Says They Try To Provide Extra Benefits for Players Who Pay for MyFACTION Content</h2>



<p>Interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/wwe-2k26-myfaction-interview-talking-microtransactions-and-mixed-gender-matches-with-the-popular-modes-leads/">VGC</a>, Terrell Carter, MyFACTION’s lead designer, explains that he and the team try to give players an extra benefit for spending real-world money.</p>



<p>Internally, the hope is that they don’t make players feel they have to make purchases like that to use any of the game’s features. Still, if the purchase is made, they want them to feel there is as much upside as possible.</p>



<p>“So we try to give more content based on those things, rather than be ultra restrictive. Hopefully, it doesn’t feel ultra-restrictive to the players,” he said.</p>







<h2>Team Chemistry is A Major Feature in This Year’s MyFACTION Mode</h2>



<p>2K recently announced that a new mechanic called team chemistry would be a major focal point of this year’s MyFACTION. With 60 in-game traits that can have positive and negative effects on your team, there are plenty of scenarios that will play out depending on your specific team’s chemistry.</p>



<p>For example, Carter says that if your team has bad chemistry, it could fall apart when Partners refuse to tag each other. Luckily, there’s a way to circumvent that: a new teleport option this year that draws on fighting games like Marvel vs. Capcom and places them in the WWE environment. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-myfaction-adds-team-chemistry-and-quickswap/" id="178385">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Toronto KOI has just secured a win after an eight-match losing streak in the Call of Duty League. The team managed to produce a huge 3-0 sweep over Minnesota G2, putting out something of a masterclass while flexing the new talent in the recently promoted Kips. The young competitor came up from Challengers, departing the Huntsmen and moving into the League.</p>



<p>It was a much-needed victory for Toronto KOI, especially in the run-up to Major II, which will take place in the United Kingdom for the first time in six years.</p>







<h2 id="h-toronto-koi-manages-to-secure-a-win">Toronto KOI Manages to Secure a Win</h2>



<p>Toronto KOI, which rebranded ahead of this season after dropping the Ultra moniker, has pulled off a sweep against Minnesota G2. The Call of Duty League has not been kind to Toronto KOI this season, and the team currently sits in 10th place in the overall season standings.</p>



<p>That being said, today’s fixture against G2 could be an indicator of things to come, now that Kips has taken up a spot on the roster after moving up from the Huntsmen. To make space for him, Reeal was pushed out.</p>



<p>Kips admitted in a post-match interview that his first series with Toronto, which was a 0-3 loss to FaZe Vegas, was him getting his feet wet. He now has a win under his belt in the Call of Duty League, and it was secured against a Minnesota side that hasn’t been performing too badly of late.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Minnesota went on something of a run at Major I in Dallas, Texas, in January. The squad pushed FaZe Vegas into the lower bracket and eliminated Miami Heretics from the tournament before falling in a <strong>very close </strong>redemption series against FaZe.</p>



<p>Toronto’s next fixture will be <strong>next Saturday </strong>against Miami Heretics, followed by a series against Paris Gentle Mates, this season’s Major I champion side. Will Toronto remain resilient?</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/midsummer-studios/" id="1480">Midsummer Studios</a> has closed, but not before giving a look at a life simulator that the team was working on.</p>



<p>The studio was founded by XCOM designer Jake Solomon, and it was Solomon who shared on social media that the studio was closing its doors but wanted to provide a look at a game called Burbank. According to Solomon, the game was a mix of The Sims and The Truman Show, the film starring Jim Carrey that focused on a man discovering that his life was a television series.</p>



<p>“We built a studio, we made a game, and I’m really proud of both,” wrote Solomon. “This game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us,” he said in his post.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into.</p><p>It's like "Life Sims + The Truman Show," but it's more than that. I believe people are… <a href="https://t.co/RuYvDhdEZO">pic.twitter.com/RuYvDhdEZO</a></p></div>— Jake Solomon (@SolomonJake) <a href="https://twitter.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>











<p>Jake Solomon later stated in a social media post that the characters in the pre-alpha trailer he shared were generated by AI. However, he insists that the studio had no intention of replacing any developers with AI.</p>



<p>“Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That’s what let’s you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing <em>any</em> developers with AI,” he wrote.</p>
