<p>FromSoftware is set to bring back its best-selling Dark Souls game for a new audience. According to a new claim, Dark Souls 3 is getting the remaster treatment from the studio.</p>



<p>The report comes from known leaker “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shpeshalnick.xboxera.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shpeshal Nick</a>” Nick Baker, who made the reveal during the latest episode of his Xbox Era podcast.</p>



<p>“A lot of people will probably file this under ‘this was obvious’,” he said. “What I have heard is that we are getting a Dark Souls 3 remaster.”</p>

<p>Baker hinted that he had more information on the remaster, but wasn’t “allowed to pass that on”.</p>



<p>First released in 2016, Dark Souls 3 is the best-selling Dark Souls game with over 10 million copies sold. As a franchise, Dark Souls has sold over 35 million units since its debut in September 2011. It also helped fully establish the Souls-like genre that a number of games have utilized in recent years  like the Nioh series, Lords of the Fallen, and more.</p>

<p>Roblox has added new parental controls to its platform to protect children.</p>



<p>Roblox announced the new parental control and safety measures on Monday. The measures aim to give parents and caregivers more control to protect children. Roblox says that some of these changes will be made immediately, starting today, whereas other features will be rolled out next year.</p>



<p>These new features will enable parents to see exactly how long their children are spending on Roblox and view their friends list. They will also enable parents to set a daily limit on the amount of screen time children can have on the platform.</p>



<p>The company also revealed that children under the age of 13 would no longer be able to send direct messages to other users by default unless a parent or guardian changes the setting. Roblox will also launch a slew of new content labels that will make it easier for children and parents to decide what content is age-appropriate. These four new categories will be “minimal,” “mild,” “moderate,” and, “restricted,” which will be the strongest category and could contain “strong violence, heavy realistic blood, moderate crude humor.”</p>



<p>Users under the age of 9 years old can only access “minimal” or “mild” content and will need parental consent for “moderate” content. </p>



<p>You can read the full changes on the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/11/major-updates-to-our-safety-systems-and-parental-controls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s website here</a>.</p>



<p>Roblox has come under a lot of scrutiny in the past couple of years because it lacks online safety for young children. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-gets-banned-in-turkey-over-concerns-of-child-exploitation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turkey banned the platform because of concerns about child exploitation</a>. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-player-numbers-inflated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report in October</a> also revealed that it found the trading of child pornography in some of its games.</p>



<p>What do you think of Roblox’s new safety changes? Let us know in the comments or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/828/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> has given players plenty of content to dig their teeth into. Not only are there two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-saug-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapons</a> and a variety of cosmetic rewards to unlock in the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> for the game, but there’s more planned to release throughout Black Ops 6 Season 1’s duration.</p>



<p>The Hit List event will arrive in BO6 Season 1, and if you’re interested in the details, such as its release date, rewards, and more, here’s everything we know so far.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-6-hit-list-event">When is Black Ops 6 Hit List event?</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Hit List event will arrive on <strong>November 21, 2024, at around 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT</strong>. </p>



<p>The event tab is now in the game with a countdown to its release, so this is how we know exactly when the limited-time event will be arriving.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-hit-list-event-in-bo6">What is Hit List event in BO6?</h2>



<p>Hit List is a <strong>limited-time event</strong> coming to Black Ops 6 during Season 1 and it <strong>offers players a chance to earn rewards via in-game challenges</strong>. </p>



<p>We don’t yet know what these challenges are, but the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> revealed that the event will give players a “board of contracts” that they will need to take out. Taking out these hit list contracts in-game will grant players exclusive rewards. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-hit-list-event-rewards">Black Ops 6 Hit List event rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty are yet to reveal the official rewards, but based on the promotional image for the Black Ops 6 Hit List event, we can assume that players will be working towards earning the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shadow Perk (Strategist)</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-sirin-9mm-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirin 9mm</a> Secondary</li>



<li>Power Drill Melee Weapon</li>



<li>CoD Points</li>
</ul>



<p>It seems players will be able to get the new weapons through this event, as well as the new Shadow Perk, which makes you undetectable by enemy traps and mines.</p>



<p>We expect more on top of this, but these are some of the rewards seen in the promotional image for the Hit List event. Previous Call of Duty events have also had cosmetic rewards like Calling Cards, Emblems, and more, so perhaps those will be up for grabs too.</p>
