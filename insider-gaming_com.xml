<p>There are so many indie games, but it feels like not all of them get the attention they probably deserve. The Awesome Console Showcase 2025 was designed to showcase those games, and it did so with its debut broadcast on Tuesday, October 28.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtXqQbu1oPU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">broadcast started</a> at 2pm ET/11am PT, and, over the course of 25 minutes, featured games from indie studios coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo. Included in the 18-game showcase were Antonblast, Bad Cheese, Laysara: Summit Kingdom, Anthem #9, and more.</p>



<p>You can check out everything that was announced during the event below, including the full showcase. Be sure to let us know your thoughts on the showcase in the comments, or join this and more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>. It‚Äôs worth noting that everything is in the order it was shown.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 REDSEC Battle Royale is the game‚Äôs marquee BR mode. A Solo playlist is the ideal avenue for BF 6 owners who prefer to walk in isolation like calculated lone wolves. Let‚Äôs check out the latest Solo news for Battlefield 6 BR. </p>



<p>Even though it can be an absolute sweatfast full of campers and players desperate to occupy most windows and keep bathroom corners warm, Solos has a certain charm to it in battle royale. You‚Äôre relying on yourself, so it‚Äôs technically <em>your </em>fault if you die. There‚Äôs also an added feeling of anxiety knowing there are over 100 of you all vying to be the final player left standing‚Äîknowing every footstep could be one move toward your next elimination, or your own demise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-bf-pro-battle-pass-worth-it-battlefield-6-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> introduced the fabled REDSEC battle royale mode after launch. It has the electric <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gauntlet-mode-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gauntlet mode</a>, but let‚Äôs see if Solos gets any love.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-solos-in-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-right-now">Can You Play Solos In Battlefield 6 REDSEC Battle Royale Right Now?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>But, why? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield Studios has opted not to include a Solo playlist at Battlefield 6‚Äôs REDSEC battle royale launch.</strong></p>



<p>Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger! We‚Äôre just as disappointed as you are, and it really is a glaring oversight and an odd omission from REDSEC. There are no figures to back this up, but don‚Äôt be surprised if Solos is the most popular battle royale mode across all BR games.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs just easier for an individual player to pop in, without needing a squad, and trust their own survival instincts. REDSEC‚Äôs launch debuted with two playlist options: <strong>Duos and Quads</strong>‚Äîbut no Solos.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-solo-in-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale">Is There Any Way To Play Solo In Battlefield 6 REDSEC Battle Royale?</h2>



<p><strong>The only way to sort of play Solos is to join a random team in Duos or Quads and play your own game in Battlefield 6 REDSEC battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>No, this isn‚Äôt genuine Solos, and yes, we know‚Äîbut what else are you going to do? Duos is about as close as you‚Äôre going to get for the time being, and, to be honest, there‚Äôs a good chance <strong>many players will do the same thing</strong>.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs likely many Duos lobbies will be full of teams in name only, and both players are acting independently of one another. You too can do this, and go to the opposite end of the map to your ally if you want to prove a point.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-solo-playlist-coming-to-battlefield-6-redsec-br">When Is Solo Playlist Coming To Battlefield 6 REDSEC BR?</h2>



<p><strong>EA or Battlefield Studios hasn‚Äôt specifically mentioned Solos in any of its press releases or blog posts, but the use of ‚Äúat launch‚Äù in a blog post is a dead giveaway that a Solo mode is coming.</strong></p>



<p>Logically, more content will be added to Battlefield 6‚Äôs REDSEC BR. There‚Äôs no direct mention of Solos in the Battlefield 6 Season 1 roadmap, and, again, we still find the lack of Solos bizarre.</p>



<p>However, a Season 1 roadmap <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-full-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> does say this: ‚ÄúREDSEC‚Äôs Battle Royale experience is built on Battlefield‚Äôs foundation of iconic all-out warfare, tactical destruction, and squad-based gameplay defined by its Class System. The standard Battle Royale match holds up to 100 players in either four-player squad or duo formats <strong>at launch</strong>.‚Äù</p>



<p>It‚Äôs coming, we all know it‚Äôs coming. Once it does, or it gets leaked, we‚Äôll be the first to update you.</p>



<p>You can now vent your anger in the comments about Battlefield 6‚Äôs crazy decision to leave out a Solo playlist. Is Solos the best way to play battle royale?

<p>Battlefield‚Äôs REDSEC Battle Royale mode has launched, with plenty to sink your teeth into, and completing missions is a vital step to obtaining the best loot and securing victory.</p>



<p>Landing at the start of season 1, REDSEC in Battlefield has a variety of modes, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gauntlet-mode-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mission-focused Gauntlet</a>, but these missions are also available in the standard Battle Royale modes.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre looking for a breakdown of all the missions available in REDSEC Battle Royale inside Battlefield, we‚Äôve got the definitive guide you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-redsec-battle-royale-missions">All REDSEC Battle Royale Missions</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Heavy support. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Missions are optional side quests that appear during a REDSEC match, providing a bunch of XP and valuable rewards to help you in the fight.</strong></p>



<p>Only one mission can be activated at a time, with any squad member able to select one to be completed. Once a mission is accepted by one player, no missions can be selected by another player in the squad until later in the match.</p>



<p>Rewards are available for successfully completing each mission, ranging from Rare Weapons and Drop-Ins to immediate access to Custom Weapon Drops, and a Vehicle Key Card required for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-tanks-in-battlefield-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaining access to a Tank</a>. Missions can be both PvP and PvE in nature, though the PvP aspects with other players in the Battle Royale will be constant.</p>



<p>Additionally, some missions will appear as a ‚ÄòCounter Mission‚Äô, which indicates a nearby squad is completing a mission and tasks you with disrupting their plans. This almost always involves head-to-head combat with enemy players, however, so only dive into these when you feel you are prepared for a battle.</p>



<p>The table below details all of the mission types that can appear in REDSEC Battle Royale, and details on how to complete them.</p>
