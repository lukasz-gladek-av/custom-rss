<p>Steam has once again proven that PC gaming is on the up, securing a new all-time high peak user count and notching up 39,205,447 concurrent players. This record came during a busy weekend that saw the successful launches of Marvel Rivals and Path of Exile II in early access, among others.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Steam has gone from strength to strength in recent years, seeing a sharp increase in user activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and never really slowing down since. The data revealed in charts on SteamDB tell the story from the last twenty years:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The ‘A’ flag on the chart is the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. This event saw millions of gamers worldwide locked down by their respective governments, and more than ever before turned to gaming and content creation as a way of occupying their time – and perhaps making a little money.</p>



<p>That of course warranted a massive growth in the number of PC players around the world.</p>



<p>This weekend, the popular PC platform hit almost 40 million concurrent users – a staggering number by all accounts. Since 2024 kicked off, Steam has been soaring, but some games understandably contribute to that success much more than others.</p>



<p>For example, Counter-Strike 2 maintains a regular 24-hour peak of around 1.5 million users, with PUBG and Dota 2 coming in behind with around 700,000 players. This weekend, Marvel Rivals hit a peak of almost 500,000 players, and Path of Exile II, which is in early access, stormed the charts and racked up 578,000 concurrent users.</p>



<p>It’s worth highlighting that the number displayed is <strong>peak concurrent users</strong>. That doesn’t mean they’re actively playing a game, they’re just <strong>online </strong>on Steam. At the time that the 39 million mark was hit, just over 12 million users were playing games.</p>

<p>On December 6, Grand Theft Hamlet was released across the UK and Ireland in select theatres, and it’s coming to streaming platforms next year. This zany representation of Shakespeare’s work was planned, performed, and recorded entirely in GTA Online by Pinny Grylls and Sam Crane, and it’s making a wealth of impressions on critics worldwide.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, the ‘documentary’ has won awards at film festivals everywhere, including SXSW, Vancouver, and Philadelphia, and it scooped a prize and several nominations at the British Independent Film Awards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-yes-it-s-real">Yes, It’s Real</h2>



<p>When I say ‘Grand Theft Hamlet’, that’s what I mean. It’s a story showcasing the telling of Shakespeare’s Hamlet <strong>in </strong>Grand Theft Auto Online.</p>



<p>The idea was concocted by Sam Crane during the COVID-induced lockdown in the United Kingdom in 2021, and he roped in Mark Oosterveen to star alongside him. Pinny Grylls was eventually brought in to direct the documentary, which is proving to be a rip-roaring success with critics and viewers.</p>



<p>The recently released theatrical trailer gives you an indication of the origins of the project:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET  | UK theatrical trailer | IN CINEMAS FRIDAY 6TH DECEMBER from TULL STORIES" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLpGIHjwhNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Most of the documentary is spent unveiling the trials and tribulations of the team making their way towards the ultimate performance, which unravels at the end of the 90-minute flick.</p>



<p>The reviews speak for themselves. In <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/grand-theft-hamlet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Empire</a>, Grand Theft Hamlet was dubbed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘…a riotously funny, unexpectedly poignant ode to gaming, Shakespeare, the indestructible nature of art, and the benefits of befriending bazooka wielding extraterrestrials.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://theface.com/culture/grand-theft-auto-gta-hamlet-film-mubi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Face</a>, Grylls explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that it’s also important to think about the fact that&nbsp;<em>GTA Hamlet</em>&nbsp;is not really just a&nbsp;film of the play. It’s a&nbsp;story about this crazy adventure to try and put on this play which seems impossible. It’s a&nbsp;kind of comedy adventure story and it was edited to be really, really entertaining and fun, like the big eighties blockbuster movies Sam and I&nbsp;grew up watching, like&nbsp;<em>Back to the Future.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>This isn’t the first time a video game has been used as a platform for a production like this – but it’s certainly the most impactful occurrence. </p>



<p>For instance, the ‘Wasteland Theatre Company’ in Bethesda’s Fallout 76 pieced together and staged a performance of Shakespeare’s works in the post-apocalyptic MMORPG a year or two ago.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is taking the gaming world by storm, and NetEase just revealed that the hero shooter hit 10 million players in just <strong>three days</strong>. It’s aided by the fact it’s a free-to-play, multi-platform title, but it <strong>also helps </strong>that Marvel Rivals is a solid game that stands as a real competitor to games like Overwatch and Deadlock.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ignite-the-battle">Ignite the Battle</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the NetEase team revealed:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/marvelrivals/status/1865909229070016851
</p></figure>







<p>Marvel Rivals offers a breathtaking experience with an unparalleled roster of Marvel-based heroes. From Wolverine to Moon Knight, and from Iron Fist to Thor, players are finding their main and enjoying every second of Marvel Rivals, which is set to challenge the hero shooter paradigm held by the likes of Overwatch for many years.</p>



<p>On Sunday evening, Marvel Rivals <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launch-performance-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured a new all-time high</a> on some platforms, including Steam. On PC, Marvel Rivals hit 480,990 peak concurrent users, putting it above the likes of Fallout 4, Helldivers 2, and Grand Theft Auto 5. The volume of users trying to get into the game has presented some server issues in various regions, but it’s nothing that has marred the overall launch of the game.</p>



<p>The game has also carved out a sizeable piece of the global streaming estate, netting a peak viewer count of 278,000 users on Twitch and sitting in the platform’s top ten categories by viewers.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blue-protocol-return-new-name-studio/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco%E2%80%99s-failed-%E2%80%98blue-protocol%E2%80%99-is-back-but-under-a-new-name-and-studio.1055412/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/blue-protocol-return-new-name-studio/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In August, Bandai Namco and Amazon Games confirmed the cancellation of Blue Protocol, which failed to surface in Western markets after flopping in Japan. This ‘anime MMO’ is being taken offline forever in January after having been in development since <strong>2015</strong>.</p>



<p>It seems that’s not the end of the road for Blue Protocol, though.</p>



<p>Recently, a Chinese studio named Shanghai Bokura Technology – a Tencent subsidiary – revealed a game called Star Resonance, a PC and mobile-based MMORPG that’s looking like a second outing for Blue Protocol.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-for-the-better">Back for the Better</h2>



<p>A recent report published by <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/blue-protocol-star-resonance-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simulation Daily</a> explained that Blue Protocol’s licensure was provided by Bandai Namco to Tencent’s Shanghai Bokura. The new game, named Star Resonance, is deeply reminiscent of Blue Protocol, the cancelled and failed MMORPG.</p>



<p>Sure enough, I managed to dredge up <a href="https://www.bokura.com.cn/news/3b747306-41d1-419c-b137-2a341bd3c80e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> published by Shanghai Bokura several months ago that confirmed a collaboration between itself and the Bandai Namco team that originally worked on Blue Protocol.</p>



<p>The press release mentioned Star Resonance (which wasn’t named back then) is ‘based on the world view’ of Blue Protocol but is a completely different game to the one that was released in Japan. </p>



<p>With that being said, the trailer certainly showcases something as close to Blue Protocol as you could hope to get:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Resonance ACGN style MMO-ARPG based on the Blue Protocol IP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ee2wT-3n3TU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Here’s a snippet from that press release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“PROJECT SKY BLUE” is a project team jointly formed by Bandai Namco Online Inc. and Bandai Namco Studios Inc., aiming to create a new entertainment IP that can move the world, and is responsible for the planning and development of its content. With the online action role-playing game “Blue Law” as one of the core contents, various developments are being planned.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many prospective fans were disappointed by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blue-protocol-shut-down-bandai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of Blue Protocol</a>. Perhaps Bokura’s Star Resonance can fill that gap that was created in their lives.</p>

<p>It’s all stations go in the streaming world today as Ludwig announces a return to Twitch after a three-year platform hiatus <strong>and </strong>Adin Ross reveals he’s stepping down from Kick.com ‘indefinitely’. These bombshell announcements left the content creation community reeling, but Ross’ revelation was much more impactful than Ludwig’s tidbit.</p>



<p>Multiple streamers have returned to Twitch in recent weeks, particularly as exclusivity deals with YouTube dry up and expire.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ludwig-and-ross-back-on-twitch">Ludwig and Ross Back on Twitch</h2>



<p>Adin Ross has an obstacle to overcome before he makes it back to Twitch, and that’s his permanent ban from the popular streaming platform. The controversial creator has cleaned up his act in recent months, but will it be enough to sway the Twitch leadership team and earn him a prestigious spot back on the site?</p>



<p>In a post on Twitter, Adin Ross revealed his split from Kick.com:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I will be making a full video on why I am leaving Kick indefinitely. I am stepping down officially and will be going into detail about this this week. I will tell you all everything.</p>



<p>With that being said, I am going to fully focus on being reinstated on Twitch. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere, Ludwig, one of the world’s most popular streamers, revealed <a href="https://x.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1865882864652546356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a video on social media</a> that after three years of YouTube exclusivity, he’s back on Twitch. Recently, Ludwig scooped the Best Streamed Event award at The Streamer Awards, and he’s still got  more lined up for the future.</p>

<p>Following the highly successful launch and return of Fortnite OG, it has been claimed that some matches can have up to 90 bots in a single game.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable Fortnite data miners and leakers such as <a href="https://x.com/osirion_gg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">osirion_gg</a>, who’s claimed that Fortnite OG lobbies will have 90 bots per match in low skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) lobbies. Low SBMM lobbies are essentially players who are not good at the game, so they need to be matched with similarly skilled players, or in this case, a huge amount of bots, to make them feel like they are doing well when playing.</p>



<p>According to leakers, the move was made because of the influx of skilled players returning to Fortnite because of Fortnite OG, which likely led to lower-skilled players not having fun and not playing. The same leaker also said that in high SBMM lobbies, there are only ten bots and 90 real players. </p>



<p>Following the leaks, several videos of players that appear to be low-skilled bots have <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1865513248457474262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">surfaced online</a>. </p>



<p>SBMM has become a huge discussion in recent years, with players arguing that it makes them less inclined to continue playing multiplayer games. On the flip side, Activision, who has implemented a stronger SBMM system in Call of Duty in recent years argues that it has seen an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-reveal-sbmm-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improvement in player retention because of it</a>. </p>



<p>Epic Games is yet to officially comment on the addition of bots and skill based matchmaking in Fortnite, but if there is an official announcement, we’ll be sure to update this article.</p>

<p>There’s something eerily exciting about a game set in the ‘post-apocalypse’. They’re typically morbid, darker adventures that see players tackle all the threats that come with surviving in a world devastated by a virus or a nuclear holocaust, but despite those bleak elements, they’re often highly enjoyable experiences. In this list, we’re taking a look at the best post-apocalyptic games ever.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-post-apocalyptic-games">What Are The Best Post-Apocalyptic Games?</h2>



<p>There’s a huge library to work with, as post-apocalyptic games are traditionally quite good sellers that are able to ultimately stitch together expansive universes that traverse as a series of unique releases. Some of them will even go on to spawn post-apocalyptic movies, books, or television shows.</p>



<p>So, what are the best post-apocalyptic games? Let’s find out.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-fallout-4">1. Fallout 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fallout 4 is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic games you’ll ever play. It’s expansive and it embodies the ‘wasteland vibe’ perfectly. It wasn’t a favourite of the die-hard Fallout fans because it became more ‘mainstream’ and sold out a little, but it’s a solid choice and offers hundreds of hours of entertainment in one of the most engaging maps in the game’s history.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-the-last-of-us">2. The Last of Us</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Last of Us (and later, Part II) was a smash hit when it was released back in 2013 exclusively on PlayStation 3. It became an overnight sensation and birthed one of the most memorable and emotional post-apocalyptic stories in gaming history. With the player getting the opportunity to travel across the outbreak-ravaged United States, it’s easily one of the top titles on offer in the post-apocalyptic scene.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-metro-exodus">3. Metro Exodus</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Metro is a legendary series that was a novel before it became a best-selling video game. In Metro, the player embarks on a perilous journey through the subways of Moscow, with the above-ground environment having been turned into a post-apocalyptic nightmare. In Exodus specifically, an open-world formula was introduced, and the player went far beyond Moscow…</p>



<h3 id="h-4-half-life-alyx">4. Half-Life: Alyx</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Half-Life: Alyx is one of the best VR games ever made, and it’s set in a gritty, harrowing post-apocalyptic world that never fails to keep you on your toes. Following a cataclysmic event during an experiment at a research facility, portals are torn open to alien worlds that instantly threaten Earth.</p>



<p>As Alyx, you’ll take a journey through a world torn apart by alien oppressors and invaders. Every step is fraught with danger, and you’ll need to scavenge, fight, and hide to survive. </p>



<h3 id="h-5-horizon-zero-dawn">5. Horizon Zero Dawn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Horizon Zero Dawn (and later, Forbidden West) boasts a unique story that lends itself perfectly to this post-apocalyptic games list. It’s a gorgeous game on the surface, making use of cutting-edge technology to deliver a visual display that amazes the player. It’s marvellously well-written, boasts a star cast, and has some of the most innovative combat we’ve seen for years. </p>



<h3 id="h-6-gears-of-war-3">6. Gears of War 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s no list of the best post-apocalyptic games that doesn’t include Gears of War – and in this case, we’re looking at the third game in the series. This all-out action-packed saga sees enormous men in hefty suits of armour fight to defend their home planet from an uprising of subterranean mutants.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-dying-light">7. Dying Light</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dying Light (and 2022’s Dying Light 2) emerged into the post-apocalyptic world of games as one of the most fast-paced and high-octane titles in years. It dropped in 2015, bringing a parkour-fuelled, zombie-slaying adventure to gamers the world over. In Dying Light, the stage was set, and in Dying Light 2, the world fell so much deeper into its apocalypse.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-fallout-3">8. Fallout 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We’ve already named Fallout 4 on this list, but a special space must be reserved for Fallout 3. This is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever made, and it was a turning point for the franchise itself when it was released. It introduced gamers to a massive, open-world bursting at the seams with danger and destruction, and even fifteen years later, it’s still a fan-favourite game.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-left-4-dead">9. Left 4 Dead</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left 4 Dead was designed to be a cooperative slayer of sorts, but it fared well as a single-player game nonetheless. If you’re listing the best zombie games, you can’t help but mention Left 4 Dead, and even though it has some years today, it remains one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever. It’s littered with bloodthirsty zombies, one-liner quips, and pure, unbridled violence.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-dead-rising">10. Dead Rising</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dead Rising is an iconic zombie series that only just makes this list by way of technicality. It’s one of the best post-apocalyptic games, but in this series, it’s usually just one area that’s impacted by a zombie outbreak – like a town or a shopping mall. Regardless, all the Dead Rising games boast large, open worlds, thousands of zombies to slay, and more weapon-crafting mechanics than you could shake a sharp stick at. </p>







<hr>



<p>Do you agree with this list, or are there other post-apocalyptic games you’d like to see featured?</p>

<p>GTA 6 is set to be the biggest release in gaming history. It was <strong>more than a decade ago </strong>that GTA 5 hit stores worldwide, and players are nothing short of hungry for another instalment in the legendary series. It’s safe to assume that GTA 6 will be the most ambitious game ever made, but I’ve put together a list of the top 10 things GTA 6 should <strong>bring back.</strong></p>



<p>Some of the best features from past GTA games have long since been phased out, but many of these mechanics simply must be in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>Here’s the list.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-10-things-gta-6-should-revive">10 Things GTA 6 Should Revive</h2>



<p>Let us know in the comments if there’s anything you’d like to see return to Grand Theft Auto in GTA 6.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-euphoria">1. Euphoria</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Euphoria made GTA 4 feel so much more realistic, especially when it came to the NPCs taking fire or the weightier feel of cars when they were being driven. This was lost in GTA 5, so it’d be good to see GTA 6 be more realistic in the realm of physics.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-character-customisation">2. Character Customisation</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In San Andreas, players could customise the protagonist – Carl ‘CJ’ Johnson – much more than in any other game. They could tweak his hair, tattoos, clothing, muscle definition, and even how people viewed and respected him on the street. We need that back.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-get-a-job">3. Get a Job</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Okay, so it wasn’t <em>technically </em>getting a job, but in older Grand Theft Auto games, players could assume the role of a firefighter, paramedic, and even a police officer. It allowed them to unlock some bonuses and kill time, and it would be great to see similar content resurface in GTA 6.</p>







<h3 id="h-4-turf-war">4. Turf War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In GTA San Andreas, kicking off a gang war to secure turf was always entertaining. With enough effort, a player could take over most of the in-game map – and then defend that turf. I’m not sure if GTA 6 could facilitate something like this, but I’d be happy to take <strong>anything </strong>over and gain some benefits from it.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-expansions">5. Expansions</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>GTA 4 had The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, Red Dead Redemption had Undead Nightmare, but GTA 5 had absolutely nothing. I’d love to see some additional content added post-launch to GTA 6. It’s one thing that has always confused fans of GTA 5 – why was there never any extra content added?</p>







<h3 id="h-6-property">6. Property</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In GTA Online, players can buy plenty of properties – including businesses. I’d love to see that make a bold return as one of the top 10 things GTA 6 should feature – let us invest in businesses like in GTA 5 and purchase penthouses, apartments, and garages like in GTA Online, and customise them. In San Andreas, you could own <strong>dozens </strong>of properties.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-crime">7. Crime</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>That might seem like a silly thing to highlight, but I’d love to see more <strong>criminal activities </strong>surface in GTA 6. If I’m going to be the bad guy (and girl) then I want to commit some diverse crimes. I want to burgle homes, break into cars, hold people up, steal their valuables, and even carry out some pettier crimes – perhaps Rockstar could let us spray tags around the map again, huh?</p>



<h3 id="h-8-fun-with-friends">8. Fun with Friends</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Let’s get back in the bowling alleys and the nightclubs, let’s go back on dates with love interests, and let’s go to a comedy club and take in a show. In GTA 4, we could do all of that and more, and it always made Liberty City feel quite alive, despite the game itself being quite morbid and gritty. It even featured Ricky Gervais in a stand-up role.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-duke-it-out">9. Duke it Out</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>GTA San Andreas let the player learn a range of hand-to-hand fighting styles in gyms dotted around the map. In GTA 4, the protagonist was ex-military, so his combat skills were top-notch, but a hand-to-hand fight felt satisfying, weighty, and at times, quite challenging. Let’s have that back in GTA 6 – give us realistic hand-to-hand combat abilities that we can upgrade over time.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-bizarre-cheats">10. Bizarre Cheats</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It might not be one of the top 10 things GTA 6 needs, but it’s something that many gamers would love to see. Look at San Andreas – it featured dozens of cheat codes, some of which were bizarre, but they were fun to enable. Sure, they’ve been replaced by mods in this day and age, but kooky cheat codes were always entertaining.</p>
