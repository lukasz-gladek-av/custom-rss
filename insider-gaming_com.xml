<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s associate creative director has explained why the timeline doesn’t allow for Wall Runs.</p>



<p>Activision’s latest Call of Duty installment, Black Ops 7, is all set to arrive on November 14, 2025, with the developers conducting open beta testing until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-beta-has-been-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 9</a>. Ahead of the game’s release, the devs have provided players with an insight into BO7’s movement features, explaining why Wall Jumps can transition into Wall Runs. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-doesn-t-have-wall-runs-as-the-timeline-doesn-t-allow-it">Black Ops 7 Doesn’t Have Wall Runs As the Timeline Doesn’t Allow It</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-say-that-you-can-blame-the-black-ops-timeline-for-the-wall-jump-not-being-a-wall-run-black-ops-2-really-gave-us-a-foundation-for-the-technology-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie revealed why Wall Runs weren’t included in the game. Leslie first explains that when they began developing BO7, they “wanted to pick up threads from Black Ops 2.” Which is why all the technology available in the game is from that era. Leslie explained that the team is very precious to their canon and they have to respect that. </p>



<p>Leslie added that they couldn’t have Thrust Jump as the tech didn’t exist until 2035. Similar to that, Wall Run would have made sense if the game were set more in the future; however, as the tech did not exist in the Black Ops 2 era, “so it made sense not to do it.” </p>



<p>Black Ops 7 does have Wall Jumps, which allow players to gain some height by chaining three jumps. Leslie also spoke about how players can get much higher with the new feature, and they “took a lot of learnings from everything we did on Black Ops 3 – it was really important that we kept the combat in-frame.” </p>
