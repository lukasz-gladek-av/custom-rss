            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report has outlined that Microsoft wants Xbox to hit higher profit margins, with the goal for the gaming division to hit a profit margin of 30%, a number which is well above the industry standard. The target has resulted in Xbox canceling several different projects, raising both its console and subscription service prices, and cutting thousands of jobs over the last 24 months.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>‘s Jason Schreier and Dina Bass, Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer, Amy Hood, has reportedly set a target to achieve 30% “accountability margins” across the company, including Xbox.</p>



<p>As revealed in the report, the target of 30% is significantly higher than the industry standard for the video game industry, with past averages ranging between 17-22%, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>



<p>In 2023, Microsoft reported a mere 12% profit margin for its gaming division, with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence estimates revealing that the industry, on average, has not gone past 22% for at least since 2018.</p>



<p>In July 2025, this new target by Microsoft saw the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-was-perfect-dark-canceled-xbox-game-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark by The Initiative canceled</a> – a project that was reportedly in development for around seven years. Its cancellation saw the shutdown of The Initiative studio. Rare’s Everwild, another project that was in development for around seven years, was also canceled around the same time.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-was-everwild-canceled-xbox-game-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal memo obtained by Insider Gaming</a> from Xbox CEO Phil Spencer, the cancellations were due to the “focus on strategic growth areas.”</p>



<p>In the last two years, Microsoft has seen several high-figure layoffs, with Xbox also being impacted.</p>



<p>What do you think of Xbox’s new internal target of 30% profit margins? Do you think it can be achieved, or will we continue to see Xbox canceling projects, raising prices, and laying off its employees?

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is full of content, with Lumiose City packed full of shops to spend your hard-earned cash, and the Stone Emporium is one of the most important locations in the game.</p>



<p>Although not available instantly, the Stone Emporium is a go-to location to purchase items for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-trading-stone-special-evolutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">special evolutions</a>, as well as fossils to revive in the Pokémon Research Lab.</p>



<p>For all the details on where to find the Stone Emporium and the stock available to purchase, our guide has you covered.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Shopping spree. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Stone Emporium in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A is located on Vernal Avenue, near Wild Zone 1 and to the east of Wild Zone 12</strong>, <strong>but only unlocks once you complete Main Mission 10.</strong></p>



<p>The nearest fast travel point is the Pokémon Center on Vernal Avenue, though you can also use the fast travel points at the Pokémon Research Lab, Cafe Woof, and Cafe Classe.</p>



<p>Available stock increases throughout your playthrough, so make sure to revisit the store regularly to stock up on Mega Stones and Evolution Stones.</p>







<p><strong>The Stone Emporium is the best place in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A to get your hands on Evolution Stones, along with being the only place you can purchase particular Mega Stones.</strong></p>



<p>Stock levels increase throughout the game, with some items only becoming available to purchase later on in the main story progression, and remember, you can only purchase each Mega Stone once. However, unlike previous games, you can purchase as many fossils as you want to revive at the Pokémon Research Lab.</p>



<p>The table below shows the full breakdown of the stock available at the Stone Emporium and prices.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wicked-grin-skin-argument/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-players-are-arguing-about-unrealistic-skins-again.1332415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s first season approaches, and in the run-up to the inevitable drop, fans have started discussing the content coming in the impending update. One of the key points of contention involves a new <strong>blue </strong>skin, dubbed ‘Wicked Grin’. It’s one of the least unrealistic skins showcased so far for Battlefield 6, and some fans feel it’s the beginning of the end.</p>



<p>It has gotten to the point of a fierce debate on social platforms, with some diehard fans berating Electronic Arts and all associated studios for ‘already tainting’ Battlefield 6 with bizarre skins.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s that bad?</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-wicked-grin-skin-is-causing-fights">Battlefield 6’s Wicked Grin Skin is Causing Fights</h2>



<p>On social media, users shared images of the blue Wicked Grin skin, coming to Battlefield 6 with the season one update and assumedly being part of some Halloween-themed campaign.</p>



<p>It’s the most divisive skin yet, even more so than the skin that boasted some <strong>bright green elements </strong>that split the community down the middle a couple of weeks ago.</p>



<p>EA DICE announced that Battlefield 6 would be much more grounded ahead of release, and some have condemned the studio for already breaking that promise, less than two weeks after the launch of the game. Battlefield 6 has proven to be a marvel so far, with the community loving almost everything on offer, but these potentially destructive skins are not going down well with fans.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/grounded_skins_for_a_while_18_days_exactly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Reddit</a>, one user wrote, ‘Man, that looks f***ing dumb,’ while another asked, ‘Why is it so much to ask for just regular military uniforms? Nobody is using this s***.’</p>



<p>Others defended the skin: ‘This is cherry-picked from a large selection of mostly regular military outfits. This sub is a cesspool, so I expect no different, but this is laughably misrepresented.’</p>



<p>Some have argued that it’s ‘far more grounded’ than some of the most inane Call of Duty skins, such as the Beavis and Butthead and Nicki Minaj crossovers that brought <strong>the strangest outfits </strong>to the Activision-backed shooter.</p>



<p>Do you think the Wicked Grin skin is so awful that you won’t want to see anyone wearing it in Battlefield 6? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-day-2025-what-to-expect/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-fallout-day-2025%E2%80%94here%E2%80%99s-what-to-expect.1332406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Every year on October 23, the Fallout community comes together to celebrate Fallout Day, an official tribute to the franchise that recognizes the date in the game’s universe on which <strong>the bombs fell</strong>. It was the spark that ignited The Great War, bringing about the end of the world and the start of the Fallout franchise.</p>



<p>This year, the rumors have been circulating like wildfire, with many believing that Bethesda Game Studios is about to reveal a remaster of Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas. We know a few things that are happening this Fallout Day, but what’s set to unravel as the day goes on?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-3-remastered-being-revealed-today">Is Fallout 3 Remastered Being Revealed Today?</h2>



<p>It’s Fallout Day, and that means a few things.</p>



<p>First, it means that Fallout fans worldwide are diving into their favorite post-apocalyptic games, soaking up the irradiated action that has evolved over the last quarter of a century. Second, it means that special streams, offers, and reveals are set to drop.</p>



<p>Later today, Bethesda Game Studios will host a special Fallout Day broadcast, and the consensus is that a new game, such as Fallout 3 Remastered or New Vegas Remastered, will be unveiled.</p>



<p>Some have even theorized that a Fallout Shelter 2 will shadowdrop.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Fallout team revealed a glimpse of what’s coming this Fallout Day:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Fallout Day is almost here! Tomorrow at 1 PM ET, join us for a special broadcast packed with:</p><p>✅ Fallout 76: Burning Springs Updates<br>✅ Fallout Shelter<br>✅ Fallout 4 and Creations<br>✅ New Merch Drops<br>✅ Community In-Person Events<br>✅ And a post-show celebrating the community! <a href="https://t.co/kcNTLrSf8E">pic.twitter.com/kcNTLrSf8E</a></p></div>— Fallout (@Fallout) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1981020245226594611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Let’s break down that list.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout 76: Burning Springs </strong>is likely a more in-depth look at the upcoming expansion, which brings Walton Goggins’ character ‘The Ghoul’ from the television show to the game.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout Shelter </strong>is seen by many as the sudden unveiling of a new release to expand the best-selling mobile-first game, but it’s more likely a new update of sorts or a limited-time event.</p>



<p><strong>Fallout 4 and Creations </strong>is the outlier in the list, as nobody is sure of what that means. It could be more officially-backed mods finding their way into the Creations platform on Fallout 4, or it could be something else entirely. Last year, Fallout 4 received a current-gen upgrade, and nothing has really changed since then. In just a couple of weeks, Fallout 4 will hit its <strong>tenth anniversary</strong>.</p>



<p>Maybe we’ll see a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-this-november/">Fallout 4: 10th Anniversary Edition</a>… Who knows?</p>



<p>New merchandise is available for fans to purchase, and a limited-time 40% discount is available in the Bethesda Gear Store. Also, a special post-show has been announced, set up to celebrate <strong>the community</strong> behind Fallout. This will be backed by the Fallout for Hope charity initiative and will last at least three hours.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-fallout-day-2025-stream">Where to Watch Fallout Day 2025 Stream</h2>



<p>The easiest way to watch Fallout Day 2025 is via <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bethesda Game Studios’ Twitch channel</a>. This is where the official stream will run, and if you miss it, you can check out the VOD to catch up on what was announced.</p>



<p><strong>Here’s when to watch Fallout Day 2025:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>1 PM ET</li>



<li>6 PM BST</li>



<li>10 AM PT</li>



<li>7 PM CEST</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Woojer Strap 4 Review—Small Size, Mighty Feedback]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-strap-4-review-mighty-feedback/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/woojer-strap-4-review%E2%80%94small-size-mighty-feedback.1332397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I received a Woojer Strap 4 alongside the Woojer Vest 4, and I was eager to see how the two devices stacked up against one another. While the Woojer Vest 4 is reserved more for immersive VR experiences, the Strap 4 is a more compact, simpler device that offers a scaled-down feedback experience.</p>



<p>What I found was that the Woojer Strap 4 shouldn’t be discredited just because it’s a smaller thing. This haptic feedback device offers a punchy solution for <strong>feeling audio</strong>, and whether you use it for games or music, you’ll be impressed with what it can do.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Woojer Strap 4 review.</p>



<h2 id="h-woojer-strap-4-is-energy-in-a-compact-package">Woojer Strap 4 is Energy in a Compact Package</h2>



<p>While the Woojer Vest 4 (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-vest-4-review-new-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which I also reviewed</a>) is a full upper body solution, the Woojer Strap 4 is a single, simple, and discrete device that offers immense versatility. It’s designed to be used however you want, and with that in mind, it can be worn in several ways. Whether you want a low-cost immersion element for VR or something to enhance your enjoyment of music, this is it.</p>



<p>The Strap 4 is less than half the price of the full Woojer Vest 4, so it’s a no-brainer if you want an introduction to the haptic world without breaking the bank. You’ll be paying around $125 for the strap, which comes in a range of colorways and themes, and there are even some special edition straps featuring branding from top games like Black Ops 7 and Fortnite.</p>



<p>Once you’ve unboxed your Woojer Strap 4, you’ll find that the setup process is so swift and simple, and the Woojer app allows full customization of the device where sound profiles, inputs and outputs, and RGB layouts are concerned.</p>



<p>Putting on the Strap 4 takes seconds, and it’s designed to fit all body types. Even my larger frame was perfectly comfortable enveloped by the Strap 4. Once on, you’ll start blasting sound through the Strap 4, noticing how the punchy transducer translates all inputted sound into powerful, vibration-based haptic feedback.</p>



<p>It’s weird at first, but stick with it.</p>



<p>On a single charge, the Woojer Strap 4 can last around ten hours, which is about the same amount of time as you’d get with the Vest 4, only the Strap 4 takes less time to recharge. It’s a diverse thing that can be connected wirelessly via Bluetooth or wired with a range of inputs that accommodate almost every kind of device you might want to use.</p>



<p>At just 240 g, you’ll hardly notice the Woojer Strap 4, but you’ll feel those audio cues without a doubt. At the highest sensitivity, the Strap 4 will hit like a 12-gauge alongside certain sound profiles. I used the Strap 4 with a variety of games, but like the Vest 4, it felt the best for me with an explosive first-person shooter like Battlefield 6 or Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>You really do feel every shot, explosion, and punch.</p>



<p>It might seem like a bit of a gimmick, but if you want the most immersive gaming solutions possible, something like the Woojer Strap 4 should be right up your street.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if the Woojer Strap 4 sounds like your kind of technology.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Woojer is back with another iteration of the Vest, an innovative haptic device that allows you to feel the games you play. It’s a somewhat comical device at first blush that reveals itself as something quite impressive on use, and having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-haptic-vest-feel-games-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used the Woojer Vest 3</a> a year ago, I can attest to the Woojer Vest 4 being an evolution of sorts.</p>



<p>With the Woojer Vest 4, users can secure punchy haptic feedback from any audio experience, but it’s marketed much more for <strong>gaming</strong>. That’s where I connected with the Woojer Vest 4, linking up with some pulse-pounding games to get the most out of this device.</p>



<p>Is the Woojer Vest 4 worth it? Find out in this snapshot review.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-woojer-vest-4-any-good">Is The Woojer Vest 4 Any Good?</h2>



<p>I was very familiar with Woojer, having used the Vest 3 for many hours across desktop and VR gaming experiences. It was a seamless transition into the Vest 4, which takes on mostly the same form and function but boasts a few changes. I noticed that it <strong>felt more comfortable </strong>to wear, despite there being few differences in the makeup of the Vest itself.</p>



<p>As I mentioned, the Woojer Vest 4 might look funny at first glance, but there’s a lot of clever technology lurking under the surface. This haptic device boasts six transducers that offer immensely powerful and physical feedback when playing games.</p>



<p>In case you’re unfamiliar with the concept, the Woojer Vest 4 offers physical and haptic feedback in collaboration with the sound emitted from your games, music, and movies. It takes an input and cleverly translates that into vibration and shocking feedback, allowing you to feel, at multiple points around your body, the sound that you’re hearing.</p>



<p>I was eager to use the Woojer Vest 4 in a few rounds of <strong>Battlefield 6</strong>, so I connected the device to my PC and linked it with my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-a50-wireless-headset-review/">Astro A50 headset</a> and <strong>felt every gunshot, explosion, and rumble of tank tracks</strong>.</p>



<p>If there’s one complaint I have about the Woojer Vest 4, it’s that the latency is a bit off-putting for reflexive gameplay, and even the in-built low-latency mode that can be activated via the Woojer app doesn’t change much.</p>



<p>That being said, it wasn’t a deal-breaker. The Woojer Vest 4 is truly a one-size-fits-all device, and it even accommodated my much larger frame for several hours (note: battery life is advertised as 10 hours maximum). If you play VR in tandem with the Woojer Vest 4 (like I did), you’ll get a little toasty under the device, but it’s designed to be as breathable as possible.</p>



<p>If you’ve never seen or used a Woojer Vest, you’ll quickly get to grips with the Vest 4. It’s easy to use, comes with handy start-up guides, and has an app with a clean UI that makes it a wonder to use. The front-facing control unit is easy to reach, there’s a nice spot of RGB lighting, and the inputs are tactile.</p>



<p>There are so few things I found that turned me off from the Woojer Vest 4. Even the price point has come down from the near $500 heights of the Woojer Vest 3. It’s now floating around $340, which is more comfortable. Talking of comfort, the Vest 4 comes in at around 1.6 kg, which is nothing when you consider the weight is distributed around your back, shoulders, and chest.</p>



<p>If you’re a VR fan and want to make your experiences much more immersive, I’d say the Woojer Vest 4 is an easy buy. If you’re a console or desktop-based gamer, it’s perhaps less worthwhile, and if you’re interested in getting the vest for movies or music, I’d probably suggest reconsidering that decision.</p>

<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X ‘gaming soundbar’ ticked more than a few boxes for me. It was punchy, easy to use, and it had a tasty splash of RGB that made it a tantalising pick for any gamer. When I was putting together my Katana V2X review, I put this two-part soundbar through its paces, and I’m pleased to say that it impressed me in every aspect.</p>



<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X from Creative is the culmination of decades of work in the audio space, and it’s a compact yet powerful thing that looks great and works with just about any device you connect to it.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out my full review of the Sound Blaster Katana V2X soundbar.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-katana-v2x-soundbar-is-power-in-a-small-package">The Katana V2X Soundbar is Power in a Small Package</h2>



<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X is a perfectly sized solution for gamers short on space but eager to achieve some of the best audio results possible. The soundbar measures just 600mm by 95mm and has a height profile of just 62mm, which means it should fit nicely in front of, under, or behind any setup, television or otherwise.</p>



<p>This soundbar comes with a company subwoofer that’s 423mm tall, 250mm deep, and 116mm wide, and despite that scaled-down size factor, I found it to be a <strong>very </strong>capable piece of equipment. It adds a tasty touch of bass to the core soundbar without needing anything more than a coaxial connection to the back of the device.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about that sound power.</p>



<p>The Katana V2X soundbar boasts tri-amplified amps and represents an evolution of the earlier models of the same soundbar. It has two mid-range drivers, two tweeters, and the bolt-on subwoofer drive, all of which combine to produce a deep audio range, cinematic diversity, and stunning clarity.</p>



<p>It doesn’t take much to run the Katana V2X soundbar, and you can connect it to <strong>almost anything </strong>via Bluetooth 5.0, HDMI ARC, optical, aux, and USB-C. I would be blasting music via my phone in one minute, then pressing a single button and connecting to a PS5 in the next.</p>



<p>This multi-functional soundbar even has built-in microphones, which is a nice-to-have rather than a need-to-have. It’s all customizable too, and the sound profiles, RGB strip, and saved settings can all be tweaked.</p>



<p>Creative has been in the business of audio technology since 1981, and the Sound Blaster technology has been tried, tested, and optimized over <strong>many</strong> <strong>years</strong>. It’s now at a point where the Katana V2X soundbar should be considered one of the best gaming soundbars you can get for the price.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in the Katana V2X soundbar, it’ll set you back around $259 – $280, depending on where you buy it. I’d say it’s worth every penny, especially if you’re looking for a compact yet powerful audio solution, preferably being twinned with a TV and home console arrangement.</p>
