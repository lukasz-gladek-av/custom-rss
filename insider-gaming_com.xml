            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Weeks of speculation and rumors have come to a head as we finally have confirmation of A2. Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new A2 Set is here—named Space-Time Smackdown—and we know its start date, which new cards are included, and much more.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-new-packs-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A2 Set</a> talk has come true, as expected. Pokémon TCG Pocket is introducing a new set to kick off 2025—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-expansion-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space-Time Smackdown</a>. The funky-sounding name is apt (more on this later) and is a big step up compared to the mini-set-nature of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a>.</p>



<p>Genetic Apex has kept the app stocked with cards for a while, but it’s time for Space-Time Smackdown to shake up the meta and daily routine of opening Packs.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-release-date">Pokémon TCG Pocket Space-Time Smackdown Release Date</h2>

<p><strong>Space-Time Smackdown first debuts in Pokémon TCG Pocket on Wednesday, January 29, followed by a global launch on Thursday, January 30.</strong></p>



<p>It’s likely a same-time rollout for Space-Time Smackdown. The key difference is New Zealand players get to experience the joy of the new set first because of the time difference—hence January 29. This is the way for virtually every game release, and Pocket is the same here.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-new-space-time-smackdown-card-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Every New Space-Time Smackdown Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>So far, we know of a few Pokémon TCG Pocket Space-Time Smackdown Cards including <strong>Dialga ex, Palkia ex, a Lucario Full Art, Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/explore-pokemon-tcg-pockets-newest-expansion-space-time-smackdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> the set has “<strong>Over 140 cards including exciting Pokémon ex cards, new Trainer cards, and gorgeous immersive cards ready to bring you into the wondrous world of Pokémon</strong>.”</p>



<p>Here’s a full list of every card revealed so far in the new Space-Time Smackdown set:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chimchar</li>



<li>Cresselia</li>



<li>Gible</li>



<li>Honchkrow</li>



<li>Leafeon</li>



<li>Piplup</li>



<li>Turtwig</li>



<li>Dialga ex</li>



<li>Pachirisu ex</li>



<li>Palkia ex</li>



<li>Cynthia (Full Art)</li>



<li>Lucario (Full Art)</li>
</ul>



<p>The debut trailer only gave away a small mackerel of cards. Another trailer close to launch—or a comprehensive leak—could tell us more. For now, we’ll take these cards, and you can see them for yourself in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Official Pokémon YouTube channel</a>‘s Space-Time Smackdown debut trailer!</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-which-generation-is-pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-set">Which Generation is Pokémon TCG Pocket Space-Time Smackdown Set?</h2>



<p><strong>The 4th Generation of Pokémon is the focus of Pocket’s Space-Time Smackdown A2 Set.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone—myself included—thought the second set would naturally follow the chronology of Pokémon. Genetic Apex was predominantly a Kanto set. It makes sense A2 would move on to Johto for the second set, but alas, this is not the case.</p>



<p>I’m pleasantly surprised as it means to <strong>expect the unexpected</strong>.</p>



<p>The development teams are going to mix things up and keep us on our toes. It also means we probably get some amazing Mon in Space-Time Smackdown: <strong>Infernape</strong>, <strong>Bidoof</strong>, <strong>Kricketot, Kricketune</strong>, <strong>Mismagius</strong>, <strong>Munchlax</strong>, <strong>Glaceon</strong>, and many more.</p>



<h2 id="h-trading-added-ahead-of-space-time-smackdown">Trading Added Ahead of Space-Time Smackdown</h2>



<p><strong>Trading arrives on January 28—the day before Space-Time Smackdown gets underway.</strong></p>



<p>It’ll already be in the game before the A2 Set Booster Packs launch; however, we’re glad to finally see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a>. Adding it the day before gives the team a chance to ensure it’s implemented properly before Space-Time Smackdown is live. You can also spend the last few hours swapping cards with friends to fill out decks before you have a new set to start over with.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m always giddy before a new event gets underway. I’ve got Hourglasses galore and all the resources ready to complete the Space-Time Smackdown set. Are you looking forward to it? Are you surprised to see Gen 4 as A2’s main focus?</p>
