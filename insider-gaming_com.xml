<p>CODMAS returns in 2024 with Black Ops 6 and Warzone, bringing all kinds of holiday gifts and surprises for players. Driving the holiday spirit, Treyarch have detailed what to expect in the CODMAS event, from the return of the Nuketown Holiday map to limited-time modes.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about the Warzone and Black Ops 6 CODMAS event, including its release date and expected content.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-codmas-event-in-black-ops-6-amp-warzone">When is CODMAS event in Black Ops 6 &amp; Warzone?</h2>



<p>The devs have not confirmed an official date for the Black Ops 6 CODMAS event yet, but if we look at last year’s release date for the event, we <strong>expect it to arrive mid-December</strong>, perhaps Tuesday the 17th. </p>



<p>The event is definitely arriving, as the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Weapons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 Season 1 blog</a> confirmed its return alongside Nuketown Holiday, the Christmas-themed variant of the iconic map that’s set to arrive in the days leading up to CODMAS.</p>



<p>The previous year’s CODMAS event landed on December 19 and ended on January 3, so if that’s anything to go off, this year’s event will also last around 2 weeks as well. Keep in mind that this is just speculation, so take it with a pinch of salt. Treyarch will likely announce the event soon, so when they do, we’ll be sure to refresh this piece with the details.</p>

<ul>
<li>Event rewards</li>



<li>Limited-time modes</li>



<li>Themed maps</li>



<li>Store bundles</li>



<li>Warzone mode</li>
</ul>



<p>Similarly to last year’s CODMAS event, BO6 players can expect to see an in-game event panel with a variety of rewards for players to earn. These prizes will likely be cosmetic rewards like Charms, Calling Cards, Emblems, Weapon Blueprints, and maybe even an Operator skin. We also expect to see Holiday-themed Store bundles.</p>



<p>On top of tasty rewards, CODMAS will also bring themed maps and limited-time modes like last year’s Santa’s Slayground It’s unclear whether the mode will be completely new or just another iteration of last year’s. </p>



<p>Further, Warzone will likely also receive its own Christmas-themed mode, but players will hope that doesn’t mean the return of Krampus, who completely ruined the festivities a few years back by being an unstoppable killing force in lobbies.</p>

<p>The bulk of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s marketing features The Replacer. The bearded character appears in various BLOPS 6 trailers and spoofs, but his origins are confusing to many—so let’s tell you everything you need to know about The Replacer.</p>



<p>Treyarch brought back the iconic character for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>—marking the first time The Replacer has been seen since Black Ops 4. The character has been used in various pre-release trailers, depicted as a replacement for real people in everyday life.</p>



<p>The Replacer’s face has become synonymous with CoD, and I’m here to dive into who he is, the actor behind the role, and more.</p>

<p><strong>The Replacer is a fictional character created specifically for the Call of Duty universe and was first seen in Black Ops 2.</strong></p>



<p>With CoD’s reputation continuing to grow and its popularity soaring at an unfathomable rate, The Replacer debuted in a marketing trailer to hype up new BLOPS 2 content. In the video, The Replacer steps into the shoes of normal people going about their day to “replace” them, allowing the person to enjoy Black Ops 2 instead.</p>



<p>The hot reception for The Replacer resulted in the persona returning for Black Ops 3, and Black Ops 4, and they have returned for 2024’s Black Ops 6. Again, following the same ideology; players desperate to play Black Ops 6 can call upon his services to step in and fulfill their day-to-day duties.</p>



<p>If only The Replacer was real, he could be here writing this while I kick back and camp Hardpoints!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-the-replacer-in-black-ops-6">How to Unlock The Replacer in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p><strong>You unlock The Replacer in Black Ops 6 by purchasing the Tracer Pack: The Replacer Bundle from the BLOPS 6 Store.</strong></p>



<p>The bundle costs <strong>2,400 CoD Points</strong> and includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Replacer Operator Skin</li>



<li>Blueprints</li>



<li>Finishing Move</li>



<li>Charm</li>



<li>Calling Card</li>



<li>Sticker</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-who-is-peter-stormare-in-black-ops-6">Who is Peter Stormare in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><strong>Peter Stormare is a Swedish-born actor playing the role of The Replacer in the Call of Duty: Black Ops series.</strong></p>



<p>The actor’s legendary portfolio of acting credits—thanks to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001780/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB</a>—stretches across TV, movies, and video games. Focusing on the latter, as well as The Replacer in Call of Duty, Peter Stormare has had voice roles in <strong>The Elder Scrolls: Online</strong> as King Joruun, <strong>Destiny 2</strong> as Arach Jalaal, and <strong>Until Dawn</strong> as Dr. Hill.</p>
