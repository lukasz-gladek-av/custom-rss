            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re pushing fast through December, and before you know it, the festive window will be in full swing. How are you preparing for this year’s celebrations? Hopefully, you’re planning to kickstart today with a fresh run around the latest NYT Connections puzzle, because I’m here with the hints and solutions you need.</p>



<p>Read on to dominate today’s NYT Connections challenge! The latest hints are just below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #912:</p>



<ul>
<li>CONSIDER</li>



<li>CLOWNFISH</li>



<li>COUNT</li>



<li>HONEYBEE</li>



<li>FACTOR</li>



<li>TIGER</li>



<li>INCLUDE</li>



<li>ZEBRA</li>



<li>FIEVEL</li>



<li>DOROTHY GALE</li>



<li>FOREHEAD</li>



<li>LEPRECHAUN</li>



<li>TOUCAN</li>



<li>PRIDE</li>



<li>WONDER</li>



<li>UNICORN</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about actions you take when weighing options or doing calculations.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>All of these creatures are known for their distinctive stripes or bold patterns.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These all connect to rainbows — either literally or symbolically.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These words start with a misspelled number.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 9:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-9-912">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 9 (#912)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CONSIDER, COUNT, FACTOR, INCLUDE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CLOWNFISH, HONEYBEE, TIGER, ZEBRA</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – DOROTHY GALE, LEPRECHAUN, PRIDE, UNICORN</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FIEVEL, FOREHEAD, TOUCAN, WONDER</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 playoffs will commence soon, running from December 11 to 14. It’s the portion of the tournament that will crown the victor in Hungary, and they’ll secure a $500,000 grand prize for their efforts. Eight teams are set to enter the MVM Dome, but only one can walk away with the trophy.</p>



<p>In this breakdown, we’re taking a closer look at the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs betting predictions to determine which team has the best odds of winning.</p>



<p>If you want to make a wager, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-top-budapest-major-playoffs-predictions">Top Budapest Major Playoffs Predictions</h2>



<p>It’s almost too close to call, as this event has been electrifying thus far. We’ve seen huge upsets, underdog streaks, and new records set during this tournament, which has proven to be one of the best Counter-Strike 2 events of 2025.</p>



<p>FURIA remains the safest bet, which reflects the team’s dominant run through the early stages and consistent form throughout the year thus far. With outright odds of 2.9 to win the tournament, FURIA won’t offer the biggest returns, but should be the safest play.</p>



<p>Vitality has slightly longer odds (around 4.0), which promises better bang for your buck, and the team remains a fantastic choice for a middle-of-the-road option. Everyone knows that Vitality had the best year imaginable in 2025, but things have cooled off a little in recent weeks for ZywOo and Co.</p>



<p>By far the biggest outsider in terms of Counter-Strike betting odds is FaZe Clan. The Brazilian squad enters the Budapest Major playoffs with odds of 20.0 to take the trophy, but they’re a resilient side that has had a decent run thus far, so it might be worth a flutter to play the longest odds in the tournament.</p>



<p>If you want the safe pick, aim for FURIA. There’s value in wagering on Falcons or Spirit, but if you want larger returns, MongolZ still has a phenomenal shot at the trophy, and FaZe Clan <strong>could </strong>produce a masterful victory in the bracket.</p>

<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will be jumping into action during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>. The game is set to release sometime in 2026 and has been highly anticipated by fans.</p>



<p>Revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is bringing back the Caped Crusader in all his blocky glory. Set to be an original story taking from the series’ most iconic moments, it looks like the perfect love letter to the DC franchise. While it won’t have many playable characters, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-open-world-arkham-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its open-world Gotham City</a> and Arkham-inspired combat will tide fans over. It’s been a bit quiet from TT Games about the title, especially with the 2026 release approaching. Now, it seems fans will get a new look at it on December 11th.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/LEGODCGame/status/1998211049951047851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet from the game’s official account</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will appear at The Game Awards. The post, seen above, shows Lego Batman guarding a poster for the Geoff Keighley-hosted show, which’ll take place at Peacock Theater. It’s unclear what exactly will be shown at the event, scheduled for December 11th. However, it does seem likely fans will get a release window/date, given it’s due to come out in 2026. Even still, gameplay of the title is most certainly going to appear, so there’s that to look forward to. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got its hands</a> on LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight at Gamescom 2025 over the summer. The writer found the gameplay fun and engaging, calling the overall experience one with massive potential. Seeing as the LEGO games are a guilty pleasure for many, Legacy of the Dark Knight looks to be just what Gotham (and the world) needs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[2K Games is Launching a New Studio Headed by ex-The Initiative Leadership]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/2k-games-the-initiative-new-studio/</link>
            <guid>1376656</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two former lead employees from The Initiative have launched a new studio for 2K Games. Previously, both members worked on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cancelled Perfect Dark title</a> for Xbox.</p>



<p>The Initiative was an ambitious new first-party studio for Microsoft/Xbox and led by former Crystal Dynamics head, Darrell Gallagher. It brought in many notable figures from studios like Rockstar, Santa Monica Studios, and Naughty Dog. The studio’s first title was announced to be a remake/reboot of Perfect Dark. Unfortunately, earlier this year, the game was cancelled and The Initiative was shut down. Now, two former employees, including Darrell himself, are heading up a new studio for 2K Games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403902973464014848/?originTrackingId=juNbzYzc45PM4zhZ2yaPjg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a LinkedIn post</a>, former studio head of The Initiative, Darrell Gallagher, announced that he’ll be joining a new studio for 2K Games. He’ll join as SVP, Studio Head of the yet-to-be-named studio. His message can be found below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>I’m excited to share that I will be joining 2K as SVP, Studio Head, where I’ll be building a new studio and leading an ambitious opportunity unlike anything I’ve taken on before</strong>,” says Gallagher. “<strong>I’ve spent my career believing in what’s possible when great people come together with a bold vision. I can’t wait to get started with the exceptional team at 2K!</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Furthermore, Brian Horton, former Creative Director at The Initiative for Perfect Dark, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403908881246318592/?originTrackingId=CgNwdSlyrogNLDJN1Ms7OQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced on LinkedIn</a> that he will join Darrell as VP Head of Creative. Prior to The Initiative, Horton served as Creative Director for Marvel’s Spider-Man and the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>. No information was shared regarding any other talent joining or what the game may be. Either way, it is a pretty big snag and may give fans a peek as to what stories The Initiative would have told if not disbanded.</p>
