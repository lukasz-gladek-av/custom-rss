<p>The next year is shaping up to be a big one for gaming, with 2026 including a wealth of major releases from huge publishers across the world, but there are also plenty of exciting Indie releases on the horizon.</p>



<p>From sequels to popular titles to entirely new creations, Insider Gaming has selected eight of the biggest Indie games to watch out for in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-2026-indie-releases">Biggest 2026 Indie Releases</h2>



<h3 id="h-hytale">Hytale</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Finally. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where else is there to start? After being scrapped by Riot Games, Hytale is back in the hands of it’s original creators at Hypixel Studios and an early access release is set for January 13. After a long, long wait, this could be one of the biggest releases of the year.</p>



<p>Hytale began life as a Minecraft server, and the inspiration from the Mojang title is clear to see, but the big differences are the embracement of modding, with all in-game assets being made available to the community to create with, opening the door to an infinite number of ideas.</p>



<p>The early access release merely marks the next stage in the Hytale journey, and players have been warned it’s far from the finished product, but, either way, Hytale will be huge in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-demon-tides">Demon Tides</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Washout. Image via Fabraz</figcaption></figure>



<p>A platformer set in the open seas, Demon Tides will see players explore the waters of the world to uncover dark secrets, with “dozens of locales” and gear to upgrade, and the game is set to be released on February 19.</p>



<p>The demo, initially released in February 2025, earned rave reviews, and even received an update dropping additional content, and the full adventure is now right around the corner.</p>



<h3 id="h-beastro">Beastro</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Cooking up a storm. Image via Timberline Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>No release date has been set for Beastro, but a demo is now available on Steam, with the title seeing players take control of Panko, tasked with creating culinary masterpieces to serve to a variety of characters, and the dishes you create will build a deck for their adventures.</p>



<p>The food-based fantasy adventure’s unique mix of cooking and deck building, with a variety of ingredients to unlock and secrets to discover, will certainly cause a stir, and it’s a title you should definitely keep your eyes peeled for in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-aniimo">Aniimo</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Journey awaits. Image via Pawprint Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Two years after Palworld set the gaming world alight, a new open-world, creature-catching game is on the horizon with Aniimo, which, like the Pocketpair title, will be open to a wide audience due to its inclusion on Xbox Game Pass from release date. </p>



<p>Full details of the release are yet to be shared, though they could come in Xbox’s Partner Showcase in January, but the countdown is well and truly on, with reveals showcasing an array of Aniimo’s to collect, vast social interactions, and an exciting world to explore.</p>



<h3 id="h-slay-the-spire-2">Slay the Spire 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sequel. Image via Mega Crit</figcaption></figure>



<p>Set for launch in March 2026, Slay the Spire 2 is the sequel to the original title, once again inciting players with a roguelike deckbuilder filled with challenges and variety.</p>



<p>The original Slay the Spire, released in 2019, is still extremely popular to this day and is ranked overwhelmingly positive on Steam with close to 70,000 reviews, showing that there is already an extremely strong playerbase, and more players are set to be drawn in.</p>



<h3 id="h-coromon-rogue-planet">Coromon: Rogue Planet</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Going rogue. Image via TRAGsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another creature-catching game releasing in 2026 is Coromon: Rogue Planet, a sequel to the original Coromon, which focuses on a roguelike approach—which could set it apart from other games in the genre.</p>



<p>While there’s plenty that will be familiar to players, like choosing your starter Coromon and battling wild monsters, the roguelike approach gives a different spin to the game, and could lure in a heap of players as a result.</p>



<h3 id="h-big-walk">Big Walk</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Follow the leader. Image via House House</figcaption></figure>



<p>The creators of Untitled Goose Game are back in 2026 with the release of Big Walk, a cooperative online walker-talker where players can “hang out and get lost with close friends in a big world.”</p>



<p>Filled with challenges, puzzles and discoveries, there’s a heap of adventures on the horizon, and the scope to just hang out with your friends, or boot your companions into the ocean, the choice is up to you.</p>



<h3 id="h-neverway">Neverway</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Haunted. Image via Coldblood Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neverway is described as a mixture of a horror, life sim, and action RPG, where players take charge of Fiona, who starts over on a farm. If this sounds like your cup of tea, and you’re a big fan of Stardew Valley, Neverway’s release in 2026 is something that can’t be missed.</p>



<p>With farming, combat, dating, and plenty to collect, Neverway could be one of the biggest titles in 2026, and the fact it was co-created by the pixel artist of Celeste adds another feather into Neverway’s cap.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 Jailbreak Rumors Have Caused A Star Wars Game to Increase 1000% in Price]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-game-hike-in-price/</link>
            <guid>1395940</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new PlayStation 5 rumour suggesting that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-rom-keys-leak-jailbreaking-concerns-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console can be jailbroken</a> has caused one Star Wars game to increase in price by over 1000%.</p>







<p>That’s because, according to the rumours, the jailbreak method can only be done with a physical version of one particular game.</p>



<p>The game in question is Star Wars Racer Revenge, which, before the rumours, was selling for around $50. Now, listings on eBay are as high as $500, meaning that the price has increased tenfold.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gezine</a> on X, one of the reasons for the sudden price increase is that the game only has around 10,000 copies in the market, which is a relatively low number in the grand scheme of things. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Wars Racer Revenge [Full Game | No Commentary] PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7TXXOtvIG8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As of yet, Star Wars Racer Revenge is the only game that works and according to the rumours, it works because the exploit targets the PlayStation 5’s disc authentication used for backwards compatibility.</p>



<p>Sony is yet to respond to the rumours, but if true, the jailbreaks could pose security concerns for the brand. As for what it currently means for jailbroken PlsyStation 5’s is also unclear, but it’s a step in the direction to soon having jailbroken consoles flooding the market.</p>







<div><p>So, with the price increases, it might be worth checking your library of physical games to see if you have a copy lying around. You might just be sitting on a fortune!</p><p>What do you think of the news that the PlayStation 5 may be jailbroken?

            <title><![CDATA[Should Escape from Tarkov PvE Be Free or Deleted Entirely, Nikita Asks]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-pve-free-or-deleted-nikita/</link>
            <guid>1395877</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new and somewhat bizarre post on social media, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov has asked his followers what should be done with Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform. The contentious mode has been a point of debate since surfacing in June 2024, and Nikita hosted a poll with three options, two of which were ‘make it free’ or ‘delete it’.</p>



<p>The poll surfaced on social media after Nikita responded to a post from a critic who ‘refunded Escape from Tarkov’ after discovering that the PvE mode <strong>was not free</strong> and is instead a paid-for bolt-on.</p>







<h2 id="h-and-our-survey-says">And Our Survey Says…</h2>



<p>The feedback on Nikita’s tongue-in-cheek poll is clear, and the bulk of Escape from Tarkov users either want PvE to be <strong>free </strong>or <strong>deleted entirely</strong>. At the time of publishing, 53.1% of voters (out of 17,000 votes) want PvE to be entirely free. That was supposed to be the case years ago when the concept first surfaced, but Battlestate Games went a different way with things.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The second-most popular option was ‘delete PvE’, which garnered 29.4% of the votes, assumedly from diehard PvP fans who believe that the PvE offering has long diluted what it means to be an Escape from Tarkov fan.</p>



<p>Nikita has been in the weeds with it recently and stressed in a new interview just a few days ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-ten-years-of-tarkov-miracle/">Escape from Tarkov is his life</a>, and he couldn’t imagine existing without the game. In our most recent episode <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-interview-tarkov-console-frustrating/">of Access Granted</a>, we sat down with Nikita, and he walked us through what it means to be an Escape from Tarkov developer.</p>



<p>Spoiler: It’s a mindset thing, and if you don’t have it, you’re not a Tarkov dev.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform isn’t going anywhere. Nikita said minutes after posting the poll that it’s all a big joke to poke fun at people complaining about PvE in the first place.</p>



<p>If anything, Tarkov’s PvE offering is getting stronger through 2026. There are some updates planned that will even introduce a PvE mode to Escape from Tarkov: Arena, so if you want to play <strong>that game </strong>but don’t want the stress of real players, you’ll be catered to soon.</p>







<p>Do you play Escape from Tarkov’s PvE mode, and if so, what do you think of it? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[8 Rare Fortnite Skins That Need to Return in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/8-rare-fortnite-skins-that-need-to-return-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1395844</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite has a staggeringly long list of skins introduced over the years, ranging from original creations to huge collabs, and some have become extremely rare heading into 2026 after a long wait for a return to the Item Shop.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has selected eight of the rarest skins that Epic Games should have near the top of the list to return at some point in 2026, so keep an eye in the Item Shop for these appearances.</p>







<h2 id="h-rarest-fortnite-skins-that-need-to-return">Rarest Fortnite Skins That Need to Return</h2>



<h3 id="h-travis-scott">Travis Scott</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Heavily-requested. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>There seems to be murmurs of Travis Scott’s long-awaited return to the Item Shop every month, but fans are still waiting for the Icon Series Outfit to return, a wait that has gone beyond 2,000 days.</p>



<p>August 2020 was the last time that the Travis Scott skin was available in Fortnite, an audaciously long time for such an iconic look and community-requested skin, but there’s high hopes that 2026 is the year of a return.</p>



<h3 id="h-kratos">Kratos</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Pray to the Gods. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Kratos Gaming Legends Series Outfit is regularly cited among the favorites that players are desperate to see return to the Item Shop, but the God of War giant has not made an appearance since March 2021.</p>



<p>2026 is a huge year for the God of War franchise, with murmurs of the next game in the series due to release on PlayStation in the window, and filming for the Amazon TV series set to begin, so it’s the perfect time for Kratos to return.</p>



<h3 id="h-reflex">Reflex</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Strange absence. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although perhaps not as eye-catching as some of the other skins on this list, particularly with the huge collabs waiting to be seen, the absence of the Reflex outfit from the Item Shop is staggering, and it stands as one of the rarest skins in all of Fortnite.</p>



<p>The Reflex skin last appeared in March 2019, which was only it’s second appearance in the Item Shop after an initial release in November 2018, and those limited appearances have made the outfit extremely rare.</p>



<h3 id="h-mike-lowrey">Mike Lowrey</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Bad Boys. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>An iconic face from the Bad Boys franchise, Mike Lowrey was initially introduced in Chapter 2, Season 7 in 2021, and made several appearances in the Item Shop that year, but has not appeared since.</p>



<p>All of the appearances of the Mike Lowrey outfit in the Item Shop came in the release year, but a reapparance of the collab skin could be on the agenda for 2026 as discussions about a new movie continue to ramp up.</p>



<h3 id="h-marcus-fenix">Marcus Fenix</h3>



<figure><figcaption>E-Day. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another Icon of the Gaming Series, the Marcus Fenix skin, quite frankly, has to return in 2026, in a year that is set to be huge for the Gears of War franchise with the release of Gears of War: E-Day, a prequel title set 15 years before the original game.</p>



<p>Themed around the older version of the beloved character seen in the latter games of the franchise, there could be scope for a new skin to tie into E-Day in 2026 but, even so, the existing Marcus Fenix skin needs to appear, with the last occurence in the Item Shop coming in December 2022.</p>



<h3 id="h-aloy">Aloy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Horizon. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s a bit of a trend existing for collabs in the Gaming Icon Series not appearing in the Item Shop regularly, which also extends to Aloy, the face of PlayStation’s Horizon franchise. Compared to others on the list, a last appearance in March 2023 pales, but it’s still too long of a wait for an iconic look.</p>



<p>The future of the Horizon franchise looks promising, with the next game in the series surely on the cards alongside a big Hollywood adaptation, and Sony may be holding off for future releases before allowing Aloy to feature again.</p>



<h3 id="h-lebron-james">LeBron James</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The King. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most famous sports players to have ever lived, LeBron James’ Fortnite skin has not been available since April 2023, and the return is eagerly anticipated due a different approach for the skin that provides unlockable cosmetics.</p>



<p>Purchasing the skin unlocks a series of Quests to complete, with two additional styles, giving players more bang for their V-Bucks when compared to other skins.</p>



<h3 id="h-leon-s-kennedy">Leon S. Kennedy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Permanent Resident. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>The iconic face of the Resident Evil franchise surely has to return in 2026, right? Given there’s a big release around the corner for the series in February, heavily rumored to have another appearance from Leon himself, it would be the perfect time for the skin to return.</p>



<p>Players have not been able to purchase the Leon S. Kennedy skin in Fortnite since April 2023, just a month after its initial release in March of the same year.</p>
