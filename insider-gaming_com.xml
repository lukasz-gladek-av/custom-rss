<p>Sales of the Grand Theft Auto franchise have been revealed, and the series is nearing 455 million units sold. </p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto is one of the most popular gaming franchises in history, having released several iconic titles, including GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City, and GTA 5, among others. GTA 5 is one of the longest-running games available today, spanning three generations of consoles and accounting for nearly half of the franchise’s sales. </p>



<h2 id="h-gta-series-has-sold-close-to-half-a-billion-units">GTA Series Has Sold Close to Half a Billion Units</h2>



<p>The new sales details for the GTA series were announced during Take-Two’s latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4caa8ce3-9cd2-45d5-b267-593e2391801f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a> (via <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/465433/gta-series-approaches-455m-rdr-series-tops-104m-borderlands-series-tops-94m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>). One of the slides reveals that the Grand Theft Auto franchise has sold “nearly 455 million units”, out of which GTA 5 has sold 215 million units. GTA 5 has also reached $1 billion in retail sales faster than any entertainment release in history and has been the “best-selling title of the past 10 years in the U.S., based on both unit and dollar sales.”</p>



<p>Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption series has also surpassed 104 million units in sales, with RDR2 accounting for over 77 million of those units. The NBA 2K franchise has sold over 162 million units, the Borderlands series has sold over 94 million units, and Sid Meier’s Civilisation has sold over 77 million units. </p>



<p>In other news, Take-Two CEO has dodged a question on whether GTA 6 will be priced at $80, stating that the upcoming title will have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fair-price-80-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a ‘fair price’</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lazlow-doubt-gta-6-longest-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">longest-serving actor</a> in GTA doubts he will be included in GTA 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode has been given a Fall 2025 release window, indicating it won’t be available at launch. </p>



<p>The remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 is all set to release on August 28, 2025, bringing players back to their beloved stealth action title. The title will feature the same story and world, with brand new visuals and audio, improving on the core experience of the original. The title was also going to receive a brand new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-reveals-fox-hunt-multiplayer-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer game mode</a> called Fox Hunt, but it seems that will be available post-launch.</p>







<p>Konami has posted a new update on its <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/foxhunt/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, which provides a release window for Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode. The post only states ‘Fall 2025’ without giving an exact release date. As the MGS 3 Remake is set to release at the end of this month, it seems players will have to do without the Fox Hunt multiplayer mode for some time. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode is a hide-and-seek-based online experience. Here, players will utilise elements unique to Metal Gear, including camouflage and survival. The game mode features sneaking gameplay elements iconic to the Metal Gear series, and the new visual enhancements help make the experience that much more immersive. </p>



<p>Worry not, as the other two game modes of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be available at launch. PlayStation and Steam players will receive ‘Snake vs Monkey’, where you have to round up all the escaped apes as Snake. Xbox Series X/S will receive ‘Snake vs Bomberman’, where you have to blast these bombermen across different stages. </p>

Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-support-developer-virtuos-hit-with-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support developer</a> for the upcoming title has been hit with layoffs.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-dodges-question-on-gta-6-costing-80-or-more-says-it-will-have-a-%E2%80%9Cfair-price%E2%80%9D.1265505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has said that GTA 6 will have a “fair price” when the game releases in 2026.</p>



<p>Following a question from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/take-two-gta-6-pricing-debate-june-earnings-1236481561/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> ahead of Take-Two’s recent quarterly earnings report, the outlet asked Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick about $80 games and what that means for GTA 6.</p>



<p>According to Zelnick, that announcement will come from Rockstar Games, the developer behind GTA 6, in due time.</p>



<p>“Our goal always is to deliver more value than what we charge, so we’ve had variable pricing at the company forever. As you know, the approach of the industry is to launch at a premium price, sometimes with special editions, and over time, typically to reduce the price to enhance the overall size of the market. We do the very same thing. I think, probably more than most, we’re highly focused on making sure that the experience is great, not just because the game itself is great, but also because consumers have paid a fair price for it,” Zelnick said.</p>



<p>So to put it bluntly, Zelnick dodged the question pretty perfectly (hurrah for training), diverting the question from the actual price point to the value to customers.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-gta-6-release-at-the-80-price-point">Will GTA 6 Release at the $80 Price Point?</h2>



<p>Frankly, I find it hard to believe that GTA 6 won’t release at $80. Nintendo has already got the accolade for being the first publisher to make that plunge, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-cuts-prices-of-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-holiday-xbox-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft recently pulled back on their price increase</a>s, Take-Two won’t want to miss out on another 14% increase, especially for a game like Grand Theft Auto that is going to sell at that price point regardless.</p>



<p>Will other publishers follow suit with $80 games after GTA 6? I’d argue yes, and while Microsoft’s decision to revert their price points suggests otherwise, I believe it was a strategic move based on their current game pipeline and the issues the company is currently facing.</p>



<p>Another common rumor floating around is that GTA 6 will launch at $100, and while I don’t think that will be the case, they’ll almost certainly have an edition to tempt us, and likely go beyond that price point. </p>



<p>What do you think of GTA 6 costing $80 is a fair price? Do you think it will be justified, and what do you think of other games following suit?
