<p>Move over, Terminator – an old familiar face is back in town and standing ready to take the spot of the most overpowered, controversial Call of Duty skin. When Season 03 arrives in Black Ops 6 on April 2, players will be able to unlock R0-Z3, a modern-day recreation of one of the sweatiest Operators in Call of Duty history.</p>



<p>Back in the day, ‘Roze’ was the firm favourite for players looking for an (unfair) edge over the competition. Her skin was darker than dark and made her a shadow in dimly-lit areas, and even a redesign to lighten her up didn’t do much to stem the sales.</p>



<p>There’s a really sneaky catch, though. You can only get the R0-Z3 skin if you own the BlackCell Battle Pass – the most expensive Battle Pass variant in Call of Duty. Surprise, surprise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-signature-sweat">Signature Sweat</h2>



<p>The R0-Z3 skin, which is an all-new take on the classic Roze Operator, will be available exclusively through the BlackCell Battle Pass, which just so happens to be one of the most expensive single purchases you can make in Call of Duty. It’ll set you back $30 to obtain Season 03’s BlackCell Battle Pass, which is more than the average skin pack by far.</p>



<p>Here’s the spiel for R0-Z3, published in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-three-critical-launch-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent Call of Duty blog</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The new BlackCell Operator R0-Z3 arrives in an animated mantle and her signature mask along with her faithful hound, leading an awesome array of Season 03 BlackCell content. She is joined by a roster of teched out Operator Skins, sleek Weapon Blueprints, and sci-fi themed unlocks earned exclusively through BlackCell.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She looks as familiar as ever, but she has some golden splashes that make her fit with the BlackCell brand:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Roze first appeared in Warzone in July 2020, mere months after the game hit the market. She became a staple of the battle royale landscape, with everyone grinding the battle pass to Tier 100 to acquire the legendary Operator skin.</p>



<p>If you’ve got $30 to spare, you’ll be happy enough picking up BlackCell, and admittedly, it comes with heaps of bonus features for the avid Call of Duty fan. There are BlackCell-exclusive weapon blueprints for a range of firearms, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-amax-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMAX</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a>, which are returning for the reappearance of Verdansk in Warzone.</p>



<p>You’ll also get 1,100 COD Points, a 10% XP boost, and several exclusive skins for an array of Operators. They’re not as popular as R0-Z3 will be, but you never know.</p>



<p>Do you plan on getting the R0-Z3 skin as soon as possible, ready for Verdansk’s return? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-yves-guillemot%E2%80%99s-internal-memo-on-ubisoft-and-tencent%E2%80%99s-new-subsidiary.1146903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft and Tencent announced a new subsidiary valued at approximately €4 billion ($4.3 billion). Insider Gaming has received Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot’s internal memo on the announcement.</p>



<div><p>It reads,</p><p>“Hello everyone,</p><p>I’m pleased to share an important announcement that will mark a milestone in Ubisoft’s history.</p><p>Following a process to review different strategic options for Ubisoft’s future, we have just signed an exceptional agreement with one of our trusted shareholders, Tencent, with whom we have a solid relationship.</p><p>Their €1.16 billion investment will benefit all of Ubisoft. We will be able to firmly take back control of our future and renew with the serenity needed to create the best games.</p><p>The terms of this partnership are straightforward: we will establish a dedicated subsidiary within Ubisoft that will bring together our three most powerful franchises: Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry. This subsidiary will gather the teams working on these brands, primarily in the studios of Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Tencent will be a 25% shareholder of this new subsidiary, with the aim of boosting these franchises so they become undisputed global icons.</p><p>This historic agreement is above all a recognition of the extraordinary work you have been doing for years: the value of these three brands directly reflects your individual and collective talent and efforts, which have allowed us to create these beloved franchises.</p><p>This investment will also give us the means to accelerate the changes we’ve been discussing for several months across the group – changes that many of you have been longing for, as revealed by the Ubisoft XP survey. These changes are in line with the initiatives that Marie-Sophie has been sharing recently, which aim to put the creation of unique games and player satisfaction back at the heart of our daily work. This is what will enable us to return to a higher level of profitability.</p><p>This announcement comes at a pivotal time, after the very positive reception of Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the excitement sparked by the announcement of Rainbow 6 Siege X, of which we can be very proud.</p><p>I want to express my deepest gratitude for your resilience, tenacity, courage, and creativity – all the qualities that make Ubisoft a truly unique company and that helped us overcome a challenging period over the last few years.</p></div>



<div><p>The coming months will be dedicated to shaping our next chapter. Of course, this new step in our transformation will raise many questions, including on an individual level. We are committed to keeping you regularly informed, answering your questions, and providing visibility on the next steps.</p><p>I hope you can join the global livestream that will be held tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. CET during which I will share a few words with you. You’ll receive an invitation shortly.</p><p>See you tomorrow, and thank you again,</p><p>Yves”</p></div>



<hr>



<div><p>Understandably, employee’s are now nervous. In a follow-up email, Marie-Sophie de Waubert (Chief Studios &amp; Portfolio Officer) said,</p><p>“Hello everyone,</p><p>I wanted to follow up immediately with all of you in Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia after Yves’ email regarding the new Business Unit that is being created.</p><p>First and foremost, I want to emphasize that the agreement we announced is a powerful enabler and an exciting opportunity for Ubisoft. It will help us accelerate our evolution and improve how we make games with greater focus and agility.</p><p>Tencent’s investment is a strong testament to their trust in our ability to grow Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. This is a direct result of the incredible work you’ve done in making these franchises iconic, as a lead or major codev studio.</p><p>I also want to be clear: if you’re not currently working on these brands, it doesn’t mean your work matters any less. This agreement will benefit all of Ubisoft, giving us the means to spark more innovation and creativity across the board. This marks the beginning of a new chapter, and you play a vital role in shaping it.</p><p>In the coming weeks and months, we will work hard to build the best organization possible – for Ubisoft, for our teams, and for our players.</p><p>Of course, this brings some uncertainty and questions. Right now, we may not have all the detailed answers, but we are committed to communicating with you transparently and regularly. Supporting you through this transition is the top priority for your local and your global leadership teams. Don’t hesitate to reach out to them and stay tuned locally; usual or dedicated “studio times” will be also good forums to keep you updated and answer your questions.”</p></div>
