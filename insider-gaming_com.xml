<p>DLSS and DLAA are sophisticated graphical and performance-related techniques. They’re crucial for games like Battlefield 6 and its Open Beta. If you’re having problems with DLSS and DLAA not working, this guide has all the answers on why this is.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Open Beta</a> is up and running. You can already tell there’s a greater strain being placed on the beta compared to week one. The social media clips and the hype have got everyone worked up and excited to play.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Week 2 has been hit by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-matchmaking-update-01-arrives-to-fix-playlist-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matchmaking and playlist problems</a>, and there’s also DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling<br>) and DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) nuisances.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-dlss-amp-dlaa-working-in-battlefield-6-open-beta">Why Isn’t DLSS &amp; DLAA Working in Battlefield 6 Open Beta?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not as crisp and clear as it could be. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Both DLSS and DLAA are currently disabled in the Battlefield 6 Open beta due to an “issue” being investigated by the BF6 team.</strong></p>



<p>This is a very vague explanation, I know. But this is all the Battlefield Comms <a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X page</a> has disclosed for now. This was its first statement on the technical fault:</p>



<p>“The team is aware of reports regarding DLSS / DLAA being unavailable in the Open Beta. We’ll follow up with additional updates as soon as possible. Thanks for your patience!”</p>



<p>Thankfully, we’ve had further updates since then with better news.</p>



<div><article><p><span>The team is aware of reports regarding DLSS / DLAA being unavailable in the Open Beta. We’ll follow up with additional updates as soon as possible.

Thanks for your patience!</span></p></article></div>



<h2 id="h-when-will-dlss-amp-dlaa-be-fixed-in-battlefield-6">When Will DLSS &amp; DLAA be Fixed in Battlefield 6?</h2>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 team believes the DLSS and DLAA issues will be resolved by the end of August 14.</strong></p>



<p>Update 01 on the DLSS and DLAA indicates the root cause of the problem has been found. The team is working on it as I write this—alongside a myriad of other headaches—and has given a timeframe.</p>



<p>“The team have identified the root cause of this issue and are working to have this resolved and DLSS / DLAA active once again within the Battlefield Open Beta. We anticipate this to be resolved later today, and will update accordingly.”</p>



<p>As always, this doesn’t mean this <em>will </em>be the case, and there could be unforeseen delays. For now, you’ll have to endure slightly more uneven performance and sub-optimized explosions and gunfire for now. The Battlefield Comms is being very active and vocal on the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, so we do anticipate updates through the beta weekend.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-gooner-reputation-has-been-addressed-by-its-game-director/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals%E2%80%99-%E2%80%98gooner%E2%80%99-reputation-has-been-addressed-by-its-game-director.1269891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the beginning, Marvel Rivals started out as a budding hero shooter. A few weeks in, and it had amassed an audience of several hundred thousand players and counting. It’s established as one of the best free-to-play games, but recent skins that leave little to the imagination have raised eyebrows.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-version-might-become-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> launched with a star-studded roster with fabulous unlockable skins. It is a free-to-play game after all, so paid cosmetics were always going to be a thing. We’ve seen an increased influx of more scantily-clad costumes and somewhat exposed heroes, shall we say, in recent skins—leading to the ‘Gooner’ accusations.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-a-gooner-game">Is Marvel Rivals a ‘Gooner’ Game?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>C’mon, you’ve probably bought at least one of them. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-summer-party-swimsuit-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Summer Party Swimsuit Event</a> and its array of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-swimsuit-costumes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Swimsuit Costumes</a> have contributed greatly to Marvel Rivals’ ‘Gooner’ label.</p>



<p>Game director Guangyun ‘Guangguang’ Chen recently spoke with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RivalsAssembled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rivals Assembled</a>. In a special interview talking about all things Marvel Rivals—including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EOMM</a>—Guangguang was asked: “How do you guys respond to people calling Marvel Rivals a gooner game?”</p>



<p>Guangguang barely flinched before replying: “Because our design is inspired by classic comic themes, including some very outstanding skins, like Mantis and also Psylocke’s Vengeance, these all come from classic comic designs, and we create some more fashionable designs based on them to gain players’ appreciation. I think this also reflects the broad recognition from our players.”</p>



<p>“As mentioned earlier, with the Squirrel Girl and the Krakoa Resort skin, these are actually designs based on real-world themes and the season’s storyline. For designs like these, we try our best to integrate the storylines from the season, including elements from Krakoa, and blend popular elements from real life. We create new designs based on that, and I’m very grateful these designs have been well received by the majority of players.”</p>



<p><strong>Skip to 11:37 for the exchange.</strong></p>

<p>Do you think Marvel Rivals is a gooner game? Are people blowing some lore-specific skins out of proportion? Or ultimately, does none of this matter because Marvel Rivals is a good game?

            <title><![CDATA[Is Black Myth: Wukong Coming to Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-wukong-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-black-myth-wukong-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1269879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a long wait, Black Myth: Wukong is finally set to release on Microsoft platforms, so you may now be wondering whether the title will be available on Xbox Game Pass. We’ve got the answer.</p>



<p>Releasing August 20th on Xbox Series X|S, Black Myth: Wukong was one of the stand-out games of 2024, making huge waves after launching on PlayStation 5, and was one of the contenders for the Game of the Year title.</p>



<p>12 months after an initial release, Black Myth: Wukong is poised to make its debut on Xbox, and we’ve got the details on whether that includes a Game Pass inclusion.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-myth-wukong-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been a long wait. Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Black Myth: Wukong will not be available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on August 20th.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/black-myth-wukong/9NWQ1Q1FR0C9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is not an Xbox first-party title, and there has not been any announcement on the game coming to the service. As such, this confirms it won’t be included.</p>



<p>Although Xbox has not announced the second wave of August titles coming to the subscription service, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-for-august-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous announcement</a> covering up until the 14th, Black Myth: Wukong will not be one of the titles included. If it was, it would have been a huge surprise and would have been announced well in advance.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-myth-wukong-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Black Myth: Wukong Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that Black Myth: Wukong will ever be added to the Xbox Game Pass catalog in the future, although nothing can be ruled out entirely.</strong></p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science has close ties with Sony, releasing the title exclusively on PlayStation in August last year, and, while that timed-exclusive period has come to an end, it doesn’t mean the floodgates will open for an addition to the service.</p>



<p>Truthfully, if Black Myth: Wukong were to become available on any subscription service, it would probably be Sony’s PS Plus service. Even then, such an addition is unlikely to happen for a while, given the popularity of the title, so there’s not really any reason for Game Science to secure a deal.</p>



<p>Have you pre-ordered Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox? How long have you been waiting for its arrival on the platform? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The official Battlefield Communications page has acknowledged an issue concerning matchmaking when choosing playlist options in Battlefield 6. The ‘Update 01’ has been deployed in a bid to rectify this, and there’s more details on future measures in the works.</p>



<p>Was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Weekend 2</a> ever going to go smoothly without a single problem? Probably not. That’s a testament to the work that Battlefield Studios has put into the game’s testing and marketing. Thousands—potentially millions—of players are desperately trying to log in for the second-week beta. Understandably, there’s a big issue.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-update-01-drops">Battlefield 6 Update 01 Drops</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Revive matchmaking, please. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Battlefield Comms <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page has been active since the Weekend 2 beta started. It’s trying to keep players up to speed with bugs and potential hiccups you might encounter.</p>



<p>Matchmaking is proving to be one of the biggest walls we want to blow a hole through, though.</p>



<p>Here’s what Update 01 brings: “If you are currently experiencing matchmaking issues, please ensure that you have the most recent client update. EA App: Repair functionality is available via the 3-dot button, and Repair. The team continues to assess this.”</p>



<p>If the problem is happening to you, I recommend trying these methods. The final sentence shows that this is a <em>high priority</em> for the team, and more updates are likely in the works.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[6 Best Offensive Playbooks in Madden 26]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-offensive-playbooks-madden-26/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/6-best-offensive-playbooks-in-madden-26.1269861/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Madden 26 is here with a fresh slew of content to dig your teeth into, though you won’t be able to get anywhere without the best offensive playbooks. Fortunately for you, that’s where we come in.</p>



<p>Whether your mode of choice is Franchise Mode or Ultimate Team, Superstar Mode or going head-to-head against your friends online, a strong offensive playbook in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-review-a-mixed-bag-of-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> is crucial. Without one, you’ll struggle to find any momentum.</p>



<p>Even if you have the best players in the world, a decent playbook is pivotal to unlocking their full potential. To make things easier for you, we’ve picked out our six favorite offensive playbooks.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-offensive-playbooks-in-madden-26">Best Offensive Playbooks in Madden 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of options. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</h3>



<p>Arguably the best option in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden 26</a> for those who want a versatile offence, able to call upon both passing and running plays, the Chicago Bears playbook is incredibly strong. In fact, the only downside is that there are no Pistol plays to call upon, but there’s enough to keep you busy.</p>



<p>If you have a decent slew of receivers and running backs in your team, and you don’t want to rely heavily on one player, the Bears playbook is the perfect choice. With it at your disposal, it will be difficult for any opponent to predict your next move.</p>



<h3 id="h-green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</h3>



<p>Another option for those who want to rely on short passes, the Green Bay Packers playbook is exceptionally strong. Overall, the Packers have one of the most versatile playbooks in Madden 26, with a wide range of formations to call upon.</p>



<p>Top of the list are the Bunch formation plays, a go-to for many players in the community, and they are the perfect tool in your arsenal for breaking down a tough defence. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-orleans-saints">New Orleans Saints</h3>



<p>The New Orleans Saints playbook is the best choice for those who want to rely on short passes, as well as having several options for a mobile quarterback. While it might not be the playbook that dominates highlight reels, it’s effective in getting you moving and is probably the best choice to start with.</p>



<p>Well-balanced with a variety of formations, including Wildcat, there are some deeper plays you can call upon to mix things up. However, the strength is certainly in quick passes and pitches. </p>



<h3 id="h-philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</h3>



<p>The Eagles have been one of the strongest teams in the NFL for years, so it’s hardly surprising that they boast one of the strongest and most versatile playbooks in Madden 26. To unlock the full potential of the playbook, however, you’ll need a strong Tight End in your ranks.</p>



<p>Another strength is the variety of ways you can keep your opponent on their toes, with an array of trick plays to call upon. Even against the toughest defences, the playbook is loaded with options to keep you ahead and leave your opponent on the backfoot.</p>



<h3 id="h-san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</h3>



<p>If you want to lean heavily on a talented running back, the San Francisco 49ers playbook is the one for you. Ideally used when facing a zone defense, this playbook is perfect for finding a receiver in wide open space, or hammering through the defensive line with your running back.</p>



<p>The downside, of course, is the playbook requires a top-class running back, and, without it, you’ll struggle to find momentum. If you’re in Franchise Mode and have that at your disposal, or have packed a top-class running back in Ultimate Team, I highly suggest taking a looking at this option.</p>



<h3 id="h-los-angeles-chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</h3>



<p>Another option for anyone wanting a run-focused offense is the Los Angeles Chargers playbook, with boasts a wide array of Singleback plays. There are also some rather unique plays to call upon to leave your opponents in a spin, though you’ll require decent depth with your running options.</p>



<p>The benefit over the 49ers playbook is a decent chunk of Shotgun plays to call upon, bringing your receivers into the game more and providing greater options when calling plays. </p>



<p>Which playbook has been your go-to in Madden 26 so far? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-update-surprisingly-big-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-2042-could-be-getting-a-%E2%80%98surprisingly-big%E2%80%99-update-soon.1269792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been suggested on social media that Battlefield 2042, the most recent game in the series to hit the open market, will get a ‘surprisingly big’ content update soon. It was theorized that this could be the final update to hit the Battlefield 2042 platform before Battlefield 6 is released worldwide on October 10.</p>



<p>The claimed update that comes from ‘Temporyal’ on social media includes a new map, three new weapons, and two new vehicles being broken out of the Battlefield Vault.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2042-s-final-content-update">Battlefield 2042’s Final Content Update</h2>



<p>With Battlefield 6 sitting tantalizingly close on that horizon, Battlefield 2042 is preparing to become a forgotten thing of the past. In a new post on social media, prolific dataminer ‘Temporyal’ claimed that a ‘surprisingly big’ update is headed to Battlefield 2042, and that it might be <strong>the final update</strong> for the game, content-wise.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Battlefield 2042 may be getting a surprisingly big (maybe final?) content update soon.</p><p>New Map:<br>🇯🇵 Iwo Jima</p><p>New Weapons:<br>🤫 The Prototype (“Riverdweller”)<br>🔫 KFS2000 (FN F2000)<br>🎯 GM6 Lynx</p><p>New Vault Vehicles:<br>🇺🇸 A-10 Warthog<br>🇷🇺 SU-25TM Frogfoot</p><p>🪖 Pax Armata-themed cosmetics <a href="https://t.co/vvZ3P4uhUl">pic.twitter.com/vvZ3P4uhUl</a></p></div>— temporyal (@temporyal) <a href="https://twitter.com/temporyal/status/1955701622660591897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Iwo Jima is a setting we’ve seen before in the Battlefield world, even if it seems a little out of left field for Battlefield 2042 (and Battlefield 6, for that matter).</p>



<p>The suggestion that this update includes Pax Armata is interesting. It almost guarantees it’ll drop soon, as Pax Armata is the antagonist faction in Battlefield 6, and this would be Electronic Arts fuelling the hype for the next game by bleeding it into Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>I’m personally more interested in the return of the SU-25TM and the A-10. They’re timeless classics in the Battlefield space, and raking the ground with fire from the Warthog’s auto-cannon never gets old.</p>



<p><strong>BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT</strong>.</p>



<p>Temporyal explained a little more about the Pax Armata cosmetics by offering a description from a datamined bundle:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A new way of warfare has been born, and that requires soldiers trained for the task. Pax Armata intends to change the world – will you join their ranks or become one of the conquered?”</p>
</blockquote>
