            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, some of the most prolific personalities in the Escape from Tarkov space have taken to social media to complain about a new phenomenon. What has been labelled a ‘vulnerability’ by some is causing Escape from Tarkov accounts to be <strong>wiped </strong>and altered by what is assumed to be rogue operators.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has stressed it’s aware of the issue and is working on it, but no official statement has been posted.</p>







<h2 id="h-has-your-tarkov-account-been-wiped">Has Your Tarkov Account Been Wiped?</h2>



<p>Hours ago, posts started surfacing on social media from users impacted by this Tarkov account wiping issue. In some cases, big-name streamers were recorded suffering from the problem <strong>live on air</strong>. Dr Lupo was one of the content creators struck by the anomaly.</p>



<p>In a comment under one of the investigative posts, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>already took measures. investigating</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s what the players are figuring out about the issue from what they’ve learned:</p>



<ul>
<li>There’s a vulnerability ‘somewhere’ that malicious operators are leaning on to access and reset accounts of other players, most notably prolific players.</li>



<li>Whoever is doing this is able to bypass two-factor authentication, as accounts that have the security layers in place are reporting this problem occurring.</li>



<li>It was thought this issue was related to Escape from Tarkov: Arena, but that most likely isn’t the case.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p><em>We’ve reached out to Battlestate Games for confirmation on what’s happening.</em></p>



<p>In August 2024, a technical malfunction caused player profiles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-malfunction-profile-wipe/">to suffer from unwanted wipes</a>. It was reported that ‘tens of thousands’ of profiles were impacted by this back-end issue, which led to an irrevocable data wipe.</p>



<p>Popular creator Onepeg explained <a href="https://x.com/Onepeg/status/2004685750894559692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My tarkov account got reset. Gg boys.</p>



<p>I did not use the wiki at all for at least the last few days. I haven’t clicked on any weird links. This has to be some other vulnerability.</p>



<p>pfp got changed to a QR code that forwards to a 7 second long youtube video calling me a bitch lmao at least these guys have a sense of humor.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One user took to socials to stress how impactful the issue had been, with their account being stripped of all progress at a pivotal progression point:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I got RESET TO 0 IN TARKOV?<br>Somehow, an hour ago someone logged into my account and reset it to 0, they also changed my profile Pic, my accounts have double log verification, etc. Never had this happen before, with any account whatsoever. I was lvl 53 ready to prestige 5 with all… <a href="https://t.co/dAtts06Ulc">pic.twitter.com/dAtts06Ulc</a></p>— BAXBEAST (@BAXBEAST) <a href="https://twitter.com/BAXBEAST/status/2004607588302717205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>This issue has struck amidst a lengthy Twitch Drops campaign that’s stuffing players’ accounts full of loot, which adds extra fuel to the fire and insult to injury.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Jujutsu: Zero Codes (December 2025)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-jujutsu-zero-codes/</link>
            <guid>1392661</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Jujutsu: Zero monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including extra Clan Rolls and much more.</p>



<p>Jujutsu: Zero is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/your-bank-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> action RPG where players develop and strengthen their sorcerer by mastering cursed techniques, joining powerful clans, and defeating increasingly challenging enemies. Unlike simple button-mashing games, success demands mastering the parry system, where perfectly timing your blocks as enemy attack indicators close creates openings for devastating counters.</p>



<p>What sets Jujutsu: Zero apart is its clan system, where your bloodline determines your passive abilities and stat bonuses. The game’s progression feels meaningful as you evolve from a Grade 4 novice toward the coveted Special Grade status, unlocking increasingly powerful techniques along the way. The premium currency, Lumens, fuels the gacha system where you’ll roll for powerful cursed techniques on specialized banners.</p>







<p>While grinding is always an option, savvy players accelerate their journey by hunting down promotional codes that developers regularly release during updates and holidays.</p>



<h2>Active Jujutsu: Zero Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>BETAout</strong> – 200x Clan Rolls and 3,500x Lumens</li>



<li><strong>CHARM</strong> –1x Basic Charm</li>



<li><strong>smallfixPATCH</strong> – 1,500x Lumens, 3x XP Vows and 15x Clan Rolls</li>
</ul>



<h2>Expired Jujutsu: Zero Codes</h2>



<p>As of December 2025, there are no expired codes for the Roblox game Jujutsu: Zero.</p>



<h2>How To Redeem Jujutsu: Zero Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Jujutsu: Zero Codes Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Follow these steps to activate all the active codes in Jujutsu: Zero:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Jujutsu: Zero in Roblox</li>



<li>Click on the button labelled Codes in the main menu</li>



<li>Type or paste the code into the text box</li>



<li>Click on Redeem and claim your freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2>How To Get More Jujutsu: Zero Codes</h2>



<p>Jujutsu: Zero codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Discord server, where developers post in the announcements channel, the Roblox game page itself, and Studio Resonance’s social media accounts where they regularly share updates and special events.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones, major updates, or special events like the recent beta launch. But if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself. This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals Season 6 carries on the live-service shooter’s comic book story in 2026. It’s the first proper content of the new year, and it’s adding the odd brash and brutal face or two. If you’re looking for the Marvel Rivals Season 6 start date and times, Insider Gaming has everything you need to know.</p>



<p>It’s been a wild and exciting 12 months for Marvel Rivals. NetEase has added new characters, from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-gambit-voice-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gambit</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ad-rogue-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rogue</a>. The player count is steady—as is your aim—and 2026 signals the next era of the game.</p>

<p><strong>The official Marvel Rivals Season 6 start date is locked in for January 16, giving you plenty of time to wrap up the previous season and enjoy a hearty Christmas before starting S6!</strong></p>



<p>You’ve got plenty of time to stuff your face with Turkey, beverages, chocolate, and anything else you can get your holiday hands on. Once the Christmas period starts to tail off and we get into the real meat of 2026, NetEase games will drop Season 6.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox FIFA Super Soccer monthly redeem codes to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including special Xmas packs, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIFA Super Soccer, as the title suggests, is an official FIFA-sponsored <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-fireball-training-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience centered around football, including attire, emotes, celebrations, and dribbling, among other talking points. Coins are the primary in-game currency and are rewarded to players after every match. The winning team, the MVP, and players who score goals earn more Coins. These Coins can be spent on various packs, however, they often cost several thousand Coins and require intense grinding. This is where active codes come in, as they can be redeemed not only for packs but also for free accessories and gear. This article covers all the active codes, inactive ones, instructions on how to redeem them, and more.</p>
