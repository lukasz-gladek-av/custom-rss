<p>The Rockstar Games employee dismissals have dominated gaming headlines for several weeks. Now, a new report has revealed the Discord messages that are believed to have led to the termination of 34 Rockstar Games workers.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reported back in October about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Workers allegedly being fired to prevent union forming.</a> Since then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games has claimed that the fired employees were leaking information</a>. There have been protests since, and the company has since been hit with legal action over the firings.</p>



<p>But now, a new development has seemingly uncovered the actual Discord messages at the root of everything.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-games-allegedly-accessed-union-discord-server">Rockstar Games Allegedly Accessed Union Discord Server</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A dark period for Rockstar. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleMakeGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People Make Games</a> released an eye-opening video on November 24 titled: “The Messages Rockstar Saw Before Firing 34 Union Members.”</p>



<p>The reporter claims that they have “since spoken to a Rockstar insider, who has shared screenshots with People Make Games of what they believe to be the messages sent just a few weeks ago on that Discord server, which directly contributed to the firings of these 34 former employees. We also know how Rockstar got hold of these messages as well.”</p>



<p>According to People Make Games, the source is “not one of the fired workers” and isn’t even part of the union. The Discord server has apparently been around since 2022 and consisted of various Rockstar employees.</p>







<p>The reporter’s source claims that “They couldn’t recall a single example of any confidential game details being shared.” It’s said that the beginning of October 2025 saw Rockstar Games revise its policies pertaining to the company Slack—a messaging platform usually used by workplaces.</p>



<p>Various non-essential chats were removed, with the company claiming them to be a “distraction” and a source of “poor conduct”. </p>



<p>This “Slack purge” did not go down well. The union Discord server discussed these changes, with one individual saying: “I would really like to see the evidence for them being too much of a productivity hit. I can’t imagine it being worth the absolute dumpsterfire this will be for morale.”</p>



<p>It’s alleged that Rockstar’s Slack revision email was sent out after 5 PM—and employees can’t check their emails outside of work—and a second email about guidelines and conduct was also pushed. The emails were shared by people still in the office on Discord to inform other colleagues who hadn’t seen them yet.</p>



<p>“This led to one member of the Discord approaching studio management to express concerns about the discussions taking place,” the report adds. Additionally, “I’m told this either contributed to or kicked off an investigation into the Discord by the company, which does line up with the timings we now understand.”</p>



<p>The report claims it’s likely Rockstar did manage to access the union Discord server. Soon after, the whole world learned of the firings, with Rockstar presumably identifying individuals in the union chat who had broken guidelines, weren’t adhering to policy, and potentially attributed this to leaks.</p>



<p>You can see recreations of the Discord messages in the full video below.</p>

<p>The 2025 holiday shopping season is in full swing, and Nintendo is dropping a host of discounts to help players secure some last-minute deals and gifts.</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking to pull the trigger on a Nintendo Switch 2, are looking to add to your library of games, or are on the hunt for accessories, Nintendo has plenty of deals to cover all bases.</p>



<p>To help with your shopping spree, Insider Gaming has collected the best Nintendo Black Friday deals for 2025. Make sure to leave a comment if something catches your eye, and join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> to share deals you’ve found with other players to take advantage of.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-do-the-nintendo-black-friday-deals-start">When Do The Nintendo Black Friday Deals Start?</h2>



<p>Nintendo’s holiday gift guide went live well in advance of Black Friday, on November 10, with the main Cyber Deals kicking off on November 20 and running through to December 3 at 11:59 PM PT.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-nintendo-deals-for-black-friday-and-the-2025-holidays">Best Nintendo Deals For Black Friday and the 2025 Holidays</h2>



<h3 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-console-deals">Nintendo Switch 2 Console Deals</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch 2 console has not received any fresh price drops directly from Nintendo for the holiday season, though you can still take advantage of the bundle deals with Mario Kart World &amp; Pokémon Legends: Z-A that save $20-30 compared to purchasing separately. However, retailers may offer additional incentives on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, though this is unlikely to be a price slash, and may instead include extra accessories or bundle deals.</p>







<h3 id="h-nintendo-switch-accessories">Nintendo Switch Accessories</h3>



<p>Similar to the Switch 2 consoles, Nintendo hasn’t issued any direct deals for accessories for the original Switch and Switch 2, so the best course of action for savings on these will likely be heading to other retailers. However, even they are unlikely to drop prices significantly for Switch 2 accessories like Joy-Con controllers and the Camera. </p>

<p>If you’re looking to expand your games library on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 this holiday, the good news is that this is where you will find the majority of savings, particularly during the Cyber Deals event running until December 3.
