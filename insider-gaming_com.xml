<p>SEGA’s unwavering commitment to the Yazkuza/Like a Dragon series shows no signs of stopping. Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is the newest release—arriving quite soon after Infinite Wealth—and we’ve put together an all-in-one guide to its key details.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-gets-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> is a new, fully-fledged Like a Dragon game. It’s one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2025-is-the-year-of-the-rpg-upcoming-rpg-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025’s biggest RPGs</a> and Goro Majima is the leading man again as we journey through the franchise’s bizarre new direction. If you thought 2024’s Infinite Wealth was starting to get wacky with its foray into Hawaii, you’ve seen nothing yet.</p>



<p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii gives overboard on the pirate theme. It looks to be the most swashbuckling entry in the series’ illustrious history and looks to be a cutlass above the rest.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It makes you want to scream yarrrr! Credit to SEGA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>February 21 is the release date for Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not sure how developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has managed this, but the predecessor Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth was released on Jan. 26, 2024. This means it’s only a <strong>13-month turnaround for the sequel</strong> to happen.</p>



<p>Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii isn’t going to be a 100+ hour marathon like many Yakuza games, however, expect to spend a good chunk of time roaming around Hawaii—pillaging and pirating.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers are going back on their decision of rank resets for the second half of the first season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals recently released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-detail-season-and-half-season-ranks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer update</a> for the second half of the upcoming season. In it, we learned about the release date, forthcoming changes, and a rank reset that drops players by four divisions. This worried many players, as they would have to drop four ranks now and another six ranks when the second season begins. Naturally, there was a huge uproar, and due to the massive feedback, Netease decided to reverse the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from Marvel Rivals delves deeper into the concerns around rank reset. NetEase understands that a rank drop every half-season will make the “competitive mode less enjoyable” for the community. Hence, rather than a rank reset, players must “complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet the relevant conditions by the end of the season” to earn new rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rewards for the end of the second half will be the same as those they just received. Players will be eligible to earn “a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.” The Marvel Rivals community is <a href="https://x.com/Valennxxte/status/1889209660822970688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">happy</a> their concerns received a swift response from the devs.&nbsp;</p>

Also, Ninja thinks NetEase’s new game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-dead-ninja-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has killed Overwatch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-the-order-1886-didnt-get-sequel/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Order: 1886 was a one-and-done game released on PlayStation 4 in 2015. It was a pretty good title, pieced together by Ready at Dawn and offering players an immersive, original single-player campaign. It plunged gamers into an alt-history version of London in, you guessed it, 1886, pitting them against werewolves and vampires, among other things.</p>



<p>The Order: 1886 was a deeply cinematic affair, and even the game’s aspect ratio promoted a sense of ‘playing a movie’, but it wasn’t enough to warrant a follow-up title, despite one being planned by Ready at Dawn. In a recent interview, the studio’s co-founder explained <strong>why </strong>a sequel never arrived.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-missed-it-by-that-much">Missed it by That Much</h2>



<p>In an interview with MinnMax uncovered by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ready-at-dawn-co-founder-discusses-failed-the-order-1886-sequel-pitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGC</a>, it’s revealed why The Order: 1886 didn’t receive a sequel, despite many players asking for one over the years. As the discussion unfolded in the 24-minute sequence, Ready at Dawn’s Andrea Pessino explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it was the sales – I think it was the critical reception.</p>



<p>Sony is a very proud group and rightfully so, and the critical reception, if it had even been just in the 70s, we would have had the sequel, I’m convinced.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pessino was referring to The Order: 1886’s Metacritic score, which landed on a not-so-good 63 post-launch. That was despite the game testing well and generating solid responses from previews and mock interviews, Pessino reported.</p>



<p>The Order: 1886’s follow-up title should have arrived in 2018 if everything had gone as planned. Ultimately, the team at Ready at Dawn had to slice and dice the opening game to meet Sony’s deadlines, resulting in some of the game’s more innovative and engaging segments effectively becoming sheer cinematics:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the problems is that so much was cut.</p>



<p>A lot of the more subtle narrative parts were lost because so much was chopped away and things that were supposed to be interactive became a movie.</p>



<p>We needed another year, that’s the reality. We needed at least one more year, we didn’t get it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

<p><br>The Order: 1886 is one of those games that’ll go down in history as <strong>needing a sequel</strong>. It fits in nicely alongside the likes of Bloodborne, another PlayStation 4 game that, for many years, fans worldwide have cried out for a follow-up title to.</p>

<p>Team Jade has revealed that Delta Force’s single-player campaign – ‘Black Hawk Down’ – will be released on February 21. This paid expansion of the free-to-play Delta Force label is one of the most highly anticipated portions of the new game, allowing players to ‘relive’ the events of the fateful operation that took place in October 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia.</p>



<p>In a new trailer released recently, Team Jade revealed the intensity of this campaign, showcasing 30 seconds of gameplay and cinematics – and admittedly, it looks pretty fantastic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-delta-force-goes-single-player">Delta Force Goes Single-Player</h2>



<p>Delta Force was released in December 2024 as a multiplayer shooter, allowing players worldwide to explore a few maps and modes. Since dropping, Delta Force has been incessantly compared to Battlefield, with many of the game’s core mechanics – and even the UI – representing what’s available in Battlefield 2042, the latest release in the EA-backed franchise.</p>



<p>The single-player portion of Delta Force is expected to turn heads owing to a semi-accurate representation of one of the most famous battles in American military history – the ‘Battle of Mogadishu’. </p>



<p>Here’s the most recent trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The Black Hawk Down campaign isn’t free, though. This PvE, narrative-driven mode will have a price tag, but it’s a one-shot thing – beyond the initial purchase, you won’t have to pay for anything else, and it can even be played with friends. At the time of publishing, it hadn’t been confirmed how much the Delta Force campaign would cost.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force isn’t a bad game</a>, and that’s coming from a lifelong Battlefield fan. The single-player portion looks as though it’ll be a blast, and I’m excited to dive in when it’s finally released on February 21.</p>
