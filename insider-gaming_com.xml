            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-%E2%80%9Cwill-explore%E2%80%9D-nintendo-switch-2-possibility.1287270/</guid>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has opened up all manner of possibilities for gamers and Nintendo itself. With Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 being one of 2025‚Äôs biggest and best games, it would only be fitting if the Switch 2 could welcome the GOTY contender onto the console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-teases-new-content-and-other-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> could already be 2025‚Äôs Game of the Year. That‚Äôs how revered and successful it is. It‚Äôs the highest-rated release this year, and a wider reach could introduce even more players to its unreal world. While it‚Äôs anything but official, a new quote from its developer suggests all hope isn‚Äôt lost.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It would look good. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/sandfall-interactive-esta-explorando-lanzar-clair-obscur-expedition-33-en-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintenderos</a> has reported that Sandfall Interactive isn‚Äôt ruling out bringing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to the Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe have some possibilities that we will explore, but at the moment we cannot confirm anything,‚Äù was the company‚Äôs official response when prompted by Nintederos on a Switch 2 port.</p>



<p>Reports are circulating that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many developers are struggling to get Switch 2 dev kits</a>. This understandably holds back many games and is likely to delay a ton of future third-party ports to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With Sandfall not ruling out a Clair Obscur Switch 2 crossover, this could be the reason why an announcement is taking so long. We‚Äôll keep you updated on the situation and developments on a future Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>Will you buy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 if it arrives on Nintendo‚Äôs new hardware? Or are you busy and impatiently waiting for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-franchise-sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>? As usual, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> is the perfect place to echo all your thoughts and theories.</p>
