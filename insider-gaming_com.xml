<p>Battlestate Games recently carried out a survey in Escape from Tarkov geared towards gathering feedback centered on the ‘Scav’ player character. When folks play Escape from Tarkov, they can do so as a PMC, which is their dedicated character, or as a Scav, which is a randomised ‘local’ character that has many restrictions and drawbacks.</p>



<p>Following the collection of the survey results, Battlestate Games has already implemented some major changes to Scav characters. It was stressed that further changes are in the pipeline.</p>



<p>Find out below what Battlestate Games has done to upgrade Scavs.</p>

<h2 id="h-scav-life">Scav Life</h2>



<p>The feedback received from the recent Escape from Tarkov survey revealed that 64% of players want to be able to ‘plan and control’ where their Scav character can go, which is mostly centered around picking the map they want to explore. Additionally, 84% of players confirmed that they only play as a Scav to perform loot runs and secure items to upgrade their in-game Hideout.</p>



<p>By comparison, 30% of players said that playing as a Scav should be truly random, right down to which map the player is forced to explore. Also, 2.6% of players admitted that they never play as a Scav character, and 6.6% play as a Scav to actively seek out PvP scraps with PMC characters.</p>



<p>To improve the state of play with Scav characters since the survey, Battlestate Games has made af few key changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Player Scavs will now spawn no earlier than 17 minutes <strong>after </strong>the start of the raid on all maps except for Reserve, Factory, and Ground Zero.</li>



<li>The Scav equipment system has been improved, and a higher fence rep will now reward a player with better Scav gear.</li>
</ul>



<p>It was then promised that more optimisations are coming to the role that 97% of Tarkov players enjoy.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov remains at the top of the table where extraction shooters are concerned. It has been around for almost ten years and shows no signs of slowing down. In just a couple of months, players will be transitioning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">into another ‘wipe’ event</a>.</p>



<p>Do you play as a Scav in Escape from Tarkov? What would you like to see changed? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It has been a silly amount of time since the first trailer for GTA 6 was released by Rockstar Games. In December 2023, we got our first look at the upcoming game, and since then, things have run completely flat. Many rumours and proposed release dates for the second GTA 6 trailer have come and gone time and again, and right now, we have <strong>no idea </strong>when the next snippet will drop.</p>



<p>Recently, Rockstar Games took a break from not promoting GTA 6 to back something else entirely – a new Danny Dyer movie. It’s bizarre, but there’s a method to the madness that led to the gaming titan promoting a small British movie.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-proper-naughty-comedy">‘A Proper Naughty Comedy’</h2>



<p>Everyone is on tenterhooks, wondering when the next GTA 6 trailer will be released, but Rockstar is keeping tight-lipped. It seems that gamers worldwide have plundered the first trailer clean of every tidbit and detail, and there’s nothing left to be discovered – not that everyone is giving up, of course. </p>



<p>In an unexpected post on social media, Rockstar took a moment to promote Danny Dyer and Nick Love’s new British movie, Marching Powder.</p>



<div><article><p><span>From our friends Nick Love and Danny Dyer, the absolute legends behind The Football Factory…

</span><a href="https://twitter.com/MarchingPowder_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MarchingPowder_</a><span> — a proper naughty comedy out tomorrow in the UK and Ireland.

Get tickets now at </span><a href="http://marchingpowderthemovie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marchingpowderthemovie.com</a><span> and look out for details on worldwide release soon.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Fans have already theorised that this is a clear nod to Danny Dyer appearing in GTA 6, potentially reprising his ‘Kent Paul’ character, which was last seen in 2004’s GTA: San Andreas. Others more privy to the situation have recollected how Rockstar Games was a <strong>producer </strong>of the movie penned in the recent social media post – The Football Factory.</p>



<p>Given that the GTA universe split in 2008 when GTA 4 was released, it seems highly unlikely that Kent Paul is returning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/">in GTA 6</a>, but never say never, right?</p>



<p>Keep on waiting for that trailer.</p>

<p>Split Fiction upholds Hazelight Studios’ sterling reputation for delivering high-quality voice over work with a polished production. If you’re wondering who provides the voices for Mio, Zoe, and several other key figures, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<p>A Way Out and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a> are considered iconic because of their co-op-focused action. But I find anything with a Hazelight Studios logo comes with a certain level of quality seldom seen in AAA games. A tight script and endearing characters further enhance the variety of the gameplay. </p>



<p>In years past, Leo and Vincent’s no-nonsense approach in A Way Out caught the eye, and May and Cody’s strangled relationship was painful but engaging. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> introduces the butting heads of Zoe and Mio, and they are backed up by a stellar cast of characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-zoe-amp-mio-in-split-fiction">Who Voices Zoe &amp; Mio in Split Fiction?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So much happening at once. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elsie Bennett voices Zoe in Split Fiction, whereas the role of Mio is assumed by actress Kaja Chan.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-kaja-chan">Kaja Chan</h3>



<p>Kaja has recently shifted into the video game art. After several TV appearances, she provided voice over work in CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty DLC. She moved on to have casting credits in Foamstars and The First Descendant, before landing what is sure to be a breakthrough role as Mio in Split Fiction.</p>



<h3 id="h-elsie-bennett">Elsie Bennett</h3>



<p>Split Fiction’s Zoe is handled brilliantly by Elsie Bennett. She built up a consistent video game profile by lending her talents to IO Interactive’s Hitman games. She added more acting credits to her portfolio by providing several voices for Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint and Control, before actualizing the character of Zoe.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-voice-actors-in-split-fiction">All Voice Actors in Split Fiction</h2>



<p><strong>Split Fiction has over 40 actors and actresses working hard to bring every hero and enemy to life.</strong></p>



<p>From the Mr. Hammer boss to J.D Rader himself, every role has a voice, along with distinct character and personality. According to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34996975/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_cst_sm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB</a>, the cast has <strong>42 roles in total</strong>. No expense has been spared to ensure Split Fiction is presented professionally and as emotionally as possible.</p>
