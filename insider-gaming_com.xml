<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed to November 19th 2026, according to Rockstar Games. The news comes just before Take-Two Interactive was set to reveal the sales report for the year.</p>



<p>There’s no denying that Grand Theft Auto 6 is the most anticipated game of 2026. The third-person open-world shooter is a household name, for good and bad. Rockstar Games’ enormous success with GTA 5 is still going strong even after a decade since release. At a time, when it was slated to release in 2025, developers feared it would release near or with it and get nothing. Despite a delay to May 26th, 2026, the hype hasn’t died out in the slightest. The last trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-2-is-live-featuring-jason-and-lucia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raked in 137 million views</a> and growing, so it’s clear people are anxious to get their hands on it. Well, it’s going to be a bit longer of a wait.</p>



<p>This story is currently developing and will be updated once more information is revealed.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-delayed-to-november-19th-2026">GTA 6 Delayed to November 19th, 2026</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</p><p>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a<a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?t=ptQ-g0f12tfyu0M9qfbBQw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> tweet from Rockstar Games</a>, the company revealed that <strong>Grand Theft Auto 6</strong> is now <strong>delayed to November 19th, 2026</strong>. The game was originally set to come out on May 26th, 2026. In a <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540444126249252?t=R8mT952wpGMG1v8Lb-jajg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement from Rockstar Games</a>, they said the following,</p>



<p><strong>“We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.”</strong></p>



<p>It has already been a long, long road since Grand Theft Auto 5, so the almost year-long wait now is disappointing for sure. The company seemed adament that it would make the May release earlier this year, but it looks like that isn’t happening. It did seem likely, as there has been no new trailers or marketing since the last trailer. While the finished product will likely be worth the wait, it still stings knowing it’s going to take longer.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Square Enix has released a statement to the media regarding the layoffs. However, they didn’t clarify the number of people being let go, and Insider Gaming has asked for more clarification. </p>



<p>The full statement is as follows:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are reorganizing our operations in North America and Europe to strengthen our development structure and to drive a globally integrated marketing strategy. This was an extremely difficult decision, made following careful consideration and analysis by our leadership, in order to best position the Group’s long-term growth.</p>



<p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the talented team members who will be departing the company for their significant contributions to Square Enix. During this period of transition, we remain committed to treating each individual with the utmost respect and providing extensive support throughout this process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Original Story:</em></strong> Square Enix is letting go more than 100 employees in a global mass layoff.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN’s Rebekah Valentine</a>, Square Enix is letting go up to 137 people in the United Kingdom (UK) along with an unknown number of people in the United States (US).</p>



<p>The layoffs were announced in a video call with staff located outside of Japan. These cuts will impact those working in marketing, publishing, business planning, QA, IT, and more. Staff being let go will start being notified on Thursday. Full details on what Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu called a <strong>“fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization” </strong>will be given in the future.</p>



<p><strong>“In the current fiscal year, a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency,”</strong> a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">presentation shown</a> first to staff before being made public said.</p>



<p>It has also been reported that those not let go from the company will be required to work more often in office. </p>



<p>They also come the same day the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-wants-ai-to-handle-70-of-qa-within-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said it wants to have 70%</a> of its QA and debugging handled by AI by the end of 2027. It’s unclear, however, if this plan attributed to the current round of job cuts.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Square Enix for comment on the layoffs. Should a response be received or a statement be made public, it will be added to this story.</p>
