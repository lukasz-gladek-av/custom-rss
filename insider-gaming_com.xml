            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Headwinds update for ARC Raiders is finally here, and it’s brought with it a fair share of new content. From a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy Display Project</a> to a new Minor Map Condition, it’s a fairly exciting update, but one thing has caught the fanbase off guard—the new Augments.</p>



<p>It wasn’t mentioned anywhere in the build-up to the update, but now that it’s here, two new Epic Augments have been confirmed to have arrived in ARC Raiders. Augments are crucial to planning your loadout, and by the looks of things, these two new ones are about to shift the meta in a major way.</p>







<p>Follow along with this guide to find out what the two new Epic Augments are in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-easily-complete-all-arc-raiders-trials-this-week-january-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, as well as how to get your hands on them.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-two-new-epic-augments-in-arc-raiders">What Are The Two New Epic Augments In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Will they be better than the Survivor Augment? Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The two new Epic Augments in ARC Raiders are the Tactical Mk. 3 Revival and the Survivor Mk. 3 Safekeeper.</strong></p>



<p>Both Augments are of the Epic rarity, and they each bring some unique traits to the table. Here are both of their unique traits:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Augment Name</th><th data-align="center">Augment Trait</th><th data-align="center">Augment Shield Compatibility</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical Mk. 3 Revival</td><td data-align="center">Restores 1 health every 5 seconds. When damage is taken, the effect is paused for 30 seconds.<br>Augmented Slot has a Defib.</td><td data-align="center">Light</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Survivor Mk. 3 Safekeeper</td><td data-align="center">A Safe Pocket that allows any item to be stored.</td><td data-align="center">Light<br>Medium<br>Heavy</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The star of the show is undoubtedly the Safekeeper Augment; having the ability to store any item in your safe pocket, including guns, is a major benefit to any raider, and it’s immediately one of the best Augments in the game. The Revival Augment, on the other hand, is a slight let down. The integrated Defib is a nice touch, but based on the name, fans were hoping for a self-reviving augment.</p>



<p>Let’s be real, though—everyone is going to want that Safekeeper Augment. But the question remains, where do you find it?</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-two-new-epic-augments-in-arc-raiders">Where To Find The Two New Epic Augments In ARC Raiders</h2>



<p><strong>As is the case with every other Augment in ARC Raiders, there’s no set spawn location to find them; instead, you’ll need to hope you find their Blueprint whilst looting.</strong></p>



<p>That’s not to say there aren’t places you can search to improve your odds of finding one, though. Your best bet is to load into a map during a Major Map Condition, like a Night Raid or Electromagnetic Storm. Once in, head to the High Loot zones, and get searching!</p>







<p>Some of the best containers are usually the Lockers and Cabinets, though Blueprints can be found just about anywhere. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-patch-removes-out-of-map-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stella Montis</a> is a great map for such looting excursions, but beware, as most raiders are bound to be on the prowl for the same Blueprints—and they don’t always play nice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has arrived with a hefty patch for ARC Raiders update 1.13.0, introducing new features, updates, and bug fixes. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders’ new mode, Solos vs Squads, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-trailer-leak-reveals-solos-squads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> before the official announcement when the Headwinds update trailer was accidentally posted early. Now, the latest patch introduces a new game mode, along with other additions such as a Trophy Display, Bird City, new quests, and more. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-arc-raiders-update-1-13-0">What’s New in ARC Raiders Update 1.13.0?</h2>



<p>The ARC Raiders update 1.13.0 introduces a new matchmaking option called Solo vs. Squads, designed for highly skilled players seeking a greater challenge. If you are a solo raider above level 40, you can participate in the Solo vs. Squads option and take on groups of raiders by yourself. Additionally, a new project called Trophy Display requires players to hunt and gather parts from groups of ARC. Successfully completing this can reward players with Raider Tokens, a Howl emote, a guitar, and 300,000 Coins.</p>



<p>Next, we have the Bird City map condition: Buried City has experienced a surge of birds building nests in empty chimneys. Players can inspect these nests for new trinkets, and more bird traps and ziplines will be added to the map. Additionally, this patch introduces two new types of Epic Augments and seven new quests for players to try out.</p>



<p>Additionally, ARC Raiders update 1.13.0 also introduces an option to set parties to open, allowing friends to join your game even faster. Players can now use squad invites, allowing party members to invite others. Check out all the changes in the full patch notes below: </p>



<h2 id="h-all-arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes">All ARC Raiders Update 1.13.0 Patch Notes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Solo vs Squads</strong>
<ul>
<li>Solo vs Squads is a new matchmaking option for our experienced and highly skilled players who enjoy the PvP aspect of the game. Solo Raiders level 40 and above will get the “Solo vs Squad” toggle above matchmaking to join the Squads queue and tackle squads of Raiders head-on. When opting in, players will receive +20% bonus XP at the end of the round on both successful extract, and defeat.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Trophy Display</strong>
<ul>
<li>A new long-term project which requires players to hunt increasingly dangerous groups of ARC to submit their parts for rewards. Raiders will be able to build a new Display Case over 5 different steps (same as for the Candleberry Project) and each level will add a new item to the Display Case.</li>



<li>The rewards for completing each step include blueprints as well as Raider Tokens, and full completion also brings additional rewards including a Howl emote, a guitar and 300,000 Coins. There is currently no fixed end date and it will not be impacted by Expedition resets.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Bird City</strong>
<ul>
<li>Flocks of birds have moved into Buried City, building nests in the empty chimneys. We got some reports of them storing shiny trinkets inside so make sure to inspect them. This new permanent map condition will be applied to the Buried City map only which will cycle in and out of rotation weekly. There will be more bird traps and ziplines present on the map. Raiders can expect more combat in, on, or around the rooftops, including more flying ARC, and more players in proximity.</li>
