<p>The trending of falling video game hardware sales in the United States (US) continued in October 2024. The information comes via the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>.</p>



<p>Hardware spending fell 23% year-over-year in October from $323 million to $249 million. That follows a year-over-year drop in September of 44% that saw just $251 million in hardware sales. </p>







<p>Like last month, the declining sales were across all three major platforms. The Nintendo Switch, as expected, saw the biggest fall of 38% year-over-year. PlayStation 5 (PS5) had the second-largest drop at 20% while the Xbox Series had an 18% decrease in sales. The fall for the PS5 and Xbox Series wasn’t as much as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-continued-its-fall-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 45% and 54%, respectively, drop in September</a>, however.</p>



<p>That said, of the total sales, PS5 still was the best-selling console of the month while Xbox Series finished second. Regarding the Switch, it’s clearly a case of whoever was going to buy one, already has one as the run up to the Switch 2 continues.</p>



<p>For 2024 as a whole, hardware sales are down 29% from $3.97 billion in 2023. Still, despite a drop of nearly 30%, hardware revenue sits at $2.82 billion this year.</p>

<p>It’s not all down for hardware, however, as video game accessory spending rose 15% year-over-year from $162 million to $187 million. A big reason for that was the PlayStation Portal which, once again, was the best-selling accessory in terms of dollar sales. For 2024 as a whole, accessory spending is up 8% to $2.12 billion.</p>

<p>Sure, you could play Palworld. It’s sort of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative to the famous monster-catching franchise</a>, albeit with more automation and firearms. Or, if you grew up playing handheld monster-catching titles, you probably want something more retro, old-school nostalgia to strike that itch. Well, a new Pokemon alternative out on PC, Dokimon: Quest, looks phenomenal!</p>



<h2 id="h-dokimon-quest-is-out-now-on-pc">Dokimon: Quest is Out Now on PC</h2>



<p>Dokimon: Quest, by developer Yanako RPGs, is the first of its kind for the studio. Its previous title, Notice Me Leena-Senpai, is an anime 2D tower defense game that launched in December 2023 in Early Access. It’s still in Early Access, albeit with an official release date coming up shortly. But for now, let’s talk about Dokimon. </p>



<p>First and foremost, it’s available today on Steam as a full release for $19.99 with a limited-time launch discount, bringing the total price down to $17.99.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-dokimon-quest">What is Dokimon: Quest?</h2>



<p>Dokimon: Quest is a retro RPG with an old-school aesthetic that mimics the turn-based battle style and monster-catching and collecting mechanics of everyone’s favorite Pokemon. </p>



<p>The adventure takes place across the Xelos region, a fantasy world in which monsters known as Dokimon roam, along with battlers, or trainers, in turn-based monster-catching and battling gameplay that pairs old-school mechanics from the franchise with modern quality-of-life improvements. </p>



<p>Some key features include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Nine playable characters</strong></li>



<li><strong>Four available save slots</strong></li>



<li><strong>Quest log for easy tracking</strong></li>



<li><strong>8bit + Piano OST</strong></li>



<li><strong>20+ Retro Color Palettes</strong></li>



<li><strong>The ability to edit monster stats</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fast-forward battles with a single key</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Following the success of Palworld in the face of Nintendo, I imagine we’ll see plenty more monster-catching titles release in the coming months and years. Do you intend to jump in the seemingly neverending hype train of such titles? Let us know in the comments below if you intend to give Dokimon: Quest a try!</p>

<p>There were rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-palworld-going-free-to-play-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld going free-to-play</a>, with microtransactions to support development, but we answer your concerns and questions!</p>
