            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new video posted to their YouTube channel, Linus Tech Tips has broken down the cost of the hardware that will be added to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a> to get a sense of how much the console be priced. Spoiler alert… It’s likely to be much more than people thought online.</p>



<p>According to Linus Tech Tips, the parts at their historical low price will cost around $602, but that number has increased significantly in recent months by a whopping 50%, bringing the price to around $900.</p>



<p>As Linus Tech Tips rightfully pointed out, though, these prices are for name brands, and they think the cost can be reduced to around $813 at retail. However, Valve does have a direct-to-consumer model, meaning that it doesn’t need the traditional retailer margins of around 10%.</p>



<p>The question is then, how much profit does Valve want per console? Traditionally, console manufacturers have subsidised or even taken a loss on their consoles, while subscription models and software are their profit centres. </p>



<h2 id="h-steam-machine-will-cost-700">Steam Machine Will Cost $700?</h2>



<p>The conclusions led Linus Tech Tips to believe that the Steam Machine will cost approximately $699, if the hardware prices remain at the prices they do today. Linus Tech Tips then went on to say $800 at most if the hardware market continues to climb at the unprecedented rate it has been going. That could be a hard sell when the <a href="https://amzn.to/48iMmlb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5 is only $399</a> at the moment.</p>



<p>And remember… This is for a model with a 500GB SSD… Not 1TB / 2TB.</p>



<p>You can watch Linus Tech Tips’ full analysis and breakdown below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Personally, though, I think that the Steam Machine might be a little pricier. I would think that $799-849 would be the 512GB version, with a 2TB costing $999. But then and again, maybe I am just a little loopy when it comes to pricing. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ab6-flight-review/</link>
            <guid>1368100</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been around 4 weeks since I unboxed and started playing with the AB6 flight simulator bundle from MOZA, and it’s a true step up in terms of quality and immersion from what I’ve been using previously. For complete transparency, I am not a tried-and-tested flight simulator enthusiast with years of experience; in fact, I only got into flight simulators in the past 12 months thanks to my 9-year-old son, who is obsessed with planes. So naturally, as an adult who loves his toys… I couldn’t just let him have all the fun.</p>



<p>Nearly $1500 later, and we finally have a decent flight simulator setup, but when MOZA contacted me to try out their new AB6 flight, I jumped at the chance.</p>



<p>MOZA has been in both the flight and racing simulator scenes for several years, and their AB9 flight stick was very well received in the flight simulator community. With the AB6, they’ve opted for a more affordable offering at $399. For those not in the flight simulator community, it’s a price tag that might seem steep, but compared to other products on the market that offer similar features, it really is a good deal.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-fully-immersive-product">A Fully-Immersive Product</h2>



<p>One of the key highlights of the MOZA AB6 is a force-feedback flight base that delivers up to 6 Nm of peak torque—roughly half the output of the AB9. While on paper that is a huge difference, the competitive price and inclusion of the flight stick as a part of the bundle (which does not apply to the AB9), it is a good compromise. Remember that the AB6 is aimed at getting people into the hobby at a competitive price, rather than pricing them out.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What I will say is that the force feedback completely changed the immersion for both my son and me, and I don’t think either of us wants to go back to what we were using. In fact, I would recommend anything to get into the hobby with force feedback at the start, rather than wasting money further on down the line.</p>







<p>One of the things I was massively unaware of with the AB6 is that you can also change it into a shifter if you’re also into race simulation. So, if you’re like me and are sick of changing parts around, the MOZA AB6 makes it relatively easy to change a few settings and swap out the flightstick for a shifter and go from in the air to on the ground.</p>



<h2 id="h-ab6-specifications">AB6 Specifications</h2>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>188*123*163 mm</td></tr><tr><td>Housing Material</td><td>Aluminum alloy</td></tr><tr><td>Dust Bag Material</td><td>Microfiber leather</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.95KG</td></tr><tr><td>Motors</td><td>Dual high-performance servo motors</td></tr><tr><td>Roll Axis Continuous Torque</td><td>4.4N·m</td></tr><tr><td>Peak Combined Torque</td><td>6N·m</td></tr><tr><td>Travel Range</td><td>±20° roll (X-axis), ±17° pitch (Y-axis)</td></tr><tr><td>Compatible Sticks</td><td>All MOZA flight sticks</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>72W</td></tr><tr><td>Voltage Input</td><td>110~220V AC —&gt;12V DC</td></tr><tr><td>Game Resolution</td><td>0-65535</td></tr><tr><td>USB Polling Rate</td><td>1000Hz</td></tr><tr><td>Mounting Options</td><td>Desktop clamp (included), baseplate (sold separately), direct hard mount</td></tr><tr><td>Emergency Stop Switch</td><td>Optional</td></tr><tr><td>Smart Telemetry-Based Force Feedback</td><td>Supported (no plugin required)</td></tr><tr><td>Native Force Feedback Support</td><td>√</td></tr><tr><td>Platform</td><td>PC</td></tr><tr><td>Included Accessories</td><td>Power supply, power cable, data cable, toolkit, user manual, stickers</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-ab6-overall-thoughts">AB6 Overall Thoughts</h2>



<p>Again, I am not a fully-fledged flight simulator enthusiast, but if you’re like me with a year or so in the cockpit, I couldn’t recommend the AB6 by MOZA enough. The production quality and immersion that the AB6 brings you is such a massive step up from the more common flight simulator products that most people start off with, that I do think it’s worth spending an additional $100 or so to get the full bang for your buck on what the hobby can offer.</p>



<p>You can check out MOZA’s AB6 and other products over on their <a href="https://amzn.to/4onOdK8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amazon page here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Blackshark V3 PRO—Even Better Than Brilliant]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/review-razer-blackshark-v3-pro/</link>
            <guid>1368022</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro was my go-to headset for the longest time, and it was also the pick of many of the world’s best esports pro players. That’s why I was elated when Razer revealed the Blackshark V3 Pro, the next generation of the award-winning headset, packed with upgraded technology but retaining the classic, flawless aesthetic that we all knew and loved.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro is out now and selling like hot cakes. In this review, I’m breaking down exactly why this headset is worth every penny of the somewhat expensive price tag.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-razer-blackshark-v3-pro-worth-269-99">Is the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro Worth $269.99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing this review, the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro had a price tag of $269.99, which might seem exorbitant to some. However, the technology that’s packed into this headset more than makes the tag worthwhile, and there’s a reason why the world’s best pro players, especially those in the Call of Duty space, rely on this device.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the fundamentals. This is a wireless ANC headset, which means that when you’re playing, you’re unencumbered by cables and you won’t hear a thing around you. You’re completely in the zone and loving life, and that’s what this headset is all about.</p>



<p>It uses Razer’s Hyperspeed technology to ensure you’re getting low-latency connections that deliver your audio as clearly and efficiently as possible, which is of the utmost importance for <strong>any gamer</strong>, as audio desync is a harrowing issue that prevents the pinnacle of performance being delivered.</p>



<p>If you’re playing as part of a team, you’ve got the Hyperclear, detachable boom mic, which has a fat pop filter to keep your vocals clean and your callouts succinct. I used the boom mic on a range of software to test it out, from OBS to Audacity, and from Discord to in-game voice chats, and I can confirm it’s just as clear as most desktop podcast microphones, which is <strong>nice</strong>.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro comes in a range of designs, from black to white, and from ‘esports green’ to a special-edition Counter-Strike 2 version. I’m a <strong>huge </strong>fan of the esports green variant, which is available exclusively from Razer, but for my review of this headset, I used the clean white version.</p>



<p>For this new generation of the Razer Blackshark headset, the tech titan has pumped new technology behind the cups. The extremely capable drivers have been tweaked to reduce harmonic distortion, the bass range has been improved, and the directional audio capabilities are second-to-none, thanks to the THX Spatial on-board mechanics.</p>



<p>Put simply, you’ll hear a foot scraping on the floor across the map and be able to pinpoint exactly where it came from.</p>



<p>It gets better, though.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro has <strong>quad mode</strong> connectivity, which means it can work with 2.4Ghz wireless bands, Bluetooth, USB inputs, <strong>or </strong>via a 3.5mm cable. The battery is also nuts, and without ANC turned on, you can get up to 70 hours of battery life. The only negative I have about the headset is that it could really do with a dock of some kind to make charging more ‘comfortable’ and seamless.</p>



<p>That’s why I love the Astro A50 Gen 5, after all.</p>



<p>Interchangeable faceplates, app control, customization through the Razer Synapse software, and incredible levels of comfort thanks to a low-weight profile and comfy cushioning all come together to make this one of the best headsets on the market right now for both casual and pro gamers.</p>



<p>Don’t sleep on the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Raiju V3 PRO Review—An Elite Alternative to Scuf and Battle Beaver]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/razer-raiju-v3-pro-review/</link>
            <guid>1368019</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re in the market for a ‘pro-grade’ controller and are considering a Scuf or a Battle Beaver, put those thoughts on hold. Instead, take a look at the Razer Raiju V3 Pro, an all-new device that’s customizable, capable, and created by the best technical minds at Razer, one of the most reputable gaming brands around.</p>



<p>In this Razer Raiju V3 Pro review, I’ll help you understand why this is one of the best alternatives to the eye-wateringly expensive pro controllers on the market, and why it’s definitely worth your investment.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-razer-raiju-v3-pro-worth-219-99">Is the Razer Raiju V3 Pro Worth $219.99?</h2>



<p>The Razer Raiju V3 Pro will set you back a pretty penny, but it’s worth every cent. I’ve been trialling this wonderful controller for a couple of weeks on <strong>both </strong>PlayStation and PC as I write this, and I have had a brilliant time. I’ve used it across Battlefield 6, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and ARC Raiders, and in every situation put before me, the controller has excelled.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the build.</p>



<p>The controller is bigger than your average Dualsense controller, but it uses a similar mapping in terms of thumbsticks and face buttons. It has the classic trackpad that you’ve learned to associate with PlayStation controllers, but the triggers and shoulder buttons are more reminiscent of an Xbox controller. It’s the perfect hybrid, in my eyes.</p>



<p>You’ve got two extra buttons alongside the shoulder inputs, and up to <strong>four </strong>tactile inputs on the back, all of which are hot-swappable and customizable in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>The thumbsticks are modular and can be swapped out just as quickly, and you get extras in the attractive carry pack that the controller comes in to suit your needs.</p>



<p>Additionally, almost every input on the controller is ‘mouse-click’ in build, the triggers come with stops that you can switch on and off to suit your game, and the entire thing is wrapped up in a comfortable, durable shell that looks great and feels nice in your hands.</p>



<p>It’s as premium as you can get, and it still comes in under the cost of a Scuf or a Battle Beaver.</p>



<p>But wait, <strong>there’s more!</strong></p>



<p>The Razer Raiju V3 Pro can be further adjusted with Razer’s Synapse software, which includes creating on-board profiles, setting actuation points, adjusting deadzones, remapping inputs, and so on.</p>



<p>If you want to use the controller wirelessly on a PS5, you’re covered. If you’d rather go wired on a PC, you can do that too – and you can switch between those inputs easily enough. The Razer Raiju V3 Pro is marketed as a ‘lag-free, esports-grade’ device, which means you have lightning-fast response times and super-low latency inputs.</p>



<p>It’s expensive, but that’s the point. It’s a premium controller that’ll suit the best pro players in the world, and it has been crafted in collaboration with those very competitors, especially in the Call of Duty space. It takes a while to get used to the inputs if you’ve never used a controller like this, but it’s well worth investing that time to seek those results in-game.</p>



<p>I can’t fault the Razer Raiju V3 Pro controller, and that’s rare for me when it comes to reviewing peripherals.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="h-overhead-camera-mount-with-ring-light">Overhead Camera Mount with Ring Light</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re thinking of doing top-down content, like pack openings or drawings, an overhead camera with a light is a must-have, and this has both in one.

<hr>



<h3 id="h-pqrqp-3-in-1-wireless-lavalier-microphone">PQRQP 3-in-1 Wireless Lavalier Microphone</h3>

<hr>

<hr>



<h3 id="h-neewer-collapsible-backdrop">Neewer Collapsible Backdrop</h3>

<p>A green screen might not be an immediate necessity but, once you start using it, you’ll never look the other way again. The Neewer Collapsible Backdrop has both green and blue screen, coming double-sided, and is easy to put up and store, all available for a decent price.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-elgato-4k-s-external-capture-card">Elgato 4K S External Capture Card</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A capture card is one of the most important items for any streamer or content creators, as it quickly captures all content from an external source, like a console, and connects it to PC and your stream. Without it, you’ll be limited on your options when streaming, and it should be one of the first things you pick up when you get started.</p>
