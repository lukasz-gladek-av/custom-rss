<p>The latest Xbox update for members of the Xbox Insider program is resetting consoles to their factory default settings. This, according to many who’ve gone through with the update.</p>



<p>The problem arises for those who have installed the Alpha or Alpha Skip-Ahead updates. When installed, Xbox profiles, Quick Resume information, and console settings are wiped. To make matters worse, the update is mandatory for insiders.</p>



<p>A quick visit to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Insider subreddit</a> sees a number of posts complaining about the issue. Many are requesting the update be pulled offline, but it doesn’t appear anyone has heard from the company.</p>



<p>“I totally understand that programs like this are here to find problems like this but it’s the complete lack of action on the development team when a bad update goes live on a test branch and it stays live for 18+ hours,” said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/1j4n9bj/comment/mgbh7r1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user</a>.</p>



<p>One thing the update doesn’t appear to do, at least, is deleted any local game save data on the Xbox consoles. As of publishing, Microsoft has yet to comment on the issues. Insider Gaming has reached out for an official response.</p>

<p>2K’s annual tradition of unveiling a ton of post-launch superstars continues. WWE 2K25’s sizable roster will grow thanks to the confirmed release dates for many DLC characters, and you can start your training right now.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wwe-2k25-ratings-roster-confirmed-so-far-every-superstar-legend-dlc-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25 offers a roster</a> so big it would tower over Andre The Giant, Big Show, Omos, and The Great Khali combined. There’s a ton of hype for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>, so much so that players are already grabbing their tickets through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-wwe-2k25-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>.</p>



<p>Getting your ticket to the dance is one thing, but what about the afterparty? The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-season-pass-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2K25 Season Pass</a> is the perfect remedy for those who want a rollicking Royal Rumble of talent to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>The WWE 2K25 Season Pass includes Five full Character Packs introducing new wrestlers and the Supercharger Pack to inject more content into WWE 2K25 after launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re wondering why many of your favorite in-ring stalwarts are missing, there’s a good chance they’re being saved for the upcoming <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25 DLC</a>. If you purchase the Season Pass, you are guaranteed all Character Packs and the Supercharger Pack.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-dlc-release-dates-amp-roadmap">WWE 2K25 DLC Release Dates &amp; Roadmap</h2>



<p><strong>A new piece of DLC is arriving pretty much every month between now and the end of November 2025. The Supercharger Pack is available from launch, meaning you can jump into its contents straightaway.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll have a brief gap in August of this year. Other than that, a new Character Pack is inbound in most months. It’s likely 2K will completely shift focus and turn its attention to WWE 2K26 after this.</p>



<p>Take a look at our table below showing you every pack name, who’s included, and its release date.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-showcases-a-deep-dive-into-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows%E2%80%99-hideout-feature.1126863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new Assassin’s Creed Shadows blog post, Ubisoft has released new information on the Hideout feature coming to the game.</p>



<p>As briefly explained in the introduction, the Hideout will be the players base of operations and a fully customizable sandbox allowing you to build your perfect home.</p>



<p>The Hideout will be located in the Izumi Settsu province and is surrounded by hills on all sides for protection. Its said that the Hideout will be a acre of fully customizable land, which players are able to place buildings, pavilions, pathways, bushes, trees, ponds, mossy rocks, local flora &amp; fauna, and countless other Japanese cosmetic elements found or acquired throughout their journey.</p>



<p>“We really want players to make the Hideout their own” says Dany. “Throughout your adventure, most of the content for customization keeps unlocking as you progress, so your customization options will truly reflect your journey.” The building tools are simple enough for everyone to draw up a quick and easy layout, but there’s enough depth to sink hours into crafting your vision.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the Hideout, players will be able to create six main rooms, which are:</p>



<h2 id="h-main-rooms">Main Rooms</h2>



<p><strong>Tomiko’s Hiroma</strong><br>Tomiko’s main house and gathering hall is already built when players first get their hands on the Hideout. This building is the cornerstone of the Hideout, granting quick access to most of the important functions of the Hideout. It can be changed cosmetically, but the Hiroma cannot be moved or removed.</p>



<p><strong>Stables</strong><br>An important pillar of your Hideout, the stables unlock the ability to use your scouts for smuggling stockpiles in enemy camps or castles; doing this will allow you to receive extra resources at the end of a season.</p>



<p><strong>Forge</strong><br>The Forge unlocks the ability to upgrade your weapons and gear to higher tiers, which is crucial for staying strong as you level up. It also allows you to dismantle unwanted armor and weapons into raw materials, engrave new perks on existing gear, and unlock the transmog feature for customizing your look and weapons, accessible in the inventory menu.</p>



<p><strong>Kakurega</strong><br>This unlocks the ability to purchase and claim safehouses around Japan. These safehouses extend the Hideout’s functions to distant areas, as well as unlock safe fast travel points well outside enemy territory. Some features, like the regional contract boards, can be accessed from here as well. As mentioned in our exploration article, kakurega are also great to refill your tools, replenish your scouts, or manage the allies you want to bring on your next missions.</p>



<p><strong>Study</strong><br>The Study increases the maximum number of scouts and refines the search zone when scouts locate an objective on the World Map, optimizing objective investigations.</p>



<p><strong>Dojo</strong><br>The Dojo unlocks the ability to train Naoe and Yasuke’s allies that can be recruited and called in combat, elevating their ranks and increasing the power of each of their unique skills.</p>



<p>In addition, players can also create seven themed rooms which are:</p>



<h2 id="h-themed-rooms">Themed Rooms</h2>



<p><strong>Tera</strong><br>Adding a Tera (altar) in the Hideout boosts the amount of XP players can gain while venturing out in the world, effectively acting as a 10% XP booster.</p>



<p><strong>Jinja</strong><br>Shinto shrines around the world allow players to pray and earn a small stat boost – called a boon – for a few minutes. The Jinja’s presence in the Hideout magnifies the effects of any shrine’s boon encountered in Japan.</p>



<p><strong>Nando</strong><br>The Nando – a kind of barracks for sleeping and storing personal items – makes recalling scouts that have been used less costly – a function that extends to all Kakurega safehouses.</p>



<p><strong>Zashiki</strong><br>Apart from the cool factor of owning your very own&nbsp;<em>sake</em>&nbsp;room, the Zashiki&nbsp;increases ration efficiency (health restoration) for both Naoe and Yasuke.</p>



<p><strong>Tea Room</strong><br>This Tea Room also increases ration efficiency – an effect that can be compounded with the Zashiki bonus.</p>



<p><strong>Gallery</strong><br>A place where players can display armor sets and weapons they’ve acquired, which unlocks the possibility of creating equipment loadouts.</p>



<p><strong>Generic Rooms</strong><br>Players have access to a variety of rooms with varied layouts for showing off their earned cosmetics such as outfits, wall art and more.</p>



<p>For more customization options, players can also join rooms together and decorate them to their hearts content. The Hideout aaims to be the players safe place, where they can spend hours creating their perfect home.</p>



<p>“Once recruited, allies will spend a significant amount of their time in the Hideout, working, resting, training, and otherwise occupying themselves during their down time. Building new rooms will diversify the actions that they can perform there – allies with an inclination for martial training might spend more time in the Dojo, while others with a taste for&nbsp;<em>sake</em>&nbsp;might enjoy spending time in the Zashiki,” the blog reads.</p>



<p>You can read more about the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Hideout feature on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/75Ec8tj1T1Y0mqJTLVE4fD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Ubisoft blog</a>.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows officially launches March 20 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-horror-games-coming-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The horror game market continues to thrive and 2025’s schedule is lining up a multi-course meal of fear-inducing, hair-reducing cowering and crying. 2025 has a myriad of big horror games from well-known sequels to potential breakout hits.</p>



<p>I find horror in games makes films look like child’s play—and I don’t mean any dangerous dolls. A movie forces you to watch what happens, whereas in a game, <em>you </em>are responsible for the action unfolding. <em>You </em>have to push your character along, advance the narrative, and trigger jumpscares and premeditated psychological horror.</p>



<p>It’s daunting when you think about it, yet players can’t get enough. To appease the morbid curiosity in all of us, here’s a list of the biggest upcoming horror games in 2025, sure to scare and scar you one way or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-horror-games-releasing-in-2025">Biggest Horror Games Releasing in 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Many of these 2025 horror game release dates could be subject to change.</strong> The volatility of the game industry and sudden technical problems means any title is a delay away from a 2026 or 2027 release date. That being said, let’s get into it.</p>



<h3 id="h-directive-8020">Directive 8020</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Unsettling. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Supermassive Games is one of the pioneers of the horror genre in the last 15 years. The acclaimed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-teaser-released-ahead-of-first-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn</a> kickstarted this Hall of Fame-worthy horror march. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/directive-8020-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Directive 8020</a> is the latest in The Dark Pictures Anthology—featuring The Quarry, Little Hope, and others—and features the series’ trademarks. Expect to tackle sudden quick-time events and critical story-changing decisions while you explore the unknown of the Cassiopeia.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light The Beast</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We’re ready for more mutations. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light The Beast</a> brings back OG protagonist Kyle Crane as we embark on another adventure of parkour and parasitical purgatory. The Beast is a separate sequel from Dying Light 2, and <a href="https://techland.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Techland</a> is looking to bring together a more compact and equally chaotic experience. As before, Dying Light The Beast’s world is a terrifying ordeal during the day and almost unsurvivable at night. You’ll need to unlock the beast within to help Crane rise high.</p>



<h3 id="h-killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Can’t we be friends? Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Imagine Call of Duty Zombies’ renowned round-based gameplay, but with even faster, more vicious, and grotesque enemies. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a> is the meaner and nastier undead sibling in the zombies family and builds on Killing Floor 2’s good work. The M.E.A.T system is back to delight and disgust, and the new Zed design is likely to put you off your tea—sick bags on stand by.</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Phew, someone by my side. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>2025 is proving to be a big year for Supermassive Games as the developer is pulling double duty. Developer Tarsier Studios has moved onto pastures new, and someone needed to pick up the remnants of the beloved franchise. In steps Supermassive Games to deliver <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-platforms-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> and bring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-little-nightmares-3-multiplayer-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op multiplayer</a> in a series first. We have a new developer, new main characters in Low and Alone, and reasons to be thankful and fearful.</p>



<h3 id="h-reanimal">Reanimal</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Excited for this one. Credit to Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>We segue nicely to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarsier-studios-new-game-reanimal-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reanimal</a>—the new IP from Little Nightmares 1 and 2 developer Tarsier Studios. Even from the screenshot above you can see an uncanny resemblance and deliberate inspiration for the horror title. Unsurprisingly, you need to solve puzzles, escape and avoid unspeakable enemies, and it also includes co-operative play in case you need to squeeze the hand of the person next to you.</p>



<h3 id="h-state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been long enough. Credit to Undead Labs</figcaption></figure>



<p>Full disclosure: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Decay 3</a> MIGHT not be releasing in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s currently the only entry on this list in serious jeopardy of this deadline. A potential delay to 2026 or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2027</a> is on the cards, so bear this in mind, but no one truly knows. If it releases in 2025, developer Undead Labs has likely put all its infected blood, sweat, and tears into it. There’s a healthy development cycle between each State of Decay release, and the 2024 Xbox Showcase footage we saw of State of Decay 3 heightens survival, and the game demands your time, respect, and attention. </p>

<p>Just looking at The Midnight Walk makes me anxious. It’s ingenious, stop-motion clay-orientated horror works so well because it’s seldom seen. Its art styles alone make me want to play it. If you dare to jump into The Midnight Walk, you’ll need to do more than walk around to survive the antagonistic threat of monsters.</p>

<p>The Sinking City 2 is a sequel and another special loveletter to Lovecraftian themes. Unlike escape and survival, like many entries on our best and biggest horror games 2025 list, you can attack in The Sinking City 2. But you also need to venture into the deepest recesses of your brain to engage your deductive reasoning senses. The sequel builds upon the original’s detective mechanics, and happens to throw a 200ft monster or two at you in the process. Sherlock Holmes didn’t have to deal with this!</p>
