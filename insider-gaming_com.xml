<p>Veteran game developer Katsuhiro Harada has announced his departure from Bandai Namco after working on the Tekken franchise for 30 years. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tekken-8-producer-provides-a-character-breakdown-for-fahkumram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tekken franchise</a> has long been one of the pillars of the fighting game genre, and Katsuhiro Harada has been at the heart of it. His goodbye marks the end of an era for the Tekken, but the Tekken 8 team has been quick to shut down any fan concerns regarding the departure of their studio director.</p>

<p>Harada confirmed his departure in a statement shared online, explaining that the decision came after a period of personal and professional loss. He revealed that the “loss of several close friends” and watching senior colleagues retire or pass away pushed him to reflect deeply on “the time [he] has left as a creator.” After decades spent shaping the world, characters, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anna-williams-tekken-3-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legacy of Tekken</a>, he felt the moment was right to close this chapter.</p>



<p>His message also looked back on his early days at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-bandai-namco-partnership-billion-yen-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bandai Namco</a>, recalling humble beginnings at local Japanese arcade tournaments and tracing his journey through the studio’s growth and Tekken’s global rise. He thanked fans for their unwavering support and noted that he will share details about his future plans in due course.</p>
