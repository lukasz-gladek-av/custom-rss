<p>Late last year, rumours surfaced regarding a developing Steam-based console being built by Valve. It was claimed that the device was being designed alongside new iterations of the Steam Controller and a fresh VR headset. On social media, tech insiders were mulling over proposed specs for a Steam console, but of course, the claims were <strong>not </strong>addressed by Valve.</p>



<p>Today, fresh rumours have hit the airwaves, with eXtas1s commenting on social media (and uploading a video) about the ‘very spicy’ claim that the rumoured Steam console will compete with PS5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-competition">More Competition</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://xcancel.com/eXtas1stv/status/1886541769833398343?t=_-orVAMq3NTYowaQr-QYbQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, eXtas1s wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>New Steam console?</p>



<p>Very spicy with Valve, it already seems that a new Steam console is coming that competes against PS5 and Xbox in the future.</p>



<p>Thanks to HandleDeck, we have learned that Valve works closely with AMD and its RDNA 4 technologies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a follow-up video, eXtas1s expanded on the rumour – but I don’t speak Spanish, so perhaps you’ll have better luck breaking this down:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Valve has had plenty of success with the Steam Deck, which is considered one of the best handheld gaming devices on the market, but would the tech titan see the same results with a home console? It would be welcome competition, but it could skew the existing market.</p>



<p>For instance, it could prevent PlayStation from launching further ‘exclusives’ on PC, as anyone with a Steam console could play them there as opposed to buying a PlayStation console to get that traditional home gaming experience.</p>



<p>It could also be another flop, just like the Steam Machines that Valve tried to launch several years ago.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that these rumours are to be taken with a pinch of salt until Valve confirms what’s happening behind the scenes. The cards are being played very close to the chest of this gaming giant, so we’ll have to see what happens in due course.</p>

<p>Dr Disrespect still hasn’t clawed his way back into the good graces of gamers worldwide and probably never will. Regardless, he’s still trying to retain some semblance of a streaming career across <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-relocation-rumble-youtube-stream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rumble</a> and YouTube, and recently, he secured monetisation again on YouTube several months after losing it in the face of ‘minor messaging’ allegations.</p>



<p>During a recent live stream, Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm levelled some accusations at Midnight Society, the studio that he fronted until last June when things turned awry for him. In his words, ‘I can say all this s*** now.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-get-me-started-with-that-guy">‘Don’t Get Me Started With That Guy’</h2>



<p>Last summer, Dr Disrespect found himself embroiled in (another) controversy, this one concerning events that occurred in 2017. It was alleged that the supersized streamer had used Twitch’s ‘Whisper’ mechanic to inappropriately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-ban/">message a minor</a>, which the creator copped to shortly after – in a way.</p>



<p>That prompted him to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-loses-followers-allegations/">lose tens of thousands of followers</a>, be dropped by sponsors, and get cut out by fellow streamers.</p>



<p>Fast-forward several months, and Midnight Society, the studio that Dr Disrespect was a prolific part of until the allegations surfaced, is closing down. For a couple of years, Dr Disrespect provided a massive marketing pull, getting players around the world to invest in ‘DEADROP’, an NFT-backed extraction shooter that will now never see the light of day.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Dr Disrespect went in against Midnight Society:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was handled extremely poorly by leadership.</p>



<p>It’s unfortunate.</p>



<p>That tweet that weekend, it should have never gone out. It was never approved by me. They say, ‘after fully investigating’, whatever — they didn’t investigate nothing.</p>



<p>I can say all this s*** now.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Then, the creator fired shots at Robert Bowling, the former Call of Duty dev who co-founded Midnight Society:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Don’t get me f***ing started with that guy.</p>



<p>Don’t get me started with that guy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, data showed that while Dr Disrespect’s airtime has gone up, his viewership and peak counts are dropping rapidly, suggesting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/">there’s no comeback in store</a> for the disgraced creator.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98battlefield-portal%E2%80%99-is-returning-to-the-next-battlefield-with-classic-maps.1099155/</guid>

<p>Battlefield Portal, which was first introduced into Battlefield 2042 will be returning to the next title, DICE has confirmed.</p>



<p>The news came via the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOih6h3VeTE&amp;ab_channel=Flakfire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Flakfire</a>, who had an early online presentation of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> reveal last week. In Flakfire’s latest video, he said that the developers confirmed the return of Portal, a gamemode which introduces classic maps, weapons, and more into the latest game.</p>



<p>“We had surprising confirming in the briefing that Portal will be making a return with the next Battlefield title,” he said. </p>



<p>“Portal could be one of those slices tested under the Battlefield Labs program,” he theorised. </p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is essentially a Community Test Environment, where players can give feedback of specific features in the next Battlefield game and presumably, future DLC, too.</p>



<p>Flakfire pointed out earlier in the video that those who sign up to the Battlefield Labs program will be under an NDA, whcih presumably will still not stop people from sharing footage and information.</p>

<p>While we currently don’t have the name for the next Battlefield title (unless it’s just Battlefield), it has been confirmed that the game will be for current-generation consoles only, meaning it will release on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. According to EA, the game will release later this year.</p>



<p>What remains to be seen is the announcement of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Battle Royale</a>, which has been in development at Ripple Effect for the past couple of years and was exclusively reported on by Insider Gaming in early 2024.</p>
