<p>Tencent has acquired another new game studio, Chinese studio Kuro Games. </p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Youxi Putao</a> — then found by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> — , Tencent has purchased 37% of the Wuthering Waves developer’s shares. When adding it to the 24.4% it already owned, the new acquisition gives the company 51.4% of the shares, and a controlling stake in the company.</p>



<p>The purchase also makes Tencent the only external shareholder of the company.</p>



<p>According to Kuro Games’ internal memo to staff, the studio will continue to work independently. It was iterated that “operational strategy will remain unchanged”. An example used in the memo was Tencent’s ownership in Riot Games and Supercell.</p>



<p>“Based on our past collaborative experiences with Tencent, we firmly believe that this external shareholder change will provide Kuro with a more stable external environment, further benefiting our future independent operational strategies and long-term development,” the internal memo reads via machine translation.</p>



<p>“Over the past decade, our original intention of creating games has never changed, and it will remain unchanged in the next decade. We will continue to love our players, our games, and our team.”</p>



<p>Kuro Games is set to release Version 2.0 of Wuthering Waves on January 2.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov has posted a series of images on social media showcasing Terminal, the potential final map in Escape from Tarkov. For months, talk about the spearhead extraction shooter has been centred around the last step that players are waiting for – the ability to <strong>escape </strong>from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Alongside the images, which showcase a dark and brooding map, Buyanov wrote: ‘The place where it all ends?’</p>

<h2 id="h-the-end-of-all-things">The End of All Things</h2>



<p>When Escape from Tarkov finally hits a 1.0 release, it’ll be delivered with the ability to finally escape from Tarkov. That has been the goal for the last decade or so, and it’ll be a way to finally ‘complete’ the game.</p>



<p>The ultimate endgame objective was teased today on social media by Nikita Buyanov, the head honcho at Battlestate Games:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Escaping from Tarkov is something that has only ever been possible by powering down and stepping away from the desk – but soon, players will be able to do that after firmly completing the game. The only issue is that we have no idea what that’ll look like. Could it be some kind of ‘prestige’ system, allowing players to complete the game over and over again to earn new rewards?</p>



<p>Nobody knows.</p>



<p>The images showcased by Buyanov don’t reveal too much. It’s an industrial area, which we knew already based on the ‘port’ setting on the map, but something that’s never been seen before is a <strong>submarine </strong>docked in the port. Players have already theorised that’s how we’ll finally escape from Tarkov. </p>

I am happy to announce that I joined SQUARE ENIX in December.”</p>
