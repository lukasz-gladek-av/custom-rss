<p>Bloober Team has announced that Cronos: The New Dawn will get a new difficulty option called Temporal Diver Mode in 2026.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is a survival-horror third-person shooter released by Bloober Team this September. The title features a spectacular narrative blended with challenging gameplay, which has been well received by players. However, some have complained about it being too difficult for casual players. Now, the developers are introducing a new, easier difficulty mode to open the title for more players. </p>

<p>Bloober Team posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2BVRu26Fug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new video</a> on their official YouTube channel, announcing the arrival of the Temporal Diver Mode difficulty option for Cronos: The New Dawn. The video shows a cinematic in which the Bloober Team HQ receives calls to lower the difficulty or introduce an easy mode for players because it can be too challenging for non-hardcore gamers, or players who wish to experience just the story. </p>



<p>The video ends with the developers addressing the players directly, stating that “Cronos: The New Dawn was a game developed to challenge the players.” However, they have heard the community’s feedback and acknowledged that some would like to explore the story at their own pace. Hence, they are working to create a new difficulty option called Temporal Diver Mode and plan to release it in early 2026. </p>

<p>Hideo Kojima has revealed that if it weren’t for Super Mario Bros, he might not be in the gaming industry. </p>



<p>Hideo Kojima is one of the most prolific game directors in the industry, with popular game series like Metal Gear, Death Stranding, and more under his belt. But even he has gone through numerous traditional job interviews before reaching his current position. <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-revealed-who-inspired-him-to-start-making-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An HR director</a> sparked his entry into the games industry</span>, and now, Kojima has revealed the game that inspired him to pursue a career in game development and delve deeper into this medium.</p>







<h2 id="h-super-mario-bros-is-the-game-hideo-kojima-has-played-the-most">Super Mario Bros is the Game Hideo Kojima has Played the Most</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WIRED</a> on YouTube (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/without-super-mario-bros-hideo-kojima-probably-wouldnt-have-become-a-game-dev-when-i-saw-that-i-felt-this-medium-would-one-day-surpass-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima discussed his relationship with Super Mario Bros. and how it was instrumental in getting him interested in gaming. Kojima revealed that Super Mario Bros. is ‘definitely’ the game he has played the most. He played the game for a year while in college, and he skipped school to stay home and play it. </p>



<p>Kojima added that ‘without Super Mario,’ he probably wouldn’t be part of the gaming industry. The game director added that he wouldn’t really play the game today, noting that it is a side-scrolling action game that basically just involves jumping. But when you add the dash button, it brings subtle changes to jumping, changing its trajectory while attacking or dodging. </p>



<p>He spoke about how Super Mario Bros. has almost no story, yet it still feels like the player is on an adventure. After seeing that the game was “pixel art with no story,” Kojima felt that the gaming medium “would one day surpass movies,” and this conviction brought him to the gaming industry. </p>
