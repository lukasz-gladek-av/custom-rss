<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-now-pve-first-tactical-shooter/</link>
            <guid>1445434</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/madfinger-games/" id="2643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MADFINGER Games</a> continues to evolve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gray-zone-warfare/" id="1330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gray Zone Warfare</a> in a strong and sensible direction. The open-world tactical shooter has undergone more than a few changes in recent history, and it’s becoming increasingly impressive with each new drop.</p>



<p>Recently, the team made an update to the game’s identity on Steam, including a term in the product description that’s not seen too often in the tactical shooter space. Gray Zone Warfare, the sumptuous sandbox shooter, is now ‘PvE-first’.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-pve-first-mean-for-gray-zone-warfare">What Does PvE-First Mean for Gray Zone Warfare?</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, Gray Zone Warfare was described as an extraction shooter, with a twist. Players could run into and out of the game world, unbound by any kind of timer-based limitations, and explore the diverse, lush setting of Lamang at will. It bore classic trademarks of the extraction genre, but it was so much more than that.</p>



<p>That concept was recognized by MADFINGER <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-no-longer-extraction-shooter-label/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a pivot last year</a>, with the team officially dubbing Gray Zone Warfare a tactical MMOFPS. It was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re not heading back to base nearly as often. Tasks can be turned in from the field. Your time is spent moving from COP to COP, POI to POI. The world encourages staying out longer, discovering more, encountering more PvP—and staying immersed.</p>



<p>You’re not jumping in and out of isolated raids. You’re living in this world. It’s a tactical MMOFPS. It’s persistent. It’s dangerous. It’s accessible—whether you’re new or a seasoned vet.</p>



<p>It might look like an extraction shooter on the surface, but it’s something different. Something of its own. That’s what makes it special.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>However,</strong> things have changed again, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479810/Gray_Zone_Warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gray Zone Warfare</a> has a whole new identity:</p>



<h3 id="h-high-stakes-pve-first-open-world-tactical-shooter">High-Stakes PvE-First Open-World Tactical Shooter</h3>



<p>It’s a brilliant way to label everything the game offers in one sweep. It has the high-stakes mentality of an extraction shooter, the PvE-first focus that the developers are keen to flesh out, the open-world sandbox elements, and, above all else, it’s a <strong>tactical first-person shooter</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s borderline milsim, mixed in with survival mechanics.</p>



<p>The PvE-first element, as we’ve learned, is a concept that the studio’s CEO and Co-Founder, Marek Rabas, is keen to remain heavy on. There are some ‘amazing moments and stories’ to pull from the PvP world, and that’s not going anywhere in Gray Zone (and will be expanded on in due course), but the PvE push is now front and centre in this game.</p>



<p>In recent months, we’ve seen many more shooters lean more into the concept of PvE.</p>



<p>For instance, Escape from Tarkov is a couple of years deep into running a mirrored PvE platform that accommodates thousands of users. Elsewhere, ARC Raiders players never stop debating the potential for a PvE mode to surface in <strong>that </strong>extraction adventure title.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare <strong>perfectly </strong>suits a PvE operating model, and it does little to take away from the game’s inherent challenge and risk profile. There’s every opportunity for you to run into an opposing faction and get into a firefight, but much of that tension is now centered entirely around AI enemies.</p>



<p>It’s very worth pointing out that, since the beginning, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pve-in-gray-zone-warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gray Zone’s ‘Joint Operations’</a> mode has facilitated 100% PvE combat…</p>







<p>Do you think it’s a win for Gray Zone’s developers to be focusing on PvE? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
