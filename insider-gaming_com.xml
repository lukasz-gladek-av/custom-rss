<p>When Ubisoft announced that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake was canceled</a>, it was also revealed that five other games were ending. Insider Gaming has learned the six games that have been cancelled at Ubisoft.</p>



<p>First reported on Insider Gaming Weekly, Insider Gaming understands that the following six games were canceled:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</strong> – Canceled after being first announced in 2020.</li>



<li><strong>Project Ether</strong> – In development since 2019, which was canceled, but has morphed, in a way, into a newer project. Believed to have been in development at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" id="168333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Halifax</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Project Pathfinder </strong>– Known previously as Project U</li>



<li><strong>Project Crest</strong> – A World War 2 extraction shooter</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</strong> – Stopping support</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Singularity </strong>– A new mobile Assassin’s Creed Game</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with the game cancellations that were previously announced—confirmed above—there was also a multiplayer Assassin’s Creed that had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-assassins-creed-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly been shuttered</a>. That game, however, isn’t a part of this group. </p>



<p>One game that is still coming is the Assassin’s Creed: Blag Flag Remake. The latest rumors suggest that a reveal will take place in April after being delayed out of the current physical year. </p>



<p>If you want to go directly to the moment in the show below, it takes place <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/rZcgQAfLRd4?si=k8dedz7N5aQ7E0D9&amp;t=3247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around the 54:07 mark</a>.</p>

<p>You’d think love would be in the air with today’s NYT Connections puzzle, but alas, no. It’s just another challenge that will come and go without too much pomp – the folks over at the New York Times didn’t want to feed any romance into this puzzle. Regardless, I’m here to help you solve the challenge with today’s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<p>Read on to get the answers you need for today’s NYT Connections, then you can go about your day!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>
