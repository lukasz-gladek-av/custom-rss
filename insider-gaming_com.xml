<p>The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley posted some mysterious images this morning. However, it seems fans have already&nbsp;started to figure out what those teases could be.</p>



<p>On December 11th, The Game Awards are set to go live on social media. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, the event celebrates the best of the year’s games. This year is host to a plethora of amazing titles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record-breaking Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. However, in recent shows, it’s also been home to huge reveals like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-wont-feature-at-the-game-awards-despite-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> and Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. This morning, Geoff Keighley and The Game Awards’ socials posted <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1994816833464217796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">weird photos of a mysterious statue</a> and location. Now, it seems the mystery is going a bit deeper thanks to one fan’s journey to said locale.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned before, The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley released a picture of a statue and a desert location in New Mexico. Fans on Reddit speculated everything from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1p9uzuu/another_teaser_for_the_game_awards_do_you_think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tomb Raider</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1p9vgwx/dont_believe_his_lies_dont_believe_his_lies_dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Half-Life</a>. However, user <a href="https://x.com/TotallyNOTTrio/status/1994843343575224514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TotallyNOTTrio</a> noticed they lived not far from it and took a trip to the site. There, as pictured above, we get a closer look at the statue, which is adorned with demon-like creatures and a big yellow eye with tentacles. According to the user, the staff on location were quiet about what it could actually mean.</p>



<p>Luckily, it seems fans are already hard at work conjuring what it could be. The most likely consensus is that it’s for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation’s Saros</a>, as the visual design and architecture look similar to the upcoming Housemarque title. Perhaps a bit of a stretch, fans are hoping it’s referring to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/greek-god-of-war-game-pushed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/julian-lefay-father-elder-scrolls-passed-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls</a>, as both series have eldritch enemies and a similar visual style. Plus, the series are no strangers to The Game Awards, so the collaboration isn’t out of left field. Its fans are going crazy on Reddit, with some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/1p9vswt/this_geoff_post_on_twitter_what_you_guys_think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">referencing the armor as one of Kratos</a>‘ and others believing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1p9nef1/youre_thinking_about_the_teaser_wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it has a connection to Oblivion</a>.</p>



<p>Another one, Diablo 4, is another good choice, given it feels like it’s time for a new expansion, and the statue fits with something one could see in-game. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1p9mf6w/geoff_keighley_dropped_this_new_expansion_or_not/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fans on the subreddit</a> do think that, while it does go too far for an expansion, it could tease the Paladin class’s addition to the game. Additionally, it could very well be a new game from a big studio, given the marketing strategy. Unfortunately, it may be some time before it’s known what exactly it is, but it’s certainly one great way to market your game.</p>



<p>What do you think the statue is referring to? Saros? God of War? Elder Scrolls? Diablo? Another franchise? Leave a comment below or on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Doom By Fate monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards and get ahead of the competition.</p>



<p>If you’re afraid of the dark, then this game is definitely not for you. Quite clearly inspired by Dead By Daylight, Doom By Fate is a popular survival horror <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where players are thrown into short rounds in a dark place with a deadly killer on the loose. The main objective of the game is to survive through the night without getting killed, but that’s easier said than done. Although players have the option to jump and sprint, getting away from the killer is no easy task.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Surviving in a limited space when there’s a murderous killer on the loose is hard enough, but throw in the fact that you also have to complete objectives, and you have quite the challenge on your hands. Considering this, it’s essential for the players to try and coordinate to have the higest chance of surviving through the round. As expected, the killer’s job is simply to eliminate all of the players before the timer runs out. With a variety of playable survivor characters to unlock, Doom By Fate encourages grinding, as a lot of cash is required to make most purchases. This is where Doom By Fate codes can come to your rescue.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-doom-by-fate-codes">Expired Doom By Fate Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Doom By Fate, as the game only came out recently. It’s currently in Alpha, so more codes and content updates are likely on the horizon. The moment any of the active codes expire, they will promptly be moved to this section of the page. Moreover, players are urged to use the active codes and reap the rewards before they eventually expire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many Roblox games nowadays demand that players join the game’s <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/35983705/what-is-what-is#!/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Roblox developer group</a> and like the game before unlocking the code redemption feature for them, and Doom By Fate falls into that category too. Once that’s done, however, redeeming codes is a simple process that requires next to no effort. Here’s a step-by-step guide:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Doom By Fate.</li>



<li>Click on the Settings button at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Hit the Enter key to claim your rewards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-doom-by-fate-codes">How To Get More Doom By Fate Codes</h2>



<p>Considering that the game is still in alpha, it’s not surprising that there’s only one active code at the moment. However, the sheer amount of popularity that game has received means that more codes are surely on the horizon. New codes are released through the game’s socials and Discord server, so tracking both of those might be a good idea. A better idea though, would be to simply bookmark this page and check in every so often, as we update this article with new codes as soon as they drop.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Servers Down For Chapter 7 Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-servers-down-for-chapter-7-launch/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortner servers are down ahead of the launch of Chapter 7, following the huge end-of-chapter event that marked an end to the previous chapter.</p>



<p>The Zero Point live event was stacked with collabs, including the likes of Godzilla, Hatsune Miku, and Homer Simpson, and servers immediately went offline after the conclusion of the event in preparation for Chapter 7’s launch.</p>



<p>Taking the Fortnite servers down immediately was an unexpected move by many, considering the usual start time of downtime for new content is at 2 AM ET, but Epic Games announced the downtime in advance of the event to give players a heads up.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-downtime-end">When Will Fortnite Downtime End?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big drop. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1994771674793996483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> ahead of the event, Epic Games stated that downtime would commence immediately after the event’s conclusion, and in-game, a precise countdown was shared.</p>



<p>Fittingly for Chapter 7, downtime will last four seven hours, and there is a live countdown available in-game. That downtime is a similar length to what was witnessed prior to the launch of Chapter 6, though there could still be server issues when the season commences.</p>



<p>A host of players complained on social media of being disconnected during the live event, which had over 10 million active players watching the action, and server instability may be present when Chapter 7 first kicks off.</p>



<p>It will be late in the evening in the United States, however, and the middle of the night for Europe, which may reduce the flood of players heading into the game immediately when servers return.</p>



<p>During downtime, several prominent content creators will be publishing footage from an early access Chapter 7 launch event, similar to what was seen ahead of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>
