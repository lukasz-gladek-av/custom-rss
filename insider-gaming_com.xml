<p>The Sims fans have spent many a year wondering what the next major release in the series would look like. For the most part, it’s assumed that it’ll just be ‘The Sims 5’, but it’s what that game will look like that has the community deep in discussion. There’s also ‘Project Rene’, which has been thrown around by Maxis and Electronic Arts for some time.</p>



<p>At least one of those things has a more solid identity now, and it’s all thanks to those very same fans. In a new blog post, the team at Maxis revealed that Project Rene has ‘evolved’ into a ‘social, collaborative, mobile-first life-sim game.’</p>



<p>It’s not the next big Sims title, but what <strong>is it</strong>?</p>







<h2 id="h-project-rene-is-not-the-sims-5">Project Rene is NOT The Sims 5</h2>



<p>In a recent blog post, Maxis and Electronic Arts took a deep dive into all things The Sims. The post started with a reaffirmation that things aren’t set to run cold with The Sims 4, which will continue to receive updates and new content going forward.</p>



<p>It was believed that the game’s new expansion pack, Royalty &amp; Legacy, would be <strong>the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sims-4-royalty-and-legacy-final-expansion-pack/">final Sims 4 expansion</a></strong>. It seems that might not be the case, based on the new blog post.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> in question details everything you’d want to immediately know about Project Rene, including how the project has pivoted to focus on mobile-based multiplayer mechanics:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to ongoing player feedback, Project Rene has evolved to focus on social multiplayer play, offering a more direct way for friends to share creativity together. </p>



<p>It is not the successor to&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>&nbsp;and is a separate experience from any future deep, single player life simulation experience.&nbsp; It introduces a new way to explore and play together within the growing Sims family of games, welcoming Simmers who want to connect directly with other players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is adamant that the core of the Sims franchise is rooted – and <strong>forever will be</strong> – in <strong>single-player experiences</strong>. That has been the bread and butter of The Sims since the first game debuted almost 26 years ago.</p>



<p>And again, those updates won’t stop flowing right into The Sims 4:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At its core,&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>&nbsp;was built on a deep, single-player life simulation, chock full of rich systems, meaningful storytelling, and player agency that puts you in control. That foundation isn’t going anywhere. We’ll continue to deliver content and updates to&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>&nbsp;and we are committed to improving the experience.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s still no indication of when the next numbered Sims title might surface, but as the live-service, free-to-play model of The Sims 4 is doing so well, it might be a <strong>long time </strong>before it does.</p>

<p>If you’ve been waiting for the chance to play Baldur’s Gate 3 on the go on your Nintendo Switch 2 console, you’re going to want to sit down for this. It’s not happening.</p>



<p>Taking part in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit on Friday, Larian Studios’ Swen Vincke was asked about the game possibly being ported to Nintendo’s latest system. His answer, immediately shut the door on it. </p>







<p><strong>“We would have loved to, but it wasn’t our decision to make,”</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vincke wrote</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-won-t-it-come-to-switch-2">Why Won’t It Come To Switch 2?</h2>



<p>As a follow up to Vincke’s confirmation, known leaker NateTheHate, who had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-could-potentially-come-to-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed in the past</a> there was a possibility to bring the game to Nintendo, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2009691766191165501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gave a bit more insight</a> into why it’s not coming.</p>



<p><strong>“While Larian would love to bring Baldur’s Gate 3 to the Switch 2… their relationship with Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast is not healthy,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Late last year, I heard [Baldur’s Gate 3] for [Switch 2] was no happening….”</strong></p>







<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 first launched in Early Access in August 2020. The full release of the game came in August 2023 on PC. The game would then come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later that year. It would also receive regular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates until April 2025</a>, when the last major patch was released.</p>



<p>While Baldur’s Gate 3 coming to Switch 2 may not be happening, that doesn’t mean Larian isn’t working on what’s next. The studio is in-development of the next game in the Divinity franchise, which, as part of the same AMA, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/">won’t feature any sort of generative AI</a> artwork.</p>
