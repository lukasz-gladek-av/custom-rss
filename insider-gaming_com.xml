<p>On December 3, it’ll be 30 years since the original PlayStation first launched in Japan. A system that changed the course of the industry, PlayStation has been at the top of the console market for three decades now. To start the celebration, not only is Sony holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-sale-500-games-celebration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty massive sale</a> on the PlayStation Store, but the company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkmonzpHVRg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has released</a> a new “Thank You” video for its fans.</p>



<p>“For the past three decades, we’ve shared an incredible journey, building stories and shaping experiences together,” Sony says in the video description. “Along the way, we’ve found adventure, laughter, and lasting memories that go far beyond any one moment. We’ve forged new friendships and redefined what gaming is all about. Thank you for being part of this journey — we couldn’t have done it without you.”</p>



<p>The two-minute video shows some of the biggest franchises in the console’s history with various messages about what PlayStation “is about”. You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While December 3 marks the official 30th anniversary of the PlayStation, the console didn’t release in North America and Europe until September 1995. That means there’s still another nine months of celebration to happen, and plenty of more time for PlayStation to say “Thank You”.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-path-of-exile-2-have-co-op-multiplayer-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 is coming for the crown of ARPG king. It’s no secret the original PoE has co-op and multiplayer, so I’m here to clear up any questions and confusions relating to Path of Exile 2’s potential co-op and multiplayer—it would be nice to have someone to clear the path with.</p>



<p>Multiplayer takes many forms in 2024: Online multiplayer shooters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, couch co-op tag teams in It Takes Two, and outrageous tests of patience such as Chained Together. I personally love single-player games as much as anyone, but you can’t beat getting together for some harmonious co-op or multiplayer action.</p>



<p>The nature of Path of Exile 2 makes it perfect for either form of gameplay. 2013’s PoE incorporated co-op multiplayer into its action, but this doesn’t mean Path of Exile 2 continues on the multiplayer co-op theme. Let’s see what the developer is cooking up.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-path-of-exile-2-multiplayer-co-op">Is Path of Exile 2 Multiplayer Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Path of Exile 2 team, assemble! Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Good news! <strong>Path of Exile 2 features both online multiplayer and local couch co-op</strong> for you to enjoy the game with other people, either via wi-fi, or sitting next to someone.</p>



<p><strong>The confirmation comes from Grinding Gear Games itself</strong> via an official YouTube announcement trailer and the official FAQ.</p>



<h3 id="h-local-couch-co-op">Local Couch Co-op</h3>



<p>If you consult the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Path of Exile 2 frequently asked questions post</a>, under the query asking, “Is couch co-op available in Early Access?,” the answer says, “<strong>Yes, you can play Path of Exile 2 in couch co-op mode on a single account right from the start.</strong> The second player will be able to create a character on that account.”</p>



<p>No waiting around and no kerfuffle here—it’s immediate access to local <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-path-of-exile-2-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">couch co-op</a> with a player of your choosing. Furthermore, the “Path of Exile 2 – Console Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games” trailer also confirmed couch co-op was slated for Path of Exile 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-online-multiplayer-co-op">Online Multiplayer Co-op</h3>



<p>Hammering home the notion of online multiplayer and co-op for Path of Exile 2 is the announcement trailer I referenced above. The trailer says “<strong>Online multiplayer play requires PlayStation Plus membership</strong>.” It also mentions crossplay for Path of Exile 2 too—so you and your friends don’t need to play PoE 2 on the same format.</p>



<p>Check out the cool trailer below.</p>

<p>Tencent has acquired another new game studio, Chinese studio Kuro Games. </p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Youxi Putao</a> — then found by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> — , Tencent has purchased 37% of the Wuthering Waves developer’s shares. When adding it to the 24.4% it already owned, the new acquisition gives the company 51.4% of the shares, and a controlling stake in the company.</p>



<p>The purchase also makes Tencent the only external shareholder of the company.</p>



<p>According to Kuro Games’ internal memo to staff, the studio will continue to work independently. It was iterated that “operational strategy will remain unchanged”. An example used in the memo was Tencent’s ownership in Riot Games and Supercell.</p>



<p>“Based on our past collaborative experiences with Tencent, we firmly believe that this external shareholder change will provide Kuro with a more stable external environment, further benefiting our future independent operational strategies and long-term development,” the internal memo reads via machine translation.</p>



<p>“Over the past decade, our original intention of creating games has never changed, and it will remain unchanged in the next decade. We will continue to love our players, our games, and our team.”</p>



<p>Kuro Games is set to release Version 2.0 of Wuthering Waves on January 2.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov has posted a series of images on social media showcasing Terminal, the potential final map in Escape from Tarkov. For months, talk about the spearhead extraction shooter has been centred around the last step that players are waiting for – the ability to <strong>escape </strong>from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Alongside the images, which showcase a dark and brooding map, Buyanov wrote: ‘The place where it all ends?’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-all-things">The End of All Things</h2>



<p>When Escape from Tarkov finally hits a 1.0 release, it’ll be delivered with the ability to finally escape from Tarkov. That has been the goal for the last decade or so, and it’ll be a way to finally ‘complete’ the game.</p>



<p>The ultimate endgame objective was teased today on social media by Nikita Buyanov, the head honcho at Battlestate Games:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1863505672601534943
</p></figure>







<p>Escaping from Tarkov is something that has only ever been possible by powering down and stepping away from the desk – but soon, players will be able to do that after firmly completing the game. The only issue is that we have no idea what that’ll look like. Could it be some kind of ‘prestige’ system, allowing players to complete the game over and over again to earn new rewards?</p>



<p>Nobody knows.</p>



<p>The images showcased by Buyanov don’t reveal too much. It’s an industrial area, which we knew already based on the ‘port’ setting on the map, but something that’s never been seen before is a <strong>submarine </strong>docked in the port. Players have already theorised that’s how we’ll finally escape from Tarkov. </p>

<p>Visions of Mana Director Ryosuke Yoshida has announced that he joined Sqaure Enix this December.</p>



<p>The announcement came from Yoshida’s X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/YoshidaBeer/status/1863418476637118944" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a>, where he said, “On a personal note, I quit NetEase Ouka Studios on October 31st. We were a new studio, but we were able to release Visions of Mana. I am grateful to the development team and NetEase for their support. It was a very good experience. Thank you all. I am happy to announce that I joined SQUARE ENIX in December.”</p>



<p>Visions of Mana was released on August 29, 2024, by Square Enix and received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregated Metacritic. The game sold approximately 40,000 units in Japan in its first on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, but Square Enix is yet to announce wider sales numbers.</p>



<p>Before joining Square Enix, Ryosuke Yoshida worked on Devil May Cry 5 at Capcom as a game designer.</p>
