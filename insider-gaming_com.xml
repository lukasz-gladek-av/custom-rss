<p>A number of employees at Marvel Rivals and Destiny: Rising developer NetEase Games have been arrested, according to a new report.</p>



<p>According to Chinese outlet <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/category/industrynews/D1r2qIXu83HaLD5q.html">Leifeng</a> — with additional context via <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/netease-says-police-detained-executives-for-alleged-bribery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg Law</a> — nine employees, including two senior executives, were arrested for allegedly laundering money.  </p>



<p>Per the report, the contract value appears to be worth 2 billion yuan, which is just about $278.6 million. In actual money, it’s a  bit lower at 800 million to 1 billion yuan, or $111.4-$139.3 million.</p>



<p>The two executives implicated in the case are Xiang Lang and Jin Yuchen. Xiang served as the head of NetEase’s esports division while Jin was the head of the company’s publishing side.  Neither executive is still with the company.</p>



<p>Names of other employees at the company weren’t made available. At least one who was questioned by outlet <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/netease-responds-to-the-rumors-of-corruption-saying-things-are-under-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yicaiglobal</a> has denied any claims of money laundering. </p>



<p>The allegedly corruption took place within the segments of the company the two executives worked, the company said. They also confirmed that 27 different companies have been blacklisted due to links to fraud. </p>



<p>Other details of the incidents couldn’t be shared due to there still being an active investigation. More information will be provided at a later date.</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket encourages you to open packs, perform Wonder Picks, battle the AI and real-life opponents, and complete Missions. The latter is very interesting as Pokémon Pocket has unadvertised Secret Missions—but we know what they are and what they reward you with.</p>



<p>I don’t know what it is, but knowing a secret most people don’t is invigorating. It doesn’t make you feel special, but it’s cool having exclusive knowledge unknown to anyone else. Most of Pokémon TCG Pocket’s mechanics and functions are out in the open—even the famous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-bent-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bent Pack Trick</a>—but the community is largely in the dark about Secret Missions.</p>



<p>Daily Missions and Premium Missions are all well and good, but if you didn’t know, Pokémon TCG Pocket has several Secret Missions that take weeks to complete.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-secret-missions-does-pokemon-tcg-pocket-have">How Many Secret Missions Does Pokémon TCG Pocket Have?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Secrets no more. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket has seven Secret Missions </strong>for you to chase, and believe me when I say—it could take you a <em>long time</em> to even finish one of them.</p>



<p>Depending on your propensity to procure Poké Gold, it’s conceivable that weeks pass before you tick off any of the missions. Each Secret Mission revolves around collecting cards in the Genetic Apex set. It’s entirely feasible more missions are added in Pokémon TCG Pocket’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next expansions</a>, but for now, let’s concentrate on the initial Secret Missions.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-pokemon-tcg-pocket-secret-mission-amp-rewards">Every Pokémon TCG Pocket Secret Mission &amp; Rewards</h2>



<p>To complete every Secret Mission in Pokémon TCG Pocket, you need to <strong>own every card in the Genetic Apex set</strong>.</p>



<p>This is a brutal proposition as this requires a ton of luck, time investment, and probably money. Without further ado, check out the list in full, their requirements, and your luxurious rewards for managing each impressive feat.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Secret Mission Name</th><th data-align="center">Mission Requirements</th><th data-align="center">Mission Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Complete the Kanto Pokedex!</td><td data-align="center">Complete the Kanto Pokedex by collecting all 151 Kanto region Pokemon cards.</td><td data-align="center">Mew</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Genetic Apex Museum 1 (Charizard)</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Gloom, Pinsir, Charmander, Rapidash, Lapras, Alakazam, Slowpoke, and Meowth.</td><td data-align="center">x36 Wonder Hourglass<br>x12 Pack Hourglass<br>x10 Shop Tickets</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Genetic Apex Museum 2 (Mewtwo)</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Bulbasaur, Cubone, Golbat, Weezing, Dragonite, Pidgeot, Ditto, and Porygon.</td><td data-align="center">x36 Wonder Hourglass<br>x12 Pack Hourglass<br>x10 Shop Tickets</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Genetic Apex Museum 3 (Pikachu)</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Squirtle, Gyarados, Electrode, Diglett, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Eevee, and Snorlax.</td><td data-align="center">x36 Wonder Hourglass<br>x12 Pack Hourglass<br>x10 Shop Tickets</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Gym Leaders of the Kanto Region 2</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Brock, Misty, Lt.

<p>As you can see, these missions must be swiftly cleared. You get some of Pokémon TCG Pocket’s best cards, but you also get much-needed consumables: <strong>Hourglasses and Shop Tickets</strong>.</p>

<p>In order to cut costs, you have to spend money. Unity revealed on Thursday that it had to spend $205 million as part of its restructuring efforts — which included mass layoffs — throughout 2024.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001810806/16c99346-58d4-4022-924d-7cfefa4f7054.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to the company</a>, the money was spent mostly on “incremental” separation costs for the employees being let go. This included $127 million worth of “incremental stock-based compensation”. </p>



<h6 id="h-related-unity-s-new-ceo-nets-millions-months-after-layoffs-and-scandals">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-ceo-salary-new-bonus/">Unity’s New CEO Nets Millions Months After Layoffs and Scandals</a></h6>



<p>“Of the incremental employee separation costs, $15 million are within cost of revenue, $46 million are within research and development, $52 million are within sales and marketing, and $92 million are within general and administrative,” Unity said.</p>



<p>The company added that in they also had $45 million in restructuring costs related to office closures.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Unity announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-laying-off-25-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans to let go 25%</a> of its workforce. The decision was made to allow the company to “focus on our core business and drive our long-term success and profitability”, according to CEO Jim Whitehurst.</p>



<p>The layoffs and changes came after Unity announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-to-charge-game-devs-per-game-install/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial change</a> to its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-apologizes-again-announces-major-changes-to-runtime-fee-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runtime fees</a>. A change that was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-is-cancelling-controversial-runtime-fee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately reversed</a> after backlash.</p>



<p>As part of its earnings call, Unity revealed that it’ had $1.4 billion’s year-over-year revenue for the quarter fell to $446.5 million from $544.2. That’s despite operating expenses falling from $520.3 million to $461.6 million. Overall, the company reported a net loss  of $124.5 million for the third quarter.</p>
