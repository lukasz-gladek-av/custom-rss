<p>Details from the evidence documents from IWGB’s lawsuit against Rockstar have been revealed, hinting at 32-player lobbies for GTA 6 Online. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Rockstar is under investigation for alleged union-busting, with IWGB claiming that the company fired employees who were “organising for better conditions”. Rockstar has denied these claims, stating the dismissal was due to employees <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-devs-fired-over-leaks-sent-to-influencers-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing “confidential information” in insecure channels</a>. Now, details about this confidential information have surfaced online. </p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-hosted-a-32-player-session-suggesting-it-could-be-for-gta-6-online">Rockstar Hosted a 32-Player Session, Suggesting It Could Be for GTA 6 Online.</h2>



<p>The details about GTA 6 Online’s 32-player lobbies come from a recent YouTube video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuipPQDd_w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People Make Games</a> (via <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-6-online-detail-revealed-in-new-court-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RockstarIntel</a>), in which Chris Bratt accessed a hard copy of the court documents in Glasgow. In these documents, Bratt read the Discord messages shared by Rockstar as evidence of employees leaking information. Across these messages, there was some information that was “so sensitive” that Rockstar’s barrister didn’t want to read them in court and asked the judge to read them privately. </p>



<p>The “top secret” messages Rockstar referred to have now been revealed, as Rockstar applied no reporting restrictions to them. The messages start with an employee talking about Rockstar not wanting “more than 13 people off at one time”, which was seemingly later reduced to “no more than 5 people off at a time”. </p>



<p>Then a message comes in as a response to a previous message that talks about a session they conducted, which was “difficult to do” and included 32 players. Another employee responded, stating that they have “multiple studios of QA testers, surely someone can manage to organise a 32 player session and let people have their time off.” This is information regarding an “unannounced feature” in a game currently being developed by Rockstar. </p>



<p>Rockstar’s response also states that it is “gravely concerned” about the claimants sharing “highly confidential and commercially sensitive information relating to the content and features of an unannounced online service.” The claimants discussed the specific number of players planned for this service. However, it hasn’t been explicitly stated that the online service is indeed GTA 6 Online. </p>



<p>For context, GTA 5 Online features 32-player lobbies with 30 active players and 2 spectators. If this is indeed for GTA 6 online, then it won’t be a significant upgrade over the previous title. </p>



<p>At the same time, there was some evidence that Rockstar stated was directly related to GTA 6. Rockstar presented multiple messages as proof for each employee who was fired, but one employee received only one message as evidence. The message itself stated, “Nothing that I’ve heard in the North QA! Will keep you updated if that changes ofc.” Rockstar’s head of publishing, Jeniffer Kolbe, stated that this message “could indicate the stage of development that GTA VI was at for those familiar with the games industry and could also undermine team collaboration. </p>

<p>Workbenches in Hytale are a vital piece of equipment to help players in both survival and progression, opening the door to new items, recipes, and plenty more.</p>



<p>Given the number of Workbenches there are in Hytale, alongside other structures like the Furnace and Cooking Stove, it can be difficult to keep track of what you are missing, the items you need to collect to craft them, and what exactly each one is used for.</p>



<p>To ease the confusion, this Insider Gaming guide has a detailed breakdown of everything you need to know about Hytale’s Workbenches.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-hytale-workbenches-amp-how-to-make-them">All Hytale Workbenches &amp; How to Make Them</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll need plenty of room. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are eight types of Workbenches in Hytale, all of which have different uses, and some of which are not available immediately when you start the game.</strong></p>



<p>Workbenches in Hytale are geared towards specific uses, like the Farmer’s Workbench for creating reliable food sources at your base to the Furniture Workbench for kitting out your decor.</p>



<p>Apart from the initial Workbench, which can be crafted in your inventory, all of the others require interacting with the basic Workbench to craft. Additionally, three of the Workbenches are only unlocked when you upgrade your initial Workbench to Level 2, which requires a host of resources.</p>



<p>The table below shows all the Workbenches in Hytale, the requirements to unlock them, and the necessary ingredients to craft them.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/edios-montreal-aaaa-game/</link>
            <guid>1405534</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A LinkedIn profile from an Edios Montreal employee has revealed that the studio is working on an unannounced ‘AAAA’ game in Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>The finding was posted by LinkedIn scouter <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2011272772551614666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a> on X, and corroborates what I have heard about the project.</p>







<p>In December 2025, I posted to X that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-lets-go-staff-more-layoffs-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Eidos Montreal layoffs</a> were connected to a project codenamed P11, which has been reducing its headcount as of late as it heads into Beta and eventually, launch.</p>



<p>P11 is Eidos Montreal’s new IP, which, according to sources, has been in development since around 2019 and has faced significant setbacks and issues along the way. It’s understood that the project has seen hundreds of millions of dollars invested, which, unsurprisingly, would warrant the ‘AAAA’ tag.</p>



<p>As mentioned on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tM8RcRXnHX8?si=S3YyG2iZjDNKCuoZ&amp;t=2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming podcast</a>, the game is an open-world action-adventure game in third-person. </p>



<p>Funnily enough, I only know about the game because I was pursuing finding out more about the game last year for a book I am working on about cancelled video games, because it looked surprisingly familiar to the cancelled survival game WiLD by Wild Sheet Studio. The similarities led me to believe that the IP had been bought by Eidos Montreal / Embracer, but to my knowledge, that project is entirely dead, and P11 is a new IP but with some striking similarities.</p>







<p>As for when P11 will be revealed remains to be seen, but it’s believe that the game will be ready to be shown later this year if things go well.</p>

<p>According to a new court filing, the Former Activision Blizzard CEO stated that Call of Duty’s performance fell by 60% compared to 2024 due to games like Battlefield 6. </p>



<p>New developments have started popping up in the Delaware lawsuit against Microsoft, Activision, and other board members, including Kotick. The former CEO has already claimed that this lawsuit was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kotick-says-activision-lawsuit-was-meant-to-help-embracer-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed to benefit the Embracer Group</a> at Activision’s expense. Additionally, he has spoken about Call of Duty’s performance visibly declining since his departure.</p>







<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-s-performance-affected-by-battlefield-6-defeats-ftc-s-argument-about-lack-of-competition">Call of Duty’s Performance Affected by Battlefield 6, Defeats FTC’s Argument About Lack of Competition</h2>



<p><span>A report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bobby-kotick-activision-microsoft-ap7-lawsuit-embracer-group" target="_blank">GameFile</a></span>&nbsp;indicates that Kotick has acknowledged that Microsoft has benefited from the Activision Blizzard deal. However, he noted that the recent performance of the company has fallen “well below” their long-term targets. Kotick specifically addressed the performance of Call of Duty, mentioning that it is projected to perform over 60 percent below last year’s figures due to intense competition from titles such as Battlefield.</p>



<p>Kotick also points out that this fall effectively undermines the FTC’s argument regarding a “lack of competition in the first-person action game category” due to the acquisition. For those unaware, the FTC was attempting to block the deal, arguing that it would diminish competition in both the console and cloud markets, ultimately harming consumers by leading to higher prices and reduced innovation in the gaming industry.</p>







<p>In other news, EA has announced that the start of Battlefield 6 and Battlefield REDSEC Season 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been delayed</a>. Additionally, Activision has released&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-releases-new-black-ops-7-patch-with-weapons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new patch</a>&nbsp;for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 that updates several weapons.

<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bobby-kotick-activision-microsoft-ap7-lawsuit-embracer-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameFile</a>, the Delaware lawsuit was initiated by the Swedish pension fund Sjunde AP-Fonden, commonly known as AP7. This fund has accused the former CEO of accelerating the acquisition process in order to overshadow the sexual misconduct scandals that were emerging against the company in late 2021. The lawsuit against Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, and various board members, including Bobby Kotick, has now been met with a response from the former CEO.</p>











<p>The former CEO of Activision Blizzard stated that “this Delaware lawsuit was apparently aimed to help pave the way for Embracer to increase its foothold in the California market at the expense of Activision.” Kotick’s response added that this situation made it more difficult for Activision to attract new talent and hindered its ability to expand through mergers and acquisitions, a strategy it has historically relied on for growth. </p>



<p>The Embracer Group has denied the claims made by the former Activision Blizzard CEO, stating that “perhaps difficult to accept for Mr. Kotick, but we did not and do not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision.” </p>
