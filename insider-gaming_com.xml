<p>Xbox has brought back its 14-day PC Game Pass for $1, which gives access to games including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>The deal was removed prior to the release of Black Ops 6 on October 27, 2024, however, the publisher has just brought back the deal for those wanting to try the service.</p>



<p>As pointed out on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass/pc-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">xbox.com</a>, the subscription will automatically renew at $9.99 a month unless the user opts to cancel it manually via their Microsoft account.</p>



<p>Despite arguably being one of the best deals in gaming, some users online have criticised the deal as it means that cheaters will now be able to get access to Black Ops 6 for a much cheaper price. </p>



<p>In recent weeks, Call of Duty’s Richochet anti-cheat has been heavily criticized for not keeping cheaters at bay. Yesterday, one <a href="https://x.com/ItsGamerDoc/status/1860094492956606555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Riot Games’ anti-cheat developer even took to X</a> (formerly Twitter) to point out its serious flaws.</p>



<p>As for if the PC Game Pass deal will cause an increase in cheaters in Call of Duty remains to be seen, but for those uninterested in Call of Duty, the PC Game Pass deal is still exceptional value for money to try out the service and the games that it has to offer.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PC Game Pass deal? Do you think Microsoft should have addressed the Call of Duty Richochet problem before rolling out its PC Game Pass deal again? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The interconnectivity of video games is greater than it ever has been. Marvel Rivals is the definition of a AAA blockbuster in gaming, and having some kind of crossplay, cross-progression, or cross-platform integration would be ideal.</p>



<p>Growing up, I hated the fact I couldn’t play with or against my friends who had different consoles. It also sucked that if I owned a game on two consoles, I couldn’t carry my progress across. In 2024, this ideology is practically redundant as most online multiplayer titles have some form of cross-platform capabilities.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> isn’t just an online multiplayer hero shooter, it is shaping up to be one of the most prominent and significant in recent times. Having cross-platform functionality can only improve the overall experience, and I have some interesting news for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-crossplay">Is Marvel Rivals Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PlayStation, Xbox, and PC come together? Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is set to feature fully integrated crossplay at launch, allowing players on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC to play with each other.</strong></p>



<p>The news was confirmed by Rivals’ executive producer Danny Koo in an interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-qa-netease-talks-about-the-heroes-hybrid-roles-opposed-to-hard-tank-dps-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wccftech</a>. Discussing crossplay, Koo reiterated Marvel Rivals is coming to “PC, Xbox, and PlayStation,” and when queried on “cross-platform play between them,” Koo replied, “<strong>Yes, and we’ll be cross-play in beta as well.</strong>“</p>



<p>The beta—in the aftermath of this interview—did indeed feature crossplay, meaning it’s <strong>all but confirmed we’re getting Marvel Rivals crossplay when the hero shooter goes live on Dec. 6.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-does-marvel-rivals-have-cross-progression">Does Marvel Rivals have cross-progression?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, Marvel Rivals likely won’t support cross-progression—at least in its launch phase.</strong></p>



<p>In an Oct. 17 interview, this time with game director Guangyun Chen, for <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-devs-still-dont-know-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, he said “<strong>For now, we have no cross-progression.</strong> As we only have around two months to go global launch, we are doing the final tech check to see what we can do and how we can process it. The workload is a lot more than we thought at the beginning.”</p>



<p>Chen later confirmed cross-progression is one of the most sought-after features by the community, and the team “are still having internal discussions.” For now, we’ll go on the assumption Marvel Rivals has no cross-progression at launch. Do keep checking back for the latest developments on the topic though, as it could be added as a last-minute surprise—or as a post-launch update.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s good news on the crossplay front at least. Are you disappointed there’s probably no cross-progression in Marvel Rivals? Will it put you off buying the shooter?
