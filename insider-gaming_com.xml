<p>Fortnite has revealed a surprise Nickelodeon collab with Danny Phantom is arriving in the Item Shop tomorrow, with the secret somehow being kept from the flood of leakers on social media.</p>



<p>Epic Games’ boasts a proud history of featuring a wealth of impressive collabs in Fortnite, shown by the recent The Simpsons mini-season, but keeping collabs under wraps and coming as a surprise is difficult. This time, though, they’ve managed to do so.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1996323949882523779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teaser post</a> showcasing what to expect to appear in the Item Shop on Fortnite this week, it was subtly revealed that a Danny Phantom bundle will land on December 5.</p>



<p>The bundle will feature skins for Danny Phantom and Samantha Manson, though further items like Back Bling, Emotes, or Gliders have not been showcased, nor has the price been revealed.</p>



<p>Keeping such a huge collab under wraps is a big win for Fortnite, and the fact that Danny Phantom falls under the Nickelodeon banner could open the door to further huge collabs in the future.</p>



<p>It’s already been widely reported that SpongeBob SquarePants is coming to Fortnite later this Chapter, which, along with Danny Phantom, suggests other collabs could be on the cards.</p>



<p>The potential for collabs has increased following the release of Sidekicks, which allows for smaller characters to feature in collabs, whereas previously, there were size restrictions that prevented small-sized characters from starring prominently.</p>



<p>So far, the only Sidekick collabs have come from The Simpsons, with Scratchy and Homer’s Pig, but there are plenty of options for the future.</p>

<p>A long-awaited Fortnite skin has finally been made available, although the initial unlock is locked behind the purchase of a $170 piece of hardware.</p>



<p>Fortnite skins continue to flood out, with both collabs and Epic Games creations becoming hits, and the Clyde skin has been on the eyes of players for a while, providing a mix of a raccoon and a cowboy. However, it won’t be cheap initially.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-clyde-skin-initially-locked-behind-backbone-controller">Fortnite Clyde Skin Initially Locked Behind Backbone Controller</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hefty purchase. Image via Backbone</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although the Clyde skin could be available in the Item Shop at a later date, the initial option to claim the skin is locked behind the purchase of a $170 Backbone Pro Controller.</p>



<p>Existing owners of a Backbone Pro can also receive the Clyde outfit by redeeming a code, which unlocks a quick in-game Quest before Clyde is added to your Locker.</p>



<p>The code is redeemable only once per user, and cannot be resold, exchanged, or redeemed for cash, though that’s unlikely to stop some people trying to flog their codes on the market.</p>



<p>Anyone else wanting the Clyde outfit will have to fork out the price to purchase the controller, or wait for the Outfit to potentially be available in the Item Shop in the future. However, there’s no indication of how long that will be, nor is the price of such a release known.</p>



<p>The Clyde outfit can also only be unlocked by playing Fortnite on iOS, Android, PC, and cloud streaming, although it will be usable across all platforms when unlocked.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is finally in the hands of players worldwide after years of waiting, but players have uncovered that a basic feature is locked behind an Amiibo figure.</p>



<p>18 years after Metroid Prime 3: Corruption was first released, the fourth instalment in the series launched on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on December 4, but early impressions are mixed, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-the-lowest-reviewed-game-in-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critic scores being the lowest in the series</a>.</p>



<p>There’s still time for that to change, however, and user scores may be more positive, but the locking of a basic feature behind a paywall has left one area of the game feeling barren.</p>







<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-desert-music-locked-behind-amiibo-purchase">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Desert Music Locked Behind Amiibo Purchase</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Locked. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/lukestephens/status/1996340617497227440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Luke Stephens</a> on Twitter, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond’s music in the desert, an area explored while driving the Vi-O-La bike, is absent unless you purchased the $29.99 Samus Amiibo.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/hardware/amiibo/game/bgw5a_2/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo’s product description</a> lists background music as a perk from owning the Samus Amiibo, along with the ability to activate a shield that will block up to 99 damage and fully restore Samus’ life once per day.</p>



<p>The description doesn’t inform you, however, that without the Amiibo figure, the desert landscape in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be eerily silent, and offers nothing if you haven’t splashed out on the figure.</p>



<p>There are also two other Amiibo figures to purchase to get additional bonuses in the game, with the Samus &amp; Vi-O-La figure providing customizable colors, the ability to check total distance travels, and a once-per-day increase to the rate of regeneration for Viola’s Boost Energy.</p>



<p>The final figure, Cyrax, allows you to see the full version of the movies that are shown in fragments throughout the game, once you have completed it, a feature that is otherwise locked behind achieving a 100% scan rate and item collection rate.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#907)—Clues and Answers for Thursday, December 4]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-4-907/</link>
            <guid>1372570</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You’re almost through the first week of December, and you’re a few steps closer to the festive window that we all love. Before you get there, you’ve got a few more NYT Connections puzzles to complete, and naturally, that includes today’s puzzle. Below, I’ve sketched out the best NYT Connections hints and solutions you’ll find anywhere.</p>



<p>If you’re being hampered by today’s puzzle, be sure to read on for the NYT Connections hints you need to get through it and keep your streak running.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-4">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 4)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #907:</p>



<ul>
<li>DRAW CLOSE</li>



<li>PUZZLE</li>



<li>ROSTRUM</li>



<li>NUZZLE</li>



<li>GUZZLE</li>



<li>IKEA FURNITURE</li>



<li>MUZZLE</li>



<li>LEGO SET</li>



<li>HOLD TIGHT</li>



<li>KNOCK BACK</li>



<li>MODEL</li>



<li>SPOON</li>



<li>SWILL</li>



<li>BEAK</li>



<li>POUND DOWN</li>



<li>PROBOSCIS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all different ways people might physically draw close to one another for comfort or affection.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>These words all describe drinking something quickly, often in large amounts or without pause.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all items that don’t come ready-made — you have to put the pieces together yourself.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These words are all different names for the protruding facial structure of animals.</em> </li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 4:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-4-907">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 4 (#907)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DRAW CLOSE, HOLD TIGHT, NUZZLE, SPOON</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – GUZZLE, KNOCK BACK, POUND DOWN, SWILL</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – IKEA FURNITURE, LEGO SET, MODEL, PUZZLE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BEAK, MUZZLE, PROBOSCIS, ROSTRUM</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/console-nex-playground-topped-ps5-sales-us/</link>
            <guid>1372561</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Circana’s most recent release of hardware sales in the United States just revealed a tantalizing tidbit about an unknown piece of hardware that’s making waves this holiday season. In a post on social media by Circana’s Mat Piscatella, it was revealed that the <strong>NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System </strong>outsold the PlayStation 5 during the week ending November 22, 2025.</p>



<p>The NEX Playground came in just behind pole position, held by the Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle, this year’s hottest Christmas gift.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-nex-playground">What is the NEX Playground?</h2>



<p>Mat Piscatella’s telling post on social media revealed that the <strong>NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System </strong>beat the PS5 Slim Digital in sales in the United States midway through November, prompting many to ask what the device even is.</p>











<p>The NEX Playground has been around since 2023, but it’s gathering steam now ahead of this year’s holiday season. It’s part of a new line-up of interactive games consoles designed for families and young gamers, allowing them to turn their televisions into engaging experiences without the need for controllers.</p>



<p>It’s like the Kinect, Eye Toy, or PlayStation Camera, but you don’t need a console to make it work, as it <strong>is </strong>the console.</p>



<p>It’s an AI-powered device that sits next to your television, offering a range of games like Fruit Ninja, Bluey Bust-a-Move, NHL Puck Rush, and Barbie Dance Party, all of which encourage young players to get up, get moving, and enjoy video games more interactively. It also has a bolt-on subscription that users can opt into to secure more games.</p>



<p>The NEX Playground costs just $249, which makes it a considerably cheaper option compared to the Nintendo Switch 2 ($500) or the PS5 Slim Digital ($449).</p>



<p>Circana’s Mat Piscatella followed up his simple sales report with a comment that read, ‘MOTION CONTROL IS BACK.’</p>







<p>Are you investing in a NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System for your family this Christmas?

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s ‘Good Ending’ Has Been Unlocked, and It Almost Suggests a Sequel]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-good-ending-almost-suggests-sequel/</link>
            <guid>1372555</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov has been dominating the extraction shooter space for many years, and midway through November, it hit the long-awaited 1.0 release window that pushed it out as a ‘finished’ game. In the weeks that followed, the game’s best players have busied themselves with completing the game’s all-new story-driven campaign, seen as the ultimate challenge for Tarkov fans.</p>



<p>The first completion came earlier this week, with streamer ‘Tigz’ being dubbed the first in the world to see Tarkov through to the end. Other streamers and players followed, but recently, a Chinese streamer proved to be the first to capture unlocking the game’s best, and reportedly <strong>hardest</strong>, ending – <strong>Savior</strong>.</p>



<p>This was the first <strong>PvP </strong>unlock, while the first PvE unlock, recognized as the world’s first <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/1996179962685178266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Battlestate Games</a>, was by a player named Tsukinogi.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-s-best-ending-has-been-secured">Escape from Tarkov’s Best Ending Has Been Secured</h2>



<p>On BiliBili, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nE2YBGEWr">an hour-long VOD</a> was posted from the perspective of a Chinese streamer, Youmoxiangche, who goes by the in-game username ‘NeverPlayScav’.</p>



<p>In this video, we saw a tense battle through Terminal rage as the player pushed towards what’s widely believed to be the <strong>best </strong>of Escape from Tarkov’s four endings: Survivor, Fallen, Debtor, and Savior.</p>



<p>The worst endings are <strong>Debtor </strong>and <strong>Fallen</strong>, while <strong>Survivor </strong>is seen as being a middle-of-the-road victory, and <strong>Savior </strong>sits atop the pile as the best outcome. In the Savior ending, the player character is welcomed onto the ZUBR Boat after extracting through Terminal, fighting through Scavs, RUAF, and Black Faction enemies in a PvE environment.</p>



<p>As they’re ushered onto the boat, the vessel’s captain tries to assassinate them, but is caught and killed by a friendly RUAF soldier who assures the player that nobody is left on the boat but allies. As they head topside for a smoke, more bodies are seen being dumped into the river through Tarkov.</p>



<p>At that moment, jets fly overhead and drop what appears to be a <strong>nuclear warhead </strong>on the city of Tarkov, and the soldier quips that they managed to escape just in time. As the image fades to black, the player character receives a unique ring, and the RUAF soldier utters the words that it’s up to them to decide their own fate now.</p>



<p>It almost suggests a sequel of sorts could be coming. The RUAF squad, along with the PMC protagonist, zip off into the sunset, and the soldier says:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What matters is we’re alive, and now we’ll take down those bastards from TerraGroup. The whole world will know the truth.</p>



<p>From here on, we decide our own fate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We know that Battlestate Games is working on ‘other games’ in the Escape from Tarkov universe, and that DLC will be delivered now that the 1.0 version of the game is out, but is this our first indicator as to what that might look like?</p>

<p>The Starladder Budapest Major is unravelling as we speak, and the third stage is set to kick off <strong>today</strong>. The predictions for the third stage of this $1.25 million Counter-Strike 2 tournament are getting too close to call, but there are some frontrunners. It’s shaping up to be a brutal proving ground for the game’s heaviest hitters, but how might the tournament’s underdogs fare?</p>



<p>This final Swiss Stage will decide the eight playoff contenders, and the earliest signs we have point to the likes of NAVI, FaZe, and Vitality as frontrunners, which many might have predicted, but the likes of Passion UA and 3DMAX still have the potential for an underdog upset.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-will-make-it-to-the-playoffs-in-budapest">Who Will Make It To The Playoffs in Budapest?</h2>



<p>Stage two of the Budapest Major was a pretty dramatic affair. The squads lined up needing three wins to proceed to the third stage, and the likes of NAVI and FaZe Clan both produced perfect records, effortlessly walking into the next phase.</p>



<p>The three ‘underdog’ sides in this event, Team Liquid, Passion UA, and 3DMAX, all produced decisive last-minute wins, eliminating Astralis, M80, and NiP in a sweep that few saw coming.</p>



<p>As we go into the third stage, these are the teams lined up to compete:</p>



<p><strong>Invited</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vitality</li>



<li>G2</li>



<li>Spirit</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Falcons</li>



<li>PaiN</li>



<li>MongolZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Stage Two:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>NAVI</li>



<li>FaZe</li>



<li>Liquid</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>



<li>Imperial</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Parivision</li>
</ul>



<p>The matches lined up for stage three are already looking tasty, but all eyes will be on Vitality vs FaZe as the pick of the bunch. This is FaZe’s resurgence versus Vitality’s consistency, following a year of incredible results with ZywOo at the helm.</p>



<p>In terms of predictions, it’s easy to see NAVI, FaZe Clan, Vitality, and G2 Esports in the playoffs, with Liquid, UA, and 3DMAX coming in as dark horses.</p>
