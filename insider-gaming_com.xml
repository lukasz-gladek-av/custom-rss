<p>You were probably elated to see your leftover MW3 Double XP Tokens reactivated in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 fans, and equally as dismayed to see them vanish again. There is a reason why Activision has done this, but there is good news on the horizon.</p>



<p>Many Modern Warfare 3 players held onto their Double XP Tokens toward the end of the shooter’s lifecycle. This was to use them at the beginning of Black Ops 6 and get a big boost toward <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faster leveling up</a>. However, Activision and Treyarch decided to not carry legacy tokens over, leaving everyone to start from scratch.</p>



<p>It seemed the companies reneged on the decision with the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season One</a>. All Double XP legacy tokens suddenly became active—and I can’t express my joy at seeing hours of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-double-xp-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Double XP</a> in my grasp. In the blink of an eye, they were gone again—but don’t worry, all is not as bad as it seems.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-have-my-black-ops-6-double-xp-tokens">Where Have my Black Ops 6 Double XP Tokens?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t tease me. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Black Ops 6 Double XP Tokens have gone because <strong>Treyarch has disabled them to due “potential risk to game stability.”</strong></p>



<p>It turns out you were not supposed to be able to access your Double XP legacy tokens in Black Ops 6, and this was an accident caused by a Season One launch “UI bug.” </p>



<p>Treyarch informed everyone of the situation via an <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1857856770804429277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X message on social media</a>, “With the start of Season 01, a UI bug allowed players to activate legacy XP tokens in Black Ops 6. Unfortunately, it also introduced some potential risk to game stability, which is why it was patched yesterday.”</p>



<p>In more positive news, the developer has acknowledged how important legacy Double XP Tokens are to the community: “We realize how much players appreciate being able to redeem legacy XP tokens in both BO6 and Warzone, so <strong>we are currently testing a way to implement this change correctly in a future update</strong>.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, like the arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-prop-hunt-coming-to-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prop Hunt</a>, we don’t have an exact date this is scheduled to drop. All we can do is monitor Activision and Treyarch socials for the latest news on Double XP Tokens being usable in BLOPS 6 again.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-legacy-double-xp-tokens-in-black-ops-6">How to Use Legacy Double XP Tokens in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 legacy Double XP Tokens are usable if you <strong>activate them through the Warzone interface, and head on back over to the BLOPS 6</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, per Treyarch, “Players can activate any legacy XP tokens in Warzone. <strong>Any tokens applied in Warzone also apply to Black Ops 6</strong> should you switch titles or modes.”</p>



<p>So, if you’re looking to use carried-over Double XP Tokens, you need to have Warzone installed. It’s a cumbersome workaround—but a workaround nonetheless.</p>

<p>Do you appreciate Treyarch’s honesty and willingness to reintroduce legacy tokens? Or should it have been mandatory in the first place? Leave a comment.

<p>After nine years, Rainbow Six Siege is finally getting crossplay between PC and Console players. The news was announced as part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4tB2kOgWqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Operation Collision Point</a> reveal on Sunday.</p>



<p>When playing online, players on console will have three different pools to choose from when looking for a match. There will be platform-specific pools to keep you against those on the same system, a consoles-only pool to allow crossplay between PlayStation and Xbox, and a PC crossplay pool. The pool can be set in the general settings under “Crossplay Matchmaking”.</p>



<p>As far as the players are concerned, they’ll be able to invite anyone to a match through Ubisoft Connect. Those on console who decide they want to play with PC players will have a separate PC rank from their traditional console rank for ranked playlists.</p>







<p>With the addition of crossplay between the platforms, the team knows that cheating is a concern. It’s something that the developers have been working on handling before the feature became available.</p>



<p>“We are excited to confirm that MouseTrap V2 will be a part of this feature to keep things balanced,” UX Designer Abhishek Agarwal said. </p>



<p>Creative Director Alexander Karpazis added that the system will allow detection if someone is trying to play with a mouse and keyboard against just console players that will move players to the PC pool if they are detected. Regarding cheating, there is a new “Cheater Match Cancellation” system that will remove a cheater from the game and cancel the entire match if one is detected.</p>



<p>What do you think of Rainbow Six Siege getting full crossplay support? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Knowing firsthand whether you can run an upcoming simulator is step number one in immersing yourself in the experience wholly. With a game like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025, the system requirements determine everything, down to your enjoyment of the game. If your computer can’t run the title, you’ll find it a jarring experience that runs the risk of leading to motion sickness. Thankfully, we have the info you need!</p>



<h2 id="h-here-s-the-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-pc-requirements">Here’s the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PC Requirements</h2>



<p>In a simulation game that somehow manages to span the entire planet, albeit in minimal detail in some locations, one would assume the system requirements would be exceptional. They’re pretty high in some spots. Previously, there were rumors that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-on-pc-wants-64gb-ram-to-run-at-its-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MFS 2024 would require 64 GB of RAM</a> to run on the high-end. However, that doesn’t appear to be the case any longer, as the recommended amount of RAM sits at 32 GB currently. </p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-requirements">Minimum Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X / Intel Core i7-6800K</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Radeon RX 5700 / GeForce GTX 970</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 50 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband – Network Speed of 10 Mbps Bandwidth</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-requirements">Recommended Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X / Intel Core i7-10700K</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Radeon RX 5700 XT / GeForce RTX 2080</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 32 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 50 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband – Network Speed of 50 Mbps Bandwidth</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-releasing-on">What Platforms is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Releasing On?</h2>



<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will be released on November 19 and immediately available to play on PC and Xbox Series X|S. Unfortunately, the flight simulator that spans the globe isn’t coming to PlayStation 5. There’s no word on whether this might change, but with past Microsoft console-exclusive titles, like Grounded and Sea of Thieves, launching on PS5, it’s not outside the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>It’s becoming the norm for an upcoming game to launch with two, three, or sometimes even four unique editions that vary in price and content. The more you spend, the more in-game content you receive. It’s a shame. But if you’re the type of gamer who only plays a handful of titles throughout the year, especially if you have a favorite franchise, paying a little extra for one game makes more sense. Regarding the many airplanes in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, paying for the most expensive edition is how you’ll unlock everything at launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-airplane-in-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-on-launch">Every Airplane in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on Launch</h2>



<p>With four unique game editions to consider, it’s confusing which version of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is worth your time. Here’s a rundown of every airplane you’ll unlock in each edition of the game:</p>
