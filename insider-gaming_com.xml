<p>The co-founder of Grasshopper Manufacture has stated that NetEase doesn’t allow any of their studios to use AI. </p>



<p>Due to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), the gaming industry has become increasingly concerned about its application in games. Opinions on this matter vary: some support AI for its ability to expedite mundane tasks, while others argue that it should not be utilized in any artistic capacity. Additionally, some have outright rejected the use of AI altogether. Recently, Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-genai-has-zero-part-in-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed</a> generative AI in relation to GTA 6, and now we also know NetEase’s stance on the issue. </p>

<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romeo-is-a-dead-man-suda-51-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the co-founder of Grasshopper Manufacture (NetEase acquired it in 2021) and the director of Romeo is a Dead Man, Goichi “Suda 51” Suda, elaborated on his perspective on AI use in games. Talking about his game first, Suda 51 stated that Romeo would be “fake”, “hard to relate to”, and “kind of creepy” if he were made with AI. The director also stated that the work and passion devs put into creating can be felt by players, whereas AI won’t invoke the same feeling. </p>



<p>Suda 51 then spoke about NetEase banning AI use, stating that they “originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff.” However, they decided not to work on that section anymore, shutting it down and telling “their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all.”</p>



<p>When asked why, Suda 51 said he doesn’t know the exact reason but speculates there could be two. First, a vast majority of players “don’t like AI and having it in their games,” and second, “issues with copyright infringement” also come into play. Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase Games for clarification and will update this story once a response is received.</p>
