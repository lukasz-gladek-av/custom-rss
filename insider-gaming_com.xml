<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is the latest game in the recent run of arcade-style beat ‘em ups that have made a resurgence in recent years. From the same developers behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge and the upcoming Scott Pilgrim EX comes a new telling of a popular storyline from the mid-2000s.</p>



<p>Annihilus has launched an attack across the galaxy. It’s up to you to fight your way across earth and beyond to stop the Annihilation Wave from destroying everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion takes a classic Saturday morning cartoon energy and blends it with the slick pixel art style fans have come to expect from Tribute Games. Each level is loaded with bright animations, detailed designs, impressive music, and clever nods to the original Annihilation comics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What helps sell the experience is how fast everything moves. Combat is quick, responsive, and surprisingly readable even when four players are swapping characters with a screen full of enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It feels chaotic in a good way. There’s just enough depth to keep the action engaging without overwhelming players who just want a fun, vintage beat ‘em up.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-cosmic-invasion-review">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review</h2>



<p>The main gameplay element of Marvel Cosmic Invasion is its “Cosmic Swap” system. This allows you to quickly swap with the second character you select for your run. Players can go solo or play with up to three friends, and choose two characters per level or run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each hero—there are 15 in total after everyone is unlocked—has their own list of moves. Some have a couple more than others, but even those with fewer moves still feel fun such as Storm and Black Panther.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With your two heroes selected, you can swap out as often as you’d like when both characters are still alive. But, it’s not always about swapping whenever you like. Sure, you can do that or just not swap at all for that matter. But there’s a benefit towards timing the change during your fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can swap to perform combos with certain characters. One such combo is using Beta Ray Bill’s “Soaring Hammer” attack that sends enemies into the air followed by a Spider-Man swinging kick to launch them off a ledge. There are even Cosmic Assists that can be called in such as specials or other attacks to do extra damage and clear out larger groups of enemies.</p>



<p>You can even use the swap to get out of trouble. For example, you could find yourself grabbed by a tentacle. Swapping allows your other hero to come in and free the trapped character.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-quick-campaign">A Quick Campaign</h2>



<p>In the game you have the option to play the campaign in a modern format with saved progress or do it with an old-school arcade experience with limited lives, continues, and no save progression. For a first run, it’s definitely recommended to go through with progression because it also allows you to unlock everything available.</p>



<p>Each level has hero-specific challenges that allow you to earn Cosmic Cubes for the Cosmic Matrix. That matrix is where you unlock new color pallets, music tracks, corps files (bios), and arcade-mode modifiers like faster enemies, the ability to play as the same character, free play, and more. As you complete levels, you’ll also upgrade your heroes with extra HP, focus upgrades, and passive skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can play each level with whomever you want, but the cutscenes they show will feature the characters the level was designed for. So, if your challenges call for She-Hulk and Storm like in the Savage Land, that’s who you’ll see in the scenes. They’ll also be highlighted on the character selection screen as a reminder.</p>



<p>In the campaign, it also offers what look to be branching paths. But it’s kind of misleading. You’ll see branches that make it look like completing the level before it will allow you to progress only to find you need to complete both anyway to move forward. It makes the lines kind of pointless.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There were also a couple times where bugs required full level restart. During the boss fight on the second level, one of my characters died (Wolverine). Rather than swap the way it should’ve to Storm, the fight kept going but I couldn’t play. Wolverine just stayed laying down. The only solution was to restart the level. Then, it happened again at the same point.</p>



<p>Those were the only instances where it happened, and it was tough to figure out what actually caused it. It’s something that will certainly be fixed in an update, but shouldn’t have made it through in the first place.</p>



<p>Overall, the campaign will take you about three-to-seven hours depending on how you play for a first run. With everything to find and unlock, however, it’s not likely to be the only playthrough you want to do.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-cosmic-invasion-review-verdict">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review Verdict</h2>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion hits the sweet spot between nostalgic arcade fun and modern polish. The Cosmic Swap system gives combat a surprising amount of strategy, the roster has no real duds, and the progression loop makes it easy to jump back in for another level or run. A couple of bugs do hurt the momentum, but not enough to take away from how enjoyable the ride is. If you are looking for a co-op brawler to play with friends, this one delivers in every way.</p>

<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is the hottest beat ’em up game of 2025. The side-scrolling action lets you jump into the shoes of Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, and many other Marvel stars, and having it available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 1 and 2 would be heroic.</p>



<p>We’ve had a mixed bag of Marvel games in recent years. The Avengers game wasn’t a rousing success, but Marvel Rivals has done something thought impossible and made an engaging hero shooter without breaking the boundaries of the Marvel universe.</p>







<p>Now, we have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, a no-nonsense beat ’em up.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-cosmic-invasion-on-playstation-4">Can You Play Marvel Cosmic Invasion On PlayStation 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Heroes for days. Credit to Dotemu</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is available to play on PS4, giving old-gen fans the chance to beat up villains, too.</strong></p>



<p>The game looks great with its art style, but like other Dotemu projects—such as Streets of Rage 4—it’s not going to push the boundaries of any hardware. A PS4 port makes sense, and it will only boost the game’s sales and give the Marvel title much-needed exposure across more brands.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-cosmic-invasion-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Marvel Cosmic Invasion On PlayStation 5?</h2>



<p><strong>The PS5 is another home for Marvel Cosmic Invasion, giving Sony a full clean sweep.</strong></p>



<p>If the fighter is on PS4, it’s more than likely going to be on PS5. But it was a question Insider Gaming has seen, and one that certainly needed answering. Whichever recent PlayStation device you own, it can play Marvel Cosmic Invasion on it!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-cosmic-invasion-on-xbox-one">Can You Play Marvel Cosmic Invasion On Xbox One?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The game’s fire. Credit to Dotemu</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Add the Xbox One to the list of consoles you can play Marvel Cosmic Invasion on.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a tick in the old-gen checkbox for Xbox as well. Those of you who haven’t decided to upgrade to newer consoles can miss out quite frequently on new games. Marvel Cosmic Invasion does no such thing, and if the game runs perfectly fine on Xbox’s last generation of consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-cosmic-invasion-on-xbox-series-s-x">Can You Play Marvel Cosmic Invasion On Xbox Series S|X?</h2>



<p><strong>Another easy one here, as Marvel Cosmic Invasion is available to Xbox Series X|S users.</strong></p>



<p>It’s pretty much a case of rinse and repeat here for Series X|S buyers, as it is for the PS5. There’s just no way the biggest consoles are going to miss out on any big release, unless it’s an exclusive and there’s brand loyalty rights in play.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-cosmic-invasion-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Marvel Cosmic Invasion On Nintendo Switch Or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Both Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 owners also get to see what the fuss is about with Marvel Cosmic Invasion.</strong></p>



<p>Last-gen, new-gen, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, it’s all relative. Marvel Cosmic Invasion is available everywhere on all major formats, so what are you waiting for? There’s a world to save!</p>



<p>It’s good news all around then. Which platform will you/are you playing Marvel Cosmic Invasion on?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-terminal-map-entered/</link>
            <guid>1369267</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s mysterious new map started this morning as just that – a mystery. Now, it has been blown wide open, with one streamer being the first player in the world to gain access to Terminal. The new map was introduced with Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update, but until now, it has remained sealed.</p>



<p>In a move that was recognized by Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio powering Escape from Tarkov, TIGZ gained access to Terminal and experienced the endgame mission for the first time.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-do-you-get-into-terminal-in-tarkov">How Do You Get Into Terminal in Tarkov</h2>



<p>To gain access to Terminal in Escape from Tarkov, you first need to complete all the prerequisites, including the entire campaign chain that you’re taken along by the choices you make in the main game. Once you’ve fulfilled the required criteria, you’ll need to head to Shoreline between 22:00 and 04:00 and use the TRANSITION POINT that’s outside the Terminal gate.</p>



<p>This is the same gate you would have needed to scout very early in the game.,</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/RealTigz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RealTigz</a> I saw that! Congratz on the first Terminal run!<br>Better luck next one!</p>— Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1995493411688939886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>If you’ve met the criteria, you’ll transition and enter Terminal, being presented with a cutscene that kicks off the end of the game in The Ticket.</p>



<p>Your sole objective will be to head through Terminal and get to the Zubr boat, the only extraction point from Terminal, and from Tarkov as a whole. It’s a PvE environment, and a war is raging as Terminal comes under siege, forcing the player to contend with a staggering number of enemies while also having <strong>no equipment</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2632622304">TIGZ might have been the first</a> to enter Terminal, but he didn’t manage to complete the mission, as he died shortly before wrapping it up and was kicked back to the main menu.</p>



<p>It’s indicative of what Nikita said about a small portion of the player base being able to resolve the final mission in Escape from Tarkov. It’s nails, and there is an onslaught of enemies to contend with, the likes of which you’ve never seen before.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Chapter 7 The Last Chapter of Fortnite? Fortnite Final Chapter Rumor, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-chapter-7-the-last-chapter-of-fortnite/</link>
            <guid>1369264</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new adventure has commenced with the start of Chapter 7 Season 1 in Fortnite, bringing a fresh experience to the game, but questions are circulating on whether this is the last chapter of Fortnite.</p>



<p>Considerable changes have been made with the launch of Chapter 7, including the destruction of the beloved Battle Bus, and the ongoing evolution of the Epic Games title leaves the door open for significant expansion in the future.</p>



<p>With Fortnite’s history of Chapters and Seasons now long established, questions continue to emerge on whether Chapter 7 will be the final Chapter, and Insider Gaming has collected all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-chapter-7-the-last-chapter-of-fortnite">Is Chapter 7 The Last Chapter of Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>End of an era? Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no indication that Chapter 7 will be the final Chapter in Fortnite’s long-established schedule, though there is always the chance that Epic Games mixes it up.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite Chapters have been in place since October 2019, when the standard season approach was revamped. From then on, rather than having singular seasons like ‘Season One’, Fortnite moved into a Chapter and Season approach with the launch of Chapter 2 Season 1.</p>



<p>Since then, Epic Games has settled into an annual update in Chapters, bringing a new map, a revamped loot pool, and major gameplay changes to the scene, which have helped to keep Fortnite alive and fresh. However, as next year marks seven years since this process began, it could be revamped.</p>



<p>Even if a revamp was on the cards, Fortnite would not be disappearing. Instead, any change would just be to the approach of naming individual Seasons and Chapters, but even that is unlikely, as the current approach helps to avoid any confusion between previous seasons and ongoing ones.</p>



<p>The addition of Fortnite OG as a permanent mode has also proven to be extremely popular, and allows Epic Games to reuse old assets and bring a fresh approach to historic seasons in the past.</p>



<p>Additionally, rumors of a final chapter in Fortnite have persisted throughout the years, with similar questions asked about whether Chapter 6 would be the final Chapter.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-fortnite-do-in-the-future">What Could Fortnite do in The Future?</h2>



<p><strong>If Fortnite were to make a major change in the structure of Chapters, it would likely be to reference the evolution of the game away from the Battle Royale experience.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite now caters to a wide array of players, with LEGO Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, and Rocket Racing as established modes separate from Battle Royale, while the likes of Reload, Blitz, Delulu, and Fortnite OG provide a different gameplay experience. Alongside this, there’s an endless supply of creative maps offering RPGs, Tycoons, and much more.</p>



<p>The biggest aspect in the works, however, is Epic Games’ huge partnership with Disney. In February 2024, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/disney-buys-1-5-billion-stake-in-epic-games-will-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1.5 billion deal was announced</a> between Disney and Epic Games, with the investment coming alongside plans to create an ‘expansive’ universe within Fortnite where various IPs are found.</p>



<p>Epic Games and Fortnite already have a wealth of experience working with Disney, with regular collabs and themed seasons taking place over the years, and this would ramp that up significantly.</p>
