<p>Having the best meta guns will give you a huge advantage in Battlefield 6. At the very least, you’ll be able to compete with everyone else who is also using the best guns. We’ve got top weapons you should be using in Battlefield 6, along with the ideal loadouts to go with them.</p>



<p>If you’re not keeping on top of the ‘meta,’ you’re going to fall behind. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> features a vast array of guns, but selecting the right one for each class is crucial. You might love the AK4D, for example, but it’s not as good as the most elite assault rifle in BF 6.</p>



<p>We’ve put together the best meta guns and loadouts for the top weapon in each Battlefield 6 class.</p>







<figure><figcaption>A demon. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>M4A1 </strong>is currently the best AR—and potentially best weapon overall—in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>. An assault rifle usually ends up being the most dominant gun in FPS games. For us, there’s no question it’s the M4A1. It fires well, hits hard, and this best loadout brings out its true potential.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Baker 3.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Standard Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 14.5″ Carbine</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>It’s the MP5, always will be. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>PW5A3</strong>—AKA the MP5, let’s face it—rules the roost where SMGs are concerned. It’s consistently appeared throughout the course of FPS gaming history, and it’s here in Battlefield 6. It outclasses every other SMG up close, and it’s also quite handy at mid-range as well. If you need a gun that rapidly chews through bullets and tears through opponents in smaller maps, look no further than the PW5A3.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Iron Sights</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Compensated Brake</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 245MM Custom</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 40RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Don’t sleep on this. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best <strong>DRS-IAR</strong> loadout is a strange one, as it doesn’t even feel like an LMG in some ways. Our Magazine attachment gives it fewer bullets than our PW5A3 class, for example. But it’s still a powerful gun that can be just as powerful as an AR, and then some. If you’re looking for a different type of weapon, you should consider the DRS-IAR.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> CCO 2.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Double-Port Brake</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 20″ SDM-R</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Alloy Vertical</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> Magwell Flare</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Boom. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you played the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, chances are you were blown away by it, by blown away, I mean blasted in the face repeatedly by the <strong>M87A1</strong> Shotgun. Its dominance and superiority have carried over into the full game, and there’s no question that the M87A1 is the Shotgun to use. It’s a one-shot weapon of mass destruction.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Iron Sights</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 20″ Factory</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Adjustable Angled</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 7 Shell Tube</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Flechette</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>King of Sniper Rifles. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 has a decent amount of medium-to-long-range maps. This allows Sniper Rifles to flourish, and if you fancy your chances as a precision marksman, you need the <strong>M2010 ESR</strong>. It’s flexible as both a quick-firing quickscope rifle, or can dominate at a distance. Our M2010 ESR loadout is the one we feel gets the most out of the weapon, but don’t be afraid to tinker with the slots here. You may want a suppressor, but we do not.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> SSDS 6.00X</li>



<li><strong>Optic Accessory:</strong> Anti-Glare Coating</li>



<li><strong>Left Accessory:</strong> Range Finder</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 26″ Carbon</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 8RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> DLC Bolt</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Match Grade</li>
</ul>



<p>Now’s the time for you to get involved and share your thoughts. Let us know if any of these loadouts worked for you, what else you’d like to see, and you can also check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a> to start your own Battlefield 6 conversations and share your own loadouts!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re a fan of both horror movies as well as old-school cartoon shows, then these Dandy’s World codes may well be worth your time.</p>



<p>Think of a Roblox game where you start in a building known as the Gardenview Center as a cartoon character, with the objective being to survive, while also collecting money to unlock new characters and solving puzzles to fix the broken elevator. Playable in a group of up to 8 players, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-prospecting-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Dandy’s World can be a rather scary experience, with scary monsters known as ‘Twisteds’ hunting the players down in every nook and cranny of the building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dandy’s World is a game where strategy and teamwork are of utmost importance, as various shocking and dark plot twists can happen with each playthrough. Dandy’s World players must also be on the lookout for Tickets and Trinkets, while Ichor is the main in-game currency, used to upgrade characters and their abilities. Although simply playing the game will grant players plenty of Ichor, using codes in Dandy’s World is a good way to boost the amount of currency you can get.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-all-new-dandy-s-world-codes-october-2025">All New Dandy’s World Codes (October 2025)</h2>

<p>Redeeming these free rewards in Dandy’s World is a simple process that doesn’t require too much effort at all. For players who may be new to the Roblox environment, though, here’s a step-by-step guide that should make redeeming the Dandy’s World codes a cakewalk:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Dandy’s World.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Use Code’ option.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on ‘Use’ to instantly receive your rewards.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-dandy-s-world-codes">Where To Get More Dandy’s World Codes</h2>



<p>Although there is only one active code in the game right now, Dandy’s World is a game that’s known to release new codes whenever it achieves a major milestone or launches an update for the title. With this in mind, it’s safe to assume that more are on the horizon, and players simply have to wait patiently to get their hands on more free Dandy’s World rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best way to stay up to date with all the latest codes would be to simply bookmark this page and check back every now and then. We update this article as soon as new codes are dropped by the developers. This can save players from the hassle of having to manually go into the game’s socials and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/blushcrunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> each time to check if new codes have been released.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Electronic Arts Sale Facing Resistance From ‘Concerned’ US Politicians: ‘National Security Risks’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-sale-facing-resistance-us-politicians/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/electronic-arts-sale-facing-resistance-from-%E2%80%98concerned%E2%80%99-us-politicians-%E2%80%98national-security-risks%E2%80%99.1326208/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At the end of September, it was announced that Electronic Arts, one of the largest game publishers in the world, was to be privately acquired by a consortium headed by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund. The investment group also includes Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, founded and run by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law.</p>



<p>In a letter to the United States Secretary of the Treasury, key politicians Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal have voiced ‘profound concern’ about the ‘foreign influence and national security risks’ of the impending acquisition.</p>



<h2 id="h-pushback-was-inevitable-in-the-ea-deal">Pushback Was Inevitable in the EA Deal</h2>



<p>If the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that lawmakers and regulatory bodies will always try to get their two cents heard as these immense acquisitions unravel. The Microsoft purchase of Activision Blizzard King was a great example of that, with the deal being scrutinized and challenged in the courts numerous times.</p>



<p>Electronic Arts is now facing a similar situation, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the consortium’s purchase</a> of the publisher being doubted by US lawmakers.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent email</a> to Scott Bessent, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, it was stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We write with profound concern about the foreign influence and national security risks posed by the potential acquisition of American video game producer Electronic Arts (EA) by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (Silver Lake), and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners.</p>



<p>We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company.</p>



<p>The proposed transaction poses a number of significant foreign influence and national security risks, beginning with the PIF’s reputation as a strategic arm of the Saudi government.</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia’s desire to buy influence through the acquisition of EA is apparent on the face of the transaction—the investors propose to pay more than $10 billion above EA’s trading value for a company whose stock has “stagnated for half a decade” in an unpredictably volatile industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The letter went on to detail the concerns around Saudi Arabia’s attempts to strengthen foreign influence within the United States, suggesting that a data privacy concern will arise from EA having collected the information of ‘millions of users’ over the years. There are also worries from US politicians that the deal will ‘eliminate transparency’ in the company’s operations.</p>



<p>In a final request, the letter asks that the CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) conduct a thorough investigation and review of the privatization of Electronic Arts, feeding back findings by November 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Do you think the United States government is right to be concerned about the Electronic Arts acquisition? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Liam Hemsworth stepped into the boots of Geralt of Rivia some time ago, replacing Henry Cavill, who departed the show because of creative differences with the showrunners. While the masses have voiced their concerns about this switch, Hemsworth has proven willing to give the character all he has, which is the sentiment he professed in a recent interview.</p>



<p>Love or hate the casting, The Witcher returns this month with a penultimate series, and Liam Hemsworth is now the star of the show. In an interview with IGN, he explained how he’s handling all the doubt circulating online.</p>



<h2 id="h-liam-hemsworth-has-given-everything-he-has-to-geralt">Liam Hemsworth Has Given Everything He Has to Geralt</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witchers-final-seasons-liam-hemsworth-and-showrunner-lauren-schmidt-hissrich-on-replacing-henry-cavill-and-crafting-a-really-good-payoff-to-the-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, Liam Hemsworth and Lauren Schmidt Hissrich (showrunner) sat down to talk about the upcoming series of The Witcher, which returns after a two-year hiatus between seasons.</p>



<p>For the last few months, fans of the show have been wrestling with the recasting of Geralt of Rivia, the instantly recognizable lead previously played by Henry Cavill. It was a sour move for many when Cavill departed the show, and plenty of viewers feel that Hemsworth doesn’t embody the character well enough.</p>



<p>Hemsworth disagrees:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was a unique situation, to come into a show that someone else has been doing for a period of time. There was obviously a lot of talk from fans and opinions, and I think that’s great. This show has very passionate fans that care about these characters and care about this world. I appreciate that. I understand it.</p>



<p>I poured everything I had into this character. I wanted it to feel grounded. I wanted it to feel authentic. I really hope the audience enjoys the character and my interpretation of it… I got to work with so many great actors and play this wonderfully complex character that has a huge fan base. And I hope people come along for the ride. I feel very grateful to have had this experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hemworth referenced that he’d played The Witcher games ‘years ago’ and tried to get back into them when playing Geralt of Rivia for the live-action series. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I had just started playing [Geralt] and I was like, ‘I don’t know how many minutes or hours I can spend walking around as this character right now whilst shooting the show at the same time.’ So I had a quick look at it and it reminded me of what I experienced years ago when I played it.</p>



<p>It didn’t feel like it was going to be hugely helpful to my experience at that time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that The Witcher show is based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-book-sapkowski/">on <strong>the books</strong></a><strong> </strong>and not <strong>the games</strong>.</p>



<p>Hissrich, the series’s showrunner, expressed how pleased she is with Hemsworth’s portrayal of Geralt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You need someone who you can imagine can excel at these action scenes, who has such a physical presence that they could be both intimidating in the story, but also, Geralt has a huge emotional side as well… What I really loved about Liam’s work that I had seen is that he was able to organically blend those two things. He didn’t have physical scenes and then emotional scenes. He was able to really carry this specific, I guess I call it soul. </p>



<p>He has a soul that he brings into the role… To have that present even through action scenes when he’s fighting monsters, and it’s the same thing that’s present when he’s having conversations with Ciri or with Yennefer, that was a really special thing that we were able to capture. And when I had watched some of his work, specifically going back to Hunger Games, that’s something that I felt from him.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Witcher season four will be released exclusively on Netflix in its entirety on October 30. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to invest any time in the show.</p>
