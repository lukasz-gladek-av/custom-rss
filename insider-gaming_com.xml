<p>The news <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-sims-re-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirms reports</a> from earlier this week that EA was set to announce the release of both games on Friday.</p>

<p>The games will be available to purchase in three different bundles: The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle, The Sims: Legacy Collection, and The Sims 2: Legacy Collection.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-sims-25th-birthday-bundle-includes">What The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle Includes</h2>

<h2 id="h-your-old-saves-work">Your Old Saves Work</h2>



<p>If you happen to still play The Sims 1/2 or just happen to have an old save file, EA says that players will be able to bring their old saves into the newly released versions of the game. Both titles will also support original mods, but EA did make it clear that they haven’t all been tested to guarantee they work.</p>



<p>“It’ll be up to individual Mod creators to ensure Mods work with the new version,” EA said.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date%E2%80%94release-time-platforms-editions-and-price.1097145/</guid>

<p>2025 is going to be supersized thanks to the presence of a new Monster Hunter game. Capcom is back with Monster Hunter Wilds, and the monster-slaying sequel has a release date, along with information on its platforms, price, and many more mammoth details.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is looking to outdo the enormous success of 2018’s Monster Hunter World. The franchise has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-series-hits-100-million-in-cumulative-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold millions</a> upon millions of copies and has a worldwide fanbase. It might be because it’s Capcom, or possibly because slaying oversized creatures after a minutes-long struggle is exhilarating—and few do it better.</p>



<p>It’s probably safe to say Monster Hunter Wilds is one of 2025’s biggest games, and I wanna dive into the good stuff.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-release-date">Monster Hunter Wilds Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’re a bit big. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds has a February 28 release date.</strong></p>



<p>This means it’s coming into direction competition with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a>, but they’re very different games with unique audiences. <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is one of February 2025’s biggest launches, and its January 28 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> can’t come soon enough!</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-release-time">Monster Hunter Wilds Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>It’s unlikely Monster Hunter Wilds will release simultaneously for everyone, so expect a worldwide midnight launch on release day.</strong></p>



<p>This means New Zealand gets its hands on Monster Hunter first, with America, and other regions, needing to wait a bit longer. The footage and what we’ve seen suggests any extra wait is worth it. Just be sure to <strong>stay off social media for spoilers</strong> as you never know who’s going to leak what details!</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-platforms">Monster Hunter Wilds Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>It’s a full-on current-gen release for Monster Hunter Wilds with PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC launches.</strong></p>



<p>A game with the scale of Monster Hunter Wilds was always going to suggest the PS4 and Xbox One were missing out. It’s sad, given the impact of the two consoles, but they’re quickly becoming outdated and unable to run more modern games with great efficiency. </p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch is also another notable (but expected) omission—but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> could get a port down the line.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-price-amp-editions">Monster Hunter Wilds Price &amp; Editions</h2>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds Standard Edition is £69.99 and £64.99, whereas you’re looking at $89.99 and £79.99 for the Deluxe Edition, and $109.99 and £99.99 for the luxury of the Premium Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>These are the recommended retail prices and digital figures. If you’re buying a physical edition of Monster Hunter Wilds, online and in-store retailers should have offers and various discounts to bring this eye-watering cost done.</p>



<hr>



<p>How much are you looking forward to hacking and slashing away at monsters? Is there any realm where Capcom fails to deliver on the enormous expectations and hype?</p>



<p>If you can’t wait for Monster Hunter Wilds, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-how-to-join-dates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta</a> might be something you need to check out and get involved with.</p>

<p>A former Midnight Society dev recently revealed that the Studio and devs discovered that Dr Disrespect was being fired at the same time as the world did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HUN2R’s recent post on <a href="https://x.com/HUN2R/status/1885346960766378441" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) sheds some light on conversations between Midnight Society’s Director of Technical Product, Rich Cabrera, and the fans. After the news about the studio shutting down was confirmed, multiple members of the community asked why they let Dr. Disrespect go. Cabrera answered that the decision was not in the hands of the “studio and devs” and that the “leadership” made it. They found out at the same time that we did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same thread, Cabrera was also asked why the Studio didn’t release an NFT token, which might have saved them from closing down. Cabrera confirmed they were working on a Token and conversing with a launch platform. However, the shutdown came too soon, leaving them no time to execute this plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those unaware, Midnight Society recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/midnight-society-has-announced-its-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it is cancelling its NFT-backed extraction shooter, DEADROP. Hence, it is seeking other gaming studios to offer employment opportunities to its talented team members. Dr Disrespect founded the development studio; however, the allegations surrounding the streamer last year led to Midnight Society cutting ties with him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Dr. Disrespect is streaming for Rumble and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-run-rumble-head-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping them run the platform</a>. Here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his side of the story</a> on last year’s allegations. What do you think about Midnight Society’s devs being as unaware as we are of Dr. Disrespect’s decision?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Shang Chi actor reveals that his dream has been to bring Sleeping Dogs to the big screen and then a sequel that players have been hoping for for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>zengames44 recently tagged Simu Liu on <a href="https://x.com/zengames44/status/1884321313923424362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, asking if he’s working behind the scenes to bring one of the fan-favourite games to the movies. To everyone’s surprise, Simu Liu replied to the post, stating that he is already “Working with the rights holders to bring Sleeping Dogs to the big screen.” However, fans are a bit confused, as it was shared during a recent interview that the Sleeping Dogs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-movie-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movie is dead</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, in a <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1885252869483340236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent post</a>, Simu Liu doubled down on his plans with Sleeping Dogs, discussing his dreams for the franchise. Liu shared that only some movies can make it from the “pitch phase to greenlight” and that “it has been tiring” pitching the film to executives who do not understand the game. However, his dream remains: “First a movie, then a sequel game for everyone.”</p>



<p>“Sleeping Dogs,” released in 2012, was developed by United Front Games and published by Square Enix. Fans quickly fell in love with the game’s open-world setting, which allows players to explore a vibrant and bustling city set in Hong Kong. The combat and parkour mechanics are well-designed and intuitive, enhancing the overall experience. Additionally, the story centred around the Triads, the impressive visuals for a game from 2012, and the high-quality soundtrack were all standout features.</p>
