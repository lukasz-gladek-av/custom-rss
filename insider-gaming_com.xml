<p>A first look at classic Mortal Kombat characters in the upcoming movie has been revealed. In a new exclusive from Entertainment Weekly, Warner Bros. Pictures has released the first look at Johnny Cage, Kitana, and Shao Kahn in Mortal Kombat 2.</p>



<p>Johnny Cage will be played by Karl Urban from The Boys. Resident Evil star Adeline Rudolph plays Kitana while House of David actor Martyn Ford is Shao Kahn.</p>



<p>You can check out the new characters below (click to enlarge).</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat 2 is the follow up to 2021’s Mortal Kombat. After the first move followed Shang Tsung’s goal of killing Earth’s fighters before the tournament began, the sequel is where the tournament happens. Earth is at risk of losing its 10th-straight tournament. Should that happen, Shao Kahn will invade the planet and take over.</p>



<p>In addition to the tournament itself, franchise co-creator Ed Boon says that the battle between Scorpion and Sub-Zero isn’t finished.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-meet-the-creator-behind-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-creator-of-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meet The Creator Behind Call of Duty Skill-Based Matchmaking—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>“He’s certainly making appearances that are significant and necessary for the progress of other storylines,” Boon told <a href="https://ew.com/mortal-kombat-2-first-look-karl-urban-johnny-cage-kitana-shao-kahn-exclusive-11696968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>. “He plays a different role. He’s not part of the ‘Super Friends’ trying to defeat Shao Kahn, but his appearance is key and it is very essential for certain parts.”</p>



<p>And though they’ve given fans a look at three new characters coming in Mortal Kombat 2, they aren’t the only ones that will find themselves on the big screen. Jade and Queen Sindel will also play a role in the movie along with “other” characters that haven’t been announced yet.</p>



<p>Mortal Kombat 2 is scheduled to release in theaters on October 24.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-next-metro-game-darker-ukraine/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-metro-game-has-been-made-%E2%80%98even-darker%E2%80%99-since-the-invasion-of-ukraine.1136709/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-next-metro-game-darker-ukraine/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Not much is known about the next Metro game, aside from the fact that it exists and in 2023, it was in a playable state. That was what we exclusively reported on, with our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metro-exodus-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Henderson learning</a> that the sequel to 2019’s Metro Exodus was well along the path of development.</p>



<p>In a recent blog post celebrating 15 years of Metro games, 4A Games reflected on the last decade-and-a-half, talking at length about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It was stressed that, as the developers live through the situation that is ever unfolding, the story for the next Metro game has become ‘even darker’ to reflect what’s happening.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dark-becomes-darker">Dark Becomes Darker</h2>



<p>The Metro titles, which are based on a book series of the same name from Dmitry Glukhovsky, a Russian author, have been on the market since 2010. The series kicked off with Metro 2033, then Metro Last Light was released in 2013. After a lengthier pause, Metro Exodus dropped in 2019, and in 2024, a VR title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metro-awakening-review-meta-quest-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metro Awakening</a>, was also released.</p>



<p>Fans are eagerly awaiting the next instalment of this epic post-apocalyptic franchise, which many have dubbed ‘Fallout in Russia’ over the years. Metro might be set amidst a nuclear apocalypse, but it’s infinitely more morbid and stricken with horror influences than Bethesda Game Studios’ end-of-the-world series.</p>



<p>In a blog post <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/3/16/metro-15th-anniversary-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paying tribute to 15 years of Metro</a>, the 4A Games team revealed how the franchise will become even darker when the next game hits the market:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As we said in our last studio update, in 2022 a full-scale russian invasion changed how we wanted to tell the story of the next Metro game. As art became life for many of our developers in Ukraine, we drew from that lived experience <strong>to create an even darker story</strong>, those themes already present in Metro becoming ever-more apparent and important. </p>



<p>As conflict, the struggle for power, the horrors of tyranny, and the price of freedom have become part of our lives over the past 3+ years, we are still living and working during this wartime, and that inevitably shapes the games we make.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The next project is being created hand-in-hand with Dmitry Glukhovsky, the creator of Metro and currently a target of Russian law enforcement. The outspoken activist has been sentenced to jail for his opposition to the war in Ukraine. The team at 4A Games poured out their sentiments about Glukhovsky in the post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dmitry has always spoken out against the war in Ukraine from the start – a courageous decision for any Russian, that has seen him sentenced to jail (in absentia) – and we are proud to have him as a friend and co-creator as we tell this next, and never more relevant chapter of Metro together.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>No release window has been established for the next Metro title, and presently, we don’t have a clue what it’ll look like. As a fan of the franchise since day one, I’m certainly excited to see what comes next.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation has revealed the full suite of esports organisations joining forces with the brand for the 2025 Club Partners circuit. It was pointed out that bringing these organisations together to represent the $20 million ecosystem ‘unites 300 million esports fans’.</p>



<p>Out of 200 applications received, 40 esports organisations were granted access to the Club Partner Program, which can reward teams with grants of up to $1 million to expand their brand.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-the-world-go-around">Making The World Go Around</h2>



<p>The Saudi Arabian Esports World Cup Foundation continues to shower the industry with cash, standing up another iteration of the Club Partner Program in 2025.

<p>Here’s the full list of teams in the Esports World Cup Club Partner Program in 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>100 Thieves</li>



<li>All Gamers</li>



<li>Bilibili Gaming</li>



<li>Edward Gaming</li>



<li>Cloud9</li>



<li>EVOS</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Fnatic</li>



<li>Furia</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Gaimin Gladiators</li>



<li>Gen.G</li>



<li>Gentle Mates</li>

</ul>



<p>The list represents the best of the best where the esports industry is concerned. There are some notable teams missing from the roster, though – but not every organisation could make the cut. </p>



<p>Eight of the teams in this year’s Club Partners Program ‘qualified’ by succeeding at last year’s Esports World Cup in the Club Championship tournament. Team Falcons <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-falcons-esports-world-cup-club-championship/">claimed the top spot</a>, but the likes of Liquid, BDS, and Vitality all came in close behind the Saudi organisation.</p>



<p>Is there an esports organisation you’d like to see inducted into the Club Partners Program in the future? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 0.16.2.0 patch has been released, introducing a slew of upgrades and improvements to the game’s AI across both PvP and PvE platforms. This upgrade was touted by Battlestate Games a couple of weeks ago following the publication of results from an in-game survey.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, patch 0.16.2.0 also boosts Boss spawn chances and heightens the chances of running into Cultists in both PvE and PvP. Those who were struggling with Partisan appearing in too many PvE raids (like myself) can rest easy – his spawn rate has been dropped globally with this patch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ai-evolution">AI Evolution</h2>



<p>The 0.16.2.0 patch in Escape from Tarkov brings a wide variety of changes to AI enemies, including Scavs, Rogues, Raiders, and Bosses:</p>



<ul>
<li>All Sniper Scavs and regular Scavs of any difficulty now have 30 head HP</li>



<li>Increased the chance for AI PMCs to perceive an AI Scav as hostile to 80%. Other chances of faction relationships remain the same in all locations</li>



<li>Bots now turn their head towards the presumed target to obtain better visual</li>



<li>The detection speed for Hard difficulty bots is now equal to that of Normal difficulty bots</li>



<li>Adjusted the detection speed settings for AI PMCs. Now, they detect enemies 20% faster than regular bots</li>



<li>AI PMCs now also switch to single fire at long ranges. At close ranges, they will switch to full auto if possible</li>



<li>Regular bots no longer take cover in vegetation</li>



<li>Bots can no longer see through vegetation unless an enemy is very close to them</li>



<li>Bot vision is reduced if they are inside the vegetation</li>



<li>Increased the current and maximum durability of all AI PMC weapons</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at Battlestate Games has also adjusted a few <strong>Player Scav </strong>mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adjusted the spawn time for Player Scavs: they now spawn no earlier than 17 minutes after the start of the raid on most of the locations, excluding Factory, Reserve, and low-level Ground Zero</li>



<li>Increased the chance of spawning with better Scav equipment if the player has a high standing with Fence<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Further optimisations were made to the game’s overall stability, with special attention being paid to the new iteration of Customs. In-raid memory consumption has been adjusted on all maps, and shadow quality settings have been tweaked to consider low-end PCs.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has also delivered a slew of bug fixes with the 0.16.2.0 patch, adjusting some of the most common concerns like bots teleporting through doors and rewards going missing from Cultist Circle redemptions.</p>
