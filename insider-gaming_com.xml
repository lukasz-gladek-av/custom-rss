<p>REPO is an online-only game, meaning the age-old issue of server issues comes up. Servers are a constant factor and it doesn’t matter if it’s a AAA title or a low-budget indie hit. If you’re experiencing connection issues with REPO’s server status, let’s see if there’s a reason why.</p>



<p>It’s incredible how a title can become a hit so quickly. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-players-can-play-repo-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> launched in February 2025 and amassed a healthy following of a few thousand players. This is a feat many indie developers would kill for. REPO cleared 100,000 concurrent players within two weeks, and its peak reached nearly 150K very quickly.</p>



<p>This is great news for developer semiwork, but it also places a lot of strain on the servers. If you’re being impeded by said servers, let’s try to clear up why it’s happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-repo-servers-down-right-now">Are REPO Servers Down Right Now?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nothing suspicious here. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>REPO is currently operational for many players right now.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, I’ve been on various Twitch channels, and streamers are broadcasting live gameplay from REPO. However, if you are having trouble, it might be connected to the <strong>North American servers</strong>.</p>



<p>User <a href="https://discord.com/channels/303947656789622787/303947656789622787/1348850542553595965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pinny on the REPO Discord server</a> had this to say about the server issues: “If you are getting large connection issues, <strong>please check for Steam client updates which should hopefully update Steam</strong> and help make playing with friends possible again make sure both you and your friends have done this!”</p>



<p>They continue to say you should “Try taking turns hosting between you and your group” as “<strong>NA servers are especially affected at the moment</strong> so if you have friends living elsewhere, try having them host!”</p>



<p>It’s not necessarily the overall servers then, but individual aspects of the connection. My advice would be to try Pinny’s recommendations and see if this alleviates any issues for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-repo-server-status">How to Check REPO Server Status</h2>



<p><strong>Joining the official REPO Discord server and checking socials and the website are the best ways to keep up with the latest server status developments.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll find EA and Activision have dedicated websites showing live server reports. This isn’t as feasible for lesser-known companies, so I recommend safe sources related to the developer.</p>



<p>You can find each method below with accessible links:</p>

<p>Asus has announced its new lineup of monitors with a special ability to purify surrounding air. The lineup of new VU Air Ionizer monitors features three models: the 23.8-inch IPS panel Asus VU249HFI-W, the 27-inch IPS Asus VU279HFI-W, and the 34-inch VA Asus VU34WCIP-W.</p>



<p>These monitors feature a no-filter VU Air Ionizer that Asus says can “remove up to 90% of airborne dust in three hours” to remove various allergens and improve general indoor air quality. </p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Future Of Call of Duty—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>“The ionizer has an effective coverage area of 1m³,&nbsp;purifying&nbsp;air throughout&nbsp;a&nbsp;workspace for comfortable productivity,” <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-vu-air-ionizer-monitors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Asus said</a>. “With no filters&nbsp;required, ASUS VU Air Ionizer series&nbsp;monitors&nbsp;seamlessly combine air purification and&nbsp;cutting-edge&nbsp;display technologies in one streamlined design.”</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Monitor</th><th>Size and Ratio</th><th>Resolution</th><th>Refresh Rate</th><th>Panel Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Asus VU249HFI-W</td><td>23.8-inch/16:9</td><td>1920×1080</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>IPS</td></tr><tr><td>Asus VU279HFI-W</td><td>27-inch/16:9</td><td>1920×1080</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>IPS</td></tr><tr><td>Asus VU34WCIP-W</td><td>34-inch/21:9</td><td>3440×1440</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>Vertical Alignment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As far as specs are concerned, each monitor—no matter the size—has a 100Hz refresh rate with a 1ms response time. Both the 23.8- and 27-inch displays have an IPS (In-Plane Switching) panel with 178° viewing angles. The 34-inch monitor is a 21:9 ultrawide VA (Vertical Alignment) panel with the same 178° viewing angles. The two 16:9 displays have a brightness of 250 nits while the 21:9 Ultrawide has a brightness of 300 nits. </p>



<p>For pricing, the 23.8-inch starts at $129.99 while the 27-inch display will cost $159.99. If you decide you want the Ultrawide air purifier, it will cost $359.99.</p>
