<p>Finding a good gift for the gamer in your life when you’re working with a tight budget can feel tougher than it probably should. After all, prices keep going up and money feels tighter for many. But not every present needs to cost you a fortune. That’s why Insider Gaming has put together a list of genuinely fun, useful gifts that still feel thoughtful and worth unwrapping. The best part, these gaming gifts are all on the cheap side at less than $25. </p>



<p>Whether you’re shopping for a friend, a family member, or just treating yourself, these picks prove you don’t need to overspend to give something great. When it comes to gifting, sometimes the smaller items end up being the ones people appreciate the most. A clever phone stand, a handy charging dock, or even a retro-themed game or controller can upgrade someone’s setup without hitting your wallet hard. And for those who love gaming culture as much as playing the games, books, card games, and novelty items can be just as meaningful as any big-ticket tech.</p>



<p>Below, you’ll find a mix gifts that stay under that $25 ceiling, making it easier to stick to a budget while still giving something they’ll actually use. Let’s take a look at the best cheap gaming gifts for 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-gaming-gifts-under-25">Best Gaming Gifts Under $25</h2>



<p><strong>1985 Games Mystery Dice</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to get a new set of dice for your Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaigns or other table-top nights? This mystery dice set takes the decision of what dice to use out of your hand and gives you a random set of seven. This adds a little extra excitement before your next game night. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>FYOUNG Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 Controller Charging Dock</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Charging wireless controllers can be frustrating, especially if you forget to plug them in after use. For those with the Nintendo Switch, you can only charge the ones on your console usually, leaving your extras without the juice. This charging dock keeps up to four Joy-Cons charged and works with both Switch 1 <em>and </em>Switch 2 controllers.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>AZURAOKEY Carrying Case</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X are expensive pieces of equipment. So, why not protect the investment with a carrying cat that also comes with compartments for your chargers, memory cards, and other small accessories?</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>SOUNDANCE Laptop Stand</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Not much you can say about a laptop stand. It opens up room on your desk while bringing the display up higher for your eyes. The stand supports laptops ranging from 12-17.3 inches.</p>











<hr>



<p><strong>Press Reset by Jason Schrier</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>From Jason Schreier himself:</p>



<p><strong>“The business of videogames is both a prestige industry and an opaque one. Based on dozens of first-hand interviews that cover the development of landmark games—Bioshock Infinite, Epic Mickey, Dead Space, and more—on to the shocking closures of the studios that made them,&nbsp;Press Reset&nbsp;tells the stories of how real people are affected by game studio shutdowns, and how they recover, move on, or escape the industry entirely.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>8Bitdo M30 Bluetooth Controller</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want a cheap way to play classic Sega Games, or any game for that matter? This M30 Bluetooth Controller is designed to mimic the classic six-button Sega Genesis controller. It works on your Nintendo Switch or Switch 2, Windows PCs, and even mobile devices.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>8BitDo Wireless USB Adapter 2</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to guarantee you can hook up any Bluetooth controller to any device? This wireless USB adapter allows you connect your controllers to your Switch 2, Switch, PC, Steam Deck, and more. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If the person you’re buying for still likes to play on their PlayStation (PS1) or PlayStation 2 (PS2), why not give them the gift of wireless control. The 8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver allows you to use your Xbox, PS4, PS5, Wii U Pro and Switch Pro controllers wirelessly with the PS1 or PS2. Imagine just sitting on your couch that’s more than 10 feet from your TV?</p>











<hr>



<p><strong>UNO: The Legend of Zelda Card Game&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>UNO? Great game. The Legend of Zelda? Great franchise. So, why not combine them with a special version of UNO that features the artwork of The Legend of Zelda. There’s even a special Triforce Card that forces the next player to draw an addition three cards. Get it? Triforce? Three Cards? </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>JSAUX Docking Station</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Ally X, Steam Deck, Legion Go, and other handheld gaming PCs are all great devices, but sometimes you don’t want to play on the small screen. This docking station—which is actively in use by Senior Editor Mike Straw—allows you to not only hook your handheld to a larger display with HDMI 2.1, but also connect two USB-A devices, an ethernet cable, and a 100W USB-C charging port for your handheld to stay powered during use.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Banjo-Kazooie Mobile Phone &amp; Controller Holder</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>An 8.5″ figure made from PVC, this Banjo-Kazooie holder is the perfect place to set your phone, controller, or other small devices when not in use. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>The Oregon Trail Card Game</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have a millennial you’re shopping for, why not give them the gift of dysentery and let them relive their youth. Supporting 2-6 players with 8-bit art, The Oregon Trail Card Game has you try to stay alive from Independence, Missouri to the Willamette Valley. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Your shoes are now an Xbox. A new collaboration between Xbox and footwear brand Crocs has been announced, and it’s one for the 2000s kids. </p>







<p>With the 20th anniversary of the Xbox 360, Microsoft has been a bit quiet in terms of celebration. Over the weekend, many outlets, like Insider Gaming, did lists on the console, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/favorite-xbox-360-games-ever/">the staff’s favorite titles</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-selling-xbox-360-games-all-time/">best-selling</a>. However, it seems the company has had one foot in the door the whole time. Luckily, that foot looks rather stylish with the new designs in its collaboration with Crocs.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-crocs-available-november-25th-cost-80">Xbox Crocs Available November 25th, Cost $80</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced today, Crocs and Xbox are collaborating on a <a href="https://houseofheat.co/crocs/xbox-crocs-classic-clog-211439-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">special edition pair of Crocs shoes</a>. The pair will don the Xbox logo and made to look like an Xbox controller, complete with buttons and joysticks. So, basically, your feet can look like controllers. Who doesn’t want that? The collaboration is starting sales on November 25th and will cost $80. If the controller Crocs are too expensive, you can get limited-edition Xbox Jibbitz, which include designs from Fallout, Halo, and League of Legends, to name a few. Those cost around $20 and also launch on November 25th. You can find the link for purchasing <a href="https://www.crocs.com/p/xbox-classic-clog/211439.html?cgid=standard-exclusion-list&amp;cid=001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p>In the world of collaborations, it’s not a surprise to see Xbox going outside of the box. A while ago, Xbox made an Xbox Series X Mini Fridge, as the console looked like one. While not connected much, the statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/david-jaffe-god-of-war-creator-xbox-grave-joke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘This is an Xbox’</a> does feel apt for this. The company’s desire to be just about everywhere is certainly working, with exclusives like Halo going to PlayStation and future titles going multiplatform. Soon, you won’t be able to outrun an Xbox; you’ll just wear them on your feet.</p>







<p>What do you think of the Xbox Crocs? Going to get a pair? Just buying the Jibbitz? Any other out-there collaborations Microsoft should do? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty fans are getting an early treat in Black Ops 7 Multiplayer with Season 1, as eight new modes are coming to the game—six of which will remain permanently available.</p>



<p>Season 1 in Black Ops 7, kicking off on December 4, brings a host of new additions to the title, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-is-getting-six-new-multiplayer-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">variety of maps</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombies-gets-new-maps-enemies-more-in-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new maps for Zombies</a>, and players in Multiplayer will be spoiled for choice on the game modes to enjoy.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-gets-6-new-modes-2-ltms">Black Ops 7 Gets 6 New Modes, 2 LTMs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Break your bones. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-01#Modes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty blog</a>, Black Ops 7 will see the addition of eight new Multiplayer modes, two of which are limited-time only and will form a part of the CODMAS event.</p>



<p>The permanent game modes being added include Prop Hunt, Gun Game, One in the Chamber, and Sticks and Stones, along with a new mode, Takeover, where players fight over three neutral territories and earn points for each zone they control. Once all three zones are captured, a short cooldown takes place before they move to new locations—effectively making it a mix of Domination and Headquarters.</p>



<p>During the season, two limited-time modes are coming as part of CODMAS festivities. Holiday Havoc is a “festive moshpit combiting your favourite modes with holiday cheer,” where players can earn bonuses like Quick Regen, Spring Speed, and Movement Speed for eliminating enemies.</p>



<p>Snowfight is the other LTM featuring in-season, which, as the name suggests, sees players throw snowballs at each other to eliminate them, with no respawns. </p>



<p>Season 1 in Multiplayer also brings additional loadout content in the form of the Deadeye Drone, available as a Weekly Challenge Reward during the season for completing weekly objectives.</p>

<p>Season 1 is on the horizon in Black Ops 7, and the first season in the latest Call of Duty title is bringing a host of new content across all game modes, including Zombies.</p>



<p>Zombies in Black Ops 7 launched with two maps, the larger, story-based Ashes of the Damned map, with a smaller segment of the map, Vandorn Farm, used for the Survival mode, and the tally of maps is set to more than double in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>—along with the addition of new enemies and the return of content from other Black Ops titles.</p>

<figure><figcaption>New map. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>



<p>As revealed in the latest blog post ahead of Season 1, which kicks off on December 4, Astra Malorum is the next story map in Zombies where players explore “an evil presence festering in the Dark Aether.”</p>



<p>The map features a new enemy, the O.S.C.A.R Elite Robot, a new Wonder Weapon, the LGM-1, and new traps, alongside the story quest and easter eggs to uncover.</p>



<p>For players grinding through Camo challenges and wanting a change of scenery from Vandorm Farm, Season 1 provides exactly that with Exit 115, another location from the larger Ashes of the Damned map, available in Survival from launch, with the Zorya Observatory following in mid-season.</p>



<p>Alongside the new maps, a slew of new and returning Ammo Mods will become available, including Light Mind and Shatter Blast, Field Upgrades, including Tesla Storm and Frost Blast, and the return of the fan-favorite Perk Mule Kick—all of which have their own Research to complete.</p>



<p>Zombies will also support the addition of seven new weapons, with some available at the start and others arriving mid-season, 11 new Weapon Attachments, while Directed Mode for the Ashes of the Damned story quest will also be available, guiding players through the necessary steps for completion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Attack on Titan crossover is live with title update 1.1.6; however, the quest is only available for a limited time, until December 22, 2025. </p>



<p>The details about Assassin’s Creed Shadows have been less lately, with AC Mirage taking up the news in recent days. We recently learned the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossed 10 million players</a> thanks to the arrival of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-dlc-patch-notes-new-free-content-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valley of Memory DLC</a>. Now, we are receiving new content for AC Shadows as well, with popular manga and anime series Attack on Titan making its way into the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-attack-on-titan-crossover-will-add-new-skins-for-yasuke-and-naoe">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows’ Attack on Titan Crossover Will Add New Skins for Yasuke and Naoe</h2>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Attack on Titan crossover goes live on November 25 and will run until December 22. During this time, players can take part in a limited-time quest where they face a mysterious, power-hungry faction that has infiltrated feudal Japan and kidnapped a Titan Shifter. There’s a lone survivor with a dark secret who fails to rescue the Shifter and then recruits Naoe and Yasuke to help them out. </p>



<p>To unlock the AOT quest in AC Shadows, players will have to first unlock Yasuke as a playable character and then head to the Yamashiro region, North of Hanazo Tower. While playing the quest, players will unlock new banners and a statue for their hideout and will acquire a crystal katana for Naoe once completed. </p>



<p>Along with the quest, AC Shadows will also receive the Attack on Titan Dual Pack, which is inspired by the series’ universe. This pack includes new outfits, weapons, trinkets, and a new mount. Some of what we saw in the trailer showed Naoe wearing Mikasa Ackerman’s iconic costume, and Yasuke wearing a titan-themed armour. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-third-story-drop-a-puzzlement">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Third Story Drop: A Puzzlement</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows title update 1.1.6 introduces the game’s third story drop, along with the Attack on Titan crossover. The new quest is called “A Puzzlement”, and it has been described as fun and humorous. It will feature Yasuke and Naoe engaging with two old acquaintances who are having a loud argument about a mysterious door in South Wakasa, and they have tasked the duo with figuring out how to open it. </p>



<p>The quest will have Yasuke and Naoe learning each other’s skills as well. Naoe will learn to perform her own spectacular version of Yasuke’s war-kick ability. Yasuke will learn to stealthily dispatch enemies non-lethally. Players will also finally be able to settle the debate as to who would win in a straight-up duel between our two protagonists. </p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-title-update-1-1-6-patch-notes">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.1.6 Patch Notes</h2>

<p>The Rockstar Games employee dismissals have dominated gaming headlines for several weeks. Now, a new report has revealed the Discord messages that are believed to have led to the termination of 34 Rockstar Games workers.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reported back in October about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Workers allegedly being fired to prevent union forming.</a> Since then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games has claimed that the fired employees were leaking information</a>. There have been protests since, and the company has since been hit with legal action over the firings.</p>



<p>But now, a new development has seemingly uncovered the actual Discord messages at the root of everything.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-games-allegedly-accessed-union-discord-server">Rockstar Games Allegedly Accessed Union Discord Server</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A dark period for Rockstar. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleMakeGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People Make Games</a> released an eye-opening video on November 24 titled: “The Messages Rockstar Saw Before Firing 34 Union Members.”</p>



<p>The reporter claims that they have “since spoken to a Rockstar insider, who has shared screenshots with People Make Games of what they believe to be the messages sent just a few weeks ago on that Discord server, which directly contributed to the firings of these 34 former employees. We also know how Rockstar got hold of these messages as well.”</p>

<p>According to People Make Games, the source is “not one of the fired workers” and isn’t even part of the union. The Discord server has apparently been around since 2022 and consisted of various Rockstar employees.</p>







<p>The reporter’s source claims that “They couldn’t recall a single example of any confidential game details being shared.” It’s said that the beginning of October 2025 saw Rockstar Games revise its policies pertaining to the company Slack—a messaging platform usually used by workplaces.</p>



<p>Various non-essential chats were removed, with the company claiming them to be a “distraction” and a source of “poor conduct”. </p>

<p>This “Slack purge” did not go down well. The union Discord server discussed these changes, with one individual saying: “I would really like to see the evidence for them being too much of a productivity hit. I can’t imagine it being worth the absolute dumpsterfire this will be for morale.”</p>



<p>It’s alleged that Rockstar’s Slack revision email was sent out after 5 PM—and employees can’t check their emails outside of work—and a second email about guidelines and conduct was also pushed. The emails were shared by people still in the office on Discord to inform other colleagues who hadn’t seen them yet.</p>

<p>“This led to one member of the Discord approaching studio management to express concerns about the discussions taking place,” the report adds. Additionally, “I’m told this either contributed to or kicked off an investigation into the Discord by the company, which does line up with the timings we now understand.”</p>



<p>The report claims it’s likely Rockstar did manage to access the union Discord server. Soon after, the whole world learned of the firings, with Rockstar presumably identifying individuals in the union chat who had broken guidelines, weren’t adhering to policy, and potentially attributed this to leaks.</p>



<p>This is one of the messages deemed to be a factor in Rockstar’s actions.</p>
