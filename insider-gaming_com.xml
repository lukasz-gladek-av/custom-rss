<p>During this event, players might learn more about the upcoming console’s capabilities and what new games will be playable on it. The Nintendo Switch 2 release date, pricing and availability should also be revealed on this date, considering the console is set to release in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several details about the new console were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed today</a> ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. However, most of them were leaked before the official reveal, and players are happy to see them confirmed.

<p>The day has finally come as Nintendo has officially announced the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, the worst kept secret in video games.</p>



<p>In a short <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">two-minute video</a> online (watch below), Nintendo confirmed the full design of the upcoming console. Confirming the look <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-dbrand-give-players-another-look-at-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that’s been leaked</a> in recent months. The console comes in black and will feature a more rounded look, a newly designed kickstand with a wider tilt, a new-look dock, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and more. With the Joy-Cons also being black, the red and blue color of the original appear under the thumbsticks.</p>



<p>There’s also the new button on the right Joy-Con, but its purpose wasn’t confirmed during the reveal video.</p>

<p>As far as games go, the teaser only showed what appears to be a new Mario Kart game running on the console. More information about the console and (likely) its games will be shown during a <strong>Nintendo Direct event on April 2</strong>. One thing confirmed during the reveal is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not only play digital</a> Nintendo Switch games, but it will also play physical Switch 1 games. </p>



<p>That said, the company did state that “certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.” More information on that will come “at a later date”.</p>



<p>Lastly, it was revealed that Nintendo will be holding special “Nintendo Switch 2 Experience” events in April in three United States cities: New York City from April 4-6, Los Angeles from April 11-13, and Dallas from April 25-27.</p>



<p>You can check out the video below.</p>
