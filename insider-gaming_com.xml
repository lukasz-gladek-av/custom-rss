<p>A new indie studio formed from former ZeniMax employees, with leads from Elder Scrolls Online and Project Blackbird, has been revealed. </p>



<p>Zenimax Online Studios, formed in 2007, had a massive following thanks, in part, to The Elder Scrolls Online. The MMORPG has continued to bring in new players daily, selling almost $2 billion in sales since 2014. Unfortunately, due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-zenimax-online-mmorpg-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Microsoft layoffs</a>, over 300 employees from the company were let go. This includes some who worked on a yet-to-be-revealed new IP called Project Blackbird, which Xbox cancelled. However, it seems some of the laid-off crew have come together to form a new, employee-owned indie studio.</p>



<h2 id="h-sackbird-studios-officially-announced-run-by-former-zenimax-online-leads">Sackbird Studios Officially Announced, Run by Former ZeniMax Online Leads</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello, World. üëã<br>Today we‚Äôre proud to announce Sackbird Studios ‚Äî an independent game studio based in Baltimore, Maryland, built by friends who‚Äôve spent years designing worlds, systems, and stories for players everywhere.<a href="https://t.co/1jmlgteUM2">https://t.co/1jmlgteUM2</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/indiedev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#indiedev</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/videogames?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#videogames</a></p>‚Äî sackbirdstudios (@sackbirdstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/sackbirdstudios/status/1975945947017564556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/news/studio-takes-flight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the new studio‚Äôs blog</a>, former leads at ZeniMax Online Studios have formed Sackbird Studios. The crew consists of 10 former employees of the Bethesda-owned studio. Many of them worked on The Elder Scrolls Online and the cancelled Project Blackbird. Furthermore, it is entirely employee-owned and has already been funded for multiple years. In a statement, Sackbird Studios COO David Worley said,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAfter years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets,‚Äù states Worley. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another statement, this time from CEO Lee Ridout, states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people,‚Äù said Ridout. ‚ÄúWhen I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft‚Äîand our team‚Äîwas to create a studio where creative independence isn‚Äôt negotiable.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the moment, the team is not ready to share its first title, but promises that it will launch on PC and consoles. While the team is grateful for the time they spent at ZeniMax Online Studios, it seems they aren‚Äôt pulling any stops to ensure its work gets out of the door. It‚Äôll be excited to see what Sackbird Studios creates, especially if it takes from the cancelled Project Blackbird.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A Universal Time is an action-adventure game within <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-roblox-safe-for-kids-truth-parental-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>, boasting core RPG elements and a world that‚Äôs been heavily inspired by Jojo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure and other similar anime stories. A Universal Time requires players to explore a large world and gain powers along the way. Alongside their exploration of the map, they will be required to take on various opponents, including NPCs as well as real players. Although the biggest inspiration for A Universal Time is Jojo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure, with the game including many of the anime‚Äôs ‚ÄòStands‚Äô, it also showcases characters from other popular anime, including Dragon Ball, One Piece, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will have to progress through the game to get stronger and unlock more powerful moves, and for newer players to the game, that can be a daunting task. With both PvP and PvE fights involved, getting ahead of the competition fast is of utmost importance, and using codes is a good way to make some quick progress. A Universal Time codes give players various rewards in the game, including Skin Chests, UCoins, UShards, and more, all of which will come in handy to the average player.</p>
