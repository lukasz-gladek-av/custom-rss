<p>It has been claimed by reputable insiders on social media that in December, Fortnite OG will return <strong>permanently</strong>. It’s expected that this will be announced during the upcoming Final event or The Game Awards in the first week of December. It gets better, though – it has also been suggested that every Chapter One season will return on a month-by-month rotation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-back-to-og">Going Back to OG</h2>



<p>Fortnite returned to OG a year ago and it was the most popular move Epic Games has ever made. In an instant, tens of millions of players poured into the game across all platforms, and records were broken worldwide. It was such a success that other developers have since leant on the idea of bringing back an original map as fan service.</p>



<p>Most recently, it was revealed that Apex Legends will be taking players back to their original map.</p>



<p>On social media, HYPEX and ShiinaBR, two reputable Fortnite leakers, corroborated claims that Fortnite OG is returning in December, but this time, it’ll be here to stay.</p>



<p>Per the claims:</p>



<ul>
<li>All Chapter One seasons (1 – 10) will return, with each one lasting a month</li>



<li>Only OG loot will be available and the map will support both Build and Zero Build</li>
</ul>



<p>This could be huge – but will it have the draw that OG Fortnite had last year when it was reintroduced for the first time? It’s possible. </p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that Epic is partnering with footwear brands like Jordans to produce new, in-game cosmetics called Kicks. Also, several hip-hop artists including Eminem and Snoop Dogg were added to the game as playable skins and boss characters.</p>

<p>Activision has revealed that as the game passes its fifth anniversary, Call of Duty Mobile has surpassed <strong>one billion downloads</strong>, since 2019. This staggering figure makes Call of Duty Mobile the best-selling COD game ever, and it’s almost guaranteed that it’ll never be topped as long as we all live.</p>



<p>On November 6, the game’s tenth season went live, and hundreds of millions of players set about exploring another battle pass, new weapons, maps, modes, and more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-best-selling-call-of-duty-game-ever-made">The Best-Selling Call of Duty Game Ever Made</h2>



<p>COD Mobile is the most accessible and universally appreciated Call of Duty game ever. It has a huge esports market and competitive ecosystem, and in some areas of the world, it’s the number-one Call of Duty game, even with the traditional premium releases coming around once a year.</p>



<p>In 2019, COD Mobile was released, and today, the developers are still adding more maps, modes, and operators, allowing players to earn COD points and unlock more to flesh out their free profile. While we’re on the topic, you can check out our guide to unlock <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-cod-mobile-points/">free COD Points</a> in COD Mobile.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-mobile-season-10-fifth-anniversary-celebration-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post</a>, the Activision team made a small announcement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Happy 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>&nbsp;players! Thanks to you,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>&nbsp;has now reached over *ONE BILLION downloads worldwide since its launch in 2019*.</p>



<p>Join the celebration when Season 10 — 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary launches November 6 at 5 PM PT.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s short and sweet, but it’s super impactful. Few mobile games are as universally beloved as COD Mobile, which is represented quite nicely in that one billion download milestone.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing Call of Duty since 2004 – <em>Finest Hour </em>was where it began for me. In 2009, I started playing Call of Duty multiplayer, falling head over heels in love with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and swearing up and down that I was the next best COD player in the world. Since then, I’ve at least dabbled in every Call of Duty game ever made.</p>



<p>It’s a different landscape now. There is no space for the casual gamer in Call of Duty, and Black Ops 6 can be <strong>punishing </strong>at times for someone with creaky thumbs and reflexes akin to that of a geriatric sloth.</p>



<p>With that being said, this is how I, a ‘Call of Duty veteran’, try desperately to keep up with the new blood flooding what was once my favourite shooter franchise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-set-it-up-right">Set It Up Right</h2>



<p>For starters, I play on a PC that gives me the best visual advantage possible, and my frame rate is often unparalleled. It’s like a comfort blanket – if I have the FPS soaring, I feel like I’m microseconds ahead of the competition, and in a reflex shooter like Call of Duty, that could mean the difference between a win and a loss.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>I use a bog-standard Dualshock 4 controller, equipped with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-kontrol-freeks-worth-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a set of Kontrol Freeks</a> for added accuracy (I swear it works), but I have spent years honing a <em>twist </em>to my controller layout. I use Bumper Jumper Tactical, which means I can try my best to use the age-old tactics of ‘jumpshotting’ and ‘dropshotting’ without needing one of those newfangled Scuf controllers that all the kids have.</p>



<p>It’s a game-changer, and I think I must have been using Bumper Jumper Tactical for at least five years straight in Call of Duty.</p>



<p>I’ve got the option to use my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powera-ops-v3-pro-review-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerA OPS V3</a> with all the bells and whistles, but I’m just so used to the Dualshock 4.</p>



<p>If I ever try to use a keyboard and mouse (which isn’t often), I try to rely on some of the best esports equipment I can lay my hands on, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g915-x-lightspeed-tkl-review-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Logitech G915 TKL</a>.</p>



<p>From there, having a solid headset is also one of the most important plays in Call of Duty. If your setup is lacking a headset, you’re not going to be good at Call of Duty, whether you’re a grizzled veteran or a complete newcomer. To that end, I make use of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-a50-wireless-headset-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro A50 Gen 5</a> which helps my aging ears pinpoint the pounding footsteps of an approaching enemy with relative ease.</p>



<p>Internet, too. If you’re relying on old-school copper wire broadband, you’re at a disadvantage. Old folks like us might not need super-fast internet for much else, but for gaining an edge in Call of Duty, it’s a <strong>must</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-tips-for-getting-good-at-black-ops-6">Top Tips For Getting Good at Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Not everyone can be good at Call of Duty, that’s just the bare truth of it. For every cracked player, there are nine bang average gamers, and I fall into that latter camp. Fortunately, there are a few things that you can do to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-black-ops-6-controller-settings-aiming-combat-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boost your Black Ops 6 skillset</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Learn the Maps</strong></p>



<p>Practice makes perfect, and only looping the same maps over and again will result in you knowing routes, grenade spots, and rotations for objectives.</p>



<p><strong>Find Your Mode</strong></p>



<p>If you don’t like Search and Destroy, <strong>don’t play Search and Destroy</strong>. It might be one of the best game modes in Black Ops 6 for XP, but it’ll grind you down to a nub. I tend to rely on Kill Confirmed with the Strategist specialist to maximise XP gains.</p>



<p><strong>Get the Gear</strong></p>



<p>Watch videos online and study pro players on social media to pick up the best weapon builds. Everyone claims to have the best build, but they’re mostly the same with one or two tweaks here and there.</p>



<p><strong>Optimise Your Settings</strong></p>



<p>From the Bumper Jumper Tactical tip to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-audio-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ‘Enhanced Audio’ sound profile</a>, there are many things you can do to secure the best settings in Black Ops 6. Take a little time to trawl through the menu and find what works best for you. </p>



<p>Here’s a tip for Black Ops 6: <strong>Turn off Omnimovement</strong>. If you’re on a controller, you can switch off diving, and it honestly makes such a refreshing change not needing to worry about leaping all over the map accidentally.</p>



<p><strong>Accept Imperfection</strong></p>



<p>Like I said, not everyone can get good at Call of Duty. You’ll be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-reveal-sbmm-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devastated by SBMM</a> and wannabe pro players before long, so it pays to sometimes accept that a) you’re almost past it, and b) everyone is just <strong>better </strong>at Call of Duty these days. And spoiler alert: almost everyone good at the game is 10 – 20 years younger than you.</p>



<p>Through sheer tenacity, settings that I’ve gotten used to over many years, and a desire to keep up with what’s trending, I stay somewhat ahead in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. I float around a 1.45 KD ratio, which isn’t bad for someone with my casual skillset, but I do painfully miss the old days.</p>



<p>I’ve gone from topping the charts to occupying a familiar spot at the bottom of the table. That’s what time does to you, folks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-explains-the-inner-workings-of-esports-broadcasts-for-a-modern-audience.1028259/</guid>

<p>Following the recent League of Legends World Championship event in London, Riot Games sat down in an interview to talk about all things broadcasting. During this interview, Riot’s Sam Kordower Chaimson, the executive broadcast producer for Worlds, explained what the gaming titan is doing to push content to a modern and increasingly demanding audience.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-worthwhile-to-support-all-those-fans">‘It’s Worthwhile to Support All Those Fans’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.svgeurope.org/blog/headlines/fan-eye-view-riot-games-on-creating-a-superior-viewer-experience-and-taking-fans-forwards-in-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with SVG Europe</a>, Kordower Chaimson explained that Riot Games is constantly adjusting its operating model to account for an ever-changing audience. Most recently, the broadcast team started producing a 9:16 stream – a vertical format – to accommodate those watching on platforms like TikTok.</p>



<p>It’s all about bringing as many viewers to the action as possible, and that’s only made a reality by fully diversifying how content can be consumed.</p>



<p>Kordower Chaimson drew key comparisons to ‘traditional’ sports and referenced a bold waking up to the versatility and accessibility of esports broadcasts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think traditional sports and traditional media are starting to clue into the fact that fans have different ways of engaging and at Riot we think it’s worthwhile to support all those fans, wherever they are. </p>



<p>Whether they’re watching a more traditional sport editorial broadcast like some of our main language feeds using our traditional broadcast apparatuses, or they’re watching one of our co-streamers, or they’re watching in another language using a broadcaster that may have a little bit more irreverent content, fans are choosing to engage with our sport in the way they engage with everything else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Kordower Chaimson puts it, Riot is busy trying to ‘serve a core fan experience’, and to do that, the company must ‘tailor its content to resonate with them and to reward them’.</p>



<p>Riot Games boasts one of the most tried, tested, and reliable broadcast infrastructures in the esports world. In 2022, the company opened two new remote broadcast centres as part of ‘Project Stryker’, one in Dublin, Ireland, and the other in Seattle. These facilities rival the tech-focused buildings backed by some of the world’s most powerful television broadcast companies.</p>



<p>Kordower Chaimson dipped into the emotional scenes that can unfold on a grand stage like the League of Legends World Championship:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s about marrying that hyper empathetic, hyper real personal experience with the spectacle of a top tier sporting event. I don’t think we lean too much into adhering to traditional editorial practises intentionally, but it’s about marrying the two. You obviously have natural advantages. </p>



<p>A big venue is pretty and beautiful and exciting, but it’s also a unique time to showcase our amazing community and our fans. It’s about celebrating the people around you that play the game. It’s about celebrating that comradery and those shared experiences we have, and that’s really special.</p>
</blockquote>
