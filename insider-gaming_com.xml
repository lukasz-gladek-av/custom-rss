            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If there’s one thing Bethesda Game Studios does well, it’s the creation of a top-notch expansion. For the Fallout franchise, some sizeable expansions have dropped over the years that have left players impressed and hungry for more. </p>



<p>From Fallout 3 to New Vegas and from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76, Bethesda Game Studios has delivered some great additional content. In this list, we’re taking a look at the 10 best Fallout DLCs and ranking them.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-best-fallout-dlc-ever">What’s The Best Fallout DLC Ever?</h2>



<p>Everyone has their idea of the perfect expansion. It’s a mostly subjective argument, but there are some universal truths. If you disagree with this list of the best Fallout DLCs ranked, then be sure to leave a comment and set us straight!</p>



<h3 id="h-best-nuka-world-fallout-4">Best: Nuka-World (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuka-World was a fantastic adventure from start to finish, taking players to a wide, open theme park that could be made operational. It was the perfect endgame DLC to an already impressive base game, and it served as a sublime send-off to the best-selling core Fallout game ever released. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-point-lookout-fallout-3">2. Point Lookout (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Point Lookout was a creepy, backwoods expansion that forced players to contend with some of Fallout 3’s eeriest enemies. It was a darker, more foreboding expansion that took players out of the base game’s map and put them in the heart of a swamp bursting at the seams with danger.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout/">10 Most Iconic Brands From Fallout</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-3-far-harbor-fallout-4">3. Far Harbor (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Behind Nuka-World, Far Harbor was a fantastic expansion for Fallout 4, and in many ways, it was similar to Point Lookout from Fallout 3. It introduced players to a brilliant map that was a wonder to explore, and the only thing holding this particular Fallout DLC back from the top spot is the series of annoying puzzles that must be solved as part of the expansion. </p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-pitt-fallout-3">4. The Pitt (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Pitt was so good that Bethesda Game Studios decided to revisit it in Fallout 76 more than a decade later. It was one of the grittier Fallout expansions, landing players in the heart of Pittsburgh to go toe-to-toe against savage, mutated creatures that were once slaves, twisted up by their masters and the environment around them.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-lonesome-road-fallout-new-vegas">5. Lonesome Road (Fallout New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fallout: New Vegas had some fantastic expansions, but few are as memorable as Lonesome Road. It’s one of the best Fallout DLCs because of the writing behind it and the characters it introduces – namely, Ulysses. It expands beautifully on the protagonist’s backstory and gives players a great location to explore,but  it’s just a little light on content.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-broken-steel-fallout-3">6. Broken Steel (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Broken Steel was one of the best Fallout DLCs that was released to appease fans who wanted more of the base game. It boosted the game’s level cap, added a stack of new content, and introduced an extra act that saw players fight the Enclave directly alongside the Brotherhood of Steel – Liberty Prime included. It was a bit of an afterthought that Bethesda created to ‘give players a little more’, but it was solid.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-automatron-fallout-4">7. Automatron (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Automatron was a short but sweet Fallout DLC that saw players pick up the ability to solve a mechanical mystery and create a robot companion that could be anything they so desired. It was the first outing for the expansion concept in Fallout 4, and while it didn’t add too much, it was entertaining enough for a couple of hours’ worth of content.</p>



<h3>8. Vault-Tec Workshop (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Vault-Tec Workshop, players get access to their own customisable Vault. It’s a massive, underground cavern with untold potential to craft something truly unique, but that’s about all it is – a building expansion. There are a few experiments to carry out, in true Vault-Tec style, but ultimately, it’s an expansion that allows you to build a Vault, which is about it.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-honest-hearts-fallout-3">9. Honest Hearts (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Honest Hearts has been the subject of many memes over the years, most notably because of the character that’s introduced in it – The Burned Man, Joshua Graham. It’s a great narrative, but the expanded area that’s opened up for exploration isn’t all that memorable, and aside from the core story, there isn’t much to unravel.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-steel-reign-fallout-76">10. Steel Reign (Fallout 76)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Steel Reign was one of the more sizeable Fallout 76 expansions – more commonly known as ‘updates’ – that brought the Brotherhood of Steel back into play. It was a follow-on from Steel Dawn, which was released around a year prior, and it added plenty of story content for the player to enjoy – but since it dropped in 2021, Bethesda Game Studios hasn’t been back to revisit the Brotherhood storyline. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Is 007 First Light like Hitman from a gameplay standpoint? That’s a common question from anyone who hears IO Interactive is making the jump to James Bond.</p>



<p>Millions of people fell in love with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-75-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hitman: World of Assassination trilogy</a> over the last decade. In that time, Agent 47 had an established formula that was consistently being built on with interesting maps and engaging challenges.</p>



<p>James Bond has quite an interesting history when it comes to video games, but what can you expect in the newest game? Is 007 First Light like Hitman?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-007-first-light-gameplay-similar-to-hitman">Is 007 First Light Gameplay Similar to Hitman?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>He may be another spy, but James Bond is not Agent 47. Image via IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>007 First Light can be compared to Hitman, but it’s not an exact copy.</strong></p>



<p>A lot of the things that will connect Hitman and First Light are the exploration aspects of the game. When things are calm, James Bond will survey his environment and look for ways to sneak around and enter restricted areas by causing distractions or using gadgets to disorient enemies. That is very similar to how Agent 47 operates in Hitman, so the blueprints align there, though we haven’t seen James try to steal someone’s outfit like 47 often does.</p>



<p>We would say where the two differ the most is in the combat. In Hitman, the focus was very much on remaining stealthy as long as possible. Agent 47 can fight his way out of a tricky situation, but those moments are rather limiting. Shooting in the Hitman games is rather stiff, and his melee is basic at best.</p>



<p><a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">007 First Light</a> seems to have gotten a big facelift when it comes to combat. Bond can do more with the environment around him when fighting, like grab an enemy and throw them in a direction, or fight to take a weapon away from someone. We’ve also seen Bond control an airplane and make it rock sideways while in combat, so there could be bigger ways to give enemies a harder time taking you out.</p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-has-more-to-it-than-stealth-and-combat">007 First Light Has More to It Than Stealth and Combat</h2>



<p>For the Hitman games, stealth and combat are essentially the main things you have to look forward to. There is a story there, but to be honest, it’s nothing that special or interesting.</p>



<p>IO Interactive is putting in the work to make 007 First Light a more cinematic experience than Hitman. Consider the car driving sections that never appeared in Hitman, or just how much more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-james-bond-voice-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Bond is willing to talk</a> to get his way. We love Agent 47, but the point of his character is to be silent and stoic.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early look we’ve had at the game</a>, 007 First Light definitely appears to have some of the Hitman DNA in it, but we would say it’s been built on top of not necessarily making something completely new, but augmenting what came before so that James Bond can stand apart from Agent 47.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The voice actor for James Bond in 007 First Light has been revealed after a long bout of speculation and fan casting.</p>



<p>With IO Interactive taking over and making a story for a James Bond just getting started in the spy business, many have been wondering who would be taking on the role with this young Bond, now set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Not only have we <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-reveal-how-hitman-has-influenced-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gotten a good look at gameplay</a>, but the voice behind the spy himself has been announced. Here is who the voice actor is for James Bond in 007 First Light.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-james-bond-in-007-first-light">Who Voices James Bond in 007 First Light?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This guy has a very different license to kill. Image via Paramount</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The voice actor for James Bond in 007 First Light is Patrick Gibson.</strong></p>



<p>He is a 30-year-old Irish actor who was born in London. While not the most recognizable name you will hear, Gibson is probably best known for playing a younger Dexter Morgan in <em>Dexter: Original Sin</em>, which is a prequel series. Having him as a just-starting-out James Bond kind of fits in perfectly.</p>



<p>For more background on Patrick Gibson, you can check out <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2617600/?ref_=mv_close" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his IMDb page</a> to see if there are any other shows or movies you can recognize him in, but we are unaware of the other projects he’s been in. With all of that being said, 007 First Light is the first video game acting role that Gibson has had. So far, his voice acting seems to be done pretty well, and we think he sounds like he fits the part perfectly.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-007-first-light-s-james-bond-canon">Is 007 First Light’s James Bond Canon?</h2>



<p><strong>No, the James Bond in 007 First Light is not canon to the overall James Bond story.</strong></p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/technology/gaming/007-first-light-isnt-canon-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speaking with Radio Times</a>, Jonathan Lacaille, the franchise director at IO Interactive, said that while a lot of what is included in the game, including the scar on James’ cheek, is from the novels, the things that happen here are not connected to what is currently in production with Amazon MGM, instead, it will “live alongside” those movies.</p>



<p>While Patrick Gibson’s James Bond isn’t considered canon, it’s still a really big name for him to be attached to. When you think of 007, you are usually linking some very big-time Hollywood actors to the role. Gibson can now say he stands alongside names like Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan, and Sean Connery, while delivering a very unique take on the character we have not seen before.</p>

<p>Do you think Patrick Gibson is a good choice to portray a younger James Bond? Is 007 First Light doing enough to stand out in your mind as a must-play game? Let us know in the comments or on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-insomniac-games%E2%80%99-wolverine-is-likely-to-be-at-playstation%E2%80%99s-next-state-of-play.1288170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming sources have revealed that Insomniac Games’ Wolverine is ready to be shown off for the first time officially since the 2021 PlayStation Showcase.</p>



<div><p>According to sources, who wished to remain anonymous as they couldn’t talk about company plans, PlayStation is currently planning its next State of Play event towards the end of September. </p><p>Other sources revealed that Insomniac Games’ Wolverine is “almost certainly” going to be at the event, as the production of its next trailer has now been completed. If the game doesn’t appear at State of Play, then the trailer will undoubtedly be released in the next few months, with The Game Awards being the next likely candidate.</p></div>



<p>Insomniac Games’ Wolverine faced <span>some issues in development following a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-games-alleged-ransomware-attack/" target="_blank">ransomware attack</a>&nbsp;in December 2023, during </span>which employee information and a substantial amount of game footage&nbsp;leaked online. The hack resulted in some changes to the game’s plans, but the extent of these changes is currently unknown.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, neither PlayStation nor Insomniac Games has revealed when Wolverine is set to be released, but fingers crossed, an answer awaits us in the coming weeks. The game is currently slated to release exclusively on the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As for what else the next State of Play event could feature remains to be seen, but it’s likely to feature Bungie’s upcoming ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>‘, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroidvania God of War</a> (Insider Gaming has it on good authority a mainline title is also in the works), Phantom Blade 0, and possibly even Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. If the State of Play is at the end of September as intended, then we’ll likely see a deeper dive into Ghost of Yotei, too, which releases on October 2, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhaven-lay-off-staff-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dreamhaven is now the latest studio to lay off employees from staff, letting go of many staff members.</p>



<p>Today, the developer/publisher, who created Wildgate and Sunderfolk, announced layoffs made to the studio. As of writing, no specific number is out, but it’s likely a good chunk. Dreamhaven, led by ex-Blizzard cofounder Michael Morhaime, is a newer studio. The team only has a few titles under it, with the latest being the multiplayer shooter Wildgate. With that said, the layoffs are rather surprising and very unfortunate to those affected.</p>



<h2 id="h-dreamhaven-ceo-responds-to-recent-layoffs">Dreamhaven CEO Responds to Recent Layoffs</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Wildgate | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDcX7Kf_gTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369069584328421376/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a LinkedIn post</a> by CEO Michael Morhaime, he announced the layoffs and some reassurance. He states in the post,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We made the hard decision to reduce the size of our company, with the primary impact on our Publishing group,” says Michael in the post. “These choices are never easy — they affect talented colleagues who have played a key role in building Dreamhaven’s foundation and supporting what has been an eventful year for us.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As mentioned before, the exact number of laid-off staff has not been disclosed. Regardless, it seems like support will be available, as severance packages and connections to future jobs have been given. As for its roster of games, the studio plans to continue to be supported, like Wildgate and Sunderfolk.</p>



<p>Already, this year has been full of layoffs and closures. Just last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-holds-layoffs/">Crystal Dynamics</a> let go of staff following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reportedly-could-have-been-saved-after-cancellation/">cancellation of Perfect Dark</a>. Hopefully, with new studios on the rise, those who lost their jobs can land back on their feet soon.</p>
