<p>Over a quarter of a century after the initial release, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is putting a fresh lick of paint and a new look on the classic title, with gamers across various platforms able to enjoy the game.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on February 5</a>, though players can jump in up to 48 hours early by purchasing the Digital Deluxe Edition.</p>



<p>If you’re yet to purchase Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and want to know what options are available in terms of platforms, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-on-ps5">Can You Play Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Options. Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is available to play on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> on the February 5 release date, with two options available.</strong></p>



<p>The Standard Edition of the game comes with an additional bonus of a Blue Slime Shield, and those who want to splash out on the Digital Deluxe Edition receive 48 hours of early access, The Road of Regal Wretches, Luminary’s Livery, and the White Wolf Costume.</p>



<p>Of course, that extra content comes at a price, and the biggest incentive is the early access period if you can’t wait for the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is available on both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series S</a>, with the same purchase options as PS5.</strong></p>



<p>None of the bonuses in the Digital Deluxe Edition is platform-exclusive, so Xbox players can get their hands on the same loot as PS5 players, including entry into the 48-hour early-access period.</p>



<p>There is also an Early Bird Bonus for those who purchase the game before March 4, 2026, providing the Trodain Togs outfit and three Seed of Proficiency.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined lands at the same time on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles as on other platforms, with the same purchase options.</strong></p>



<p>This includes the 48-hour early-access period for purchasing the Digital Deluxe edition of the game, though the biggest bonus for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> players is that the game is available on that platform too, as it is not a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive.</p>

<p>Over 25 years since its initial release, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined provides players with a huge modernization of the classic game, and the release date is right around the corner.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG</a> title was a huge hit when it was initially released at the turn of the millennium, and the remastered version is one of the most eagerly anticipated titles releasing in the early part of 2026.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for all the release date and start time details for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-release-date">What is The Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Back again. Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is set for launch on February 5, though the date may vary based on your region and the platform you are playing on.</strong></p>



<p>For those that purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition, 48 hours of early access are available as an incentive.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimaged is available across multiple platforms, but the release time and date vary across them; however, for the vast majority, it will be February 5 when you can start playing.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-start-times">What Are The Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>The start time for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined varies based on platform, with a 12 AM PT release on consoles, and a 9 AM PT release on Steam.</strong> <strong>Those with early access can jump in up to 48 hours before these times. </strong></p>



<p>As is customary for platforms like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a>|S, Dragon Quest VII Reimaged has a staggered release date, which means that you can play early in your time zone if you adjust your settings accordingly, which is very easy to do on Xbox.</p>



<p>For <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> players, however, the release time is global and set in stone, with a morning release for those in the United States, while European players have to wait until the afternoon, and other regions may need to wait until the early hours of the morning on February 6.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-skyrim-lead-elder-scrolls-tv-show-not-work/</link>
            <guid>1420906</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has seen immense success with the delivery of the Fallout television show. It has won awards, pulled millions of eyes to the Fallout universe, and opened the door to collaborations across the ecosystem. But would that success roll over into The Elder Scrolls if <strong>that franchise </strong>were to be adapted into a live-action production?</p>



<p>According to Bruce Nesmith, former design lead on The Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim, and a quest writer on Fallout 3 (amongst other things), a live-action adaptation of The Elder Scrolls <strong>probably wouldn’t work</strong>.</p>











<p>Nesmith worked at Bethesda Game Studios for several years, leaving in 2021 to chase new horizons. But before he departed, he offered key contributions to some of the company’s most ambitious projects, including 2011’s Elder Scrolls game, <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-is-being-released-again/">Skyrim</a></strong>. It’s widely considered one of the best games ever made, and he played a pivotal part in bringing it to life.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Press Box PR</a>, Nesmith spoke at length about Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, and the world around him and what he has created – and continues to create.</p>



<p>One segment turned to talking about the Fallout TV show and the success it has seen since debuting in April 2024.</p>



<p>The interviewer asked Nesmith if he could see The Elder Scrolls receiving the live-action treatment, but the former Bethesda Game Studios developer was sceptical and pretty on the money with his opinion:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Do they really need marketing for Elder Scrolls 6?</p>



<p>There’s something very special and different and unique about Fallout that lends itself to becoming a TV or movie experience whereas The Elder Scrolls is trying to be a standard kind of fantasy. That’s not as interesting.</p>



<p>You look at Fallout, everything is special about it. There is nothing like the Fallout universe anywhere else in gaming.</p>



<p>That makes it easy to make a TV show and draw eyeballs as opposed to going into a fantasy world where I’ve got elves and people throwing spells around. You’d have to raise those stakes. There’s a dragon? I’ve seen dragons 20 times before. What are you giving to viewers that’s new?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t know that The Elder Scrolls would fit that media well. Maybe a movie but I would struggle to see a TV show.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a good point. Nesmith pointed to brands like Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings, which could be seen as very Elder Scrolls-coded. There are plenty of television shows and movies with fantasy themes, even adaptations like The Witcher walk a close line to the Bethesda-backed brand, for instance.</p>



<p>It’s highly unlikely Bethesda Game Studios will turn anything other than Fallout into a show, especially as the series could run <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/">for up to a <strong>decade</strong></a>, all being well.</p>



<p>Now, if we could just start talking about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-wants-play-fallout-5-600-hours-rookie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making Fallout 5 a reality</a>…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2’s director has put fans’ minds at ease, reaffirming that the game remains unaffected despite the recent restructuring. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively revealed</a> last week that, despite being one of Ubisoft’s longest in-development projects, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 had survived the recent organizational, operational, and portfolio reset. A spokesperson later confirmed that the game remained a priority for them within their strategy, centred on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures</a>. </p>







<h2 id="h-beyond-good-amp-evil-2-game-and-team-unaffected">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 Game and Team Unaffected</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7421227406130335744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 creative director Fawzi Mesmar reaffirmed that he, the team, and the game “are unaffected by the recent changes.” Mesmar also spoke about the remaining cancellations and studio closures, encouraging people to support those affected in whatever way they can. Check out the complete statement below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for everyone who has reached out to me over the past few days in regards to recent news at Ubisoft. </p>



<p>Myself, my team and our project Beyond Good and Evil 2 are unaffected by the recent changes. I would direct you to the official press release for more information around the latest organisational structure. </p>



<div><p>Needless to say, I am saddened by the cancellations that has affected my colleagues in other parts of Ubisoft and the industry. I urge everyone – myself included – to offer support whenever and however they can during these times.</p><p>We remain committed and focused on delivering a remarkable game for our players to enjoy.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>For those who may not be aware, Ubisoft’s restructuring has resulted in the cancellation of the highly anticipated&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, along with five other games. The new operating model will prioritize open-world adventures and experiences designed for Games as a Service (GaaS), featuring&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five creative divisions</a>. This restructuring has already caused a&nbsp;significant decline in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s share price</a>.</p>







<p>In other news, the Black Flag Remake was likely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed by up to </a><span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/" target="_blank">1 year</a>&nbsp;f</span>ollowing the recent restructuring. Additionally, Ubisoft has revealed intentions to make Far Cry, Assassin’s Creed, and Rainbow Six ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual billionaire brands</a>.’  What are your thoughts on the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 director reaffirming the team and project’s status?

            <title><![CDATA[Is PUBG: Blindspot on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pubg-blindspot-platforms-xbox-ps5/</link>
            <guid>1420879</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new entry in the PUBG universe is on the horizon with the release of PUBG: Blindspot into early access, though questions are naturally being asked about the available platforms.</p>



<p>The 5v5 top-down tactical <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shooter</a> is bringing an entirely new approach for PUBG fans, and there’s a strong audience to appeal to, given the vast success of PUBG over the years.</p>



<p>If you want to know whether PUBG: Blindspot is available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a>|S, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-ps5">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No luck. Image via PUBG</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, PUBG: Blindspot will not be available on PlayStation 5 when it launches on February 5, and there’s no end in sight for PS5 players.</strong></p>



<p>PUBG: Blindspot’s early access period is exclusive for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, but, potentially more significant is that there have been no details of a planned release on PS5.</p>



<p>The top-down shooter is an entirely different genre from the main PUBG title, and may not adapt well to PS5, which could explain its absence.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>No, similar to the situation with PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S players will not be able to play PUBG: Blindspot on the February 5 launch date.</strong></p>



<p>Again, the early access launch is for PC only, and there is no news on a potential Xbox Series X|S launch in the future, but it is still early days for the game.</p>



<p>More details about any plans for console releases could come deeper into PUBG: Blindspot’s lifespan, with the early access release merely marking the next step on a long journey.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>No, PUBG: Blindspot is not available on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles at launch, though this isn’t surprising given the overall platform status.</strong></p>



<p>Given that PUBG: Blindspot isn’t on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, it shouldn’t be much of a surprise that there is no Switch launch, and, of all the platforms the title could come to in the future, the Nintendo platform is likely at the bottom of the list.</p>

<p>CM Punk is on the cover of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461">WWE 2K26.</a></p>



<p>During the Royal Rumble coverage on ESPN 2, WWE CM Punk is the cover star of the standard edition of WWE 2K26. Pre-orders are now open, and the release is set for March 13 worldwide.</p>



<p>Currently, the WWE World Heavyweight Champion, CM Punk, is on the cover of a WWE video game for the first time since WWE ’13 back in 2012. Of course, Punk left the WWE for 10 years after a dispute with Vince McMahon and Triple H, which was spurred on by exhaustion and frustration with the direction of his career.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/">Insider Gaming exclusively reported </a>that Punk would be the centerpiece of this year’s 2K Showcase. Not only will players be able to relive some of CM Punk’s classic career moments, but there will also be the opportunity to play through some dream matches that could have happened had CM Punk not left WWE in 2014.</p>

<p>According to a new report, Helldivers 2 has crossed 20 million copies sold and brought in $700 million in revenue. </p>



<p>Helldivers 2 has emerged as one of the most inspiring success stories in the gaming industry recently. Its success has influenced other games, such as ARC Raiders, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ditched-free-to-play-because-of-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to abandon a free-to-play model</a> in favor of a reasonably priced one. This approach has made a significant impact and has seemingly contributed to reaching a major milestone today.</p>
