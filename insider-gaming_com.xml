<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. The February 12, 2026, Quordle has four new words for you to find, and this guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone and region, meaning the next game will start on February 13.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kojima and Zampella Almost Created a First-Person Metal Gear Solid Game]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-person-metal-gear-solid-game-kojima-zampella/</link>
            <guid>1433359</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima recently took to the stage at DICE in Las Vegas to reveal something long-forgotten. Shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots in 2008, he ‘had many discussions’ with the late Vince Zampella about creating a first-person MGS game.</p>



<p>The title, which has understandably never seen the light of day, would have represented a major pivot for the Metal Gear franchise. While it has featured snippets of a first-person perspective in some sequences, we’ve never had a <strong>dedicated </strong>first-person title in the series.</p>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/metal-gear-solid/" id="162">Metal Gear Solid</a> 4: Guns of the Patriots launched to a positive reception way back in 2008, emerging as a core PlayStation 3 title with immense cinematic potential. It represented a penultimate point for Kojima, as the next title, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, would be his final major release in the series before leaving Konami.</p>



<p>In 2008, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/vince-zampella/" id="3380">Vince Zampella</a> was busying himself with the development of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, the sequel to 2007’s Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. This would have been when he was the CEO at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/infinity-ward/" id="1999">Infinity Ward</a>, and up to a year and a half before he was unexpectedly let go from the company.</p>



<p>In April 2010, Zampella founded <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/respawn-entertainment/" id="2483">Respawn Entertainment</a> and went to work developing Titanfall.</p>



<p>But in a new segment at DICE, Hideo Kojima spoke fondly of the late Zampella, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-head-vince-zampella-killed-in-crash/" id="167252">who died just before Christmas</a> in a car wreck in California. In a post on social media from Geoff Keighley, it was confirmed that Kojima and Zampella had ‘many discussions’ about creating a first-person Metal Gear Solid game, building on the success of MGS4.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At DICE, Hideo Kojima revealed that he had many discussions with Vince Zampella about creating a first person Metal Gear Solid game together after the release of Metal Gear Solid 4. <a href="https://t.co/hhjbCqG7T2">pic.twitter.com/hhjbCqG7T2</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2021671381382181056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Nothing more was said on the matter, but it’s safe to assume that a first-person Metal Gear Solid game would have drastically shifted the game’s perspective in more ways than one. In the comments under Keighley’s post, die-hard MGS fans stressed that the franchise ‘only works’ as a third-person shooter.</p>



<p>Kojima also confirmed that Zampella helped him to establish Kojima Productions after parting ways with Konami around 2015.</p>



<p>Do you think a first-person Metal Gear Solid game would have worked? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections answers as quickly as possible.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>

<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– FORM, MAKE, MOLD, PRODUCE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – FAST, FIRM, FROZEN, TIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – A, CARD, JAY, YANK</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – DAIRY, DANCING, DRAG, MAY</li>
</ul>
