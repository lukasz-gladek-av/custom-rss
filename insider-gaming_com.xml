<p>Every bit of new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay is welcome. So, while it’s a bummer that exclusive Resident Evil Requiem gameplay was shown off in Japan, a video has been shared, showcasing the intriguing footage.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem adds to what is already a ridiculous 2026 for gaming. Capcom’s newest survival horror entry in the genre-defining franchise puts Grace Ashcroft in the hot seat. It’s already been revealed how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-reveal-how-grace-differs-from-previous-protagonists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grace differs from previous protagonists</a>, but seeing her in action is a treat—as shown in a new gameplay clip.</p>







<h2 id="h-exclusive-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-revealed">Exclusive Resident Evil Requiem Gameplay Revealed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shocking. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dusk Golem</a> shared a video showing “new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay of a new area with Grace fighting a zombie in the Resident Evil special program that aired on Japanese television.”</p>







<p>A 34-second video shows the new ability to flick between first-person and third-person, and shows Grace battling off zombie threats with a pistol. The gameplay looks infinitely more horrible, claustrophobic, and terrifying in first-person, which would explain why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-third-person-camera-because-resident-evil-7-was-too-scary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 9 has a third-person camera</a>.</p>



<p>The indoor environment certainly looks new, and nothing we’ve seen already in any previous gameplay footage or teaser trailers.</p>



<p>Dusk Golem clarifies that because it’s a Japan-only advert, meaning it’s “100% the censored Japanese version.” It still features blood and gory effects, but presumably to a far lesser extent than we’ll see in the full release.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There was some new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay of a new area with Grace fighting a zombie in the Resident Evil special program that aired on Japanese television. <a href="https://t.co/FToPeqi4HW">pic.twitter.com/FToPeqi4HW</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1996158141793489389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>It definitely gives off more of a Resident Evil 2 Remake and Resident Evil 7 vibe—which will be music to the ears of those who lambasted Resident Evil 8’s somewhat familiar return to action and open areas.</p>



<p>What do you think of this short gameplay extra? Is Resident Evil Requiem looking better by the day? Will this be a return to the classic vibe of vintage Resident Evil games?

            <title><![CDATA[TheBurntPeanut Just Slammed Dr Disrespect Live on Stream]]></title>

<p>TheBurntPeanut has been on a monumental glow-up this year. His escapades on games like Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders have propelled him to superstar status, and during a recent ‘streamer battle’ on the latter title, he secured a concurrent viewer count of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost 100,000 people</a>, a number seldom secured by <strong>any </strong>streamer.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, TheBurntPeanut, who literally streams as an animated peanut, slammed Dr Disrespect and his followers after a slew of comments arose about him ‘moving in’ on Dr Disrespect’s territory.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-and-dr-disrespect-beef-explained">TheBurntPeanut and Dr Disrespect Beef Explained</h2>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has, in his words, been ‘making jokes’ about Dr Disrespect since ‘day one’. This all goes back to Dr Disrespect’s immense controversy in 2024, which saw him <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-admits-minor-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admit to messaging a minor</a> on Twitch years ago, which ultimately led to his permanent ban from the platform.</p>



<p>In the months that have followed, Dr Disrespect, who has since returned to streaming and maintains a solid following, has preached his innocence on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut is at times a scandalous creator who has had to bite his tongue to avoid making ‘cancel-worthy’ statements, but where Dr Disrespect is concerned, it’s <strong>open season </strong>for the vtuber.</p>



<p>The most recent comment from TheBurntPeanut wasn’t at all veiled and was borderline inflammatory:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been making jokes since day one about Dr Disrespect, I think they think since I’m big now I’m encroaching on his territory.</p>



<p>I’m on ARC Raiders not<strong> the playground</strong>, you got nothing to worry about!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TheBurntPeanut is up for streamer awards after a year of immense success that has pushed him to the forefront of the industry. He’s incredibly entertaining and has already gained a cult following, which means comments like this <strong>do not </strong>go unwitnessed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Season 01 Battle Pass To Have ‘Improvements’ For The First Time]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-01-battle-pass-improvements/</link>
            <guid>1371274</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On December 4, Season 01 of Black Ops 7 and Warzone (like the fifth time it has had a ‘Season 01’) will be released worldwide, granting players an all-new Battle Pass to experience across two tiers. As always, there’s the standard Battle Pass and the BlackCell Battle Pass, both of which include dozens of rewards, boosts, and bonuses.</p>



<p>In a recent blog post, the Activision team uncovered fresh changes coming to the Battle Pass system, which have been dubbed the first ‘improvements’ ever to be introduced.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-changes-are-coming-to-the-call-of-duty-battle-pass">What Changes Are Coming to the Call of Duty Battle Pass?</h2>



<p>It was revealed recently in a Call of Duty blog post that when the Season 01 Battle Pass drops on December 4, it’ll land with improvements, the likes of which have <strong>never been seen </strong>before.</p>



<p>Here’s the full spiel from the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-season-01-battle-pass-blackcell-bundles#Improvements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty blog</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock Timing:&nbsp;</strong>The team has taken learnings from&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>’s Battle Pass completion times and made tuning adjustments for a more satisfying journey. The result: each season’s Battle Pass in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;will be more rewarding for your time spent in-game, no matter where you’re playing across all parts of the game.</li>



<li><strong>Shorter Initial Pages:&nbsp;</strong>Earlier pages in the&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>Battle Pass can now be completed faster with fewer tiers needed to unlock HVT content at the end of the page, while later pages in the Battle Pass will contain more rewards. This means players will earn more high-value content sooner across all 100 tiers.</li>



<li><strong>Battle Pass Tokens via Daily Challenges:&nbsp;</strong>For the first time, players will have the ability to earn Battle Pass Tokens through completing Daily Challenges, which are now available not only in Multiplayer, Zombies, and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, but also Co-Op Campaign and Endgame (another first!) On certain days in the season, completion of your bonus Daily Challenge will grant you a Battle Pass Token, which can be used right away.</li>
</ul>



<p>This means that the first few pages in the Battle Pass will be shorter and will have a faster completion rate, which means you’ll feel like you’re getting more rewards right off the bat. The further along the Battle Pass you get, the longer the pages will become, which kind of makes perfect sense.</p>



<p>Additionally, for the first time, Battle Pass Tokens will be unlockable via daily challenges that are completable across all game platforms, including the campaign and ‘Endgame’ modes. This will make it easier to get those all-important tokens to grind through the Battle Pass tiers.</p>



<p>The full patch notes for the Season 01 update should be available later today, so stay tuned.</p>
