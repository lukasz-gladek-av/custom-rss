<p>Bethesda Game Studios has revealed that little more than a year after the game was released worldwide, Starfield has hit 15 million players. It took the game almost a year to rack up two million players on top of the 13 million that was revealed in December 2023, following a remarkably successful launch window for the game.</p>



<p>Is that performance lacking something? After all, Starfield is free on Game Pass on both PC and Xbox and just weeks ago, the game’s first major expansion was released – along with mods earlier this year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sustainability">Sustainability</h2>



<p>In a post on the Bethesda Game Studios blog page, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you to the over 15 million players who are adventuring through the stars in Starfield!</p>



<p>We’re thrilled that so many of you have embarked on this journey with us, and we appreciate your feedback. We are always looking for ways to improve your experience playing the game and wanted to give our community an update on the most recent adjustments we’ve made to Starfield.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This month, Starfield will get ‘achievement-friendly’ Creations, countless quality-of-life improvements, and some new goodies for players to download and use, such as the ‘Deimog’ land vehicle:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As a special gift to our players for our&nbsp;<strong>15 million player landmark</strong>, get ready to conquer the terrain of unexplored planets with the all-new Deimog, the latest addition to Starfield’s lineup of high-performance land vehicles. Built for speed and endurance, the Deimog features a fully enclosed cabin to keep you protected as you race through rugged landscapes. </p>



<p>Its exceptional handling allows you to navigate even the trickiest terrain with ease, while a powerful rocket launcher ensures you’re prepared for any threats—be it hostile wildlife or clusters of enemies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Starfield is in something of a downswing right now. It’s no big secret that it wasn’t the sustainable success story that Bethesda Game Studios was hoping for.</p>



<p>On Steam, Starfield has slunk down to an all-time low 24-hour peak player count of just 5,300 users – that’s from an ATH of 330,597. On streaming and social channels, the game has dwindled to nothing. Take Twitch, for example – the game peaked at launch with 552,021 viewers, but at the time of writing, just 70 people are watching Starfield gameplay.</p>

<p>Finn ‘karrigan’ Andersen, one of the most recognisable pro players in the Counter-Strike esports scene, has posted a tragic revelation on social media. He explained that days before the RMR ahead of the Perfect World Shanghai Major, his older brother unexpectedly passed away.</p>



<p>Karrigan went on to qualify for the $1.25 million tournament, stressing that he’s now going to fly home to attend his brother’s funeral and take some time off.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-play-my-heart-out">‘Play My Heart Out’</h2>



<p>On Twitter, Faze Clan’s karrigan shared the heartbreaking news:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My big brother unexpectedly passed away few days before RMR, it has been so rough to deal with it on top of the most stressful tournament. I miss him so much and it’s hard to believe he is not around anymore. I know he is in a good and peaceful place now.</p>



<p>I’m going home to attend his funeral and take a few days off, I know he would want me to push through to go the major and play my heart out and I will do that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On November 13, karrigan flew to Shanghai to take part in the RMR, which is a last-ditch effort for teams to qualify for the monumental CS2 esports event. He’ll now return home to be with his family before jetting back to Shanghai to compete between November 30 and December 15.</p>



<p>Karrigan, who is 34 at the time of publishing, is one of the oldest pro esports players still active, and he’s been competing since 2006. He’s one of the winningest players in the Counter-Strike 2 scene, and between 2022 and 2023, he went on a wild spree with FaZe Clan, basically securing every trophy and grand prize possible in the CS space.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to Andersen and his family at this difficult time.</p>

<p>A new update for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes#nov18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has been released</a>, and in it comes several changes throughout the game. The biggest comes the re-re-adding of the legacy XP tokens to Black Ops 6 after they were taken away on November 15. </p>



<p>The tokens had been re-added to the game at the launch of Black Ops 6 Season 1 in a move that Activision said was unintentional. They were quickly removed the following day, leading to fan backlash across numerous social media platforms.</p>



<p>Now, four days later, they are back for all players. </p>



<p>Aside from the XP tokens being returned, the new Black Ops 6 update addresses a few UI concerns as well as fixed steering in vehicle scorestreaks. </p>



<p>You can check out the full patch notes below.
