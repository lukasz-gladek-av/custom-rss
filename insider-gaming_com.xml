<p>If you’re taking part in a little esports betting or want to watch the BLAST R6 Major Munich with some knowledge in your back pocket, here are the latest predictions for the tournament.</p>



<p><strong>FaZe Clan </strong>comes into the running in Munich with the tightest momentum and best esports betting odds. They’re the reigning Six Invitational champs with a clean roster that has had a decent year already. Ending the 2025 run with a win would see the organization redeem itself from a rough finish at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>It was Team Secret that secured the trophy at the Esports World Cup, closely followed in second place by <strong>G2 Esports</strong>, the next top pick for winning it all in Munich. It would be a phenomenal thing for G2 Esports to win the Munich Major on home turf.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-review%E2%80%94the-most-refreshing-extraction-shooter-ever-made.1341034/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has finally hit the market after years of development at Embark Studios. It comes from the creative minds that brought us The Finals and, once upon a time, games like Battlefield. It’s a retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic, extraction shooter epic that has been turning heads for months, and now it’s finally here, it’s <strong>screaming up the charts</strong>.</p>



<p>Being a fan of the extraction genre, I was all too eager to leap head over heels into ARC Raiders. I’d waited until the full release of the game to experience it, as I wanted the most polished version possible, and what I’ve been treated to is nothing short of sumptuous.</p>



<p>This is the most refreshing, entertaining extraction shooter I think we’ve ever had. Read on for my full ARC Raiders review.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-is-accessible-but-remains-challenging">ARC Raiders is Accessible but Remains Challenging</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-steams-most-popular-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a> is perhaps the most accessible game to land in the genre, which is typically tougher and less welcoming than almost every other genre out there (except perhaps Soulslike). It takes the extraction shooter concept and makes it more ‘arcadey’ and inviting, while retaining a solid sense of challenge that keeps the more talented players engaged.</p>



<p>That balance is flawless, in my eyes. I generally hate games that are challenging for the sake of it, but ARC Raiders manages to keep you entertained even <strong>while you’re losing</strong>, and there are mechanics built into the game to make sure you can keep playing even when you’re on your last buck.</p>



<p>Given that ARC Raiders is available on PlayStation, Xbox, <strong>and </strong>PC, it already has a step up on the competition, which is almost exclusively refined to PC platforms. For instance, Escape from Tarkov, arguably the spearhead of the extraction genre, has spent almost a decade confined to a proprietary launcher on PC, and is only just coming to Steam later this month.</p>



<p>If you choose to invest the $30 or so to secure a copy of ARC Raiders, you’ll be getting what might be one of the best introductions to the extraction shooter genre imaginable.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Team up, betray, or just gun down? The choice is yours in ARC Raiders</figcaption></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders takes players and throws them into a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by an invasion of robotic enemies called ARC. The human race has been driven underground into a settlement called Speranza, and ‘going topside’ is a risky and ambitious concept reserved only for foolhardy Raiders, scavengers who want to claim the riches still left above ground.</p>



<p>It’s a third-person action-based shooter with some light RPG and survival mechanics, large-ish environments to explore, and intense combat systems that make fighting both human enemies and AI-driven robots a satisfying romp.</p>



<p>I’ve said it’s effectively Fortnite crossed with Fallout, and fused with Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>You’ve got the third-person perspective, rapid movement model, and elements like skin packs and emotes, combined with the post-apocalyptic, war-torn setting, and extraction-based gameplay loop.</p>



<p>What’s different about ARC Raiders is that it holds your hand quite nicely without being too forgiving. You can get free loadouts at any point if you’re down on your luck, you have a companion named Scrappy (he’s a chicken) who collects crafting items for you to use, and the early-game missions are tutorials that help you understand the core facets of the title.</p>



<p>I think the earliest quests had me fully understand every angle of the game, including trading, crafting, extraction, healing, and more, within an hour flat. You don’t get that in a game like Escape from Tarkov!</p>



<p>But with that being said, ARC Raiders can quickly ramp up the difficulty, depending on your circumstances. The ARC enemies are notoriously tough, and fighting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-boss-kill-58-times/">something like a <strong>Queen</strong></a><strong> </strong>is absolutely impossible without a dedicated effort by a well-armed team with a key strategy to follow.</p>



<p>As you could imagine, resources are scarce, the post-apocalyptic arsenal is reminiscent of Fallout’s ‘pipe weapon’ range, and there are no armor items to find and upgrade, just energy shields and the warm flesh of your Raider.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Don’t even hope to tackle an ARC Queen</figcaption></figure>







<p>Bungie stressed that Marathon, an upcoming extraction shooter that was plagued by bad press earlier this year, would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-social-extraction-experience/">the first ‘social’ extraction shooter</a>. It was said it would hit the market with elements of accessibility and would promote teamwork and collaboration over mindless slaughter.</p>



<p>That’s what ARC Raiders is doing. In the raids that I’ve played, I’ve had more positive interactions than in any other extraction shooter or battle royale title. I’ve teamed up with other players, helped them into the extraction sites (elevators that take you back to Speranza), and even earned apologies from players before they brutally knocked me out and sent me to the abyss.</p>



<p>Even when I do get into a fight, I feel like it’s pretty balanced, even if the RPG-style skill-based pathways lend themselves to the whole ‘unemployed gamers are more powerful’ vibe. As you rank up your character, you unlock multiple benefits that might make a brand-new player feel a bit hard done by, but that’s the nature of the game, and you just need to deal with it.</p>



<p>If you grind, you’ll get there yourself at some point. There are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-arc-raiders-have-a-wipe/">no wipes in ARC Raiders</a>, except for the optional ‘Expedition Projects’ that crop up after you’ve hit level 20, so you can chug along at your own pace, have fun meeting people and enjoying the world around you, and not worry about losing all your progress once every six months.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-i-wanted">Everything I Wanted</h2>



<figure><figcaption>ARC Raiders’ maps encourage multiple playstyles, which is superb</figcaption></figure>







<p>I was holding fire on ARC Raiders for the longest time, but I need to admit that it’s everything I’m looking for in an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>There are plenty of places to loot and explore, the resource pool is diverse, and the core concept of the game is intriguing and engaging. I’m a huge fan of the combat, which invites you to try out a range of fighting styles and approaches, and I love how accessible the game is, catering perfectly for casual players just as much as die-hard veterans of the genre.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has done a phenomenal job with ARC Raiders. It looks brilliant on-screen, runs quite nicely, and has a diverse collection of maps, enemies to fight, and quests to complete. There are 63 quests to contend with right now, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/">ARC Raiders roadmap</a> for the path ahead has been revealed, and plenty more content is coming.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release</a> on November 15 and the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> on November 14 might disrupt ARC Raider somewhat, but I’m confident that this shooter has plenty of meat on the bones and fuel in the tank, more than enough to retain a core community that will keep the game up on their shoulders.</p>



<p>If there is <strong>one thing </strong>I would ask for, it’s a PvE mode that takes out the extra challenge of PvP battles. I’d be perfectly happy playing only with friends or running solo in a world populated by ARC, but I imagine that’s already set for development…</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-5-excellent">Verdict: 4.5/5 – Excellent</h2>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-actor-gta-6-100-price-tag/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-actor-thinks-grand-theft-auto-6-%E2%80%98warrants%E2%80%99-a-100-price-tag.1341028/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is mere months away from hitting the market (we hope), and fans are still busy theorizing over how much the game will cost. The price is yet to be set, and many feel that it could be the first standard game to hit the market with a $100 price tag.</p>



<p>The nature of that price tag has been widely debated by many, including the folks here at Insider Gaming. It’s believed that if any game can carry that price tag, it’s Grand Theft Auto 6. That’s a sentiment that was shared by a Grand Theft Auto actor during a recent interview with The Escapist.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-grand-theft-auto-6-cost-100">Should Grand Theft Auto 6 Cost $100?</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/jay-klaitz-exclusive-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Escapist</a>, Jay Klaitz, the actor behind the notorious Lester Crest in Grand Theft Auto 5, sat down to talk about all things GTA. He touched on his experiences acting the character and performing alongside the trio of leads in the game that debuted a whopping 12 years ago.</p>



<p>Talk naturally turned to Grand Theft Auto 6 and Klaitz’s expectations of the game, including the long-rumored price point.</p>



<p>He’s in the camp suggesting that, owing to the investment poured into creating a Grand Theft Auto game, it’s more than worth a $100 label.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yeah dude. I mean, GTA V was so heavy on the mocap. I assume that GTA VI will be the same way, and these games take so long to make. Years and years and years. It’s not like they’ve just been hanging out, chilling and then just started doing the work last year. They finished GTA V and then started on GTA VI more or less immediately thereafter.</p>



<p>This shit takes forever and as we saw with GTA V the game will come out and there will be other versions, there will be downloadable content, it will be online. You’re almost buying multiple games when you buy the one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would also like to see it made more accessible to more fans so I get that side of the argument too to make it affordable for folks. That’s cool too. Maybe there’s like a way to split the difference, but I share the sentiment that this game warrants that price tag. Yeah, I get that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Klaitz was talking about the post-launch window of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is set to drop in May 2026. He addressed hopes that Rockstar Games would ‘bring back old Lester’ in some kind of expansion that revisits the character.</p>



<p>It would work, given how we see heist footage in the newest GTA 6 trailers, and that fits nicely into Lester Crest’s wheelhouse.</p>



<p>Do you think Klaitz is right and that Grand Theft Auto 6 should cost $100? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-1-874/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-874-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-saturday-november-1.1341019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s November! That came around <strong>very fast</strong> this year, didn’t it? Halloween is now over and done with, and we can start looking to the festive season, and after that… 2026! Today, though, we’re looking a little smaller on the scale of time and considering today’s NYT Connections hints and answers.</p>



<p>I’ve got the best solutions you need to wrap up today’s NYT Connections puzzle and get on with your day. Read on to get all the hints you need to smash today’s challenge.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 1)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #874:</p>



<ul>
<li>RAVEN</li>



<li>PINKY</li>



<li>CHIP</li>



<li>JET</li>



<li>INKY</li>



<li>ROCKY</li>



<li>FILE</li>



<li>CLYDE</li>



<li>HARDY</li>



<li>SUE</li>



<li>TELLER</li>



<li>CHARGE</li>



<li>INDICT</li>



<li>ITCHY</li>



<li>PITCH</li>



<li>CHER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all legal actions that initiate or escalate a case.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these words is commonly used to describe a deep, rich black color — poetic and evocative.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>A fun twist — these are the “second” names in iconic duos.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>All animated rodents who take top billing in their respective pairs.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 1.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-1-874">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 1 (#874)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHARGE, FILE, INDICT, SUE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – INKY, JET, PITCH, RAVEN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CHER, CLYDE, HARDY, TELLER</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CHIP, ITCHY, PINKY, ROCKY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new report, it has been claimed that ‘dozens of’ Rockstar Games employees have been fired for misconduct in a wave that might have been a twisted form of union busting. </p>



<p>The report originally published by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier claims that between 30 and 40 Rockstar Games employees in the UK and Canada were terminated, and they were allegedly <strong>all </strong>part of a ‘private trade union chat’ on Discord.</p>



<h2 id="h-blatant-and-ruthless-layoffs-at-rockstar-games">‘Blatant and Ruthless’ Layoffs at Rockstar Games</h2>



<p>Rockstar Games is preparing to launch Grand Theft Auto 6 in just a few months, all being well. The studio has been piecing together the open-world crime epic for years, and fans are eagerly awaiting the delivery of what will arguably be the largest game launch in history.</p>



<p>But the most recent bit of news involving Rockstar Games isn’t all that positive.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTkzOTg3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyNTQ0NjcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTBISEpHUFFRNkMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9NYooKXrBMU_quRYMOSw6uACDogcIuS-E27t4GD8f2g&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> recently reported that Rockstar Games laid off 30 to 40 employees, labelling their dismissal terms as ‘misconduct’. However, a spokesperson of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claimed that it’s an attempt at preventing unionization amongst the team members:</p>

<p>Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Take-Two refuted the claims, suggesting that all the firings took place because of ‘gross misconduct,’ but all the employees were dismissed at the same time, per reports, and all of them were found to be in a private chat on Discord related to unionization.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games has mostly avoided the waves of layoffs that have hit the industry over the last couple of years. Take-Two, the company’s parent firm, hasn’t fared as well. In April 2024, the gaming titan laid off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/">around 5% of all employees</a> in a bid to streamline the business.</p>



<p>Do you think these alleged dismissals sound unlawful? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a></p>
