            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve and a multi-billionaire gaming legend, has secured a brand-new yacht, custom-built to his desires and fitted with a whopping fifteen ‘gaming stations.’ What’s the betting that at least one of them features a Steam Machine?</p>



<p>The ‘high-performance vessel’ will reportedly support ‘everything from world-class hospitality to scientific research’, as the yacht is equipped with a <strong>science lab and dive center</strong>, amongst other things. The 360-foot, hybrid beast chalked up a production cost of between $375 and $530 million, proving that Gaben is eating <strong>well</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-valve-on-the-open-seas">Valve on the Open Seas</h2>



<p>Gabe Newell, the eclectic founder of Valve, is said to be worth more than $10 billion. He spends most of his time <strong>living </strong>aboard yachts, and his recent addition to his collection, the ‘Leviathan’, is simply another arrow in the quiver of ocean-faring palaces.</p>



<p>It’s the 50th largest yacht in the world, custom-built to match everything that Newell desired, and in a statement, the Valve head honcho gushed over the creation of the thing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Working with the team at Oceanco is incredibly enjoyable and a lot of fun; everybody is professional, creative and dynamic. We knew we were asking for unusual things, and Oceanco embraced it with open arms. Not only have we designed a very unusual yacht that leans into Oceanco’s strengths of innovation and design, but the team has also been willing to collaborate with us on evolving the process.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It could also have been one hell of a tax swindle, given that Gabe Newell <strong>owns Oceanco</strong>, the shipyard that built the Leviathan, but that’s just a silly thing to say.</p>



<p>The Leviathan features a submarine garage, more than a dozen premium gaming PCs, racing sim rigs, a basketball court, a hospital, and more bedrooms, kitchens, and relaxation areas than you can shake a stick at. It has been dubbed the most comfortable yacht ever designed, and it certainly seems like it <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/oceanco-delivers-leviathan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per the yacht’s brochure</a>.</p>



<p>And in true gamer form, it’s surrounded by a ring of RGB lights.</p>



<p>This one-of-a-kind vessel will serve several purposes and won’t necessarily be Gaben’s new home, but it’s nice to know he has his pick of the lot when it comes to hyper-expensive boats.</p>







<p>Recently, Valve revealed a slew of new gaming devices, including a new Steam Deck, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/">a Steam Machine</a>, and the Frame, a new virtual reality headset.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-says-resident-evil-requiem-development-started-%E2%80%98way-before%E2%80%99-village.1355767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It turns out that while Capcom was working on its litany of scares for Resi 8, the developer was already working on Resident Evil Requiem, and it will be an inclusive entry.</p>



<p>The Ethan Winters journey is over in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-2026-showcase-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. We move on, and Grace Ashcroft heads up the mantle this time around. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors about Leon Kennedy</a> continue to swirl, Capcom has clearly had Grace’s chapter in mind for some time.</p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-is-over-6-years-in-the-making">Resident Evil Requiem Is Over 6 Years In The Making</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hands up (or out) if you’re excited. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve learned a lot about <a href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/11/15/resident-evil-requiem-interview-putting-the-horror-in-survival-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Press Start</a>‘s interview with Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa. One of the big takeaways is how long Capcom has worked on Resident Evil Requiem, and how its development coincided with Village’s creation.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Looking back, I understand how&nbsp;Resident Evil 4&nbsp;and Village became more action-heavy. Yes, that we have to admit. Looking back at the feedback, we understand how fans prefer more horror. Requiem was in development way before Village. We just wanted to make sure in this game, we wanted to focus on the horror and horror be the main part.&nbsp;I am not sure if all development teams are doing this, but I personally try to read as much or all the comments on social media.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kumazawa also elaborated further on Requiem’s journey: “So looking back on the online multiplayer game, <strong>it’s been in development for around six years or so.</strong>“</p>







<p>Despite the franchise being around for over 30 years, Capcom is still looking to attract new players. Kumazawa explained how Resident Evil Requiem’s development is looking to make it an accessible title:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I guess the one thing I want to let people know is that because Resident Evil is a long-running series, I want people to know they can still play Requiem and enjoy it. There are no prerequisites for the game or prior knowledge required. If this is a new game for them or their entry into the series, I want them also to enjoy this, and that any player can play thanks to difficulties like Casual. Please don’t think there are entry barriers to this game. But by saying that, I am not ignoring series fans. There are elements I have put in this that are very familiar, in the demo you can see leads and links that series fans will enjoy.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, whether you’re an old-school player or a newcomer, it will be inclusive for everyone.
