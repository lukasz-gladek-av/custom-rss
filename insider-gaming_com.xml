<p>Fantasy turn-based strategy game Songs of Conquest has an official mobile release date. Publisher Coffee Stain and developer Lavapotion have announced that Songs of Conquest will release on iOS and Android on March 13.</p>



<p>The game will be available for a one-time purchase of $11.99/£11.99.</p>



<p>Despite it being released on mobile, Coffee Stain says that it will be a full port of Songs of Conquest’s PC version. </p>



<p>“The teams at Coffee Stain and Lavapotion have worked hard to make sure that the experience of playing Songs of Conquest on mobile is seamless and immersive,” Christian Knutsson, Art Director at Lavapotion, said back when the mobile version <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/strategy-game-songs-of-conquest-coming-to-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first announced</a> in September.</p>



<p>Songs of Conquest first release in Early Access in May 2022. The game’s 1.0 launch on PC took place in May 2024, and has since released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Lavapotion also has multiple expansions and DLC plans in development for the game, the latest being the <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/swipe-right/pressreleases/songs-of-conquest-branches-out-with-roots-upcoming-new-dlc-3370453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently revealed Roots faction</a> for this summer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-rainbow-six-siege-top-esports-game-years-later/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2015, and today, it’s still going strong. Ubisoft has made this flagship shooter the poster boy for its esports ecosystem, and the millions of fans worldwide can attest to how popular it is. From multi-million-dollar tournaments to a game that never stops evolving, Rainbow Six Siege is <strong>still </strong>in a very good place in the wider esports industry.</p>



<p>That topic was broached by Gaming World Media at the recent Six Invitational tournament in Boston. The team caught up with François-Xavier Deniele, Ubisoft’s VP of Global Esports, to talk about how Rainbow Six esports got started and why it’s still such a popular game today.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-power-of-rainbow">The Power of Rainbow</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six is a legendary enough brand, but the strength of Siege is another talking point entirely. This game has stood firm for a decade, and it can be argued that in the last year or so, it has gotten <strong>increasingly popular</strong>.</p>



<p>Ubisoft refuses to relent when it comes to content updates and innovation, and most recently, the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/">uncovered Siege X</a>, a full-blown overhaul that’s poised to take Rainbow Six Siege to the next level.</p>



<p>Looking back to where it all started, Deniele explained to Gaming World Media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I want to just look back ten years ago, Ubisoft was not known at all as an esports company.</p>



<p>I remember having my first meeting with orgs and clubs, being a Ubisoft guy, when you have Blizzard, Riot, Valve… And ten years after, yeah, we’re at the table and we’re proven.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But what does it take to keep Rainbow Six Siege so stable after all these years?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For me, it’s to stay open. Listen to the community all the time, make sure that we are serving the game. We are not here to <strong>change </strong>the game. The game is here for a large community. Esports needs to be delivering the best of the game and not trying to change the game.</p>



<p>It’s very important for me that we have a lot of discussions about the evolution of the game and also we make sure that we are sticking with the reality of the game, where the game is important, and not trying to think that we can become big on esports where the game is not here.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Talking about the wider ecosystem, Deniele mentioned that a constant flow of fresh talent is pivotal to the ongoing success of an esports game. There’s also a lot to be said about the structure of that competitive scene, and having breaks and supporting grassroots endeavours are remarkably important elements.</p>



<p>That’s the nature of the Six Invitational, and it was portrayed perfectly by two ‘orgless’ teams making it so far into this year’s event. While some esports games might ‘gatekeep’ who can compete in their events, Rainbow Six Siege is, for the most part, wide open and super accessible.</p>

<p>A new Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater remaster is on the way. This according to what pro skateboarder Tyshawn Jones said during a radio appearance on February 18.</p>



<p>Talking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxPaLb7i-ezl_iTk1bqEwOkJmHOXgFbMax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New York’s Power 105.1 FM</a>, Jones gave away that a new game is set to be revealed and/or released in the near future.</p>



<p>“I’m in a Tony Hawk coming out so that’s cool,” he said. “They got a new one they remastering so that’s about to come out. I was in the last one.”</p>



<p>Talks surrounding the future of Tony Hawk games has been circulating for months. Back in September, Hawk himself said he was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking to Activision</a> about the future of the series.</p>



<p>“I wish I could tell you more,” Hawk said at the time. “But I can tell you that I’ve been talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting. We’re working on something.”</p>



<p>He then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on social media</a> that he wasn’t “supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future.”</p>

<p>The last Tony Hawk game to release was Tony Haw’s Pro Skate 1 + 2 in 2020. The game  was developed by Vicarious Visions, which has since been rebranded as Blizzard Albany after becoming fully merged into Blizzard Entertainment in 2022.</p>



<p>There had been rumors of a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remaster being in development, but nothing came of those at the time. Should Jones’ claims be accurate, it would seem to point to that being the game.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment on Jones’ claims of a new Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater remaster coming soon. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass will remove 9 games from their library on February 28, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass-in-february-nbsp">Games Leaving Xbox Game Pass in February&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Xbox recently revealed February’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wave 2</a> Game Pass titles, including the Day 1 game Avowed, Watch Dogs Legion, F1 22, and more. The same announcement indicated that 9 games will be removed from the subscription service at the end of February. The list includes the likes of F1 22, Warhammer 40,000: Bolton, Yakuza 3 Remastered, Yakuza 4 Remastered and more. Here is the complete list of the 9 games leaving Game Pass in February:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>F1 22 (Console and PC) EA Play</li>



<li>Gris (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Maneater (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>PAW Patrol World (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
