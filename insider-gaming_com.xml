<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows First Expansion ‘Claws of Awaji’ has been revealed to contain over 10 hours of additional content.</p>



<p>The new information comes courtesy of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, which was updated after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s recent delay</a>. </p>



<p>As a part of the update, the new description reads, “Pre-purchase now to get a bonus mission and the upcoming Claws of Awaji expansion. Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities.”</p>



<p>In addition to the Claws of Awaji, Insider Gaming also exclusively reported in October 2024 that Ubisoft is planning to release a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op mode for Shadows</a> and is currently under the codename ‘League’.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is now set to release on March 20, 2025, after an announcement from Marc-Alexis Côté said that the game needs a few additional weeks to implement changes based on feedback.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources, Côté’s statements reflect what is being handled internally, with staff saying that the delay is to ensure that the game is as polished as possible. </p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows had its first delay to February 14, 2025</a>, after it was announced that the game needed further polish, with sources behind the scenes also revealing that the team needed additional time to improve the authenticity of the game to its setting.</p>



<p>As for media previews, which were set to take place next week, it seems like we’ll have to wait a little longer for those, too, as Ubisoft is set to update on the dates.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/optic-halo-roster-2025-super-squad/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-assembles-halo-%E2%80%98super-squad%E2%80%99-for-2025-season.1078572/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-halo-roster-2025-super-squad/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>OpTic Gaming has come out on social media with a revelation regarding its 2025 Halo Championship Series roster. In a massive shakeup, it was revealed that going into the new season, FormaL, Bound, Renegade, and Lqgend will be flying the banner of Team Green.</p>



<p>Last season was tough for OpTic, with the team failing to secure a single major win but landing in second place no fewer than five times. The team fell short of the trophy at every HCS Major and Halo World Champs.</p>



<p>Every loss except for one came at the hands of Spacestation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-year-new-optic">New Year, New OpTic</h2>



<p>OpTic’s social media post announcing the team was met with jubilation from fans:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Some have already branded the team a ‘God Squad’, being as it is made up of some of the sharpest competitors in Halo esports today.</p>



<p>FormaL is an instantly recognisable force of nature, being one of just two esports pro players on Earth with world championship titles in <strong>two </strong>games. He has long been considered one of the best (if not <strong>the best</strong>) controller-based esports players ever seen.</p>



<p>Bound and Lqgend join OpTic Gaming from Spacestation – the very roster that wiped the floor with OpTic on so many occasions last year, which is ironic at best. Will the duo be able to start winning trophies for OpTic this season, rather than preventing victory at the last minute possible?</p>



<p>Finally, there’s Renegade, who joins OpTic Gaming from FaZe Clan, the only other team to pip OpTic to the post last season during an HCS Major.</p>



<p>These are some of the most storied, seasoned, and successful competitors in Halo esports. Could this be the year that OpTic Gaming lifts multiple trophies <strong>again</strong>? We’ll find out when the season starts.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlestate Games Has Extended The Flea Market Lockdown in Tarkov]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-flea-market-lockdown-extended/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-games-has-extended-the-flea-market-lockdown-in-tarkov.1078566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-flea-market-lockdown-extended/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has revealed on social media that it has been ‘actively monitoring community feedback’ in Escape from Tarkov, and as a result, it’ll be keeping the Flea Market locked down for a further five days. It was due to be unlocked <strong>now</strong> following December’s wipe, but it’ll now open up to all users on January 14.</p>



<p>This was seen by some as one of the most bizarre changes the developer has made in Escape from Tarkov. By locking down the Flea Market, BSG effectively put a stranglehold on the game’s peer-to-peer economy for a couple of weeks. Also, the studio made it impossible to use non-FIR items to upgrade the hideout, which was seen as another huge mistake.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-little-while-longer">A Little While Longer</h2>



<p>On social media, Battlestate Games wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are actively monitoring community feedback on Flea Market being locked and decided to extend the lock for 5 more days until January 14 3PM GMT / 10AM EST. </p>



<p>We would like to thank you on actively sharing the feedback and reporting the issues. We will continue working on technical fixes and balancing changes in the upcoming days.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to criticise the announcement, with many questioning which community the team was listening to, as ‘nobody wants this’. Even Pestily, the game’s biggest content creator, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t mind either way but where exactly where was this community feedback taken from? This would of been a perfect opportunity to use the in game survey to get active players polled for thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For the more skilful, talented players, having no Flea Market has added a deeper challenge to the game, but for casual players, it’s a bit more of a nightmare. Those who don’t have hours to while away on the game are left feeling choked. Many tend to rely on the Flea Market when they hit level 15 to build up their hideout, but that’s now impossible for two reasons.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good change, or has Battlestate Games missed the mark here? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has just released a game for the Switch called Overdungeon while their patent infringement battle with Nintendo continues.</p>
