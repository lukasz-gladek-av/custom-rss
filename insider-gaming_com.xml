<p>After a lot of feedback on the XP farm nerfs, Battlefield 6 developers have revealed that progression is being tested on PvE and curated servers. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 XP farms and bot lobbies were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-xp-bot-farming-portal-lobbies-nerfed-by-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerfed</a> recently, after players were seen using them to primarily earn XP, player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots.” However, since then, a lot of feedback has poured in, with players calling for solo lobbies for a more relaxed experience and the option to play as they wish. The developers have now responded to this feedback, revealing they will be testing progression in some curated BF6 servers. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-will-now-feature-progression-eligible-or-not-eligible-lobbies">Battlefield 6 Will Now Feature Progression Eligible or Not Eligible Lobbies </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/they-just-keep-winning-steam-was-already-beating-every-store-at-finding-games-and-it-just-got-better-with-custom-calendars-showing-recent-and-upcoming-games-valve-thinks-youll-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, community manager Shepard has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/811336158986581167/?ctp=2#c599667160179125243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to the feedback on the Battlefield 6 XP farm nerfs. Shepard first spoke about how the devs understand that many players “want full progression in solo/co-op and on curated custom servers—not just in matchmade PvP.” Some players have also expressed frustration with the game’s messaging regarding progression eligibility, whereas others worry about stat/leaderboard integrity and bot-farm exploits.</p>



<p>The developers understand that players with less time prefer low-stress PvE and still want meaningful unlocks, which is why they are enabling account XP and unlock/unlock-track progression in solo/co-op, as well as a curated list of community servers. However, to safeguard the integrity, K/D, leaderboards, and certain mastery tallies won’t update in these spaces during the test. If the data indicates low exploit/noise on these servers, they will expand eligibility. </p>



<p>At the same time, the developers don’t want XP farms in Battlefield 6, hence some anti-farm guardrails have been put in place. These include minimum difficulty, activity checks (AFK/loop detection), mixed target requirements, and sensible XP-per-minute caps. Any server that raises flags regarding exploits will lose its “Progression Eligible” status until the issue is fixed. Moreover, clear labelling will be put in place for Progression Eligible or Not Eligible on the browser and pre-match screens, with a short tooltip explaining the rationale.</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is bringing a brand-new main set, courtesy of Mega Rising. After some brief respite with Deluxe Pack ex, this is a fully fledged set, and it arrives at the end of October 2025.</p>



<p>We enjoyed the much-needed break Deluxe Pack ex gave us. It was a big expansion of recycled and effectively reprinted cards. This is fine, and it means we’ve been able to build up our Pack Hourglasses, and now they are ready to be splashed out frantically on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-debut-mega-evolution-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega</a> Rising.</p>

<p>Let’s face it, thanks to leaks, we already knew a decent amount <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising</a>. Still, it’s always cool actually seeing it announced, and you Pocket users might need to start rethinking your best decks.</p>



<p>The likes of Mega Gyarados ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Altaria ex, are going to cause havoc.</p>



<p>These special cards are loaded with HP, hard-hitting moves, but come with one massive caveat—a defeated Mega Pokémon is worth 3 points, and gives your opponent the immediate win.</p>



<p>Again, this is going to change up the strategy needed quite a bit. <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>‘s Mega Rising drops on October 30, and as it’s set B1, we’re expecting a LOT of cards to collect!</p>
