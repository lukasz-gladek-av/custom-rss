<p>In a recent interview on the XboxEra Podcast, Phil Spencer got talking about the future of Xbox showcases like the Developer Direct. In one segment, the conversation turned to Xbox using those stages to reveal multi-platform games, presenting both the Nintendo and PlayStation logos in trailers and title splashes.</p>



<p>It’s not the typical operating model, as most of these events are usually reserved for platform-specific trailers and promos. Recently, Xbox bucked that trend, showing off the PlayStation logo to let consumers know that whatever game is being showcased will be available on platforms <strong>other than </strong>Xbox.</p>

<h2 id="h-honest-and-transparent">‘Honest and Transparent’</h2>



<p>On the most recent episode of <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the XboxEra Podcast</a>, Phil Spencer spoke about the recent inclusion of PlayStation iconography in Xbox-backed showcases. In his words, that’s the set standard going forward, and players should expect to see more multi-platform imagery in trailers and broadcasts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s just being honest and transparent about where the games are showing, and we actually even had this discussion last year for the June showcase, and by the time we kind of made our decision, we couldn’t get all of the assets done and it felt weird to have some of them in and some of them out.</p>



<p>But I just want to be transparent with people – for shipping on Nintendo Switch, we’re gonna put that. For shipping on PlayStation, on Steam… People should know the storefronts where they can get our games, but I want people to be able to experience our Xbox community in our games and everything we have to offer, on every screen we can.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s all about openness and transparency, according to Spencer.</p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/">Forza Horizon 5</a> will be zooming onto PlayStation platforms later this year. That follows a few titles that were once exclusive to Xbox making their way onto the platform. There have also been rumours that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/">Gears and Halo</a> might head over to  PlayStation and Nintendo Switch at some point.</p>

<p>After 12 official matches as a team and only three during VCT Americas, NRG has benched Andrew “Verno” Maust and VALORANT coach Malkolm “bonkar” Rench. Following a strong performance at offseason events that resulted in high expectations, NRG has already made significant changes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-verno-and-bonkar-out-from-nrg-after-only-a-dozen-official-matches">Verno and Bonkar Out From NRG After Only a Dozen Official Matches</h2>



<p>Roster changes to the NRG VALORANT roster had been rumored since the conclusion of Kickoff, but were confirmed by the organization today. NRG’s Chief Gaming Officer Jaime Cohenca <a href="https://x.com/bikeage/status/1891179079015285152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> the benching is a result of a lack of cohesion that has been brewing for months.</p>



<p>“What I can say is that we put together a roster that was poised to contend for international championships but ultimately failed in terms of team cohesion,” Cohenca wrote on X. “Winning SEN City and SOOP [in the offseason] only delayed the effects of the issues brewing. The team no longer could function as constructed, so continuing with the current five players/head coach was not an option.”</p>



<p>“Given the nature of the VCT schedule, this break is pretty much the only window to make a roster move, so we are doing things now to be ready for when a Champs slot is on the line.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>VCT Roster Update: Verno and Bonkar have been moved to the NRG VALORANT reserve roster.

They will remain a part of NRG as we prepare for the remainder of the 2025 VCT season.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Long-time veterans of NRG in Sam “s0m” Oh, Pujan “FNS” Mehta, and Ethan “Ethan” Arnold will seemingly stay on the starting roster. Adam “mada” Pampuch, who joined the team during this past offseason, will also stay following an exceptional statistical performance at Kickoff. Some fans speculate that former coach Chetan “Chet” Singh could return when his suspension expires at the end of Masters Bangkok. Chet was suspended by Riot Games for streaming VODs deemed “confidential” on his personal channel.</p>



<p>NRG lost to Cloud9 and KRÜ at Kickoff, while managing to win against 100T in between those matches, but earned no points towards Champions qualification. Their season resumes when VCT Americas Stage 1 starts in late March.</p>



<p>Who should NRG bring on to the starting lineup? Let us know down below or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Rebel Wolves revealed Blood of Dawnwalker in January 2025, unveiling an intense vampire-themed game with dark and gritty undertones. It’s set to be an expansive open-world title that offers players the complete freedom to go where they want and kill whoever they desire.</p>



<p>The studio is being captained by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, a former director at CDPR who led the development of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. In a recent interview, Tomaszkiewicz’s brother, Mateusz, sat down to talk about the creative vision for Blood of Dawnwalker, revealing the focus on <strong>quality over quantity</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-our-games-are-not-as-huge">‘Our Games Are Not as Huge’</h2>



<p>Rebels Wolves’ representative, Mateusz Tomaskiewicz, explained that Blood of Dawnwalker is not a ‘huge game’ in terms of content and gameplay hours, but it is sizeable. This is Rebel Wolves’ debut project, and as such, it’s a little less ambitious than you might be expecting.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/ex-cdpr-devs-new-open-world-vampire-rpg-is-aiming-for-the-quality-level-of-the-witcher-3-but-since-its-a-smaller-studio-only-about-a-30-40-hour-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, it was revealed by Mateusz that Blood of Dawnwalker will have a story spanning around 30 – 40 hours, which is nowhere near the 100-hour average playthrough of 2015’s The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p>



<p>But that’s fine because Rebel Wolves is focused on creating something that shines rather than something that overwhelms the player with content and options:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In terms of quality, we definitely look at AAA, because this is where we are coming from, the quality level of The Witcher 3.</p>



<p>Definitely, our games are not as huge in terms of amount of content and gameplay hours – we are a smaller studio, this is our first project, so we definitely are building something smaller. But we want to build something as robust in terms of quality, maybe a bit shorter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This dark fantasy title will have players exploring a dark campaign littered with vampire interactions. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-first-trailer-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening trailer</a> released by Rebel Wolves stunned prospective players worldwide, painting the picture of a game that’s oozing with potential. It’ll hopefully be a gem of a title when it’s eventually released, we just don’t know when that will be at present.</p>



<p>Are you eager to pick up Blood of Dawnwalker when it’s released? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
