<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/gaming/story/_/id/48046034/wwe-2k26-ratings-reveal-rhea-ripley-stone-cold-steve-austin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">There was a ratings reveal on ESPN2</a> as part of the hype for the upcoming WWE Elimination Chamber event, and now we know the top 10 men and women in the game, all of whom exceed a rating of 90.</p>







<h2>WWE 2K26’s Top 10 Rated Men</h2>



<p>The men’s side of the top-ranked wrestlers in WWE 2K26 is interesting. Many of the names are just different variants of top wrestlers. There are plenty of wrestlers who take up multiple roster slots in modern WWE games, as each slot represents a different era of their career.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rhea Ripley: 96</li>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" id="177979">Bluepoint Studio</a> was recently shut down by Sony. A new report sheds some light on the studio’s closure, including the desire to remake Bloodborne and why that didn’t come to fruition.</p>



<p>The new report comes from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier of Bloomberg.</a> It was noted that following the cancellation of the live-service God of War game in January 2025, Sony was working closely with the studio to determine their next project. Also in early 2025, there was a pitch to remake Bloodborne. However, while they were told the numbers made sense, people familiar with the situation stated that FromSoftware didn’t want it to happen.</p>







<h2 id="h-bluepoint-studio-pitched-other-ideas">Bluepoint Studio Pitched Other Ideas</h2>



<p>The report also notes that Bluepoint pitched other PlayStation studios on developing new projects. One idea was a Ghost of Tsushima spinoff, but it was not approved. Other studios were said to be wary of allocating substantial resources to another team’s project, according to sources familiar with the situation.</p>



<p>It was also noted that when the God of War remake trilogy was announced without Bluepoint involved, some within the studio grew uneasy. One week later, it was announced that the studio was being shut down.</p>

<p>Jelly Roll is playable in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461">WWE 2K26.</a> The Grammy Award-winning country star is rated 80 overall. His rating was revealed as part of ESPN’s Ratings Reveal for the game.</p>



<p>Jelly Roll has been featured on WWE programming multiple times. At WWE SummerSlam 2025, he teamed with Randy Orton in a losing effort against Drew McIntyre and Logan Paul. Now, Roll can get his win back in the virtual squared circle for WWE 2K26.</p>

<h2 id="h-jelly-roll-isn-t-featured-on-wwe-2k26-s-soundtrack">Jelly Roll Isn’t Featured on WWE 2K26’s Soundtrack</h2>



<p>Earlier today, WWE Games revealed the full soundtrack for WWE 2K26. Jelly Roll is not featured on that soundtrack. Rather, this year’s tracks are heavy in the world of Rock. Linkin Park, Bad Omens, Turnstile, and Andrew WK got the nod instead. Check out the full soundtrack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-soundtrack-revealed-linkin-park-bad-omens-more-featured/" id="181124">here</a>.</p>







<p>Contemporary music artists in WWE games are not a new phenomenon. All the way back in the year 2001, Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit was featured in two WWE games: WWF Raw on the original Xbox and WWF SmackDown!: Just Bring It on the PlayStation 2. Other celebrities who have made it into WWE games include Tyrese Haliburton, Pat McAfee, Mr. T, and more.</p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>
