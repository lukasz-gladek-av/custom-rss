<p>A Pokémon&nbsp;and LEGO pairing was inevitable. The two media mammoths have finally come together to deliver a range of stunning LEGO sets, bringing out the best of brick-building and beloved ‘Mon. This guide has details on every Pokémon set, how much each one costs, and how to order them.</p>



<p>March 18 was a historic day as it was the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO x Pokémon partnership.</a> The era of Pokémon x Mega Bloks is sadly over, but as one legacy ends, a new one begins. LEGO has long been at the forefront of the premium, brick-building pastime.</p>



<p>The first-ever LEGO Pokémon Sets took a while to emerge from Viridian Forest, but they’re in the wild.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-lego-pokemon-set">Every LEGO Pokémon Set</h2>



<h3 id="h-eevee">Eevee</h3>

<p>Eevee is set #72151 and requires you to battle with 587 pierces to complete. This is likely only the beginning of the Eevee line, with the Eeveelutions surely to follow. For now, enjoy one of the cutest and most adorable Pokémon ever created.</p>







<h3 id="h-pikachu-and-poke-ball">Pikachu and Poké Ball</h3>

<p>Could you really have the first-ever LEGO Pokémon sets and not include at least one Pikachu model? This set is number #72152, has 2,050 pieces, and ensures the face of the franchise is featured in this fresh chapter.</p>



<h3 id="h-venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise">Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LEGO</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now for the fun part: Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise. It was back in 2025 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-pokemon-prices-have-possibly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Pokémon prices leaked and included a $649.99</a> item. The rumors were true, and the monstrous starter evolution set (#72153) has 6,838 pieces! </p>



<h3 id="h-kanto-region-badge-collection">Kanto Region Badge Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LEGO</figcaption></figure>



<p>#40892 is the Kanto Region Badge Collection, and is one of two items that can’t be purchased. Its 312 pieces are reserved for customers who purchase the LEGO Pokémon Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set—a heavy price for greatness.</p>



<h3 id="h-mini-pokemon-center">Mini-Pokémon&nbsp;Center</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LEGO</figcaption></figure>



<p>The fifth and final set in the first LEGO Pokémon collection is the Mini-Pokémon&nbsp;Center—otherwise known as #40911. Again, just like the Kanto Region Badge Collection set, you can’t buy this beauty outright. More on this below.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-pre-order-lego-pokemon-sets">How To Pre-Order LEGO Pokémon Sets</h2>



<p><strong>To pre-order LEGO Pokémon Sets, you need to either go directly to the official LEGO online store in your region or find an applicable outlet that stocks LEGO Pokémon Sets.</strong></p>



<p>The official LEGO website is the handy hub for all LEGO Pokémon sets. A dedicated <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LEGO Pokémon</a> section has all the sets you can buy, and information on the special mini-sets. Do note that everything will usually be full price here, but you can score LEGO Insiders Points with every purchase—used to get discounts on future sets, gain access to unique sets, and earn rewards.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can pop into nearby physical stores to see if you can pre-order any of the LEGO Pokémon Sets to pick up in person, and there’s the option to pre-order using a different online outlet.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-do-lego-pokemon-sets-cost-price-amp-how-to-get-explained">How Much Do LEGO Pokémon Sets Cost? Price &amp; How To Get, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The first LEGO Pokémon sets range from $59.99 to a whopping $649.99 for the most expensive</strong> <strong>set.</strong></p>



<p>A major and obvious downside was always going to happen with official LEGO Pokémon sets: High costs that get much bigger the more advanced the set gets.</p>



<p>To make this easy, here’s a handy table showing the Pokémon sets with all necessary details.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">LEGO Pokémon Set Name</th><th data-align="center">How To Get</th><th data-align="center">Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eevee</td><td data-align="center">Buy normally.</td><td data-align="center">$59.99 / £54.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu and Poké Ball</td><td data-align="center">Buy normally.</td><td data-align="center">$199.99 / £179.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise</td><td data-align="center">Buy normally.</td><td data-align="center">$579.99 / £9.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kanto Region Badge Collection</td><td data-align="center">Special gift with purchases of the Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set.</td><td data-align="center">Not available to purchase.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mini-Pokémon&nbsp;Center</td><td data-align="center">Can be bought for 2,500 LEGO Insiders Points.</td><td data-align="center">Not available to purchase.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>The first five LEGO Pokémon sets have been revealed, and they feature iconic Pokémon like Eevee, Pikachu, Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur. </p>



<p>The LEGO x Pokémon partnership was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in 2025</a>, and since then, fans have been eagerly awaiting what kinds of sets this collaboration will entail. The five new sets are intricate pieces where you can not only recreate some of the most popular Pokémon in the series, but also badges and Pokémon centers. </p>







<h2 id="h-lego-pokemon-sets-prices-release-and-other-details">LEGO Pokémon Sets: Prices, Release, and Other Details </h2>



<p>A post by <a href="https://www.thebrickfan.com/lego-pokemon-2026-sets-officially-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Brick Fan</a> reveals the first-ever collection of LEGO Pokémon sets, and they are set to release on February 27, 2026. The first three sets feature beloved Pokémon from the games, Pikachu, Eevee, Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise. In contrast, the other two include a Kanto region Badge set and a Mini Pokémon Center. Learn more details about each LEGO Pokémon Set below, including price, pieces included and more. </p>



<h3 id="h-pikachu-with-poke-ball">Pikachu with Poké Ball </h3>



<p>The first one features the most iconic Pokémon of all, Pikachu, leaping out of a Poké Ball. It is a 2,050-piece set that features a black lighting-rod-shaped base and blue lighting coming out of the Poké Ball. The price for LEGO Pokémon Pikachu with Poké Ball set is $199.99. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-eevee">Eevee</h3>



<p>Next up is Eevee, another fan favourite, which is the smallest out of the 3 Pokémon-based sets. Coming at 587 pieces, the Eevee set also features movable tail, head, and limbs, allowing builders to change the pose as they like. The LEGO Pokémon Eevee set has been priced at $59.99. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise">Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise</h3>



<p>The Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise LEGO set is the biggest of them all, featuring the final evolutions of all the Kanto region starter Pokémon. Coming at 6,838 pieces, it features themed pedestals for each of the Pokémon, with flora under Venusaur, a volcano under Charizard, and a waterfall under Blastoise. It seems these three LEGO Pokémon can be placed on their own as well. The LEGO Pokémon Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise is the most expensive of the lot, priced at $649.99. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-kanto-region-badge-collection">Kanto Region Badge Collection</h3>



<p>Next, we have the Kanto Region Badge Collection, which consists of Gym Badges that players can collect in this region. It is a 312-piece set; however, it cannot be purchased conventionally. The only way to get your hands on the LEGO Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection set is by receiving it as a gift with purchase when buying the LEGO Pokémon Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set. The offer is only available between February 27 and March 8, 2026. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-mini-pokemon-center">Mini Pokémon Center</h3>



<p>Last but not least is the Mini Pokémon Center, the best place to give all your Pokémon a good rest after a strenuous battle. It is a mini-replica of the Pokémon Center that also features a place to rest small Poké Balls. Similar to the Kanto Region Badge Collection, the LEGO Pokémon Mini Pokémon Center can’t be purchased conventionally; it is reserved for LEGO Insiders members and can be bought for 2,500 Insider Points while stocks last.</p>
