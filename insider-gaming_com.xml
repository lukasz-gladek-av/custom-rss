<p>Resident Evil Requiem features a brand-new protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, and the devs recently spoke about how she differs from other protagonists. </p>



<p>Capcom seems to be cooking up a storm with Resident Evil Requiem, and the anticipation is only going higher as the release date draws closer. Recently, the developers revealed during an interview that the upcoming title will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters from previous games</a>. Now, the producer has opened up about how Requiem’s Grace is different from other main characters. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-s-grace-is-an-ordinary-person-but-is-a-bit-more-used-to-guns">Resident Evil Requiem’s Grace is An Ordinary Person, But is a ‘Bit More Used to Guns’ </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://checkpointgaming.net/features/2025/11/we-speak-with-producer-masato-kumazawa-about-resident-evil-requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CheckpointGaming</a>, Resident Evil Requiem’s producer Masato Kumazawa was asked to talk about Grace. Kumazawa explained that the whole point is “scaring the players,” and, from his perspective, “she is the most scared or easily prone to being scared protagonist in the series.” The producer added that he wants other players to “be scared with her and enjoy the atmosphere with her,” noting that “she’s an ordinary person.” </p>



<p>However, Requiem’s Grace is an FBI Analyst, which makes her well-versed with guns. At the same time, when comparing characters like Chris and Leon, “they’re not like, ‘Oh, we get a gun, and we start shooting everything,’ or we get to close combat and have no problem.” When talking about ordinary, Kumazawa believes that Ethan is “the most ordinary in terms of just saying normal”; Grace is just a bit more used to guns than he is. </p>



<p>Kumazawa added that Grace is not an expert like Leon or Chris. They aim to make players feel they have limited resources and to have them figure out “what they can do with the limited amount of things that they have.” The game is closer to “classic type of horror survival,” but it’s not all classic as there are “new elements and new weapons in order to make it more fun.”</p>







<p>In other news, a new claim states Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-definitely-has-one-dlc-in-the-works-right-now-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely has at least one DLC in development</a>. Additionally, the upcoming title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to sell better than RE Village</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is gearing up to welcome Season 1 and all of its new content across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. The Season 1 Battle Pass is the first for Black Ops 7, and Treyarch has announced sweeping changes ahead of launch.</p>



<p>Many people take exception to the live-service Battle Pass model, especially when you’ve already paid full price for a game. Some companies do it better than others, and Call of Duty passes can be hit or miss. The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-battle-pass-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Battle Pass</a> is nearly here, and Treyarch is making it better than ever.</p>

<p>Treyarch announced lots of new content for Black Ops 7 Season 1 on November 24. We learned about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-adds-new-weapons-and-attachments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapons and attachments</a>, as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-multiplayer-receives-8-new-modes-in-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight new modes</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-is-getting-six-new-multiplayer-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six new multiplayer maps</a>.</p>







<p>However, one of the bigger talking points emerged after the content was revealed. In a post on X, Treyarch unveiled various tweaks and adjustments to “Significantly improve the Battle Pass experience for all Black Ops 7 and Call of Duty: Warzone players.”</p>



<p>Here are the key updates:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Tuning adjustments” have been made regarding Battle Pass completion times. This should ensure every Black Ops 7 pass will be “more rewarding for the time you spend playing.”</li>



<li>“Earlier pages in the Black Ops 7 Battle Pass can now be completed faster with fewer tiers needed to unlock HVT content, while later pages will contain more rewards. This means players will earn high-value content sooner across all 100 tiers.”</li>



<li>Finally, Battle Pass Tokens can be earned through Daily Challenges—also available in Co-Op Campaign &amp; Endgame.</li>
</ul>



<p>The comments on the post were generally positive. But one key change wasn’t addressed that was frequently mentioned: Having the content be available <em>once </em>the pass expires. It remains to be seen if this is something Treyarch looks at for future Black Ops 7 Battle Passes.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dan-houser-left-rockstar-games-due-to-disagreement-with-brother-over-companys-direction-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dan-houser-left-rockstar-games-due-to-disagreement-with-brother-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1363864/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The very foundations of Rockstar Games were rocked in 2020 when Dan Houser left. Losing a co-founder was tough, but a source claims that the communication breakdown actually stemmed from a disagreement between Dan and his brother Sam.</p>



<p>Dan Houser has usually shied away from the spotlight over the years. But the Absurd Ventures founder has been more vocal in recent weeks. His sit-down interview with Lex Fridman revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-co-founder-reveals-real-reason-why-agent-was-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real reason why Agent was canceled</a>, and he’s also opened up on why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-2-rockstar-development-bandwidth-dan-houser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bully 2 never happened</a>.</p>



<p>A new unofficial line has opened up on his Rockstar Games departure.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-games-direction-is-why-dan-houser-left">Rockstar Games’ Direction Is Why Dan Houser Left</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Where would the franchise be now? Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you know anything about GTA leaks, you probably know how reliable and revered Tez2 is in the GTA community. They’ve been a constant source of major GTA and Rockstar leaks for years.</p>







<p>So when the topic of Dan Houser leaving Rockstar Games recently popped up on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/page/6/#comment-1072611067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTAForums</a>, Tez2 stepped in with a claim. One user asked: “We will probably never know exactly the reasons why [Dan Houser left], but I’m not the only one with this opinion, and pretending everything is hunky dory at Rockstar is baffling, especially when we keep hearing bad things coming from people working at a company that is in the middle of a union-busting scandal.”</p>



<p>Here was Tez2’s response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“He left over a disagreement with his brother about the company’s direction, as per two former devs. If it was due to union busting or working conditions, he would have left in 2018 as a way of apologizing for his comment quoted in Schreier’s article.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was in response to the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games firings</a>. Tez2 makes it clear that the two issues are not connected, but again, this isn’t official until this is all confirmed in the books one day.</p>



<p>Do you think Dan Houser’s exit will affect the quality of GTA 6? Should the brothers reunite for at least one more big project in the future?
