<p>Call of Duty 2025 zombies could have six fully-fledged round-based zombies maps throughout the games life cycle, Insider Gaming has learned.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Call of Duty 2025, which will be led by Treyarch Games, could have a total of six round-based zombies maps during the games lifecycle. Details of what Call of Duty 2025 is shaping up to be is already an open secret, including that the game is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2 sequel</a> and that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original zombies crew is likely making a return</a>.</p>



<p>In the maps early development, it’s understood that the plan for zombies was to build the maps from the ground up to allow them to be played in different gamemodes including traditional round-based, grief, and outbreak. </p>



<p>Its understood that Treyarch was playing around with more “out there” settings this time around, including a map set in post-WW2 New York where the Nazi’s had dropped a nuclear bomb, with another map being described as being set in a Japanese temple at the foot of an erupting volcano. </p>



<p>Other ideas included a map set in Vietnam, one in Afghanistan, and another out-there idea of one being set in a space station in the Dark Aether. </p>



<p>As already leaked from a feedback session, it’s also understood that Call of Duty 2025 zombies will have one of its biggest maps to date and have a similar transportation system to Tranzit. </p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on if Treyarch went with every idea, but we’d expect at least a few to make it into the final game.</p>



<p>What do you think of the map ideas and the original zombies crew returning to the Call of Duty zombies in some form?

<p>Recently, it was announced that after just a few months on the market and amid the failure of the game’s first season, both Spectre Divide and Mountaintop Studios will be shutting down next month. Spectre Divide, an ambitious first-person multiplayer shooter, was first released in August 2024, but the player base quickly dwindled.</p>



<p>The Mountaintop team revealed that, despite funding, the game isn’t making enough money to remain online or support the studio, so it’s being closed down. In response, the team at FragPunk, which is another free-to-play multiplayer shooter released just a week ago, posted an image on social media that has been slammed as ‘disgusting’ by the Mountaintop team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-might-not-age-well">That Might Not Age Well</h2>



<p>The FragPunk post has now been removed, but not before eagle-eyed gamers grabbed screenshots:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>One of the first people to share this online was Marcus Schubert, one of the producers working at Mountaintop Studios. He <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/schuby_netease-games-this-is-disgusting-shame-activity-7306005072939794432-SxA6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>NetEase Games, this is disgusting. Shame on you. For those unaware, the top post is our farewell letter indicating that Mountaintop Studios is shutting down.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>FragPunk is published by NetEase, the same gaming titan behind the overwhelmingly successful Marvel Rivals. The post was likely the work of a social media intern or community manager somewhere, but that shouldn’t be used as an excuse to brush it under the rug. </p>



<p>At a time when studio closures, cancellations, and layoffs are tearing the industry apart, publishers and developers should support one another rather than mocking the downfall of a hard-working team. If recent trends are anything to go by (XDefiant and Concord, for example), then FragPunk shouldn’t potentially be casting stones in a glass house.</p>



<p>Presently, FragPunk has a peak on Steam of more than 110,000 players, while Spectre Divide peaked at just 26,200. However, XDefiant had millions of players, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/">we all know what happened</a> with that.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is on the way soon, and various Japanese analysts are expecting the console’s price to be around $400 or more when it releases.</p>



<p>In a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, many expect the system to be the most expensive in Nintendo’s history—the original Switch launched at $299—but still have no problem moving units right away.</p>



<p>“They will sell boatloads of Switch 2 in the first months in particular, almost regardless of the price,” Tokyo-based analyst Serkan Toto told Bloomberg. “We can expect a great software lineup in year one, from new&nbsp;Mario Kart&nbsp;and&nbsp;3D Mario&nbsp;after eight years to&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;and&nbsp;Metroid Prime 4.&nbsp;There will also be third-party support from day one, most probably including blockbusters like&nbsp;Call of Duty.”</p>



<p>As far as a release date is concerned, multiple analysts expect a June launch for the console. One analyst, Robin Zhu of Sanford C. Bernstein believes there will be inventory of 6-8 million consoles available on day one. </p>



<p>“That suggests that if early sales go as planned, the new console would mark the biggest console launch ever,” Bloomberg writes.</p>
