<p>It seems Rainbow Six Siege players are being banned again; what’s more, the ban is for 67 days, inspired by the viral ’67’ meme. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Rainbow Six Siege servers shut down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-hack-servers-shut-down-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after a massive hack</a> late last month, which led to multiple developer-only skins, billions of credits, and bans. Siege and the Marketplace were intentionally shut down while the team resolved the issue; however, it appears Ubisoft hasn’t yet reached a solution. </p>







<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-siege-hands-out-67-day-bans-inspired-by-viral-67-meme">Rainbow Six Siege Hands Out 67-Day Bans, Inspired by Viral “67” Meme</h2>



<p>If you haven’t heard about the viral ‘6-7’ trend, then you are better off not knowing about it; however, it has somehow made its way into Rainbow Six Siege in the most surprising way possible, with several players reportedly receiving 67-day bans. The cause for these bans is unclear; however, a screenshot posted by vxunderground on <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/2007891913425531290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/rainbow-six/rainbow-six-siege-hacked-again-as-breach-triggers-67-day-bans-3300391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> reveals that these 67-day bans are being handed out “due to harassment”. Additionally, if players head to the Rainbow Six Siege <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status</a> page, they will see “4 unplanned issues” across every platform the game is available on. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege has been compromised (again). Social media is filled with players complaining about being banned for "67 days", a reference to the "Six Seven" meme. <a href="https://t.co/1gYvvoU3WT">pic.twitter.com/1gYvvoU3WT</a></p>— vx-underground (@vxunderground) <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/2007891913425531290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Due to the appearance of the viral meme number 67, players believe Rainbow Six Siege has been hacked again. However, Ubisoft has yet to confirm that it has been hacked again. To fix the earlier issue, Ubisoft had begun a “rollback of all transactions” that occurred after the hack, followed by extensive quality control tests “to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.”</p>







<p>In other news, Rainbow Six Mobile will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-mobile-releasing-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release globally in February 2026</a>. Players in Canada, France, Poland, and LATAM can download and play the test version of the game now. What are your thoughts on Rainbow Six Siege players receiving viral ’67’ meme-inspired bans?

<p>CES 2026 is here and that means another keynote speech from Nvidia. While, usually, CEO Jensen Huant takes the stag and reveals a brand new graphics card for players, that won’t be the case this year.</p>



<p>Shortly before the company’s scheduled keynote on Monday, Nvidia confirmed that no new GPUs will be announced during the event. There also won’t be any sort of GPU announcement during Nvidia’s <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/2008176911747371438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2008176911747371438%7Ctwgr%5E4123a5ccd62e9a05d4cd884725a5b1bd7c63d3e5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvideocardz.com%2Fnewz%2Fnvidia-confirms-no-rtx-50-super-gpus-at-ces-2026-but-promises-updates-for-gamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GeForce On community update</a> broadcast on Monday night.</p>







<p>That means that the rumored RTX 50 Super graphics card isn’t coming just yet. As far as what is coming, Nvidia is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-to-reveal-dlss-4-5-at-ces-2026/">expected to unveil DLSS 4.5</a> during the annual event. The major update to the technology will include newer Super Resolution paths as well as the ability for RTX 50 series cards to generate up to six times the number of frames. </p>



<p>While no new graphics cards might be disappointing to some, it doesn’t feel like much of a surprise. The consumer electronics industry, specifically PCs, is going through a tumultuous time. The continued rise of AI and Data Centers have made components like storage, memory, and others in scarce supply. That’s led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extreme price increases</a>, leaving regular enthusiasts out in the cold. </p>

<p>A new datamine has revealed Monster Hunters Wilds Switch 2 port details, and it seems the game could run at 30FPS with DLSS enabled on Nintendo’s latest console. </p>



<p>Rumours about a Monster Hunter Wilds Switch 2 port have been circulating for a while now, with dataminers constantly providing new details through the latest update. One of the recent posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pyv6pp/more_info_on_mh_wilds_for_switch_2_including/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> discusses Monster Hunter: Wilds Switch 2 data on local multiplayer, DLSS, NPC Culling, and more. Now, details on the graphics preset have also surfaced online. </p>







<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-switch-2-preset-seemingly-runs-better-than-the-very-low-preset-on-pc">Monster Hunter Wilds Switch 2 Preset Seemingly Runs Better than the ‘Very Low’ Preset on PC</h2>



<p>Spotted by Necrolipe on <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/2007523103845253447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/evidence-grows-for-a-nintendo-switch-2-port-of-monster-hunter-wilds-including-a-glimpse-at-how-it-could-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the Chinese group responsible for the recent Monster Hunter Wilds datamines has revealed graphics details for the Switch 2 port. The details revealed that the game will run at 30 FPS with DLSS enabled and at 1080p when docked. It is said to have “better fidelity” than the ‘very low’ graphics preset for the PC version of the game. Necrolipe’s post also provides a video based on the datamining preset; however, it doesn’t represent the final version of the port. </p>

<p>It doesn’t seem too far-fetched for Capcom to create a Switch 2 port for Monster Hunter Wilds, considering they have already planned Day One releases for their next flagship title, Resident Evil Requiem, as well as Pragmata, Monster Hunter Stories 3, and Mega Man. Additionally, the developers have also revealed that Resident Evil Village and Resident Evil 7 Biohazard will also be released on the platform alongside Requiem. </p>







<p>In other news, Monster Hunter Wilds received its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Title Update 4</a> last month, along with a roadmap for the following updates. Additionally, Monster Hunter Wilds was the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-showcase-announced-for-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game of 2025&nbsp;</a>earlier in the year.
