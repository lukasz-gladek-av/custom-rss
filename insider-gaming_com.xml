<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s update Ver.2006.005.003.004.003 is live now. It allows players to access all stages when playing couch coop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, when players tried to play local multiplayer in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, they were restricted to one stage, The Hyperbolic Time Chamber. After the new patch, you can fight against your friends in all of the game’s 12 stages, allowing you to experience high-speed 3D battles with beautiful visuals and destructible environments.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-balancing-changes-in-new-sparking-zero-patch">Balancing Changes in New Sparking Zero Patch</h2>



<p>The new Dragon Ball Sparking Zero patch also features several character adjustments; check them out below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Android 19 and Dr. Gero’s amount of stamina and energy absorbed during a successful throw has been changed. Also, Dragon Dash, rapid ascend, and fast descent will consume energy when using these characters.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Cell 2nd can now throw-escape&nbsp;</li>



<li>Cooler’s transformation now recovers an increased amount of stamina.&nbsp;</li>

<p>The official Balatro <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1866905061609078866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) revealed that the poker-inspired roguelike deck builder game had sold 3.5 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developed by LocalThunk and published by Playstack, Balatro has hit the 3.5 million units sold milestone within its first year of release. In this game, you use unique Joker cards to combine them with valid poker hands to create new possibilities. The title is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balatro has also introduced several collaborations over the years, featuring unique cards from popular games like Cyberpunk 2077, Among Us, The Witcher, Stardew Valley, and more. Recently, CD Projekt Red repaid the favour by adding a Balatro-themed side quest to Cyberpunk 2077 in its recently released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-2-2-includes-hidden-balatro-quest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update 2.2</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a recent interview, Sony Group confirmed its intentions to acquire Kadokawa Group, and the FromSoftware parent company employees seem to be happy about the acquisition.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-sony-confirms-interest-in-acquiring-fromsoftware-parent-company-nbsp">Sony Confirms Interest in Acquiring FromSoftware Parent Company&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In a conversation with <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/7539b7b0e14d496a2780f1145474eb5a69163c16?page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yahoo Japan</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/elden-ring/221084/news/sony-confirms-interest-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), a representative of the Sony Group stated, “It is true that we have expressed our initial intentions. We would appreciate it if you would refrain from commenting further.” This provides official confirmation from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-confirms-acquisition-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both parties</a> that Sony is indeed looking to acquire Kadokawa Group.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-kadokawa-employees-are-happy-about-sony-acquisition">Kadokawa Employees Are Happy about Sony Acquisition</h2>



<p>The interview also included comments from a veteran Kadokawa employee who revealed that “other employees are happy about Sony’s acquisition” as they are “dissatisfied with the Natsuno administration”.” The veteran added that the other employees hoped President Natsuno’s employment would be terminated once Sony acquired the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also provided an example stating that the current administration “did not even hold a press conference when personal information was leaked due to a cyber attack” <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-group-hack-fromsoftware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sony and Kadokwa have been discussing a potential partnership for years; however, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=73612&amp;action=edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">degree of commitment</a> seems to be the issue. The FromSoftware parent company recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-parent-company-confirms-20-upcoming-console-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed 20 upcoming console games</a>.

<p>Early images of what could be a new live-service IP by Bend Studio’s have been posted online.</p>



<p>The images came from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-sony-bend-new-ip-in-development-screenshots-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, who say that the images came from the portfolio of an undisclosed UI designer at Bend Studio who have been working there since March 2022. According to the outlet, the images originate from a Google Drive that where uploaded sometime in 2023, but it’s unclear on when exactly the images where taken.</p>



<p>They reveal that Bend Studio appears to be working on, or has worked on, some live-service military shooter. </p>

<p>As some people have already pointed out, the one image above appears to be some kind of central hub where players could interact. However, without knowing the full context of the images, it’s possible that this is just a design level for the game, to test out different aspects and isn’t intended for final use.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-next-game-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Job listings</a> have already pointed to Bend Studio’s next game being some kind of live service, and with how the industry has been going all-in with Battle Royales and extraction shooters in the past few years, it isn’t difficult to imagine that Bend Studio could be going in that direction.</p>



<p>For now, though, we’ll have to wait and see what exactly they are developing.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, Bend Studio’s next game has been in development for four to five years, so we should start to hear more about it soon.</p>



<p>What do you think Bend Studio is developing? Are you excited about another potential live-service battle royale/extraction shooter? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
