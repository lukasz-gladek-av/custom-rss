<p>Use these Roblox Merge And Fight monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Seeds, Buckets, Potions and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Merge And Fight is a fusion of Plants Vs Brainrots and the iconic Plants vs. Zombies title. Players must increase their total output and total DPS to build the best garden filled with the finest plants. Furthermore, one must defeat the most profitable high-HP brainrots to increase their revenue contribution. This is when the active Merge And Fight codes come into play. Redeem these <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-survive-wave-z-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> codes to have your inventory overflowing with various Potions and Gears. New players using the codes will quickly secure the finest early-game brainrots and build the most damage-inflicting plants without grinding.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-merge-and-fight-codes">How To Redeem Merge And Fight Codes?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Merge And Fight Code Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Follow the steps below to redeem all the active codes:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Merge And Fight and spawn on the map.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Hit the “Store” button.</li>



<li>Scroll down to the last or press the “Redeem Code” key to see the code box.</li>



<li>Enter any code into the “Enter Code” text box.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Press the “Redeem” button to activate the code.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-more-about-merge-and-fight-codes">More About Merge And Fight Codes</h2>



<p>Gears claimed from the active codes have the following use:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Wooden Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 30 seconds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Freeze Grenade – Throws to freeze brainrots for a while.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Shuriken – Throw to deal 120 damage and bounce 2 additional times.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gloves – Click to deal 600 damage to brainrots.</li>



<li>Iron Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 3 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Golden Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 10 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Damage Potion – All plants ATK +50%, lasts 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Brainrot Potion – Legendary+ brainrot spawn chance +100%, lasts 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<p>Use the free Potions when you see boss brainrots walking down the Brainrot Portal. Freeze Grenades are useful because they can stun high HP brainrots and bring them down slowly. When you place rare plants, they’ll take quite some time to grow. This is when you must use the Bucket gears. They will help you ignore the annoying waiting time and quickly set up a sturdy defence in your garden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eidos-Montreal, the studio known for developing Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and supporting games like Tomb Raider and others, has had more layoffs.</p>



<p>Over the last week, a number of now former employees took to LinkedIn to announce that they were no longer with the company.</p>







<p><strong>“Hey there!”</strong> gameplay director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7398821593012989953/?originTrackingId=HOT3SE08iXRoDN1N9LEmuQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Daher wrote</a>. <strong>“Was working at Eidos, loved it and would have stayed, but times are difficult.”</strong></p>



<p>In total, at least a dozen or more people are now looking for work. This is the second known wave of job cuts at the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after 75 people were let go</a> back in March. At the time, it was said that the layoffs were done due to “mandates coming to an end”.</p>



<p>And while one would hope that the latest layoffs are the end, that doesn’t appear to be the case. In recent days, multiple sources have explained to Insider Gaming most projects at the studio have been cancelled. The focus for Eidos-Montreal right now, they say, is on the work it’s doing with Microsoft and Xbox on games like Grounded 2 and Fable. There’s also another internal project that started development in 2019 which, sources say, has no way of recouping its current costs. </p>



<p>After those projects wrap, however, <strong>“additional staff reductions are already forecasted.”</strong></p>







<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out to both Eidos-Montreal and its parent company Embracer for comment. As of writing, no responses have been received. In the past, Embracer has often declined to give an official comment on subjects such as layoffs and internal development projects. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new leak on social media for Fortnite hints at a huge collaboration with South Park. The event, if true, would have several big elements like a Rift Anomaly and multiple mech skins.</p>



<p>Chapter 7 of Fortnite has been off to a great start for fans. Not only did players get&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Kill Bill collaboration</a>, but skins for Back to the Future and a new map. With the live-service title collabing with basically every IP out there, there’s one vulgar one that would feel right at home: South Park. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rumors of a collab</a> have been here and there, but one reliable Twitter user dropped a huge leak as to what South Park will be like in Fortnite.</p>











<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>SOUTH PARK x FORTNITE IS A BIG COLLAB</p><p>• MULTIPLE SKINS AS MECHS<br>• Rift Anomaly: "Everyone Kills Kenny"  <br>• At least 1 Boss on the map<br>• Stick of Truth Mythic<br>• Respawn Token/Medallion<br>• Unknown Consumable<br>&amp; more.. <a href="https://t.co/veNGth1U9k">pic.twitter.com/veNGth1U9k</a></p></div>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1995938479830929447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1995938479830929447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>, a well-known leaker in the Fortnite community. They’ve gotten many details from past seasons correct and are generally accurate. This time, the leak pertains to South Park, as it is seemingly making its way into Fortnite. While no date was given as to when, information regarding the collab has dropped.</p>



<p>As it seems, the Fortnite x South Park collab will feature skins for the mechs and a few collectibles. However, the biggest ones are that a Boss will spawn on the map relating to the adult-animated series. Furthermore, a Rift Anomaly, aptly titled “Everyone Kills Kenny,” will be part of it, though no details on how it will play out were stated.</p>



<p>Given the recent popularity of South Park, it’s no surprise to see it collaborate with Fortnite. It wouldn’t be South Park’s first foray into gaming, as the show has garnered two RPGs and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/south-park-snow-day-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other tie-in games</a>. In fact, South Park: The Stick of Truth was a hit with critics and fans, being a near-ideal translation from its TV counterpart. While Fortnite’s version may be toned down for the player base, it’s sure to hit the same marks it did in 1997.</p>







<p>What do you think of the South Park x Fortnite leak? Excited to see more? Which characters do you want to see in the game? Want South Park to get The Simpsons treatment in Chapter 6?
