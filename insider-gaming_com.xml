<p>A new multiplayer mod for The Witcher 3, called ‘Witcher Online’, lets players complete the entire campaign with their friends. </p>



<p>There appears to be a lot happening with the Witcher franchise. Reports suggest that a new DLC is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to arrive by May 2026</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next installment is also in development</a>. However, it seems we have a long wait ahead before these releases become available. In the meantime, players can explore a mod that significantly enhances the original game’s replayability. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-online-mod-features-customization-emotes-and-full-campaign-experience">The Witcher Online Mod Features Customization, Emotes, and Full Campaign Experience </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/multiplayer-mod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, a new mod for The Witcher 3 has surfaced on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NexusMods</a> called Witcher Online. The mod adds multiplayer to the title, allowing players to play through the entire story with their friends. The mod features chat functionality for conversations with strangers, along with emotes to express yourself even more.</p>



<p>The Witcher Online Mode can be combined with the Custom Player Characters mod to add more customisation, and the Chill Out mod just to have a relaxing time in the taverns with your friends. Check out the The Witcher 3 multiplayer mod in action in the video below: </p>

<p>Players will need a non-pirated next-gen version of The Witcher 3, version 4.04 or higher. It can be purchased through Steam or GOG. </p>



<p>The Witcher 3 is known for having some of the best choice-driven narrative campaigns, a wealth of high-quality side quests, and some of the most intriguing characters. It is a wonderful experience on your own, which will only be enhanced once your friends join in on the fun. </p>

<p>Cairn is set to be one of the biggest indie releases of 2026, with the title surging past 700,000 wishlists last year, and the wait for the release date is rapidly approaching a conclusion.</p>



<p>The climbing title has garnered plenty of interest already and is expected to surge in popularity to hit a fresh summit when it launches on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>If you’re counting down the hours until you can jump in, Insider Gaming has all the release date and start time details for Cairn.</p>

<p>A reliable insider has reaffirmed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will release for Xbox in 2026. </p>



<p>For those unaware, back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-will-release-for-xbox-and-switch-2-in-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2025</a>, it was claimed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth would release for Xbox and the Switch 2 in 2026. We have yet to receive any official confirmation from either Xbox or Square Enix, but the insider seems confident it will release this year. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-for-xbox-is-coming-this-year">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth for Xbox is Coming this Year</h2>



<p>The insider who has reaffirmed the release for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Xbox is none other than NateTheHate. Interestingly, the reconfirmation comes via the insider’s latest <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013705307499712834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter), where he thanked the community for dubbing him r/GamingLeaksAndRumour’s Leaker of the Year. </p>



<p>In one of the comments, NateTheHate was asked whether the plans for Rebirth coming to Xbox in 2026 are still the same, to which he <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013710238508077359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a>, “Yes.” NateTheHate also stated that leaking something about Half-Life 3 is something he will “try to achieve” this year. And, there’s a chance that we might get some new leaks on his next podcast. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake has already released for both Xbox consoles and the Switch 2 on January 22, 2026, and hopefully, the port for FF7 Rebirth should be next on the list. At the moment, all we can do is wait for an official confirmation, but we do know the entire trilogy is making its way to Switch 2; it is just a matter of when now. </p>







<p>In other news, the director of Final Fantasy 7 Remake has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-should-be-led-by-someone-else-says-ff7-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the FF6 Remake series should be led by someone else</a>. Additionally, the game experience for the third instalment in the FF7 Remake series is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>“. When do you think Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will be officially announced for Xbox and Switch 2 in 2026?

            <title><![CDATA[8 Best Games To Play If You Like Hytale]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/8-best-games-to-play-if-you-like-hytale/</link>
            <guid>1411744</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale has recently launched in Early Access, and it’s fair to say it’s been a hit amongst fans and critics alike. Insider Gaming gave it a stellar <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-first-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first impressions review</a>, and updates are already rolling out thick and fast.</p>



<p>However, as is the case with most Early Access titles, there’s only so much of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-thorium-ore-in-hytale-thorium-ingots-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> to enjoy at the moment, with plenty of content gated behind ‘Work In Progress’ barriers. It’s no fault of the game itself, but if you’ve enjoyed your time in Hytale so far and are looking for something with a bit more meat on its bones, then you’re in luck. </p>







<p>Here are eight games that you should play if you like Hytale. </p>



<h2 id="h-minecraft">Minecraft</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Build awesome structures. Image by Mojang.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s start with the obvious—Minecraft. It’s no secret that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-things-hytale-does-better-than-minecraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was heavily influenced by Minecraft</a>; in fact, the creators began their development journey making mini-games and servers for it!</p>



<p>With that in mind, if you’ve somehow played Hytale and not Minecraft, you should definitely give it a go. Aside from the obvious blocky nature, it has an incredible amount of similarities. From a dangerous night time to vast biomes to explore, Minecraft is the sandbox that started it all. </p>



<h2 id="h-terraria">Terraria</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A minor dimensional shift. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From looking at the image above, you might look at Terraria’s 2D art-style and wonder how it is at all similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-repair-in-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a>? Well, despite their dimensional differences, the core gameplay loops actually have a lot of similarities. </p>



<p>Terraria is filled to the brim with various monsters and bosses to fight, and the constant cycle of mining and getting better gear from rarer resources never gets dull. The game’s progression is as deep as its caves, and if you haven’t played Terraria before, they’re very deep indeed. </p>



<h2 id="h-vintage-story">Vintage Story</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A more realistic take on survival. Image by Humble Store.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Vintage Story is an incredibly underrated survival game that also shares a blocky aesthetic, but don’t let the similarities to Minecraft or Hytale fool you. It is a much more brutal take on the survival formula, so if you felt Hytale was too bright and charming, Vintage Story might be the one for you. </p>



<h2 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’s a lot more to it than just tending crops. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-stardew-valley-1-7-update-includes-new-farm-type-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stardew Valley</a> for the first time, you might mistakenly take it for a simple farming simulator, but it’s so much more than that. Of course, the farming aspect does play a central role in the game, but there’s caving, fishing, romancing—it has it all!</p>



<p>There are hundreds of hours worth of content in Stardew Valley, so if you enjoyed the cosiness of Hytale but want something more long-term, then it might be time for you to open your first farm.</p>



<h2 id="h-valheim">Valheim</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Take to the open seas. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If anything, despite its visual style, Hytale might just share the most in common with Valheim. Exploration is central to progression in Valheim, and you’ll need to travel across the world in search of more powerful resources, whilst also engaging with the various enemies and hazards that litter the land.</p>







<p>Although Valheim is also in Early Access, it’s much further along in development compared to Hytale, and there’s a ton of content to engage with. If you’re desperate to live out your Viking fantasies, then Valheim should be your next purchase.</p>



<h2 id="h-disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Meet tons of recognisable characters. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Disney Dreamlight Valley is a deceptively content-rich game full of stuff for you to unpack. It’s described as a hybrid between a life-sim and adventure game, and there aren’t many better ways to put it.</p>



<p>Whilst it does lack the survival elements of Hytale, it does instead feature similar base-building and adventuring aspects. If those are what you love about Hytale, and if you’ve got a strong affinity for Disney characters, then don’t sleep on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-like-disney-dreamlight-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>.</p>

<p>It’s another Early Access title, but Enshrouded needs to be on this list for its building systems alone. Some truly wondrous creations can be built, and it’s all so incredibly simple, but there’s a lot more to Enshrouded than just building. </p>



<p>Explore and survive in a vast open world filled with secrets to uncover and enemies to fight. It’s a hostile world, but thankfully, there are plenty of items and gear ready to craft. It might share more similarities with Valheim than Hytale, but it’s a best-in-class survival game that’s worth checking out.</p>

<p>Okay, this final entry might be cheap, but give it a chance. If you’ve enjoyed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-minecraft-crossplay-mod-has-been-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> but feel that Minecraft doesn’t quite scratch the same itch, then try modding it! Minecraft is one of the most popular games to mod, and some of them can genuinely reshape the game. </p>



<p>From building factories to exploring new dimensions, the possibilities are truly endless with modded Minecraft. Best yet, if you’re confused or uninterested in debugging a compatible mod list, then there are thousands of pre-curated modpacks ready to be installed and played in moments.</p>

<p>After a lengthy wait and a last-minute delay last month, Echoes of Elysium is finally poised to release in early access, with the release date and exact start times now confirmed.</p>



<p>The action-adventure RPG hands players their very own airship to customize and expand with crafting, weapons, and more, as you explore the world of Elysium, an environment full of mysteries to uncover.</p>



<p>If you’ve been anxiously waiting for the Echoes of Elysium release date, Insider Gaming has all the details on the exact start time, so you can work out exactly how many hours there are to wait.</p>

<p><strong>Echoes of Elysium is set for release on Tuesday, January 27, bringing an end to the long wait fans have had to endure.</strong></p>



<p>An initial early access release date was slated for December 4, before a last-minute announcement pushed the release date back to the above date.</p>



<p>The delay allowed the team to be “deeply focused on improving stability and overall game feel,” and was about “addressing real issues” so that when players jump in, the “experience is solid, reliable, and ready to grow.”</p>



<p>Tweaks include crash resolving and smoothing out rough systems, as well as porting the game entirely to a new version of Unity. The result is a build that is “significantly more stable” and “in a far better position,” so the delay has been worth the wait.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-echoes-of-elysium-release">What Time Does Echoes of Elysium Release?</h2>



<p><strong>Echoes of Elysium will be available worldwide from 10 AM PT on January 27, with a simultaneous release for players across the world.</strong></p>



<p>Details of the start time come from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2644050/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> and show that the time of day will vary depending on where you are in the world, with players in some regions only seeing the doors open for them to play in the early hours of January 28.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Arknights: Endfield on Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new gacha-RPG title is spinning onto the scene with the release of Arknights: Endfield, and a customary question to ask with every release is whether the title will be available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription.</p>



<p>Arknights: Endfield releases on January 22, expanding the Arknights universe on the back of the original game, which was released in China in May 2019 and in other countries in January 2020.</p>



<p>If you were a fan of that title and are keen to jump into Arknights: Endfield, Insider Gaming has all the details on whether the title is available with a Game Pass subscription.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-arknights-endfield-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Arknights: Endfield on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New journey. Image via GRYPHLINE</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Arknights: Endfield is not available on Xbox Game Pass, and it isn’t available on Xbox Series X|S at all.</strong></p>



<p>However, that doesn’t close the door entirely to Game Pass fans as, while it isn’t available on the service, Arknights: Endfield is available on PC, and it’s a free-to-play game, so you don’t need to splash out any additional funds to enjoy it.</p>



<p>While it won’t be available through Game Pass specifically, PC players can still enjoy it. Unfortunately, there’s no similar news for Xbox Series X|S players, as there is no indication the game will arrive on the console.</p>



<p>That might be frustrating for Xbox Series X|S players, particularly as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-platforms-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield is available on PlayStation 5</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-arknights-endfield-be-added-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Arknights: Endfield be Added to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that Arknights: Endfield will be added to the Xbox Game Pass service, as the free-to-play approach means it’s not necessary.</strong></p>



<p>Recent updates to the Xbox app on PC make it easy to launch games across different launchers, so putting the title on Game Pass wouldn’t make much difference, and, due to the free-to-play nature, there’s no need to add Arknights: Endfield to the service if a console release on Xbox Series X|S occurs later down the line.</p>



<p>Free games have been added to Game Pass in the past, however, often providing additional in-game bonuses, so this is a route that could appear in the future. For now, though, there is no indication that Arknights: Endfield will be available on Game Pass anytime soon.</p>
