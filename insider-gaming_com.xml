<p>Assassin’s Creed Shaodws was delayed from its intended November 15 release to February to give its developers time to polish the game. An <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal memo from Yves Guillemot</a> said that the delay was to “to offer an optimal experience from launch on all platforms and various PC configurations, and to remove the small frictions we typically used to address in post-launch title updates.”</p>



<p>Following the delay, Marc-Alexis Côté announced, </p>



<p>“Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a dream project for us; finally bringing the series to Feudal Japan with many features developed with our community in mind, such as parkour or the renewed stealth, brought by new technology, all set in a beautiful and immersive world.”</p>



<p>He continued, “As such, we’ve made the decision to postpone the release date to February 14, 2025. The game will be released on a broad range of platforms, including Steam at launch. Additionally, preorders will be refunded and all future preorders will be granted the first expansion for free.”</p>



<p>At the time of the delay, it’s understood that Assassin’s Creed Shadows pre-orders were strong, but behind that of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla which also release on past-generation consoles and thus, had a large market to release to.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches February 14, 2024 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>
