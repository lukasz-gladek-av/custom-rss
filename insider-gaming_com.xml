<p>ARC Raiders has taken the gaming world by storm, and a key reason for its success is its combat. Whether you’re fighting PvP or PvE, there’s a strong variety of weapons and gadgets at your disposal, but one item in particular stands tall above the rest—the Trigger ‘Nade.</p>



<p>This pocket-sized rendition of a C4 packs a serious punch, and whilst it’s fairly effective against the enemy ARC, it’s best utilised against <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceo-the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fellow raiders</a>. However, the Trigger ‘Nade might be a little bit too good at ending people’s raids, as plenty of fans have been clamouring for a nerf.</p>



<p>Follow along with this guide to see whether Trigger ‘Nades are actually being nerfed in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-tv-show-and-movie-ideas-being-pitched-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and the reason why fans are calling for one. </p>



<h2 id="h-are-trigger-nades-being-nerfed-in-arc-raiders">Are Trigger ‘Nades Being Nerfed In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll want a stash full of them. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>An ARC Raiders Community Manager has confirmed that the development team is looking into nerfing Trigger ‘Nades. </strong></p>



<p>The news was broken in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJgbCVm_yRAxUaZ0EAHRmqL0gQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Finvite%2Farcraiders&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Fa-gWhhqWUNZh3rIuGRH-&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders Discord</a>, where Lily, a Community Manager, was asked whether there were any updates regarding a PVP-focused balancing update. Trigger ‘Nades were specifically mentioned, and Lily promptly responded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The team’s looking into some nerfs, including trigger nades. Keep an eye on ⁠game-announcements for updates!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As things stand, that’s all there is to know regarding the Trigger ‘Nade nerf in ARC Raiders. Its existence is confirmed, but to what extent it will present itself in-game, and when you can expect it, you’ll have to wait for further updates from Embark Studios.</p>



<p>One thing Insider Gaming is certain of, though, is that the nerf can’t come soon enough.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-are-trigger-nades-being-nerfed-in-arc-raiders">Why Are Trigger ‘Nades Being Nerfed In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>For a small ‘Nade, they pack a mean punch. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, the Trigger ‘Nade in ARC Raiders is incredibly OP, rendering many of the other utility items obsolete. </strong></p>



<p>On paper, the Trigger ‘Nade seems intended for use as a trap; place down the grenade, and remotely detonate it when enemy raiders step within range. However, what has transpired is that raiders use it more like an impact grenade, due to its incredibly quick detonation time and absurd damage potential. </p>



<p>A single well-aimed Trigger ‘Nade can down an entire trio of raiders with ease, thanks to its ludicrous damage output and large radius. To make matters worse, they’re dirt cheap to craft: both Crude Explosives and Processors are immensely simple to acquire. </p>



<p>All of these attributes combined transform the Trigger ‘Nade into what feels like a pocket-sized nuke. Fans have long been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-november-20-update-full-1-3-0-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desperate for a nerf</a>, and thankfully, it seems like Embark Studios is aware of its unbalanced nature—fingers crossed there isn’t too long a wait.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders retained its popularity heading into the new year, making 2026 an exciting chapter for Embark Studios and all ARC Raiders players. A 2026 roadmap is what the community is begging for, and this live tracker has the latest details and updates on future changes.</p>



<p>It feels redundant to say, but ARC Raiders is quite good, isn’t it? A record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 million Peak Player count</a> serves to highlight this more, and ARC Raiders is expected to be a huge presence throughout 2026.</p>



<p>One thing that will keep you all coming back is new content, and this live tracker runs through everything known about the roadmap and future incomings.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-have-a-2026-roadmap-yet">Does ARC Raiders Have A 2026 Roadmap Yet?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hang fire for now. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, Embark Studios hasn’t revealed the ARC Raiders 2026 Roadmap yet.</strong></p>



<p>It’s January 8, and Embark Studios is either still feeling the come-down of the holidays (who isn’t?) or reluctant to commit to a 2026 roadmap just yet. There’s always the daunting reality that there might not be a roadmap at all, but it’s unlikely.</p>



<p>Embark has already committed to a 10-year development cycle for ARC. You don’t claim this unless you’re cooking up some serious stuff. Thanks to some digging, a couple of details about the 2026 roadmap content have already been discovered.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will update this once the roadmap is live, per its tracker status.</p>



<h2 id="h-2026-arc-raiders-roadmap-changes">2026 ARC Raiders Roadmap Changes</h2>



<p><strong>Initial ARC Raiders changes for 2026 include changes to the Trigger Nade, Kettle, and other weapons.</strong></p>



<p>On the ARC Raiders official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1427256238651084895/1458832856120819724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> server, community manager ‘CM | Lily’ had this to say on January 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The team’s looking into some changes to trigger nades.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then, on January 6, community manager ‘CM | Birdie’ added some more details to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1427256238651084895/1458217158160154704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> about upcoming changes in 2026:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Hey! The holidays delayed things a bit, but the dev team want you to know that they are looking into balance, for example, the stitcher, kettle, and trigger nade. Rest assured that we hear you and work on delivering a good gaming experience, things are just not immediate.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These are minor details for now, but they show that the team is already working behind the scenes. A 2026 roadmap likely isn’t far off, and IG will let you know when it’s here.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-price/</link>
            <guid>1400575</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is set to be another big year for Nintendo, and the first major content drop of the year on the console is coming to an already-established classic, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, with the Nintendo Switch 2 update, and all the price details you need are here.</p>



<p>Six years after the game was first released, and four years on from the 2.0 update, the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for Animal Crossing: New Horizons brings <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates to the base game for all players</a>, as well as graphical enhancements for those who purchase the title on the latest console when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-switch-2-edition-exact-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases on January 15</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re yet to splash out on the latest entry in the Animal Crossing series, or are considering upgrading your edition, Insider Gaming has all the important price details.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-animal-crossing-new-horizons-on-nintendo-switch-2">How Much is Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Arrival. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 edition of Animal Crossing: New Horizons is priced at $64.99, $5 more than the original Switch edition of the game.</strong></p>



<p>Purchasing the original Nintendo Switch version of New Horizons will still provide you with the free content coming in the big 3.0 update, though it won’t allow you to take advantage of the Switch 2-exclusive features, which include increasing the maximum amount of players in multiplayer to 12.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Happy Home Paradise DLC is available to purchase for $24.99, but you need to already own the base game to benefit from the additional content.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-upgrade">How Much is the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Switch 2 Upgrade?</h2>



<p><strong>If you already own Animal Crossing: New Horizons on the original Nintendo Switch, an upgrade pack for the Switch 2 version costs just $5.</strong></p>



<p>There is no need to purchase the game outright again, as Nintendo offers a much cheaper option, but it won’t save you any money if you purchase the base game on the original Switch, then purchase the Switch 2 upgrade. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether the Switch 2 edition requires a completely new download, or if it will just update the standard edition of the game, though other Nintendo titles with a Switch 2 upgrade do require a completely new install.</p>

<p>The lead on Final Fantasy 9 has revealed that the PlayStation 2’s CPU was so powerful that it raised military concerns. </p>



<p>Talks about the Final Fantasy 9 Remake have completely fizzled out since a reliable insider revealed that the project “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-on-ice-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be on ice</a>“. However, as players wait for official confirmation, the lead has shared an insight from the PlayStation 2 era, revealing that the CPU’s power was no joke back then. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-2-s-cpu-was-so-overpowered-that-it-led-to-export-restrictions">PlayStation 2’s CPU Was ‘So Overpowered’ That It Led to Export Restrictions </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-9-lead-says-the-ps2-was-so-so-overpowered-its-cpu-sparked-military-concerns-so-he-struggled-to-get-an-emergency-dev-kit-during-his-stay-in-hawaii-it-was-a-very-difficult-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Final Fantasy 9’s Kazuhiko Aoki revealed the difficulties he faced when trying to test the game on the PlayStation 2 due to its CPU. Aoki revealed that, towards the end of his stay in Hawaii, there were discussions about his receiving PlayStation 2 testing equipment to see whether Final Fantasy 9 could run on the console. However, the console’s CPU was “so overpowered” that there was a “possibility that it would be used for military purposes,” so there were restrictions on the console’s export. </p>



<p>But, after taking “quite some time” and the team facing a “very difficult situation,” the console was finally delivered to the Final Fantasy 9 dev team. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake director wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-should-be-led-by-someone-else-says-ff7-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">someone else to lead the Final Fantasy 6 Remake</a>. Additionally, the director of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 has stated that the game’s experience is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>“.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Xbox Developer Direct is just weeks away, and Xbox has confirmed the first three games that will appear at the annual event.</p>



<p>Airing on January 22 at 1pm ET/10am/6pm UK, the Xbox Developer Direct gives players a look at upcoming first-party games from Xbox Game Studios as well as some third-party titles. Last year featured games liked Ninja Gaiden 4, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, among others. And with Xbox celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, Microsoft is promising fans a “incredible year”, starting with the Developer Direct.</p>



<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-2026/?ocid=Event_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_1.8.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox announced</a> that Fable, Forza Horizon 6, and Beast of Reincarnation would receive expended looks during the event.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-fans-will-see-at-xbox-s-developer-direct">What Fans Will See At Xbox’s Developer Direct</h2>



<p>For Fable, Playground Games is giving fans the first extended look at the game that’s scheduled to release this year. Forza Horizon 6, also from Playground Games, will receive its gameplay reveal after first being announced at Tokyo Game Show last year. </p>



<p>Lastly, Beast of Reincarnation comes from Pokémon developer Game Freak. The game is an Action RPG featuring “one person, one dog”. During the event, Game Freak will “reveal details of our protagonist Emma’s innovative plant manipulation actions and gameplay with her canine companion, Koo.”</p>



<p><strong>“Presented by the game creators themselves, Developer_Direct will once again give you an inside look at not just the games, but the studios working to bring them to life,”</strong> Joe Skrebels, Xbox Wire editor-in-chief, said. <strong>“Fittingly for Xbox’s 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary year, that includes the return of some of our most legendary franchises, which rub shoulders with a brand new title from one of Japan’s most beloved studios.</strong>“</p>







<p>It’s expected that at least one more game will be shown during the event, though what the game will be is still anyone’s guess. The Xbox Developer Direct takes place on Thursday, January 22. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the event as it airs.</p>

<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbrBjFZabUE&amp;t=3s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamerBraves</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/while-final-fantasy-6-remake-would-be-a-dream-project-final-fantasy-7-remake-director-thinks-hed-rather-someone-else-lead-it-should-i-be-the-one-to-undertake-remaking-another-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), FF7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke about someone else leading Final Fantasy 6 Remake. Hamaguchi first spoke about how Final Fantasy 6 has been influential in his journey as a gamer, and that influence often comes through in his work. However, FF7 Remake didn’t include any elements of FF6 as they were following a set script. </p>



<p>Hamaguchi then went on to talk about how many fans have requested a remake of Final Fantasy 6. But, he has been leading the FF7 Remake for close to 10 years and is “now finally seeing basically the end of the tunnel.” He wonders whether he should be the one responsible for taking up another remake series after pouring so much time into remaking this project. </p>



<p>Hamaguchi then states that, rather than him being the lead, he wants to see a “new creator” take the lead position, and he can take a more supportive role, “sort of cheer them on”. </p>
