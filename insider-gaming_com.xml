<p>A fresh story has revealed that Battlefield: RedSec is the name for the rebranded battle royale game mode coming in Battlefield 6. ‘Firestorm’ is now a thing of the past, and BF 6 is gearing up for its strongly rumored October 28 battle royale shadow drop.</p>



<p>We’ve known for weeks that Battlefield 6 is getting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> mode. It features an innovative insta-death circle mechanic, and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">datamine revealed that the Battle Royale is to release on October 28</a>. Now, we’ve learned the new game mode’s full title. </p>

<p>Get ready to enter Battlefield: RedSec! </p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>‘s exclusive story, we’ve learned that this is the new name for EA’s rebranded, free-to-play battle royale mode in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Here’s what they’ve said about the news:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“EXCLUSIVE: The F2P Battlefield 6 battle royale is officially named “Battlefield: RedSec”. Releasing October 28th as previously reported, however, it looks like there won’t be any trailers or official announcements until the 28th itself, instead of a day before. Full on shadowdrop.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This doesn’t alter the gameplay in any way, but it is a cool name. It’s unclear if this is a way to get clear of Firestorm and start anew, or if Battlefield Studios is simply looking for a fresh relaunch.</p>



<p>Either way, the shadow drop is looking less like a shadow drop and more like a surprise birthday party where everyone knows it’s happening. Still, EA will be looking to right the wrongs of Firestorm and hope Battlefield: RedSec is the start of something special.</p>

<p>The developers of Steal A Brainrot, a popular game within Roblox, are suing the developer of a copycat game in Fortnite called “Stealing Brainrots”..</p>



<p>According to the complaint, which was first reported on by <a href="https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Carpenter at Aftermath</a>, Spyder Games and Speedy Simulator Gaming are suing Thomas Van Der Voort for copyright infringement. They say that Van Der Voort’s game, which was released two months after theres, within the Fortnite Island Creator Program <strong>“copies the Game’s [Steal A Brainrot] protectable expressions, including user interface elements, in-game objects, artwork, level design, animations, design aesthetics, game pieces, and the selection and coordination of game elements, colors, and shapes.”</strong></p>



<p>They <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/937410050/Brainrot-Goes-To-Court#content=query:defendant,pageNum:2,indexOnPage:0,bestMatch:false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">continue to say</a> that similarities in Van Der Voort’s game are “not merely the result of the games existing in the same genre or dictated by function”. It’s alleged that he “made conscious decisions” to copy the choices of Steal A Brainrot, which, within the Fortnite Creator Program, can earn the developers money. </p>



<p>In a statement given to Aftermath, attorney Adam Starr, who represents Spyder Games and Speedy Simulator Gaming, says that his parties are doing this to protect their work, which they acquired a copyright for in August.</p>



<p>“We always prefer to resolve these matters cooperatively, but when necessary we will take appropriate legal steps to safeguard our IP,” he said.</p>



<p>The suing parties are requesting a jury trial for the claims presented. They are looking to see the infringing game taken down while also receiving damages and profits that can be attributed to the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Have Early Access?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-have-early-access.1334086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re getting toward the end of the year, which means it’s time for a new Call of Duty game. Black Ops 7 follows BLOPS 6, and if you want to get your boots off the ground quicker than most, early access is the perfect fuel to do so—we’re checking if Black Ops 7 has it for you.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was having a fairly tumultuous build-up toward launch. Battlefield 6 was the shooter on everyone’s lips, and Black Ops 7 possibly felt too similar to its predecessor for some. It all changed in the blink of an eye when Activision declared <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-will-have-non-disbanding-lobbies-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 was getting rid of skill-based matchmaking</a>.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is now back on the menu for many, so let’s check if there’s any possibility of early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-ops-7-early-access">Can You Play Black Ops 7 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Judgment day is near. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no Black Ops 7 early access, meaning it doesn’t matter which edition you buy, all of them will give you access to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 at the same time—release day.</strong></p>



<p>One thing we can definitely say is the same as Black Ops 6 is the decision not to give Black Ops 7 players early access. You have to be patient and pass the time until launch. As usual, there is a super-duper edition (Vault Edition) offering a Season Pass, as well as the usual benefits, such as packs and items for CoD Zombies.</p>



<p>The good thing is that no one can gain an advantage before November 14. Once Black Ops 7 is out, everyone is near-enough on a level playing field and can upgrade weapons, earn attachments, and do everything in between at the same starting point.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-black-ops-7-early">Is There Any Way To Play Black Ops 7 Early?</h2>



<p><strong>No, the only way you could’ve played Black Ops 7 slightly earlier than anyone else was by pre-ordering the game to give yourself an exclusive early access beta window.</strong></p>



<p>If you didn’t know, Black Ops 7’s beta has come and passed. If you pre-ordered BLOPS 7, you were guaranteed a code to play the early access Black Ops 7 beta. That’s it, though, just the beta.</p>



<p>The beta window has closed, as has any chance to play Black Ops 7 before launch. We’ve seen other titles spontaneously announced impromptu betas—like ARC Raifers did—so we can’t theoretically rule out one more chance to play early. If this doesn’t happen, we’ll see you in a persistent Black Ops 7 lobby!</p>



<p>If you did play the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta, let us know if you enjoyed it. Can the removal of disbanding lobbies and a lack of SBMM make this one of the best CoDs ever?
