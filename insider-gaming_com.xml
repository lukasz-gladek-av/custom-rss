<p>Battlefield 6’s lead producer has revealed how bots work in the game. </p>



<p>Bots in Battlefield 6 have been a subject of conversation since the open beta days, with some players annoyed about the frequency of bots and others happy to have some non-sweaty lobbies. The title also added a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Breakthrough mode</a> recently, which adds 32 bots in each match. Now the developers have revealed how BF6 bots actually work. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-bots-only-appear-for-these-reasons">Battlefield 6 Bots ‘Only’ Appear for These Reasons</h2>



<p>The lead producer for Battlefield 6, David Sirland, revealed what criteria need to be met for bots to enter and leave lobbies. Sirland’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986036167209357732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) was a lengthy thread intended to clarify the confusion surrounding bots in BF6. The lead producer revealed that bots will enter regular playlists “only under these conditions: players kickstart a lobby for a playlist, and the pre-round takes longer than X minutes (I believe 3 minutes)”. When that happens, bots will enter to “fill the server to the necessary limit.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bots enter the game on regular playlists ONLY under these conditions: <br>– players kickstart a lobby for a playlist, and the pre-round takes longer than X minutes (I believe 3 minutes)<br>At that point, the bots fill the server to the necessary limit to start the game</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986036167209357732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sirland adds that there should be 24 players per side, he believes, for “CQ for ex”. This allows players to battle against bots instead of waiting in line. While they are playing, “other players in the same region matchmaking on that same playlist – will join this server (as it has you on it).” Whenever a new player joins the lobby, a bot will leave, and when the lobby is filled with 24 players, it will no longer be seeded with bots. The rest of the slots are left for other players as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-alternative-for-bots-in-battlefield-6-is-waiting-possibly-forever">The Alternative for Bots in Battlefield 6 is Waiting “Possibly Forever” </h2>



<p>If the developers do not use this Battlefield 6 bots system, the other alternative is “full on waiting (possibly forever)” to play on your preferred playlists in regions with low populations to fill a server. Moreover, players need to stay with the bots for the server to fill with regular players.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The alternative to doing this, would be full on waiting (possibly forever) to play on the playlist of your choice in regions with low population. <br>but to fill a server (the first in the region) – you need to stay with the bots. <br>if you keep leaving because: 1: you see bots</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986036848511398177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sirland concluded, stating that they can and will “can and will test longer wait limits for the seed bots to kick in” for Battlefield 6. Lastly, there are also “onboarding bots” which are used in specific game modes for new players. However, these are different from seeded bots as they “stick around and populate a big chunk of the total players on each team.”</p>

<p>NetEase is shutting down yet another studio that was working on a game that, likely, won’t see a release. In a post on social media, studio head Sean Crooks announced that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors on November 17 after the parent company pulled funding. </p>



<p>That just so happens to be the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-is-closing-one-of-its-studios-after-just-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same day as another NetEase studio</a>, Fantastic Pixel Castle, will be closed.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on LinkedIn</a>, Crooks said that the closure comes despite “best efforts” to find a new partner for the studio and its game.</p>



<div><p><strong>“Our team poured everything into this journey — pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft,”</strong> he said. <strong>“What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent.</strong></p><p><strong>“The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision — thank you.”</strong></p></div>



<p>Bad Brain Game Studios was formed in May 2023 with Crooks, who was a producer on games like Watch Dogs: Legion, at the helm. The studio has been working on a game known as Midnight Riders, which was set to be open world action-adventure game with a 1980’s aesthetic. You can check out the game’s sizzle reel below, courtesy of Crooks.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>An Update on Bad Brain Game Studios</p><p>It’s with a heavy heart that we share that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors. Our last official day of operation will be on November 17th.</p><p>Despite our continuing efforts to seek a new partner for the project, a path forward has yet to materialize. We are deeply grateful to NetEase Games for their support and for giving us runway to explore every possible opportunity.

To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision — thank you.</p><p>As we close this chapter,&nbsp;the game and its underlying IP is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we/NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</p><p>To help support our people as they take their next steps, we’ll also be releasing a sizzle reel from the project publicly, giving everyone the chance to showcase their incredible work and open doors to new opportunities.</p><p>If you’re looking for world-class developers, artists, and storytellers, please reach out — we would be proud to connect you with them.</p><p>Finally, I want to extend my deepest gratitude once again to everyone who supported us along the way. Your encouragement and belief in what we were building meant the world to us. While this chapter is ending sooner than we had hoped, the spirit of what we created at Bad Brain will live on through the incredible people who made it possible.</p><p>Sean Crooks<br>Studio Head</p></div>
