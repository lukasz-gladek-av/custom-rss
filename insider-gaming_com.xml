<p>A lawsuit between Bungie and writer Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case, which revolved around possible copyright violations of Destiny 2 from Martineau’s work, has been going on for around a year.</p>







<p>Destiny 2 is one of Bungie’s biggest and most recent games, released in 2017. With several expansions, the free-to-play title is still going <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhat strong</a>. However, last year, a writer named Matthew Martineau <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-being-sued-for-copyright-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against Bungie for possible copyright infringement. His claim was that the company stole various narrative elements from his work for the Red Legion plot and The Curse of Osiris expansion. Surprisingly, the case survived Bungie’s dismissal and was on its way to court. Now, it seems it has been settled and over with.</p>

<p>Obtained by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, the lawsuit between Bungie and Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case has been dismissed and will not go to court. In a statement from the court filing, it says,</p>



<p>“The court having been advised that all parties have firmly agreed upon a compromise in this matter; it is ordered that this action be and is hereby dismissed as to all parties, without costs and without prejudice to the right, upon good cause shown, within sixty days, to reopen the action if the settlement is not consummated,” the order reads. “In addition, the court specifically retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement if settlement is not consummated within sixty days.”</p>



<p>However, if the settlement is not completed in 60 days, the case will go to trial. As it stands, though, a compromise has been made, and no legal action will occur. Without speculation, a settlement usually means both parties are at fault.</p>



<p>While the claims made by Matthew Martineau do seem a bit much, Bungie isn’t a stranger to copyright infringements. During the alpha of Marathon, the company was caught <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stealing assets</a> from artist ANTIREAL for several designs. After the controversy, the game was delayed and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet to be released</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-publishing-guide-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-releases-xbox-publishing-guide-online-for-free.1354309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has dropped its Xbox Games Publishing Guide for everyone to see. The guide, which was strictly under NDAs and such, is now fully available, coincidentally around the Steam Machine’s reveal.</p>







<p>For many indie developers, Steam has been a beacon for those who want to publish their first title. Via SteamDirect, one can, realistically, make a game, submit it, and it’ll be on the gaming platform in a little over a month. However, for other companies like PlayStation and Nintendo, it can be a bit more trickier to do. However, one company that has been a bit hard to tackle for indies is Microsoft. Despite the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/idxbox-showcase-october-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ID@Xbox program</a>, many games are just not releasing on the consoles, with many citing the difficult process. Now, in the advent of the Steam Machine, Microsoft has decided to pull back the curtain and make the once-hidden guide available to all.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-makes-xbox-games-publishing-guide-available-for-everyone">Microsoft Makes Xbox Games Publishing Guide Available for Everyone</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/11/unlocking-access-to-game-publishing-documentation-for-all-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Game Dev Blog</a>, Senior Program Manager at ID@Xbox, Ed Stewart, announced that <strong>the official Xbox Games Publishing Guide</strong> is <strong>available for free</strong> to everyone. The guide can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/game-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> for those interested. Speaking on the opening, Stewart said the following,</p>



<p>“<strong>By opening our Game Publishing Documentation, we’re removing barriers to learning and making it easier for teams of all sizes to understand what it takes to ship a game on Xbox</strong>,” Ed Stewart says in the blog. “<strong>Whether you’re a first-time independent developer or a seasoned publisher, you can now browse the guide freely, share it with your team, and reference it throughout development.</strong>“</p>



<p>The move does take a page right out of Steam’s playbook, which couldn’t be more convenient. The PC-only company recently announced it’s taking on the console market with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>. Its console will be able to play Steam games from your PC onto the TV. Microsoft is aware of it, as Xbox’s Phil Spencer congratulated the team. Perhaps this is the company wanting to become Steam or like them. Seeing as it’s putting exclusives like Halo and Gears of War on different consoles, it could be the future for Xbox.</p>







<p>What do you think of Microsoft releasing its Xbox Games Publishing Guide? Do you think more indies will make it onto Xbox? Think Microsoft wants to be Steam?
