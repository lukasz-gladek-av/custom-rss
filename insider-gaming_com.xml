<p>The original Backyard Football game is being re-released on Steam and mobile devices.</p>



<p>Playground Games announced on Tuesday that Backyard Football 99 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170570/Backyard_Football_99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will launch on Tuesday, September 9</a>. Like past re-releases of the original Backyard Sports titles, Backyard Football will include legendary NFL players such as Jerry Rice, Dan Marino, Randall Cunningham, Steve Young, Barry Sanders, John Elway, Drew Bledsoe, and more. In total, there will be 30 NFL legends to pick for your squad.</p>

<p>The re-release of Backyard Football follows past launches of Backyard Baseball ’97, Backyard Baseball ’01, and Backyard Soccer. In addition to the aforementioned four games, Playground Productions and Mega Cat Studios are continuing with work on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-more-backyard-sports-classics-are-coming-to-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other classic Backyard Sports titles</a> like Backyard Basketball and Backyard Hockey. </p>



<p>In addition to the re-release of classic titles, Playground Productions is planning on releasing brand new Backyard Sports titles. When those will come, however, is currently unknown.</p>

<p>Perfect Dark could have been saved, according to a new report. </p>



<p>The reboot, done by Crystal Dynamics, The Initiative, and Xbox, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/">cancelled earlier this July</a> out of the blue. Given the game’s well-received gameplay trailer and excitement, many were disappointed in the news. Plus, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-holds-layoffs/">last week’s layoffs</a>, it felt like a nail in the coffin for the classic shooter from Rare. Sadly, it does look like any chance of the game coming out has been silenced.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjgzNDY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzU3NDM5NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMVoyQTRHUTdMRlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iGoAomXADlAaCsr4KgsTEy8oHTbv4k9XTSl7NVtRZXo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> from industry insider Jason Schreier for Bloomberg, Crystal Dynamics cut staff last week because they were unable to secure a deal with a new publisher for Perfect Dark. Embracer, which owns Crystal Dynamics, was reportedly close to striking a deal with Take-Two Interactive. If it went through, the publisher would’ve bought the game from Xbox and then seen the game to completion. Sadly, the talks ceased due to Perfect Dark’s ownership, though exact details were not disclosed.</p>



<p>Along with the cancellation of Perfect Dark, its studio, The Initiative, closed down. However, the report also states that leadership from the studio and Crystal Dynamics have been trying to get a publisher for the last two months. While negotiations did happen with a few, Take-Two was the farthest along.</p>



<p>While chances for Perfect Dark to return are seemingly unlikely, it could see the light of day. Tango Gameworks, which Xbox shut down after the success of Hi-Fi Rush, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-acquired-by-pubg-publisher-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought by Krafton</a> and can work on their IPs again. Whether The Initiative meets that same fate is unknown, but it all depends on the IP of Perfect Dark and if the rights can be purchased.</p>



<p>Are you disappointed to see Perfect Dark cancelled and, likely, never coming back? Let us know in the comments and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the forums</a>!</p>
