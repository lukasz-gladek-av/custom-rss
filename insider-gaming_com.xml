<p>When you think of modern-day online shooters, you have to consider Overwatch and Fortnite. It feels almost wrong that the two brands haven’t come together at some point. New leaks suggest the sought-after crossover between the two giants is happening—brace yourself.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-earn-lego-fortnite-ninjago-2025-twitch-drops-all-rewards-how-to-get/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> is still red-hot and untouchable in 2025, whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-patch-december-overhauls-competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch 2</a>‘s (and the brand as a whole) has dropped off a bit in recent times, but it’s still a bona fide behemoth in the shooter genre. The two franchises have never partnered up once over the years, but leaks suggest this could change.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-amp-overwatch-crossover-possible-according-to-leaks">Fortnite &amp; Overwatch Crossover Possible, According To Leaks</h2>



<p>Hypex (One of the world’s biggest sources for news and leaks) has shared new information—courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR"></a><a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wensoing</a>—of a potential collab. They stress that this is only a “POSSIBLE” collab, so take this information with a huge pinch of salt until we know more.</p>







<p><a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR"></a>SpushFNBR shared leaked assets on December 11, revealing a bunch of LEGO heads and pieces. One headpiece that players were quick to jump on was a potential match for <strong>Hanzo</strong>, from Overwatch. It appears to only be for LEGO, though.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hypex explained about the Hanzo hair model: “It was used on an early version of a Fortnite LEGO skin, then removed, then re-added today again.”<a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR"></a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There’s not too much more to go on for now. Fortnite is lining up a bunch of collabs coming up, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-leak-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kim-kardashian-fortnite-guess-what-players-saying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim Kardashian</a>, and anything else Epic Games can get its hands on, it seems.</p>

<p>With Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 up for a record number of nominations at The Game Awards 2025, there was every chance it would bring home many of those accolades. Sure enough, the RPG cleaned up at The Game Awards 2025.</p>



<p>It was a huge night for Sandfall Interactive and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The surprise news that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-major-free-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 DLC dropped through a free update</a> was fun, and it rounded off a successful night for the mega-popular role-playing game.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A worthy winner. Credit to Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>With many of the Sandfall Interactive crew in attendance at The Game Awards 2025 dressed up in striking French-inspired gear, there was an air of expectation that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 would do something very special.</p>







<p>Nearly four hours later, the 2025 GOTY took home <strong>nine of the 13 awards it was nominated for</strong>. This smashes the previous record of most awards accumulated in one night, set by <strong>The Last of Us Part 2’s seven awards</strong> at the 2020 show.</p>



<p>In other years, Forza Horizon 5 and It Takes Two claimed three awards each in 2021, God of War Ragnarok took home six in 2022, Baldur’s Gate 3 matched GOW’s feat in 2023, and Astro Bot was the recipient of four last year.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 won:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game of the Year</li>



<li>Best Game Direction</li>



<li>Best Narrative</li>



<li>Best Art Direction</li>



<li>Best Score and Music</li>



<li>Best Performance</li>



<li>Best Independent Game</li>



<li>Best Debut Indie Game</li>



<li>Best Role Playing Game</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you think Sandfall’s debut RPG release was worth the hype? Does it deserve the nine awards it claimed? Have any games been cruelly robbed of an award, such as Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 for Best RPG?
