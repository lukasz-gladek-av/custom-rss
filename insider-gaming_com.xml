<p>Nintendo has officially unveiled Virtual Game Cards today: a new, easier way to share digital games between two Switch consoles. With this new feature, Nintendo aims to make games purchased digitally “as flexible and convenient” as physical game cards.</p>







<p>Virtual Game Cards were announced today <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a Nintendo Direct</a>. In the future, all games purchased on the Nintendo Switch digitally will be loaded onto the system as a Virtual Game Card. These cards can be “loaded” and “ejected” onto a second Nintendo Switch system (under the same account) using an internet connection. The two Switches only need to be linked locally once, and an internet connection is only needed during the load and eject phases. The new feature will also support Virtual Game Card swaps between a Nintendo Switch and a Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The new Virtual Game Cards also provide enhanced features to family group managers. Virtual Game Cards can be lent out to a Nintendo account’s <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/products/detail/p/989?_gl=1*1dv082h*_gcl_au*MTc5MTU0MzU5LjE3NDMwODcwMzE.*_ga*NzE2NTIxOTAxLjE3NDMwODcwMzU.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MzA4NzAzNC4xLjAuMTc0MzA4NzA2MS4wLjAuMA.." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">family group</a> members, but only for up to two weeks, after which they will return to the original account’s Switch. The Nintendo account can only share one game at a time with one specific family group member, and the Switches also need to be locally linked once before swapping.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This new feature will be added via a system update in late April. For parents with multi-Switch households, this is welcome news, as they no longer have to manage multiple libraries and purchase games across multiple Switches. All they have to manage is their own library, and they can lend their Virtual Game Cards to members of their family group. </p>



<p>Will you be lending out Virtual Game Cards to Nintendo Switch users when this feature launches in late April?

<p>Pokémon games are no stranger to innovating gameplay mechanics. The March 2025 Nintendo Direct revealed this to be the case as a new Pokémon Legends Z-A gameplay video showed off new features, including day and night gameplay, and Z-A Royale.</p>



<p>Don’t panic, even though I’ve mentioned the word “Royale,” there’s no emphasis on battle royale here. Z-A Royale ties into the new day and night cycle introduced in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-platforms-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>. Previous games have tinkered with the idea of dynamic daily cycles, but few have changed the gameplay in such a way.</p>



<p>The newest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct</a> showed us what we’re in for, and Legends Z-A looks mouth-watering.</p>

<p>The March 27 gameplay trailer showed us a lot of what we’ve seen from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-legends-z-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> already: The real-time action of Pokémon-catching and Trainer-battling antics. We also know that Pokémon are hiding all over Lumiose City—even on the rooftops.</p>



<p>But now we’ve seen what’s lurking in the city at night. Once the sun goes down, Z-A Royale begins. Trainers come out at night to fight in new Battle Zones.</p>



<p>Trainers are classified with ranks, signifying their status in the new Z-A Royale league system. You need to work your way from Z to A, and you can do so with the newly confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-will-bring-27-new-mega-evolutions-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolutions</a> we reported a few days ago.</p>



<p>We know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-reportedly-not-adding-any-new-pokemon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A reportedly isn’t adding new Pokémon</a>, which is a shame. But the new features make up for this, and it’s still set to launch in 2025.</p>

<p>Metroid Prime 4 is alive and well after it was shown off during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct Presentation. It didn’t reveal a precise release date, but we know it’s still locked in for 2025.</p>



<p>As it was predicted, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-wont-be-at-nintendo-switch-2-direct-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond was not shown off during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> Showcase. However, Nintendo’s end-of-life Direct—showing off new games and remakes—revealed new gameplay for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</a>.</p>



<p>Samus is coming for Metroids and Space Pirates this year.</p>

<p>One of the biggest reveals during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct was easily <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond-2593922.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</a>. The long-awaited sequel was in the wilderness for many years. But June 18 finally gave us a real glimpse of what the developer has been working on, and now we’ve seen more.</p>



<p>The latest gameplay trailer revealed the new Planet Viewros we’ll be traversing, along with new powers, abilities, and weapons. The most eye-catching inclusion is psychic powers, which allow Samus to manipulate the environment, which should make for new and exciting puzzles.</p>



<p>Even though the Nintendo Switch is at the end of its lifecycle, Metroid Prime 4 still looks mightily impressive. The techno soundtrack and thrilling action look like everything we’ve come to know and love about the franchise.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the trailer still states it’s “<strong>Coming 2025</strong>,” so we’ll hopefully learn more throughout the year. Stay tuned for updates, and check out the new gameplay trailer below.</p>
