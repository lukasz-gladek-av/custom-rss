<p>The Australian Classification Board has refused to classify Hunter X Hunter Nen X Impact.</p>



<p>If you head to the Australian Classification Board <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hunterhunter-nenimpact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will see that Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact has been classified as ‘RC’ or ‘Refused Classification’. The website has not provided a reason for refusing classification and has asked fans to contact them for further clarification on their decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Australian Classification Board provided a statement to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/489089/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-refused-classification-australia-ban-rating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> regarding the classification of Hunter x Hunter Nen X Impact, explaining that the game was refused classification due to “a visual depiction of implied sexual violence, where an adult male exposes himself to persons under the age of 18 years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Australian Classification Board added:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Board noted in its report that the implied sexual violence is implicitly condoned as appropriate due to a lack of resolution of the act through the game’s narrative and that it is not justified by context. Implied sexual violence that is visually depicted, interactive, not justified by context, or related to incentives or rewards is not permitted.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, Hunter X Hunter Nen X Impact does not have a concrete release date, but it is scheduled to arrive at some point in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-the-thing-leak">Marvel Rivals The Thing Leak</h2>

The character’s passive ability is Solid as a Rock, which makes him immune to enemy knockback and displacement effects. The character’s primary attack is Combination Punch, which releases quick and continuous punches. Their secondary attack is Thunderbolt Punch, which releases a devastating blow at the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Thing’s E ability in Marvel Rivals is Battlefield Support, which will make him jump towards teammates and reduce damage for allies and himself. His L Shift move is Furious Charge, which triggers a Continuous Forward charge that pummels enemies in your way and leaves a seismic zone behind you. Lastly, The Thing’s ultimate is called Slam Moment, and it knocks all enemies in front of you in the air.&nbsp;</p>

His primary attack will be the Encephalo-Ray, an energy beam, and his secondary move is Dynamic Flight, which allows him to quickly fly in the direction of movement and then enter a free-flight mode. Ultron’s E ability is Imperative: Firewall, which provides health to allies within range with the help of drones.&nbsp;</p>
