<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ creative producer, Jonathan Dumont, has revealed new details about the Claws of Awaji DLC, stating it will feature a ‘spookier’ and ‘different’ vibe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ahead of the release, Dumont shared information about the game’s post-launch content during an interview with <a href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-development-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>. The creative producer stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows Claws of Awaji DLC will act as a “continuation” of the adventure and story of their two protagonists. The DLC will feature a “different vibe, a bit spookier,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont also stated that Assassin’s Creed Shadows features “a definite ending”, and the Claws of Awaji DLC’s events occur after the “core story of the main game”. This means players will have much to explore after completing the base game, as the DLC will introduce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10+ hours of additional gameplay</a>. Check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> for Claws of Awaji here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, Dumont also discussed the bonus pre-order quest for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Thrown to the Dogs. The creative producer described it as “a simple yet heartfelt side quest,” similar to the side content we saw in AC Odyssey. The quest begins with a beaten-up stray dog at a grave, who takes the protagonists to his former house to uncover some “family secrets,” stated Dumont.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A purported Gears of War Collection has been a frequent topic of conversation in recent times. It’s a rumored remake or remastering of many legendary Gears titles, and if you’re eager to learn more, we’ve gathered the latest details on a possible collection of classics.</p>



<p>Gears of War was once one of Microsoft’s most powerful franchises. From day one, its first few sequels sold like hot cakes as fans lapped up the lopping off of Locust heads. Fatigue eventually kicked in, and the famous franchise has stagnated in recent years due to the dwindling popularity of Xbox.</p>



<p>We could be set for a Gears resurgence thanks to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-official-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War E-Day</a> and a potential Gears of War Collection. Let’s dispense with the dialogue and do some digging.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-gears-of-war-collection-release-details">Do we Know Gears of War Collection Release Details?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Eye see you there. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The latest reports indicate a Gears of War Collection could release in mid-2025—possibly August 2025.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is all speculation, so take the information with a trusty pinch of salt. But leaker <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Detective Seeds</a> claims the <strong>Gears of War Collection is already on storefronts</strong>. They also claim the release period is likely to be <strong>mid-August</strong>.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Gears of War collection should be releasing early to mid August.  It is PS5 pro enhanced, but I have been told NO Multiplayer PVP, campaign focus only.</span></p></article></div>



<p>This would back up industry insider <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden</a>‘s previous report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War is coming later in 2025</a>. Leakers and insiders tend to have exclusive information (as we know ourselves) that is usually correct. All signs point toward a Gears of War Collection and an assortment of remade or reimagined Gears titles in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-games-could-be-in-gears-of-war-collection">Which Games Could be in Gears of War Collection?</h2>



<p><strong>Currently, rumors and leaks can’t identify which Gears of War games will be added to the Collection—it could be any number of games from Gears of War 1 to Gears 5.</strong></p>



<p>The only report so far—also from Jez Corden—indicates <strong>Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition</strong> could be one of the games. One crucial aspect seemingly known about the collection is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-collection-will-feature-co-op-but-no-pvp-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op is present, but there’s no multiplayer</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll update this if concrete details are revealed or rumors intensify.</p>



<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-collection-platforms-rumors">Gears of War Collection Platforms Rumors</h2>



<p><strong>The possible Gears of War Collection could release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>The headline here is <strong>Gears of War arriving on PlayStation hardware for the first time</strong>. Gears has long been a treasured Xbox exclusive. However, we already know several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox games are coming to PlayStation</a>, making this expected and no longer a shock.</p>



<p>YouTube leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a> claims the collection “Will be revealed during the Xbox Showcase later this year.” It’s all a lot to take in, but it’s an interesting and exciting time for the games industry. Check back as we try to find out more about the rumored Gears of War Collection.</p>

<p>The latest Xbox update for members of the Xbox Insider program is resetting consoles to their factory default settings. This, according to many who’ve gone through with the update.</p>



<p>The problem arises for those who have installed the Alpha or Alpha Skip-Ahead updates. When installed, Xbox profiles, Quick Resume information, and console settings are wiped. To make matters worse, the update is mandatory for insiders.</p>



<p>A quick visit to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Insider subreddit</a> sees a number of posts complaining about the issue. Many are requesting the update be pulled offline, but it doesn’t appear anyone has heard from the company.</p>



<p>“I totally understand that programs like this are here to find problems like this but it’s the complete lack of action on the development team when a bad update goes live on a test branch and it stays live for 18+ hours,” said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/1j4n9bj/comment/mgbh7r1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user</a>.</p>



<p>One thing the update doesn’t appear to do, at least, is deleted any local game save data on the Xbox consoles. As of publishing, Microsoft has yet to comment on the issues. Insider Gaming has reached out for an official response.</p>
