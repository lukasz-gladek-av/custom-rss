<p>It has been confirmed that Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s multiplayer mode, Fox Hunt, will not support crossplay. </p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater is scheduled for release on August 28, 2025, as a remake of the acclaimed 2004 game. Unfortunately, it has been announced that the highly anticipated multiplayer mode, Fox Hunt, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-mode-wont-be-available-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be available at launch</a>. It has now been confirmed that this mode will not support crossplay.</p>







<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-will-not-support-cross-play-konami-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the crossplay details about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode come from the official Japanese <a href="https://x.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account of the game. The post states that supported platforms include PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam. However, “crossplay between different platforms will not be supported.” Many players in the comment section have expressed disappointment over the news. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Crossplay has become an integral feature in multiplayer gaming nowadays and a staple for most new releases. Crossplay enables players to enjoy a game with friends who use different platforms. Moreover, crossplay allows players to interact with a brand-new player base. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode is an online mode where players engage in tactical hide-and-seek. The game mode is set in the same universe as the MGS3 remake, and players will utilize elements unique to Metal Gear, including camouflage and survival.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/konamis-efootball-gets-major-version-5-0-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami%E2%80%99s-efootball-gets-major-version-5-0-update.1270116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Konami has released a major new update for eFootball across all platforms. EFootball version 5.0 launches on Thursday, and features stadium customization and roughly 80 gameplay changes.</p>



<p>Regarding stadium customization, <a href="https://www.konami.com/efootball/en-us/page/v5/versioninfo_v5-00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">players will now be able</a> to <strong>“freely combine various elements, including stadium colours, choreographies and Giant Props, to create your own unique home arena.”</strong> There’s also a new skill known as “Link-up Play” for certain managers. </p>



<p>According to Konami, <strong>“Through a Link-up Play, two players can combine in special ways and receive a boost to their abilities at specific moments. It will activate based on certain conditions, as the two players known as the Centerpiece and Key Man must each play in certain positions and have the required Playing Styles.”</strong></p>



<p>Aside from the new features, there are dozens of gameplay changes for players. You can check them all out below. And be sure to let us know what you think of the update in the comments below.</p>







<p><strong>Dribbling</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that when entering a command in a direction away from the defender, that opponent is less likely to make an attempt on the ball.</li>



<li>Added new motions used when an opponent approaches from the side, ensuring that they compete for the ball naturally without sticking to the opponent. This will improve the sense of fairness and control when trying to dribble past a defender.</li>



<li>Added new motions used when evading a defender who competes for the ball from the left or the right. Made adjustments so that players with high Balance can dribble past opponents more easily.</li>



<li>Adjusted how acceleration changes while dribbling so that, at low speeds, players can accelerate quickly and make swift movements, while at higher speeds, they will accelerate gradually.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that the “Dribbling” and “Acceleration” Player Stats affect how quickly players accelerate while dribbling.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Feints</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Added new motions for the Marseille Turn and Chop Turn to improve the sense of control.</li>



<li>Removed some motions for special Marseille Turns.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Trapping</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where players are unable to receive passes.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where the ball hits the player’s body again immediately after they trap it.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where the player traps a ball from midair, but it takes a fair amount of time to take full control of the ball.</li>



<li>Added some trapping motions to alleviate the problem where players move too slowly after trapping the ball.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where the ball cannot be trapped in the direction entered.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so players move to a position where it is easy to trap a ball in midair with their leg.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Shooting</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that players who have the “Non-Dominant Leg Precision” Player stat at maximum and possess both the “Outside Curler” and “Blitz Curler” skills will prioritize performing a “Blitz Curler” with their non-dominant leg rather than an “Outside Curler” with their dominant leg, when possible.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where players shoot directly with a kick or header, but that shot is well off target.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Heading</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that players move closer to opponents when competing for a header.</li>



<li>Added new heading motions to help players head the ball more suitably.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to the accuracy of near and far-post heading shots directed to the left or right.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Kicking</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where players fail to kick the ball due to catching their other leg in the process.</li>



<li>Adjusted decision-making so that kicks are canceled based on the situation, which will alleviate the problem where players kick an opponent.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where players send a low pass from a set piece, but the accuracy is calculated using a Player Stat not intended for that type of kick.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that an early cross can now be sent to a position closer to the goal.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that the increase in kicking speed occurring after entering a Knock-on command is also applied when kicking from the outside of the cleat.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where a player attempts a kick, but the ball hits them instead and the kick is canceled.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where players stumble and cannot kick when competing for the ball.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Defense</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where players win the ball but cannot take possession of it because, when moving towards the ball, they get stuck to an opponent.</li>



<li>Added new sliding tackle motions to improve the sense of control.</li>



<li>Adjusted how certain motions are shown so that players can touch the ball during a sliding tackle without committing a foul.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that the “Tackling” Player Stat has a greater effect on sliding tackles.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to acceleration for both defenders and attackers away from the ball so that, at low speeds, they can accelerate quickly and make swift movements, while at higher speeds, they will accelerate gradually.</li>



<li>Adjusted the base movement speed when using directional inputs to improve the sense of control when moving players in that way.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that players rarely attempt standing tackles automatically while the ball is far away, unless the Pressure command is given. Use commands based on the situation. To win the ball aggressively, enter the Pressure command, or to slow down an opponent, try the Match-up command.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so it is easier to attempt a tackle while running alongside an opponent.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so it is easier to make contact with the ball when attempting to block a low pass or low through ball.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where it is difficult to block or defend against direct kick feints while using the Match-up command.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where players stumble greatly in unusual ways when attempting a Shoulder Charge.</li>



<li>Players will now start defending more quickly when play switches from attack to defense, depending on their “Defensive Engagement” Player Stat.</li>



<li>Adjusted the penalty that prevents the active player near the ball from moving immediately after losing possession. This will allow them to keep moving depending on the situation.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so players do not come to a sudden stop immediately after losing the ball. They will now continue moving depending on the situation.</li>



<li>The “Defensive Engagement” Player Stat will now affect the timing at which a defender will start pressing if they are positioned behind an opponent who just received a pass.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so forwards take positions a little deeper in their own half when their team is pinned in by the opposing attack.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where two forwards take up almost the same position when their team is pinned in by the opposing attack.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that players with high Defensive Engagement are more likely to run back at full speed to defend their goal.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to reaction speed due to a problem where AI-controlled players covering the goal clear shots with extreme quickness.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that AI-controlled players with high Aggression will quickly close the distance on an opponent when applying pressure.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, while using the Pressure or Call for Pressure command, players with high Defensive Awareness will track opponents more easily.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to reaction speed due to a problem where, while using the Pressure or Call for Pressure command, players responded with extreme quickness to an opponent’s dribbling or feint.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to alleviate a problem where, while using the Pressure or Call for Pressure commands, defenders do not turn properly towards the ball when the ball holder is neither performing a Finesse Dribble nor touching the ball while dribbling. Defenders are now more likely to face the right direction in these situations.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, while using the Pressure or Call for Pressure command, players with high Defensive Awareness will have greater success following ballcarriers who perform a feint.</li>



<li>Expanded the range of movement applied when an active player stands between the ballcarrier and the goal while using the Match-up command. This adjustment will make it easier to place the player in a selected location.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, while using the Match-up command, players will move more smoothly according to directional inputs, as long as they are moving within a correctable range.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, while using the Match-up command, the game will respond better to movement commands entered immediately after switching the cursor manually.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that Call for Pressure will be canceled if used for a certain length of time and the players applying pressure are positioned far from the ball.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Offense</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that players’ acceleration while running is affected not only by the “Acceleration” Player Stat, but also by the “Offensive Awareness” Player Stat.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, instead of running at full speed, players will move at 70% of that speed depending on the situation.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when running from a deep position behind the opposition’s back line, players will start decelerating depending on the situation.</li>



<li>Reduced the frequency at which players run at full speed when moving to a forward position while on the attack.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to positioning to reduce the likelihood that players in the defensive line will move to an attacking area when the ball is bouncing around and no one has control, which would leave the opponent with a great chance to counter if they win the ball.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that players turn their bodies appropriately when running in front of goal looking to receive a cross.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when Team Playstyle is set to “Possession Game”, right and left backs will take higher positions during buildup play unless they have the “Defensive Full-back” Playing Style.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when Team Playstyle is set to “Possession Game”, central and defensive midfielders will take slightly higher positions during buildup play unless they have the “Anchor Man” Playing Style.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when the team’s back line has the ball, a center back with the “Build Up” Playing Style will move to a suitable position where it is easy to receive a pass.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to alleviate the problem where a player coming to support the play and receive a pass is hidden behind an opposing defender. This will allow users to pass the ball around more smoothly.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, depending on the situation, players deep in midfield will move to somewhat higher positions to support passing during buildup play.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Goalkeeper</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Added new ball throwing motions to speed up the goalkeeper’s movements before they release the ball.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where the goalkeeper chases after a ball that is about to go out but then stops moving completely.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where the goalkeeper rushes out to defend against a dribbling attacker but then stops moving completely.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where the goalkeeper cannot catch a high bouncing ball in time as it is falling and it then goes over their head.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when rushing out to defend against a dribbling attacker, the goalkeeper makes more suitable movements when trying to block a shot.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where the goalkeeper turns towards their goal and attempts a leg save while a teammate is in possession of the ball near the goal line.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that the goalkeeper can no longer catch balls for the purpose of wasting time, such as when the ball is headed back to them following a goal kick, goalkeeper throw-in, punt or a pass from a teammate involving a feint or trapping play.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>AI</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that when a player makes a kick and no longer has the ball, but an opponent makes a sliding tackle immediately after that, it is more likely that the player will make motions that help them avoid that tackle.</li>



<li>Adjusted the difficulty for each Match Level’s AI according to changes in game balance.</li>



<li>Adjusted how players’ Stamina levels during matches affect the “Speed” Player Stat.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where the cursor will not leave the kicker after they take a corner kick.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where a player makes a cross, but the cursor switches to a teammate other than the target, preventing the user from making the intended play. The cursor will now remain on the target of the pass in most cases.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when an AI-controlled player takes on an opponent in possession of the ball, the higher their Aggression the closer they will get to the ballcarrier.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when an AI-controlled player takes on an opponent in possession of the ball, the higher their Defensive Engagement the faster they will move in front of the ballcarrier.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where, after the cursor switches, the player automatically moves to a position other than the one selected. This improvement will help ensure that players will defend as instructed.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where, after the goalkeeper catches the ball and falls on the ground, an AI-controlled player moves near the keeper in unusual ways.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed the issue where, after losing the ball, players could win it back immediately by making a sliding tackle, standing tackle, or shoulder charge. It is no longer possible to carry out such commands directly after losing possession.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where, when using the Pressure command while no player has possession of the ball, that command stops working temporarily.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where, after entering a shooting command during a direct free kick, Off the Ball Controls commands are carried out.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where, when attempting a one-two pass, the cursor switches in unintended ways.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when the cursor automatically switches to a defender or a potential defender is selected, the cursor will likely move to a player in a position where it is easier to challenge the opponent, depending on the situation.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Fouls</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed the issue where a player makes a sliding tackle with excessive contact and it clearly seems like a foul, but no foul is called.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where a player in an offside position becomes involved in the play immediately after the ball goes to an opponent, but no offsides is called.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where a player makes contact and it clearly seems like a foul, but no foul is called.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cutscenes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Added new motions to the reactions of players while the ball is not in play, giving them more realistic movements.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Smart Assist</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that, during a Stunning Shot, the gauge level is affected by skills owned by that player. This will make it easier for players to put their skills to use.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Other Gameplay Enhancements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made changes to cancel the display of UI information shown at the feet of players applying pressure after an opponent enters the Call for Pressure command during an online match.</li>



<li>A variety of other adjustments have been made to improve the overall match experience.</li>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1s-new-beta-update-adds-a-rival-cartel-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/schedule-1%E2%80%99s-new-beta-update-adds-a-rival-cartel-and-more.1270065/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1 has just received a new Steam beta update, which adds a rival cartel, the Benzies Family, along with some additional content. </p>



<p>Players have been patiently waiting for a new Schedule 1 content update for some time now, and it has finally arrived. The developer hosted a community vote in June, where they asked players what content they wanted in the next update: Rival Cartel, Police Expansion, or Shrooms. Everyone wanted a rival cartel. </p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-welcomes-the-benzies-family-cartel-in-the-new-update">Schedule 1 Welcomes the Benzies Family Cartel in the New Update</h2>



<p>The game’s cartel update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">version 0.4.0</a>, is now available through the Steam beta branch of Schedule 1. The developer had expected to release this update last month, but underestimated the work required to complete it. At the same time, they have been working simultaneously on official Steam Deck Support and the Console Port for Schedule 1, which is scheduled to arrive later this year. Let’s get into the new update below. </p>



<h4 id="h-schedule-1-rival-cartel-features-and-interactions">Schedule 1 Rival Cartel Features and Interactions</h4>



<p>Benzies Family is the new powerful rival cartel that can be found in Schedule 1’s Hyland point. Players will be able to encounter them after unlocking a few customers at Westville. </p>



<p>The interactions with the Benzies’ family include cartel-player deals when both are trusted, ambushes, dealer robberies, dead drop theft, and cartel-customer deals. Seems like the cartel can be helpful when truced and painful when not. </p>



<h4 id="h-new-schedule-1-property-the-manor">New Schedule 1 Property: ‘The Manor’</h4>



<p>Next is Schedule 1’s new purchasable property, the Hyland Manor. However, to purchase this property, players must first complete the Benzies family storyline. Many might recall that a few months ago, a player <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-player-has-stumbled-upon-a-potential-upcoming-property/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> a brand-new property in the game called ‘The Manor’ (see the similarities there?). Moreover, this was by far the largest property in the game, featuring four bedrooms on the first floor and two spacious reception rooms on the ground floor.</p>



<h4 id="h-new-schedule-1-weapons-vehicles-cosmetics-and-more">New Schedule 1 Weapons, Vehicles, Cosmetics, and More</h4>



<ul>
<li>That’s not all, the latest update includes a pump shotgun and shotgun shells to use with it. </li>



<li>A new vehicle called ‘Hotbox’ has been added, which is very much on brand. </li>



<li>Regarding cosmetics, three new hairstyles have been added: close buzzcut, Tony, and long slicked back. </li>



<li>Three new commands have been added: ‘setgravitymultiplier’, ‘setregionunlocked’, and ‘forcesleep’. </li>



<li>Lastly, players will find more loading screen hints after this update. </li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-schedule-1-tweaks-and-improvements">Schedule 1 Tweaks and Improvements  </h4>



<p>Several changes have been made to improve the gameplay experience. </p>



<ul>
<li>Players will now find that each region has a ‘cartel influence’ level associated with it; you must bring that down to progress to the new region. </li>



<li>Players can now view the dialogue of other players talking to NPCs in multiplayer. </li>



<li>Deals will be cancelled when the assigned dealer is dead/unconscious. </li>



<li>Unconscious NPCs that are dropped in the ocean will be killed. </li>



<li>Dead/unconscious NPCs and police can be pickpocketed. </li>



<li>Once a customer is attacked, they will not place any orders with the player for 72 hours. </li>



<li>The braking properties of all vehicles have been adjusted.</li>



<li>Non-police NPCs have been given ranged weapons. </li>



<li>Police and NPCs can now “ometimes predict future target position instead of pathing directly to the target.”</li>



<li>Flashlight brightness has been adjusted. </li>



<li>Several minor scripts have been refactored. </li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Fixed various mislabellings in employee tutorial quests.</li>



<li>Fixed two light beams being visible when the flashlight is equipped.</li>



<li>Fixed scuffed NPC ragdoll LODs/culling.</li>



<li>Fixed some missing walls at Hyland Medical.</li>



<li>Fixed third-person recoil animation for the M1911 and Revolver.</li>



<li>Fixed the networth calculator algorithm, which did not factor in some item quantities.</li>



<li>Fixed vehicle impacts doing too much damage to NPCs.</li>



<li>Fixed some missing fonts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-is-getting-graffiti-soon">Schedule 1 is Getting Graffiti Soon</h2>



<p>The developer for Schedule 1 posted a new video on <a href="https://x.com/Tyler_TVGS/status/1955953753426944131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), stating that graffiti could be included in the next beta patch or the one after. </p>

<p>Developed by Saber Interactive, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-park-survival-details-on-new-characters-more-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jurassic Park: Survival</a> takes place a day after the events in the 1993 movie and is being perfectly handcrafted to replicate the scenes we all know and love.</p>



<p>There’s more to experience, however, with locations to explore that were discussed for the Steven Spielberg movie but eventually not featured, and now fans will have an opportunity to delve deeper into the lore of the movie.</p>

<p>In a behind-the-scenes featurette published on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4eXQMah9C4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, Universal products and experiences executive producer John Melchior listed facilities, buildings, attractions under construction, and a hotel under construction as areas that can be explored.</p>



<p>He describes the environments as being something that “fans wish they saw” in the original movie, elements that were talked about in the movie and lore, but, until now, not physically conceived.</p>



<p>SVP of franchise management at Universal Pictures Shayne Mifsud added that the game “gives you more time to be able to explore new locations.”</p>



<p>Those wanting a trip down memory lane won’t be disappointed, though, as Melchior detailed the immense process of recreating the iconic environments from the movie down to the exact positions of props.</p>



<p>“We go through room by room, level by level, looking at every possible resource from archives, the film, production reels, production blueprints, to make sure every prop is in the same place.”</p>



<p>One of the memorable locations that players will be thrust into is the infamous kitchen scene while being hunted by raptors, which will put players in the exact situation that Lex and Tim did over 30 years ago.</p>



<p>Jurassic Park: Survival’s release window has not yet been announced, though we know the title will be released on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>A former PlayStation Boss has commented on Game Pass, stating that it isn’t inspiring for game developers and makes them “wage slaves.” </p>



<p>Game Pass is Xbox’s premium subscription service, providing console, PC, and cloud players with access to a library of games for a fee. Every month, waves of new games are added to the service, ranging from large-scale AAA to solo indie titles. However, many have wondered whether putting your games on subscription services like Game Pass can be profitable for developers, and the former PlayStation boss has weighed in on the topic. </p>



<h2 id="h-game-pass-is-not-creating-value">Game Pass is ‘Not Creating Value’</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-one-i-dont-know-if-games-are-recession-proof" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameIndustry.Biz</a>, former Sony Worldwide Studios chairman Shawn Layden spoke candidly about Game Pass as a service. Layden first said that there are many debates about Game Pass profitability, but that’s “not the right question to ask.” Companies can do all kinds of financial jiggery-pokery for any sort of corporate service to make it look profitable.” The real question here would be, is Game Pass “healthy for the developer”? </p>



<p>Layden elaborates that the subscription model of Game Pass makes developers essentially “wage slaves”. The service is “not creating value” by putting the game in the marketplace, hoping that it does well, and then profit sharing and overages. According to Layden, it’s more like “You pay me X dollars an hour, I built you a game, here, go put it on your servers.” He concluded, stating he doesn’t think Game Pass is “really inspiring for game developers”. </p>
