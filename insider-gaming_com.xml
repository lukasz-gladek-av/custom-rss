<p>Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter, is getting a major update tomorrow (1.0.2) that will introduce the long-awaited Escape from Duckov collaboration content. We still don’t know what that looks like, but it marks the first cross-game collaboration in a hot minute for Escape from Tarkov and Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Battlestate announced an impending outage that will take Tarkov offline for up to six hours tomorrow, February 10.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-first-major-collaboration-is-coming">Tarkov’s First Major Collaboration is Coming</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, the teams at both Team Soda (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-duckov/" id="2714">Escape from Duckov</a>) and Battlestate Games (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a>) have been teasing a cross-platform collaboration. It promises to introduce crossover content in <strong>both games</strong>, despite the former title being a <strong>parody </strong>of the latter.</p>



<p>It looks like Escape from Tarkov’s maps will be replicated in Escape from Duckov, and the duck-themed characters from Duckov will surface <strong>in some way </strong>in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tomorrow, February 10 at 7:00 AM GMT / 2:00 AM EST we are planning to install patch 1.0.2.0 for Escape from Tarkov. The installation will take between 4 and 6 hours, but may be extended if required. The game will be unavailable during this time.</p><p>The official websites… <a href="https://t.co/lkoojEGgyk">pic.twitter.com/lkoojEGgyk</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/2020890440648573414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>We have no idea how long this collaboration is set to run for, but it’s likely to be a limited-time event that will expire after a few days. As with past Escape from Tarkov LTMs, it’s likely players will have achievements, items, and other rewards to unlock that, if they don’t get them now, they’ll never see them again.</p>



<p>You can expect Escape from Tarkov to be offline tomorrow from 7 AM GMT to at least 11 AM GMT, and <strong>most likely </strong>until 1 PM GMT. In true Tarkov style, you should also anticipate an extension to the maintenance window. To play it safe, perhaps wait until around 2 PM GMT for Escape from Tarkov to come back up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/riot-games/" id="52298">Riot Games</a> has downsized the team working on its League of Legends-themed fighting game, 2XKO.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">A blog post on February 9</a>, which was written by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/2xko/" id="1323">2XKO </a>executive producer Tom Cannon, revealed that the difficult decision to downsize the team was made in response to emerging trends. While the game has resonated with a core audience, momentum has stagnated, and Riot Games is unable to support a full-size team long-term.</p>



<p><span>A Riot Games spokesperson t</span>old <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>&nbsp;that approximately 80 staff members were laid off, about half of the development team.</p>



<p>The post states that, with the smaller, “focused” team, they will still make key improvements to the game, including items players have already requested. It is reiterated that this is a shift in how the development team will operate, not a sign that “the journey is over” for the 2XKO team.</p>



<p>“This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward,” Cannon wrote.</p>







<h2 id="h-riot-games-offering-support-to-laid-off-2xko-staff">Riot Games Offering Support to Laid-Off 2XKO Staff</h2>



<p>Furthermore, the blog noted that Riot Games will support staff through their transition, help them explore other opportunities within the company where possible, and provide at least 6 months of notice pay and severance where that’s not possible.</p>



<p>2XKO entered Early Access on PC on October 7, 2025, and launched across all platforms on January 20. Canon explained that during the console expansion, concerning player trends emerged. </p>



<p>Plans for the 2026 competitive series remain unchanged, and Riot will continue to focus on supporting events and organizers in local and broader communities.</p>







<p>Unfortunately, layoffs are currently a trend in the gaming industry. Ubisoft is undergoing a major restructuring, which has led to the cancellation of many projects, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">planned remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> and<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-assassins-creed-multiplayer-game/" id="174712"> a multiplayer Assassin’s Creed title.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to bring the latest updates on this story as more information becomes available.</p>
