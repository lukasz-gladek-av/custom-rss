<p>Xbox Game Pass continues to add new games to expand your gaming library, but keeping track of which games are on the service can be tricky, but Insider Gaming is here to help with the details on Quarantine Zone: The Last Check’s Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Launching January 12, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check puts players in control of a crucial checkpoint separating the zombie horde from survivors, tasking you with deciding who gains entry and who is denied, and the choices you make can have serious consequences.</p>



<p>Here’s all the important information on whether Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is on Xbox Game Pass.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-on-pc-game-pass">Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check on PC Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Key step. Image via Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Quarantine: The Last Check is available on PC Game Pass through subscription from day one of the launch on January 12, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Quarantine: The Last Check was a late addition to the Game Pass service for January, having not been listed in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-wave-xbox-game-pass-games-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11 games revealed</a> to be coming to the service this month, despite the release window aligning with the announcements.</p>



<p>Instead, the official Xbox social media account teased the <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/2009788572078137696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal of a new game</a> launching onto PC Game Pass imminently, then later revealed that the game in question is Quarantine: The Last Check, meaning PC players have a new game to enjoy as part of their subscription.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-on-xbox-game-pass-for-consoles">Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check on Xbox Game Pass For Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Quarantine: The Last Check will not be available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S. Instead, only those with PC Game Pass will be able to play.</strong></p>



<p>Quarantine: The Last Check launches as a PC exclusive and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-playstation-xbox-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not available on other </a>platforms, such as PlayStation and the Xbox family of consoles. Therefore, you need a PC to play the game.</p>



<p>The good news is that Microsoft’s many tiers of Game Pass subscriptions include a host of PC games, though you will, of course, require a platform to play them on, and, at the time of writing, it has not been confirmed which level of Game Pass is required to access Quarantine: The Last Check on PC.</p>



<p>It’s likely an Ultimate subscription will be required, however, as this is the tier that features day one releases across both platforms, whereas the Premium subscription brings new Xbox-published games to the service within 12 months of launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The founder of Hypixel Studios has stated that they expect more than one million players during the early access launch. </p>



<p>For those unaware, after being shut down by Riot Games, Hytale was reacquired by Hypixel Studios and is now scheduled to release in early access tomorrow, January 13, 2026. Ahead of this launch, we already knew some details, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-price-revealed-ahead-of-early-access-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-coming-soonand-shows-off-16-minutes-of-minecraft-like-gameplay/" target="_blank">16 minutes of gameplay</a>, along with plans to add</span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-reveals-plans-for-proximity-chat-multiplayer-portals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> proximity chat and the potential of multiplayer portals</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-hypixel-founder-asks-players-to-download-launcher-and-login-beforehand-due-to-expected-influx-of-over-1-million-players">Hypixel Founder Asks Players to Download Launcher and Login Beforehand Due to Expected Influx of Over 1 Million Players</h2>



<p>As revealed in a new post on <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010458001455640636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the founder of Hypixel Studios has asked players to download the launcher a day prior and log in to help reduce launch-day stress, as they expect “over 1 million players on the early access release day” for Hytale. If you are wondering about the launcher, the developers have confirmed they’ll skip Steam to avoid negative reviews during the early access stage. Interested readers can learn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/download-hytale-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to download the launcher</a> through Insider Gaming’s guide. </p>

<p>For those unaware, Hytale is a title that blends sandbox creativity with RPG action, where players can “explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block.” As the game is launching in early access, players should expect bugs and other changes, as it is still in active development. However, the developers have polished the core systems for launch, including exploration, responsive combat, and robust building, along with creator‑first tools for creating unique content, minigames, and running community servers. </p>







<p>In other news, Hytale developers have received the blessing to include a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-receives-blessing-to-include-technoblade-tribute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Technoblade tribute</a>. Additionally, here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC performance and system requirements</a> for the upcoming title.

<p>It seems Ubisoft could be gearing up for an announcement of The Division: Definitive Edition, as a banner has surfaced in Japan. </p>



<p>The Division franchise seems to be progressing well, with Ubisoft’s Julian Gerighty stating that The Division 3 is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shaping up to be a monster</a>” and thinks it could have as significant an impact as the first game in the series. Talking about the first game, it seems there still might be something in store for us for Division 1 in 2026. </p>











<p><span>Spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/domen0204" target="_blank">domen0204</a>&nbsp;on X (formerly Twitter), a banner for The Division: Definitive Edition was spotted at the FPS Day X event in Japan recently, with many hoping that the developers will finally provide an official announcement during its 10th Anniversary celebrations.</span> Additionally, we received some new announcements for The Division 2, with the developers confirming a ‘Realism mode’ coming in March 2026. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-division-2-s-realism-mode">The Division 2’s Realism Mode</h2>



<p>The Division 2’s ‘Realism mode’ will feature action-focused gameplay, reduced time-to-kill, and realistic weapon damage based on bullet caliber, allowing players to immerse themselves in the game in a brand-new way. Additionally, the mode will also introduce reduced UI, limited HUD, no health regeneration, reduced cool-down, and more. The devs also confirmed this is only the “first glimpses of the celebrations ahead,” with “more surprises” to come. </p>

<p>Stellar Blade developers seem to be living the life we all want, as they have been given over $3,000 in cash and Apple products as a New Year’s Bonus. </p>



<p>Shift Up knows how to treat its employees and keep them motivated through frequent bonuses awarded on major milestones and other occasions. For last year’s New Year’s Eve, the developers were given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-employees-receive-ps5-pros-and-a-cash-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5 Pros</a> and a cash bonus. This time, Shift Up has returned with another set of goodies for the employees. </p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-devs-were-gifted-cash-and-apple-products-for-new-year-s">Stellar Blade Devs Were Gifted Cash and Apple Products for New Year’s </h2>



<p>According to a report by South Korean outlet <a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/2K773GI6BZ">Seoul Economic Daily</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-up-has-gifted-all-its-staff-3500-airpods-max-and-an-apple-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Shift Up has gifted 300 employees a 5 million won cash bonus ($3400 USD), Apple AirPods Max, and Apple Watches for this New Year’s. As mentioned above, Shift Up is known to shower their employees with gifts; they have previously received items such as iPhone 14s, credit cards loaded with 10 million won ($6,800 USD), PlayStation 5 Pros, and Switch 2s. Don’t you wish you were working at Shift Up as well? </p>



<p>Currently, the dev team is working on the Stellar Blade sequel and other projects, and this could be the best way to motivate them and keep their interests aligned. The dev team is also working on a cross-platform title called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-upcoming-title-will-be-published-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Spirits</a>, which will be created through “a strategic partnership to include both publishing and joint development,” with Tencent’s Level Infinite. </p>







<p>In other news, Stellar Blade devs are considering additional platform expansions, which could mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-could-come-to-xbox-and-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 and Xbox ports</a> are on the way. Additionally, Shift Up is planning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multi-platform release</a> for the sequel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The countdown until the release of Hytale is rapidly approaching the end, and as players across the world gear up for the release of the title, questions have naturally emerged about the Hytale release time.</p>



<p>Hytale releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 13</a> as a PC exclusive, though it is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-steam-how-to-buy-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">not available on Steam</a> at launch, after a rollercoaster ride through development that saw the title cancelled by Riot Games last year, before then being re-acquired by the original creators.</p>



<p>There’s still a long development journey ahead until a full 1.0 release, but players will finally be able to sink their teeth into Hytale imminently, and Insider Gaming has the release time details.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-time-does-hytale-release">What Time Does Hytale Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Go time. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale has a confirmed release time of 10 AM ET/3 PM GMT on PC, as revealed by a countdown timer on the official Hytale website.</strong></p>



<p>The official countdown on the <a href="https://hytale.com/countdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale website</a> has been running for a while, counting down exactly how many days, hours, minutes, and seconds are left before players can dive into the game.</p>



<p>Hytale devs are expecting around one million players on launch day, so there could be some server issues to iron out early on, but the hope is that when the doors open, players will be able to flock in.</p>



<p>If you are having issues launching the game when the release time has passed, you may have to wait and try again, and make sure to keep an eye on the official Hytale social media accounts for any news and updates on ongoing problems.</p>



<p>The table below shows the exact release time for Hytale in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Hytale Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Jan. 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
