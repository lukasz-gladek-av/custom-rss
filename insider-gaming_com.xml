<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has some great close-range options for smaller maps like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-24-7-playlist-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown</a> and Stakeout, but none are quite as powerful as Shotguns. The ASG-89 is the fastest-firing Shotgun in the game, but you’ll need the best attachments for it to experience its true power.</p>



<p>With that said, here’s the best loadout for the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-asg-89-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-asg-89">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-asg-89">Best Secondary for ASG-89</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock ASG-89</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-asg-89-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the ASG-89 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-asg-89-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best ASG-89 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: CQB Grip</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Balanced Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Kicking off our best ASG-89 loadout in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> is the <strong>Long Barrel</strong>, which improves the Shotgun’s damage range, which is pretty poor otherwise. Then, the <strong>Fast Mag I</strong> provides a quicker reload at the expense of some bullets, while the <strong>CQB Grip</strong> gives you some dive, slide, and sprint to fire speed to get your shots off faster while being mobile.</p>



<p>The <strong>Balanced Stock</strong> further boosts mobility, improving strafing, hipfire, movement, and aim walking movement speeds. Lastly, to ensure you’re finishing enemies as quickly as possible, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> attachment is essential for increasing the Shotgun’s fire rate.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-asg-89">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for ASG-89</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>We’re focussing on mobility with the ASG-89 so that you can get up close and personal effortlessly and put enemies to bed. <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> improves movement speed while reloading and using Equipment, while <strong>Assassin</strong> lets you track enemies on a KIllstreak for more intel on the opposition’s position. </p>



<p><strong>Double Time </strong>boosts Tac-Sprint so you can reach top speed for longer, and thanks to the <strong>Perk Greed</strong> Wild Card, we’ve gone with <strong>Dexterity</strong> for our fourth Perk, which reduces weapon motion when jumping, sliding, and diving, as well as decreasing fall damage.</p>



<p>As for Equipment, we like a <strong>Semtex</strong> for the quick throw and detention time, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> keeps you topped up on health to stay in the fight. Finally, the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> is a top choice for a Shotgun loadout, as you’ll want to protect your flank while behind enemy lines.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-asg-89">Best Secondary for ASG-89</h2>



<p>The <strong>Grekhova</strong> is the best Secondary for the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6, as it’s fully automatic, so when you need to hit the target and finish a kill off, the fast fire rate gives you plenty of leeway to do so.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock ASG-89 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>To unlock the ASG-89 you’ll need to hit <strong>Level 31</strong> in Black Ops 6. This can be done in Multiplayer or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-guided-zombies-come-out-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a>, and using our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best tips to level up fast</a>, you should make it there fairly quickly.</p>



<p>Be sure to take advantage of Double XP weekends and playlists like Nuketown 24/7, as those will help net you a load of XP.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-asg-89-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the ASG-89 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The ASG-89 is <strong>very good for small maps</strong>, but it isn’t so great outside of close quarters. So, we recommend either running it as a secondary with an Overkill class or only using it when you play a small map like the ones found on Face Off Moshpit.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-asg-89-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>As the only other Shotgun in Black Ops 6, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-marine-sp-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marine SP</a> is a great alternative to use while you wait to unlock the ASG-89. Another great close-range weapon is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-kompakt-92-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kompakt 92</a>, an extremely fast-firing SMG that can shred enemies with a rapid TTK.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 is Still Planned to be Announced Before April 2025, Says Nintendo]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-is-still-planned-to-be-announced-before-april-2025-says-nintendo.1027677/</guid>

<p>Nintendo has announced that the Nintendo Switch 2 is still scheduled to be announced during this fiscal year.</p>



<p>The news came following Nintendo’s latest earnings call. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa announced that the company will “make an announcement about the successor of the Nintendo Switch this fiscal year.” This means that the company still currently intends to make the announcement by March 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Signs of fatigue over the original Nintendo Switch are beginning to show, too. During the same <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investor call</a>, Nintendo announced that the company is lowering its hardware forecast after sales declined in Q1-Q2 year-on-year by 31%. Nintendo now expects the Nintendo Switch to sell 12.5 million units in its fiscal year, down from its initial 13.5 forecast; a 10% reduction.</p>



<p>As for exactly when the Nintendo Switch 2 will be released remains to be seen, but earlier this year, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa had already announced that the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-nintendo-switch-2-before-april-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will not be released until Nintendo’s next fiscal year</a>, which starts April 1, 2025.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-prototype-designs-seemingly-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prototype designs of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> leaked online, including specifications for the new console, which will feature 12GB of RAM, HDMI 2.1 support, and even 256GB of internal storage. The latest rumors on the system claim that it will&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be backwards compatible and support 4K</a>&nbsp;resolution.</p>
