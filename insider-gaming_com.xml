<p>The next 12 months are shaping up to be some of the best for Microsoft and the Xbox Series X|S systems since they launched in 2020. While there have been some great games over the last four years — Forza Horizon 5 and STALKER 2, just to name a couple —  for the latest Microsoft consoles, it’s been a bit hit or miss for the most part of this generation. In 2025, that appears to be changing. So, let’s look at the biggest Xbox games expected to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Whether it’s an Xbox exclusive or an anticipated multiplatform title, there’s no shortage of games coming that will leave you wondering how you are going to find the time (and money) for everything.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8 Biggest PlayStation Games Coming in 2025</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-biggest-xbox-exclusives-of-2025">Biggest Xbox Exclusives Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-avowed">Avowed</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Avowed is the upcoming first-person RPG developed by Obsidian Entertainment, set in the high-fantasy world of Eora, the same universe Pillars of Eternity. The game was originally scheduled to release in October 2024, but was pushed to February 18, 2025 by Xbox Game Studios in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-wasnt-due-to-game-quality-phil-spencer-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">order to let the game breath</a> more rather than releasing it so close to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. </p>



<p>The game will feel familiar to fans of Skyrim and other fantasy RPGs, with various abilities and skills to help you experience the world how you like. For those concerned about the game being first-person, fear not. Avowed will have the option to play in third person. It will also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the developers of We Happy Few and Contrast, South of Midnight takes players to the deep south of the United States. The game sees you play Hazel who becomes a Weaver after a storm hits her home of Prospero. According to Compulsion Games, a Weaver is a “magical  mender of broken bonds and spirits”. </p>



<p>“Imbued with these new abilities, Hazel will confront and subdue dangerous creatures, untangle the webs of her own family’s shared past and -if she’s lucky – find her way to a place that feels like home,”  the game’s description reads.</p>



<p>No release date has been announced, but the game is planned to release in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Officially announced in 2020, Fable has been in development for nearly a decade. Not only is it the fourth main installment of the series, but it’s also serving as a reboot for the franchise.</p>



<p>Developer Playground Games has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEQRwpMYPaw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a couple trailers</a> for the game so far, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FiBmVBaY0g&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">each more promising</a> than the last. The game also features Richard Ayoade as a giant who doesn’t seem too fond of the main character, or heroes in general.</p>



<p>Fable is scheduled for 2025 — rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-on-fables-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have it scheduled for late 2025</a> — and will be available on day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A prequel set 14 years before the original game, Gears of War: E-Day centers around young versions of Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago. The game’s story — that we know so far — has players deal with the locust horde during Emergence Day. Not much else is known about the game’s features, but that should be coming over the coming months.</p>



<p>Gears of War: E-Day hasn’t been confirmed for a 2025 release, but <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1801291340569071619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the latest rumors</a> are pointing to the possibility. This is one Xbox exclusive, however, that could be come in 2026 instead.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-xbox-games-of-2025">Biggest Xbox Games Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-gta-6">Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Did you think this would be a list of biggest games and not include GTA 6? The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-most-anticipated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most anticipated game of the year</a> — and likely the last decade or more — GTA 6 is currently planned for a 2025 despite countless rumors of an eventual delay to 2026.</p>



<p>It’s been nearly 12 years since the last game in the series was released, and, based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-world-record-broken/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer alone</a>, GTA 6 could go down as the biggest launch in video game history. The anticipation for the game isn’t just with fans, either. Even those in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">industry are making decisions</a> about their releases around what Rockstar decides to do</p>



<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">First revealed by Insider Gaming</a>, DOOM: The Dark Ages is a prequel to 2016’s DOOM. A single-player game, DOOM: The Dark Ages “tells the epic cinematic origin story of the DOOM Slayer’s rage.” According to developer id Software, the game sees you control DOOM Slayer as he tries to protect a kingdom against the demons from Hell.</p>



<p>Not much else is known about the game at the moment, but that should be coming over the next few months. And for those on PlayStation 5 who were worried about not getting the next DOOM game, it should be noted that the game will launch on PS5 the same day.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another game from Obsidian Entertainment coming in 2025, The Outer Worlds 2 was first announced at E3 2021. At the time, the developers bluntly stated that there was nothing else ready to be shown to players. Three years later, and fans got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer at The Game Awards 2024</a> along with a confirmed 2025 release window.</p>



<p>The game took “three times longer to make” and will be at least “two times bigger” according to the fun gameplay reveal trailer. Like the first, The Outer Worlds 2 will be a first-person RPG that takes players to the new Arcadia colony where a factional war has broken out that you have to navigate. In addition to launching on Xbox, the game will be available on PS5 and Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>By the time it launches in 2025, it’ll have been six years since Borderlands 3 was released. While fans have gotten Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and New Tales from the Borderlands in between, it still felt like something was missing. With Borderlands 4, players will explore a brand new location with four new vault hunters along with a cast of returning characters.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-borderlands-4-trailer-first-look-at-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first look at gameplay</a> was shown at The Game Awards 2024 that should quench the thirst for Borderlands content until Gearbox starts giving more deep dives into the game. One thing to expect is less <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“toilet humor”</a> this time around, according to one of the game’s developers. Borderlands 4 is set to release in 2025, and Take-Two has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-will-not-release-close-to-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that it won’t release</a> around GTA 6.</p>

<p>An area of development for two of Hideo Kojima’s upcoming games have been delayed. In a post on social media, Kojima said that both OD and Physint have been impacted by the current <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-strike-with-video-game-voice-and-performance-artists-to-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA strike</a>.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his post</a>, Kojima gave players an update on where things stand with his three main projects — Death Stranding 2, OD, and Physint. Regarding Death Stranding 2, he says that the team “started to play and build up the game” over the summer after working on music production, Japanese voice recording, and more. For the other two games, however, there have been hiccups. </p>



<p>First, with OD, Kojima says that game development continued along with actor and environment scanning. In the second half of the year, though, scanning and filming was suspended due to the strike. For Physint, casting was suspended because of the strike.</p>



<p>Kojima said that the hold is to resume next year. That’s as long as a deal reached, of course. The current <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA strike began in July</a> after 18 months of negotiations over AI protections for video game actors. As of publishing, there is no update on where the talks stand.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[7 Major Co-op Games Coming in 2025]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Co-op games are alive and well, and many more are scheduled to be released in 2025 to fraternize with friendships and reinforce relationships—maybe. 2025’s co-op titles ensure plenty of reason to be optimistic if you enjoy playing on a couch with a friend, or online.</p>



<p>I come from a generation of playing PlayStation 1 and 2 games with friends in co-op. The feeling of sitting next to someone and experiencing the same whirlwind of emotions together as you beat a level is something the intangible nature of online co-op can’t replicate. However, I choose online co-op over no co-op at all—which is the way the games industry seemed to be heading for a while.</p>



<p>The art of co-op continues to thrive, and 2025’s biggest partner-up titles are already stirring up emotions again.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-co-op-games-releasing-in-2025">Biggest Co-op Games Releasing in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Who are you? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4 is cutting back on the toilet humor</a>, but this shouldn’t detract from what is sure to be another wild Pandora ride. Co-op has been a big aspect of the series since its debut, encouraging you to team up with other Vault Hunters and take out gun-wielding corporate stooges, and deranged Psychos. Borderlands 4 looks to be more of what we’ve become accustomed to, and I’m so glad I can use a plethora of inane weapons to destroy with friends.</p>



<h3 id="h-killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Ew. Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>As an FPS enthusiast, I really can’t wait for Killing Floor 3. If you love first-person shooters with gory action, gratuitous violence, banging soundtracks, and replayability, Tripwire Interactive’s Killing Floor 3 is the answer. Its stylings and gameplay share a lot in common with modern DOOM, sure, but this isn’t a bad thing. In a world rife with hero, extraction, and military shooters, Killing Floor 3 is a gruesome breath of blood-soaked air. Lock and load with a squad of up to six friends to take down Zeds.</p>



<h3 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Disgusting and delightful. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Low and Alone are the new and curiously named protagonists of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>—with the emphasis being on the plural. There are <em>two main characters</em> to escort through a seemingly inescapable journey of hell this time around; and you can do this on your own, switching between the two, or have a second person join you. It’s probably better for your sanity if you have someone to hold onto during Little Nightmare 3’s decidedly hairier moments.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dual dissection. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Dying Light franchise continues with 2025’s The Beast. This standalone sequel sees Kyle Crane return to the main title role—hero of the original—and it’s set some 13 years later. Kyle is a grizzled, zombie-killing veteran at this point, but a second pair of veteran-like hands doesn’t go amiss. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> supports co-op, and buddying up improves your survival chances during the series’ neverending outbreak.</p>



<h3 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</h3>



<figure><figcaption>How to make the best better. Credit to Bandai Namco &amp; FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign was easily one of the most shocking announcements from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>. A fascinating crossover featuring FromSoftware’s Elden Ring world, and the influence of action experts—Bandai Namco Entertainment. It’s not DLC, this is a fully-fledged game, and one of the biggest differences between Nightreign and traditional Elden Ring is co-op. Nightreign allows you to team up into a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trio</a> (not two, sadly) and enjoy the splendor and sickness of an alternate Limgrave in harrowing harmony.</p>



<h3 id="h-stage-fright">Stage Fright</h3>



<figure><figcaption>This ain’t no kitchen. Credit to Ghost Town Games Ltd.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to describe the angst and frustration caused by your fiancé failing to execute a last-minute beef patty throw to earn full stars on a level—but this was part of Overcooked’s charm. Ghost Town Games cooked up magic with the cooking simulation franchise, and the studio is moving to pastures new with Stage Fright. The team’s creativity looks to be in full effect here with Stage Fright promising two distinct worlds playing out side-by-side, and you need to solve puzzles and escape predicaments with a co-op cohort. This is one to keep an eye on for sure.</p>



<h3 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We want a dragon. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, what better way to round out this list? Hazelight Studios is masterminded by the enigmatic auteur Josef Fares. The charismatic director has helmed iconic co-op games, including Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, A Way Out, and It Takes Two—proclaimed GOTY by The Game Awards in 2021. Now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> has the impossible task of trying to one-up It Takes Two, but the early signs are promising, and this task might be possible. It’s designed purely with co-op in mind, and has you taking part in a ton of mini-games and trying out many gameplay-shifting concepts. Split Fiction’s expectations are high, and it includes the lauded “Friend’s Pass” system again—meaning you only need one copy!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/use-the-uchigatana-in-your-new-elden-ring-build-in-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/use-the-uchigatana-in-your-new-elden-ring-build-in-2025.1071660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/use-the-uchigatana-in-your-new-elden-ring-build-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If your <strong>Elden Ring</strong> build revolves around the Samurai class and move set, chances are you want to track down and equip a second Uchigatana. Even if you’re not playing Samura, knowing where to find the Uchigatana in Elden Ring proves worthwhile, as it is a durable, quick weapon that scales with Strength and Dexterity.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-the-uchigatana-in-elden-ring"><strong>Where is the Uchigatana in Elden Ring?</strong></h2>



<p>You can find the Uchigatana one of two ways, either as starting equipment for the Samurai class, as previously mentioned, or out in the world via a dungeon.</p>



<p>For the latter, <strong>you’ll find the Uchigatana in Deathtouched Catacombs</strong>, in Stormhill, Limgrave, where you’ll have to defeat a few skeletons and activate a lever to unlock the door leading into the hall.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Within the catacombs, fight through the undead until you discover a dead body handing over the edge of the floor. It’s here that you’ll find the Uchigatana.</p>







<h2><strong>How Good is the Uchigatana?</strong></h2>



<p>The Uchigatana in <em>Elden Ring</em> is one of the best early-game weapons, as it is viable for both Piercing and Slash Damage. Furthermore, its Weapon Skill, <strong>Unsheathe</strong>, can help you down most bosses with relative ease early on.</p>



<p>Thankfully, you can <strong>upgrade the Uchigatana using Smithing Stones</strong>, which makes it stronger overall. Over time, the blade will cause bleed buildup, which is ever-useful when dealing with bosses with an increased health pool.</p>



<p>And yes, you can infuse the Uchigatana with <strong>Ashes of War</strong>. These include the likes of Sword Dance, Vacuum Slice, Bloodhound’s Step, Raptor of the Mists, Lighting Slash, Flame of the Redmanes, Carian Grandeur, Bloody Slash, and Seppuku, among countless others.</p>
