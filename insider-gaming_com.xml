<p>There won’t be a Battle Royale mode coming to Delta Force any time soon.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hb22q5/delta_force_game_director_here_ask_me_anything/?sort=new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ask Me Anything</a> on Reddit on Tuesday, Delta Force Game Director Shadow Guo was asked about the possibility. Immediately, however, he shot the idea down.</p>



<p>“We&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have&nbsp;such&nbsp;plans&nbsp;for&nbsp;now&nbsp;as&nbsp;our&nbsp;primary&nbsp;focus&nbsp;is&nbsp;on&nbsp;Operations&nbsp;and&nbsp;Warfare,” Guo said..</p>



<p>Instead of a Battle Royale, Guo pointed to the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-release-single-player-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Black Hawk Down</a> campaign mode. In an answer to another question, Guo talked about the inspiration behind the setting and theme for the campaign and it being different than multiplayer’s setting, saying they wanted to honor past Delta Force Games.</p>



<p>“We are working hard to preserve and expand the Delta Force franchise,” Guo said. “The campaign, which is set in the 90s, is our love letter to classic Delta Force titles. We would also like to create something new for the Delta Force universe, hence the 2035 timeline set in the multiplayer part.”</p>



<p>He added that the development is “coming along nicely” and things are looking good for the Q1 2025 (January) release of the mode.</p>



<p>“Our team will be sharing more details when it’s closer to the campaign’s launch,” he said.</p>

<p>The extraction shooter genre has exploded in recent years, and it’s arguably down to the ongoing success of Escape from Tarkov, from Battlestate Games. This spearhead of a game has popularised the extraction shooter gameplay loop, so much so that many developers have tried to get in on the action in the last two or three years.</p>



<p>One such attempt to mirror Tarkov’s success comes in the form of PIONER, a new post-apocalyptic MMO FPS from GFA Games, a Serbian studio.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-stalker-and-metro-oh-my">Tarkov, STALKER, and Metro – Oh, My!</h2>



<p>PIONER recently went live on Steam, which means users can now add the harrowing FPS title to their wishlist in anticipation of the game’s impending release, which is slated for 2025.</p>



<p>Here’s the game’s description from Steam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>PIONER</em>&nbsp;is an open-world MMO first-person shooter set in a haunting, alternative-reality world where Soviet-era structures lie abandoned on a desolate, post-apocalyptic island. In this immersive environment, the gameplay experience is defined by dynamic PvE and PvP elements, where realism takes priority over traditional health bars or character levels. </p>



<p>With a sprawling map of 50+ square kilometers, not counting hidden dungeons, players can explore a world rich with mystery and danger, encountering story quests and faction missions that influence relationships and loyalty rewards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wrapped up within PIONER is ‘Shadowlands’, an extraction shooter mode that boasts the core mechanics typical for the genre. Players are invited to enter the supersized map, loot and fight to their heart’s desire, and then attempt to successfully extract from the map.</p>



<p>PIONER has been inspired by other, similar titles. Elements of STALKER, Metro, and Fallout can all be seen in the clips, shots, and trailers that have been released in the last year or so, which unfortunately means that the game’s make-up and overall aesthetic aren’t going to stand apart from the competition.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Bold promises have been made regarding the ultimate delivery of PIONER. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s bio on Steam</a>, GFA Games has promised sci-fi-influenced lore, a ‘rich’ campaign, diverse activities including <strong>casino games and fishing</strong>, and extensive survival mechanics.</p>
