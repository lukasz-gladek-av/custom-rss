            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has dropped its Xbox Games Publishing Guide for everyone to see. The guide, which was strictly under NDAs and such, is now fully available, coincidentally around the Steam Machine’s reveal.</p>







<p>For many indie developers, Steam has been a beacon for those who want to publish their first title. Via SteamDirect, one can, realistically, make a game, submit it, and it’ll be on the gaming platform in a little over a month. However, for other companies like PlayStation and Nintendo, it can be a bit more trickier to do. However, one company that has been a bit hard to tackle for indies is Microsoft. Despite the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/idxbox-showcase-october-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ID@Xbox program</a>, many games are just not releasing on the consoles, with many citing the difficult process. Now, in the advent of the Steam Machine, Microsoft has decided to pull back the curtain and make the once-hidden guide available to all.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-makes-xbox-games-publishing-guide-available-for-everyone">Microsoft Makes Xbox Games Publishing Guide Available for Everyone</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/11/unlocking-access-to-game-publishing-documentation-for-all-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Game Dev Blog</a>, Senior Program Manager at ID@Xbox, Ed Stewart, announced that <strong>the official Xbox Games Publishing Guide</strong> is <strong>available for free</strong> to everyone. The guide can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/game-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> for those interested. Speaking on the opening, Stewart said the following,</p>



<p>“<strong>By opening our Game Publishing Documentation, we’re removing barriers to learning and making it easier for teams of all sizes to understand what it takes to ship a game on Xbox</strong>,” Ed Stewart says in the blog. “<strong>Whether you’re a first-time independent developer or a seasoned publisher, you can now browse the guide freely, share it with your team, and reference it throughout development.</strong>“</p>



<p>The move does take a page right out of Steam’s playbook, which couldn’t be more convenient. The PC-only company recently announced it’s taking on the console market with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-reveals-steam-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>. Its console will be able to play Steam games from your PC onto the TV. Microsoft is aware of it, as Xbox’s Phil Spencer congratulated the team. Perhaps this is the company wanting to become Steam or like them. Seeing as it’s putting exclusives like Halo and Gears of War on different consoles, it could be the future for Xbox.</p>







<p>What do you think of Microsoft releasing its Xbox Games Publishing Guide? Do you think more indies will make it onto Xbox? Think Microsoft wants to be Steam?

<p>It’s been a packed week in the gaming industry, and if you’re trying to catch up on the gaming news you may have missed, Insider Gaming’s got everything covered. Battlefield 6 led the way with major updates on new post-launch modes and fixes for REDSEC and weapon bloom coming next week. Ubisoft, meanwhile, caused confusion after halting share trading and delaying its earnings report just minutes before release, all while quietly working on a new multiplayer shooter behind the scenes.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, PlayStation signaled that the PlayStation 5 (PS5) is only halfway through its lifecycle, the United Football League (UFL) is exploring the potential of becoming an officially licensed football video game, and it was revealed that God of War developer Sony Santa Monica had a new IP canceled despite more than $25 million invested into the project.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-getting-easier-first-time-decade/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-getting-easier-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade.1354222/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever played Escape from Tarkov from a fresh, uninitiated perspective, you’ll know that it’s <strong>not </strong>a welcoming game. It’s one of the most challenging shooters ever developed, and fans of the spearhead extraction title love to lord it over other gamers when they become <strong>cracked </strong>at Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>As the game hits 1.0 tomorrow, Battlestate Games is planning something that will, for the first time in a decade, make Escape from Tarkov <strong>easier for new players to understand</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-is-getting-a-tutorial">Escape from Tarkov is Getting a <em>Tutorial</em></h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has been pretty rough for years. You buy it, create a basic character, and are thrown into the game to figure out for yourself how the core mechanics work. The first tasks put to you are simple, but you have zero guidance, no map markers, and little in the way of any indication of where to go.</p>



<p>The game’s core mechanics were never explained, tactics were never outlined, and functions like healing, inventory management, and weapon handling were left up to the player to discover and master.</p>



<p>That’s why it comes as a surprise to learn what Escape from Tarkov has planned for the 1.0 release, which is dropping tomorrow after more than a decade of development.</p>



<p>When new players enter the fight in Escape from Tarkov from tomorrow, they’ll be met <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/363" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with a <strong>tutorial</strong></a> designed to help them learn the ropes. But it doesn’t end there. Beyond the tutorial, Battlestate Games has outlined step-by-step progression guides, building on the scattering of guides it introduced over the last year or so.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has never had a strict tutorial, only ‘more basic’ starter missions that were designed to ease players into the brutal game world, but even they were often sticking points early on in every ‘reset’ (read: wipe).</p>







<p>The tutorial arrives with a non-linear story campaign and end-game content, a new map, new mechanics and weapons, improvements across the audio and graphics suite in the game, and <strong>more than 1,000 improvements </strong>across the board.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-splinter-cell-ubisoft-canceled/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-splinter-cell-was-in-development-but-ubisoft-canceled-it.1354183/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft was working on a new entry in the Splinter Cell franchise, but Ubisoft decided to cancel it before it was ever announced.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, AdHoc Studio co-founder Nick Herman spoke about how Dispatch came to be and an interesting situation that led to the studio’s formation.</p>







<p>Herman was hired in 2017 by Ubisoft, along two other AdHoc cofounders Pierre Shorette and Dennis Lenart, and moved to work in Ubisoft’s San Francisco office. Upon arrival, they were put on the new Splinter Cell project.</p>



<p><strong>“I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,”</strong> Herman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">told Schreier</a>. <strong>“And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”</strong></p>











<p>Unfortunately, the game didn’t get very far. After just months of work, Ubisoft started making pivots on its plans. It seemed like the writing was on the wall for the game. </p>



<p>“<strong>It was exciting to go to work for the first six months because we thought we were going to be able to make something really great,” </strong>Herman said. <strong>“And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don’t anymore. It’s a common thing in games.”</strong></p>







<p>Herman, Shorette, and Lenart would leave Ubisoft after the project was cancelled and form AdHoc Studio along with Michael Choung in 2018. </p>



<p>Despite no new game in the franchise since Splinter Cell: Blacklist in 2013, Splinter Cell isn’t dead. Ubisoft is currently working on a remake of the original game that, as of late 2024, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still planned for a 2026 release</a>. Since then, however, it’s been quite silent on its status. </p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft has moved into a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnership with Tencent</a>, started <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-company-officially-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new subsidiary</a>, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-delays-earnings-report-halts-share-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed reporting its earnings</a> just minutes before they were scheduled to release.</p>
