<p>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon<strong> </strong>Legends: Z-A has been released and it provides a welcome relief for those grinding for the Shiny Charm, removing a tiresome requirement.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-shiny-charm-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shiny Charm in Pokémon<strong> </strong>Legends: Z-A</a> is unlocked by maximizing the level of Mable’s Research Tasks, and, in the base game, obtaining it required completing one of the most tedious grinds in franchise history. However, that has now changed.</p>

<p>To obtain the Shiny Charm in the base game of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, players had to complete almost all of Mable’s Research Tasks, and it was impossible to claim the reward without completing one task in particular.</p>



<p>Players had to grind through a whopping 1,000 victories in the game, which required repeatedly churning through the Z-A Royale to defeat trainers before the final reward was dished out.</p>



<p>The launch of the Mega Dimension DLC changes that, however, as additional Research Tasks are provided by Mable, making it possible to obtain the Shiny Charm without having to secure 1,000 victories.</p>



<p>Though the new tasks come too late for those who have already grinded through the requirements to obtain the charm, which significantly increases the likelihood of encountering Shiny Pokémon, it’s a welcome boost for those yet to complete the grind.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty to do, however, as the new Research Tasks require exploring Hyperspace Lumiose to catch new Pokémon, obtain new Mega Evolutions, and enter pockets of Hyperspace. However, they’re much easier to tick off than the 1,000 battles requirement.</p>

<p>Activision has announced that moving forward, it will no longer have back-to-back releases of Call of Duty’s subfranchises like Modern Warfare and Black Ops.</p>



<p>The news came as part of a new update from Activision, which acknowledged that the franchise has recently failed to meet some players’ expectations. The admission comes following what has been described to Insider Gaming from sources as a “rough launch” for Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>“We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward,” the blog post read.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-call-of-duty-stop-being-annual">Will Call of Duty Stop Being Annual?</h2>



<p>Despite Activision’s admission and realisation that Call of Duty has failed to meet some players’ expectations, they have pretty much said that annual releases will continue moving forward, which will provide fans with an “absolutely unique experience each and every year.”</p>



<p>It’s said that those plans will not be shared today but will be “when the time is right.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> concludes with the following message,</p>



<p>“To&nbsp;be clear, the future of Call of Duty is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams. We have been building the next era of Call of Duty, and it will deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward. We look forward to welcoming you in, listening to you, and moving forward together.&nbsp;“</p>



<p>What do you think of Activision’s admission? Do you think Call of Duty should stop doing annual releases altogether? </p>
