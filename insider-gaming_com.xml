            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bend Studio was forced to shut down the ongoing development of an unannounced live-service shooter last year amid restructuring and layoffs that led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-lays-off-around-30-of-staff-following-live-service-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30% of the company</a> disappearing. The game that was cancelled would have been a third-person, military-themed shooter, but we know little more than that about the abandoned title.</p>



<p>Recently, fresh files surfaced online from the project, taken from a former Bend Studio animator responsible for designing turrets, character gait, and some minor animations, such as throwing knives and deploying drones.</p>







<h2 id="h-mirror-pond-animations-appear-online">‘Mirror Pond’ Animations Appear Online</h2>



<p>It’s not a huge leap into uncovering Mirror Pond, which was the project name for Bend Studio’s cancelled third-person shooter, but it’s <strong>something</strong>. In the files pulled from a former animator’s portfolio, we can see a third-person perspective (which we already knew about) explored from a more technical standpoint.</p>



<p>What’s assumed to be a player character model walks across the screen, brandishing long firearms and traipsing with a traditional military movement pattern. In another clip, we see the same character throwing what looks like knives, before shooting something from a forearm-mounted device, and deploying a small drone mounted on their back.</p>



<p>There’s also a shot of a turret activating and firing at an unseen target.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>These files were uncovered by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-bend-studio-cancelled-live-service-title-mirror-pond-animations-surfaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">M</a>P1st, but no source was given.</p>



<p>It all points to Mirror Pond having been planned as a near-future third-person shooter of sorts, perhaps aligning with the bygone days of Syphon Filter. That’s one of the franchises that allowed Bend Studio to cut its teeth in the gaming world, and it featured spycraft, a third-person perspective, and techy gadgets.</p>



<p>In September 2025, Bend Studio opened up and started hiring again for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-hiring-for-a-new-multiplayer-game/">new, unannounced multiplayer title</a>. What that is remains to be seen, but it could be an attempt to recover the fragments of the cancelled live-service ‘Mirror Pond’.</p>



<p>Fans have long hoped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">a new Days Gone project</a> would surface, but as we all know, that’s very unlikely.</p>







<p>What do you think Mirror Pond would have looked like? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Isabela Merced is slated to star in a movie adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega’s </a>House of the Dead franchise.</p>



<p>It seems like video game franchises are being adapted for film and TV at a rapid pace. Not only are video game stalwarts like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog starring in brand-new movies, but more recent video games such as The Last of God and Uncharted are being adapted for TV series.</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Isabela Merced, known for her work in the aforementioned The Last of Us TV series, will be in a leading role in a new film about the House of the Dead. Paul W.S. Anderson will write and direct the project. He previously adapted the Resident Evil franchise for the big screen over 20 years ago.</p>



<p>He also adapted the Monster Hunter series for a 2020 film, but it was not nearly as well-received as the Resident Evil movies.</p>



<p>In 2003 and 2006, two House of the Dead films were released, but they were critically panned.</p>



<h2 id="h-history-of-the-house-of-the-dead">History of the House of the Dead</h2>



<p>How’s the dead began life in 1997. It was originally a light gun arcade game. Games were regularly released up until House of the Dead 4 in 2005. An arcade release in 2018 was titled “Scarlet Dawn.”</p>



<p>There were also spin-offs, such as 1999’s The Typing of the Dead, designed to improve typing; it was later re-released for the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. 1999 also saw the arcade release of Revenge, a beat-’em-up take on the franchise.</p>

<p>Another short trailer for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/" id="3170">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a> just dropped, and Yoshi again takes center stage, taking out one of Bowser’s most well-known minions in the most Yoshi way possible.</p>



<p>The new trailer, with the tagline “Level Up,” features previously seen clips of Bowser Jr., Mario, and Luigi. However, there are also new images of Princess Peach with Toad in a cyberpunk-looking environment, and at one point, they appear to enter a bar, with several low-level enemies from Mario video games giving them a dirty look.</p>



<p>Yoshi is also shown riding a motorcycle, similar to what Mario and Luigi did in a previous trailer. He also confronts Kamek, swallows him whole, lays an egg with Kamek’s glasses on it, and then pilots the vehicle Kamek had been piloting. Princess Rosalina is also seen in a brief action shot towards the end.</p>

<h2 id="h-this-movie-takes-inspiration-from-several-generations-of-super-mario-video-games">This Movie Takes Inspiration From Several Generations of Super Mario Video Games</h2>



<p>This movie is named after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/super-mario-galaxy/" id="2961">Super Mario Galaxy</a> video game, which was released on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-wii/" id="1031">Nintendo Wii</a>. but takes inspiration from many Mario games that came before and after the classic game from 2007.</p>



<p>A previous trailer showcased Birdo and Mouser from Super Mario Bros. 2. Baby Mario and Baby Luigi were also on display, being carried by Yoshi as they ran away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey.</p>



<p>There has been no sign yet of Donkey Kong or any of the Kongs that were featured in the first Super Mario movie.</p>







<p>The movie is slated for release on April 1. It was previously noted that the movie was in post-production after animation was completed.</p>
