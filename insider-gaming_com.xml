<p>Stranger Things recently wrapped after almost a decade of being on the air. On New Year’s Day, the final episode, with a whopping two-hour runtime, aired on Netflix and broke the hearts of millions of fans worldwide. Whether you loved it or hated it, the ultimate episode wrapped up almost every core story put forward by the writers over the last ten years.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the Duffer brothers, the creators of Stranger Things, revealed what Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed game inspired the <strong>ending battle </strong>against the Mind Flayer and Vecna in Stranger Things.</p>







<h2 id="h-that-s-how-you-take-down-these-monsters">‘That’s How You Take Down These Monsters’</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Variety</a>, Ross and Matt Duffer, the creators and directive minds behind Stranger Things, offered up all kinds of information about the show, how it wrapped, and what it took to get to this point.</p>



<p>Midway through the interview, the talk turned to the final battle between Vecna, the physical manifestation of the Mind Flayer, and the good guys from Hawkins. It was a phenomenal sequence that showed how these unlikely heroes were able to get the upper hand on a behemoth of an opponent like the Mind Flayer.</p>



<p>Matt Duffer explained what inspired the final battle:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We were thinking about D&amp;D, and I was playing&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate 3&nbsp;at the time, and&nbsp;we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together. Everyone had fully realized — either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. </p>



<p>They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and something like&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 and Stranger Things are inherently linked to the same Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe. The core exception is that Baldur’s Gate 3 remains more aligned with the source material, while Stranger Things is more <strong>inspired by </strong>it and uses references in an alternate way.</p>



<p>For instance, the young heroes in Stranger Things name the series’ Big Bad the ‘Mind Flayer’, flanked by ‘Vecna’, but that’s not their true identity; it’s just what the D&amp;D-loving kids refer to them as based on their attributes and make-up.</p>

<p>Detroit: Become Human is one of the best story-driven adventure titles ever made. It was pieced together by Quantic Dream and released way back in 2018, emerging on Steam as a port in 2020. The game tells the story of a race of androids breaking free from their programming and conditioning to rise against their human creators and oppressors.</p>



<p>In the last two weeks, Detroit: Become Human has established itself as a best-selling game on Steam, becoming the second-most bought title on the platform behind ARC Raiders and shifting almost (an estimated) <strong>one million copies</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-detroit-become-human-surging-on-steam">Why is Detroit: Become Human Surging on Steam?</h2>



<p>A recent report from Alinea Analytics revealed that Steam generated substantial revenue in December 2025. The Valve-backed storefront generated a whopping $1.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of more than 22%. The growth was elevated by games like ARC Raiders being released and selling extremely well in a short period.</p>



<p>One unexpected title to storm up the charts was 2018’s Detroit: Become Human, which Alinea estimates sold approximately 993,000 copies from December 21 to January 5. That’s almost <strong>one million sales</strong> for a game that was released nearly eight years ago.</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-steam-games-that-sold-the-most" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Alinea</a>, the staggering growth was spurred by the game having a deep discount – the steepest discount the title has ever seen on the platform. It crashed down from $40 to just $4, representing a fair amount of bang for the average gamer’s buck.</p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human was only topped by ARC Raiders, which sold around 1.2 million copies on Steam in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>The likes of PEAK, Battlefield 6, and R.E.P.O. also claimed spots in the best-seller charts on Steam.</p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human is a phenomenal and emotional game that is totally open-ended. It mirrors titles like Beyond: Two Souls, Heavy Rain, and Until Dawn, giving players full control over every action their characters make, allowing them to influence the direction of a story that has multiple endings and branching concepts.</p>



<p>The sales figures also pushed Detroit: Become Human to an all-time high peak player count of 25,615 users on January 4.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Promotes Strange Resident Evil Rip-off Named ‘Ebola Village’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-promote-resident-evil-rip-off-ebola-village/</link>
            <guid>1399069</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new trailer uploaded to the official PlayStation YouTube channel, gamers get a first-hand glimpse at ‘Ebola Village’, an upcoming first-person horror shooter coming January 23rd to PlayStation 5 and <strong>PlayStation 4</strong>. The title is the first bizarre note, and it only gets worse from there.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to point out the gen-AI cover for the video, the stark similarities to Resident Evil (right down to the game’s title font), and the low-quality make-up of the gameplay, which looks years out of date.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Ebola Village came out on PC several months ago. What’s even more perplexing is that this is the latest in a line of similar titles, none of which have ever managed to gain any traction.</p>











<p>The comments under the recent trailer upload for Ebola Village are immensely negative and accurately representative of the <strong>confusion </strong>PlayStation fans have about this game.</p>



<p>One wrote, ‘We got Resident Evil at home,’ playing on a classic meme, while another declared, ‘Official PlayStation account advertising a genuine ripoff shovelware game might be a new low.’</p>



<p>Here’s the full trailer, in case you want to see the content for yourself:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>The trailer showcases a few sequences that closely mirror content seen across the Resident Evil franchise in the last two decades or so. For instance, the player character being chased by a deranged villager wielding a chainsaw, which is instantly reminiscent of 2004’s Resident Evil 4.</p>



<p>Everything from the animations to the visuals screams ‘low budget’, and while that’s not normally a problem (we love indie games here), the subject matter of Ebola Village is much more than just ‘inspired’ by games like Resident Evil. In the comments under the video, gamers were quick to parody the title:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘What’s next, COVID City?’</li>



<li>‘Tuberculosis Town next’</li>



<li>‘From the makers of Coronaland and SARSville comes a terrifying new chapter’</li>
</ul>



<p>Ebola Village will be released digitally on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on January 23, and perhaps it’ll be worth playing to see how it shapes up after all. On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306030/EBOLA_VILLAGE/?curator_clanid=33714941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the game somehow managed to scrape a ‘Very Positive’ rating from 319 reviews, at the time of writing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/slasher-retires-cod-esports-not-fun-anymore/</link>
            <guid>1399066</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Austin ‘SlasheR’ Liddicoat has officially stepped back from competing in the Call of Duty League. This revelation comes after the 31-year-old secured multiple Major wins and a world championship title over a career spanning more than a decade. The veteran player made the announcement a few weeks into the 2026 CDL season, stepping down from the Carolina Royal Ravens.</p>



<p>In a recent stream, SlasheR went deep into why he retired, revealing that the competitive scene just wasn’t fun anymore. He stressed that the ‘new age’ competitors don’t have the same mindset, and he’s fed up with playing for the sake of playing.</p>







<h2 id="h-slasher-leaves-a-phenomenal-legacy">SlasheR Leaves a Phenomenal Legacy</h2>



<p>SlasheR has been one of the most impactful and stalwart players in the Call of Duty League over the years. At the time of his retirement, he was the most senior player in the scene and still putting up numbers.</p>



<p>His tenure at the topmost tier of Call of Duty esports saw him transition through some of the most prestigious teams in the space, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>FaZe Clan / Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Denial</li>



<li>Envy</li>



<li>100 Thieves / LA Thieves</li>



<li>OpTic</li>
</ul>



<p>In 2016, he won the CWL Championship while flying the Envy banner, fighting alongside JKap, John, and Apathy, all of whom have long since retired or moved on to content creation and coaching.</p>



<p>While streaming recently, SlasheR explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I started thinking about it over the… Honestly, even when we were practicing every day, I started thinking about it. It just wasn’t fun anymore. I feel like the way I approach practice and everything is very serious. Obviously, I want to have fun too, but I’m way more serious with it than a lot of the new-age kids.</p>



<p>It felt to me like a waste of time. We weren’t getting better, we were just playing to play, where I want to get better. I want to go hard every day. I was just like, ‘What’s the point of continuiing to Major I if I’m not enjoying it?’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He explained that he was only playing this long because he was still qualifying for LAN events, because the ‘online shit was just never fun’ for him.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>SlasheR also admitted that he hasn’t been ‘enjoying the games’, which is an unfortunate sentiment echoed by many pro players these days. The state of Call of Duty isn’t encouraging, and the reception of Black Ops 7 has been an all-time low.</p>



<p>Exceed will move up to take SlasheR’s spot on the Carolina Royal Ravens.</p>
