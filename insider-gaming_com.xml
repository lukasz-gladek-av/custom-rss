<p>EA Sports is set to pay players who appear in EA Sports College Football 26 a bit more money. According to an email sent out to NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) players (via <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6213494/2025/03/18/ea-sports-college-football-26-nil-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Athletic</a>), the company is increasing payment to $1,500 per player for their inclusion in the game.</p>



<p>That’s up from the $600 individual players received for College Football 25. </p>



<p>Players will also get a Deluxe Edition of the game, which is similar to what players from last year’s game received. Select athletes who are brand ambassadors for the game will get additional compensation.</p>



<p>The increase in player payments comes after College Football 25 became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">best-selling sports game</a> in US history, surpassing NBA 2K21. According to an EA representative, again via The Athletic, the increase was done as a way to “make sure athletes feel recognized for the success of the game.”</p>



<p>EA is expected to spend over $16 million on NIL rights for players to appear in the game before accounting for any extra payments for brand ambassadors as well as the cost of the game itself. </p>



<p>College Football 26 is expected to launch in July. After not being a part of last year’s game, it’s anticipated that real coaches will be added to the game this year after a <a href="https://x.com/bmarcello/status/1900019548520075267?s=46&amp;t=iGRZfb8A0Ak5amUsoqdLIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked cover</a> from a recent EA photoshoot made its way online. No other details about the game are currently known.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-assassins-creed-shadows-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest supersized title from Ubisoft in the flagship franchise. It’s enormous, like previous games, but just how big is the central map for this all-new title? Like the games that have been released since 2017, Assassin’s Creed Shadows boasts an enormous open-world environment for players to explore, and it can get pretty daunting.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in and determine how big the map is in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-map-size">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Map Size</h2>



<p>The map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is massive and split up into nine core regions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wakasa</li>



<li>Omi</li>



<li>Tamba</li>



<li>Yamashiro</li>



<li>Iga</li>



<li>Harima</li>



<li>Settsu</li>



<li>Yamato</li>



<li>Kii</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s one of the biggest maps released in the series thus far, and traversing it is often a chore because of mountainous terrain that can’t be overcome on foot. While you have a horse, Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t have a ‘path follow’ mechanic, which means you’re forced to make manual journeys quite often.</p>



<p>Additionally, the team at Ubisoft has advised that players use an immersive mode that removes map indicators and marked pathways, which means you’re relying on instincts and discovery to locate your objectives in this vast open world.</p>



<p>I’d say that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is just as big as – if not slightly bigger than – the core map in 2020’s Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-navigate-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">How to Navigate in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>The best way to navigate the massive map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is simply to explore. By using synchronisation viewpoints, you can get your bearings relatively easily, and you can use map markers to keep track of key locations you want to visit.</p>



<p>If you’re really stuck for navigation, you can employ Scouts that go out and determine the specific location of objectives for you. Alternatively, you can just use the guided mode to have map markers revealed in full, which makes the game a walk in the park.</p>



<p>It’s advised to stay out of the dense forests and mountainous regions of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows map, as moving through them can be laborious and, at times, impossible. You can’t climb every surface in this game as you could in previous titles.</p>



<p>It’s guaranteed to take you a <strong>very long time </strong>to uncover everything the Assassin’s Creed Shadows map has to offer, and there’s plenty of side content up for grabs. Be prepared to spend many hours exploring the beautiful environments found in this game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Sources Confident of NFL License Agreement]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sources-confident-of-nfl-license-agreement/</link>

<p>EA is “confident” that an extension of the licensing agreement between the company and the NFL will be reached and the partnership for Madden NFL will continue “for years to come”. That, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation.</p>



<p>For months now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-nfl-negotiating-license-extension-for-madden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negotiations between the league</a> and publisher regarding the exclusive NFL license that EA has held for 20 years have continued. The current deal is scheduled to end after the 2026 NFL season.</p>



<p>A reason behind the confidence of the partnership continuing are the current plans in development for the Madden NFL franchise.</p>



<p>“We have things in the works that are two, three, four years away,” one source said. “There’s a lot in the pipeline that has been heavily planned with designing well underway. Putting those resources into something that might be ending just wouldn’t make financial sense.”</p>



<h6 id="h-subscribe-insider-gaming-on-youtube">SUBSCRIBE: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming on YouTube</a></h6>



<p>When pressed on what that “pipeline” includes, sources wouldn’t go into much detail aside from saying there are features coming “brand new to the game”. They couldn’t confirm whether any will be ready for Madden 26 or not.</p>



<p>One NFL source said that the league is “so closely aligned with the development with the key beats and moments throughout the season” and that “over the years, that relationship has only gotten stronger.”</p>



<p>When asked about the possibility of EA retaining the license but in a non-exclusive matter, it wasn’t ruled out. However no one who spoke under the condition on anonymity think it’s likely unless the NFL is “blown away” by an offer to open it up.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that, as of publishing, nothing sources have said indicate that a deal has been signed. That said, there’s always the possibility that something has already been agreed up and limited people know about it. On the other side, until i’s are dotted and t’s are crossed, there’s always the chance things turn south.</p>



<p>When looking for official comment on the status of talks with EA regarding the license, the NFL chose to “hold off&nbsp;on providing any official commentary”.</p>



<p><em>NOTE: This is an expanded story of an exclusive that first appeared in the Insider Gaming newsletter.</em></p>

<p>In September 2024, Nicholas Prosper gunned down his mother and sister and stabbed his younger brother to death at their home in Luton in the United Kingdom. Today, the 19-year-old appeared in Luton Crown Court for sentencing, admitting in front of the room that he had planned the killings for several months and desired to extend his heinous goal by slaughtering schoolchildren.</p>



<p>In details obtained by the BBC, Prosper revealed a disturbing obsession with Clementine, a young female character from The Walking Dead games pieced together by Telltale. He insisted that his goal was to ‘join her in death’ and that he had been ‘chosen’ by her for this ‘mission’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-friday-the-13th">Friday the 13th</h2>



<p>Nicholas Prosper brutally murdered his family at their home in the United Kingdom, and if he weren’t apprehended by police two hours later, a reprehensible scene could have played out.</p>



<p>Prosper’s full plan was to venture into his old primary (elementary) school on Friday the 13th while dressed in a ‘distinctive outfit’ and wielding a shotgun he’d obtained illegally. Reportedly, he wanted to ‘execute’ as many as 30 children and had researched past massacres online.</p>



<p>In his defence, his barrister had stressed that Prosper was perhaps tainted by an internet ‘wormhole’ that caused something ‘very wrong’ to happen with the teenager’s psyche.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cn8ld834398t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The BBC</a> published exclusive details about the case, explaining how Prosper revealed to a prison nurse that he intended to kill himself after the shooting and that his ultimate desire was to ‘go to Clementine and join her’.</p>



<p>He was referring to a major character in Telltale’s The Walking Dead games, who appeared in the first title in 2012 as a young child before evolving into a hardened survivor.</p>



<p>Prosper posted a video online after murdering his family, in which he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am the chosen one; chosen by Clementine. I am guided as Christians are guided by Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also uploaded videos ahead of the crime, revealing his ‘distinctive’ outfit and wielding a plank of wood in place of the shotgun he’d eventually use.</p>



<p>The judge presiding over the case will pass sentencing on Wednesday.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-assassins-creed-shadows-character-naoe-yasuke/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-character-is-best-in-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-yasuke-vs-naoe.1138143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-assassins-creed-shadows-character-naoe-yasuke/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows offers a dual-protagonist system that presents the player with freedom of choice. Do you want to be the heavy-set warrior, Yasuke, or do you want to be the lithe and agile shinboi, Naoe? Both characters have unique abilities and loadouts, but which of them can be considered <strong>the best character </strong>in Assassin’s Creed Shadows to play as?</p>



<p>Read on to understand these characters and learn which of them is the best protagonist in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-vs-naoe-which-character-is-best">Yasuke vs Naoe – Which Character is Best?</h2>



<p>It’s mostly a subjective debate when it comes to determining which of the two Assassin’s Creed Shadows protagonists is the best.</p>



<p>If you prefer decimating your enemies with heavy attacks, you’ll probably pick Yasuke. If you’re more of a stealthy player who relies on shadows and subterfuge to achieve your goals, you’ll prefer Naoe.</p>



<p>Here are the advantages and disadvantages of both characters in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p><strong>Yasuke</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>High health pool</li>



<li>Incredibly powerful attacks</li>



<li>Can use a bow and teppo (gun)</li>



<li>Can easily dispatch even the toughest enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very slow, cumbersome parkour abilities</li>



<li>Tougher to remain hidden, almost impossible in some circumstances</li>



<li>No eagle vision or hidden blade</li>



<li>Attacks are typically slower and require more planning</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Naoe</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very fast and a fantastic parkour artist</li>



<li>Uses shinobi tools like smoke grenades, grapple hooks, and distraction mechanics to go unseen</li>



<li>Uses a wide range of melee weapons, most of which are designed around speed</li>



<li>Can assassinate enemies and use eagle vision to spot and mark enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Low health pool that is a challenge against tough enemies</li>



<li>Limited ranged weapons; can only use Kunai and Shuriken</li>



<li>Less physically dominating and won’t scare enemies as easily</li>
</ul>



<p>In general, I think that Assassin’s Creed fans will gravitate much more readily to Naoe, who represents the creed and what the series stands for. In truth, you’ll be splitting your time between both. However, after around 30 hours in the game at the time of writing, I can honestly and openly say that I’ve preferred my time spent with Naoe.</p>



<p>She’s much faster and more agile, and her parkour abilities are the best the franchise has ever seen. Her skillset makes her incredibly fluid, and the stealth factor with Naoe is off the charts. The only time I actively switch to Yasuke is if I’ve tried to win a fight with Naoe and have lost – if that’s the case, I bring in the hulking samurai to tackle the tougher enemies.</p>



<p>From a cosmetic perspective, I also enjoy Naoe’s outfits more. They’re better suited to the assassin lifestyle, but that’s not to take away from Yasuke’s incredible armour sets.</p>



<p>That’s which character I think is best in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but feel free to let me know what you think in the comments.</p>
