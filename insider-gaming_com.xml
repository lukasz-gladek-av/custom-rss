<p>New content continues to come thick and fast in Marvel Rivals, with the release date for Season 6.5 now rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>The launch of Season 6 made waves with the long-awaited addition of Deadpool, but NetEase is not resting on their laurels and have plenty more up their sleeves in future drops.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 release date, start times, and what to expect, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-marvel-rivals-season-6-5-release">When Does Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big drop. Image by NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 kicks off on February 13, but the mid-season transition means you won’t need to rapidly grind through the Battle Pass.</strong></p>



<p>As is customary in the mid-seasdon update, the Season 6 Battle Pass will continue, but there will be new additions in Season 6.5, including new cosmetics and likely limited-time passes.</p>



<p>The slew of new content won’t be as big as was seen at the start of Season 6, however, with the next big drop instead coming at the start of Season 7 in May.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-6-5-start-times">Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The start time for Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 has not been confirmed, but previous updates suggest the season will kick off at 2 AM PT on February 13.</strong></p>



<p>That means a later start in morning for those elsewhere in the United States, though it will still be in the early hours, while those in Europe have to wait until mid-morning, and those down under must wait until th evening.</p>



<p>The table below shows the expected Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 start times in major regions across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Jan. 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">4 AM – Jan. 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">5 AM – Jan. 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Jan. 16</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td data-align="center">8 PM – Jan. 16</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-season-6-5-content">All Marvel Rivals Season 6.5 Content</h2>



<p><strong>After Deadpool’s arrival at the start of Season 6, Season 6.5 is headlined by the arrival of Elsa Bloodstone as the latest playable character.</strong></p>



<p>New maps and new cosmetics are also set to be introduced, and there will likely be a Valentine’s Day collab introduced at the start of the season.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals could also issue further hints towards additions coming in the Season 7 launch in March, adding to the speculation after a gallery card featured teases for Black Cat and White Fox.</p>

<p><strong>An official start time for Fortnite Festival Season 13 has not been announced, though we do know it will be available when servers are back up after the February 5 patch.</strong></p>



<p>Downtime for Fortnite usually begins at 1 AM PT/4 AM ET and lasts between two and three hours. However, in some situations, downtime can be longer, particularly for larger updates or if an issue is discovered.</p>



<p>Expect Season 13 to be accessible around 4 AM PT/7 AM ET, and keep an eye on social media for news on when the game is back up.</p>

<p><strong>Epic Games has not officially announced the Fortnite Festival Season 13 headline act, though it’s widely understood to be Chappel Roan.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festivals-next-major-collab-may-have-been-found/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hints uncovered</a> earlier this month include a Pink Pony Club makeover to Fortnite’s iconic llama, along with a new microphone and drumset found by dataminers, all of which could be included as cosmetics in the Festival Pass.</p>



<p>Chappel Roan already has plenty of big hits in Fortnite as Jam Tracks, including the likes of Hot to Go and Good Luck, Babe!</p>
