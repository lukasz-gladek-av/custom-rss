<p>How often do you make an uninformed purchasing decision regarding video games? Many people wait for reviews—critic and user reviews—before buying a full-price game. Some people refuse to pay the full price. They’ll want for a sale in six to twelve months. But sometimes, you can’t help but play on day one. So, let’s explore a few notable Planet Coaster 2 reviews, many of which offer varying opinions on the theme park management game from Frontier Developments!</p>



<h2 id="h-planet-coaster-2-reviews-paint-a-vivid-picture">Planet Coaster 2 Reviews Paint a Vivid Picture</h2>



<p>If you look on the Planet Coaster 2 Metacritic, you’ll find the park management game currently sits at a ‘Generally Favorable’ score of 82, following 14 critic reviews since its launch on November 6 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. There are notable game reviews from IGN, PC Gamer, TheGamer, and plenty of other outlets that spent a bit of time with the title pre-launch. Here’s a rundown to help you decide whether it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/planet-coaster-2-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worth paying full price</a>!</p>







<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-coaster-2-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Despite how much I enjoy the act of building my ideal park, the original Planet Coaster was neither challenging nor interesting as a management tycoon game, and that has unfortunately not changed. Even after messing with the difficulty settings, of which there are several, I found it almost mindlessly simple to generate infinite money with a small number of flat rides and a high entry fee.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/planet-coaster-2-review-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Overall, Planet Coaster 2 feels like a natural evolution of the first game. Lessons have been learned, features added, mechanics improved, and the customisation of difficulty across the board – career mode has flexible difficulty levels which can be set on a per-scenario basis – really helps tailor the game to your level of experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/planet-coaster-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Structurally, Planet Coaster 2 differs little from the first. You can fix and fiddle with partially built parks in career mode, or construct your own from scratch in variations upon the sandbox. These include unrestrained creativity where money and space are no object, and the more moderated Challenge mode where at least some management skills are required.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/planet-coaster-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 is an ambitious sequel that expands sideways upon the foundation laid by its predecessor. The graphics are stunning, the water slide additions are fun, and the creative potential is immense, but it comes at a cost. The complexity of infrastructure systems interrupts the creative flow, making the impressively customizable experience feel unnecessarily convoluted at times.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/142057/planet-coaster-2-review-score" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShackNews</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>While I was playing Planet Coaster 2 for this review, I kept thinking about RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. Frontier Developments’ initial crack at theme park building and management simulation shares many ideas with their latest attempt. Tinkering with rollercoasters and waterparks in 2024 conjured a sort of nostalgia for this kind of game I didn’t think I’d have. And so, with a heavy heart, I tell you that they got me again.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Planet Coaster 2</em>&nbsp;is one of the pinnacles of the theme park simulator genre and while it doesn’t have a smooth learning curve for newcomers, it’s safe to say that those who have already mastered its systems will enjoy it immensely, with the ability to create anything you want the way you like it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re already paying for Xbox Game Pass monthly, doesn’t it make sense to check out every new release to see if it’s available? Why would you spend extra to check out a new game? Unfortunately, it feels like it’s becoming rare for day-one releases on Game Pass. For example, will we see Planet Coaster 2 on Game Pass? It’s likely, but not yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-planet-coaster-2-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Planet Coaster 2 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As of this writing, <strong>Planet Coaster 2 is not yet available on Xbox Game Pass</strong>. Could it happen? Sure! Developer Frontier launched the original Planet Coaster on day one on Game Pass, but they only announced its inclusion 24 hours before launch day. We didn’t get the same notification for its sequel, though. A quick look through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-titles-november-2024-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current Game Pass catalog reveals</a> that, unfortunately, the theme park management sim isn’t available to download for subscribers.</p>



<p>Sadly, the original Planet Coaster is no longer available on Xbox Game Pass. To enjoy Frontier’s unique and colorful management franchise, you must buy a copy. After spending an hour with it after lunch on launch day, I can tell you the sequel is much-improved and genuinely entertaining!</p>

<p>If you can’t wait to get your hands on Planet Coaster 2—I can’t blame you—then you can buy a copy on:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a></li>



<li><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP2377-PPSA19633_00-PLANETCOASTER200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a></li>

</ul>



<p>There is currently no word on whether the theme park construction and management game will release on Xbox Game Pass, and it appears rather unlikely for now, but at $49.99 for the standard edition, it’s worth the asking price. Most people who fall in love with these types of games tend to enjoy them for hundreds of hours over the years, especially once DLC and mod support really kicks off!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-planet-coaster-2-worth-the-money">Is Planet Coaster 2 Worth the Money?</h2>



<p>I won’t go into a full-length review of Planet Coaster 2 here, but after spending a little time with it, I can offer first impressions. As someone who spent hundreds of hours playing the original Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo from developer Frontier, I think the sequel to the theme park game is a vastly improved and fun experience overall. </p>



<p>For the most part, the building felt far more intuitive and freeform, allowing me to move and resize entire setpieces to my liking and tweak minute details easily. So, if you lean heavily into freeform and creative construction, you’ll love Planet Coaster 2.</p>



<p>Just be wary of the copious amounts of DLC likely on its way for the game!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-cs2-ranks-how-to-get-global-elite/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is no secret that CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) is one of the biggest esports out there. Even after its predecessor, CS:GO, handed the game the torch, Counter-Strike has continued to thrive. But do you know of all the ranks in CS2 competitive?</p>



<p>Here are all the CS2 ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-cs2-ranks">CS2 Ranks</h2>



<p>CS2 ranks fall under a much more complicated system than many other games. To heavily reward players, ranks are not thrown around lightly within the shooter. With 18 ranks as a whole, CS2 has one of the most immersive and impressive ranking systems.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-cs2-ranks">All CS2 Ranks:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Silver 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver Elite Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Distinguished Master Guardian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary Eagle</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary Eagle Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Supreme Master First Class</strong></li>



<li><strong>Global Elite</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While these are the traditional CS2 ranks, the game also has Premiere Mode, which is a more popular ranked system. </p>







<h2 id="h-all-counter-strike-2-premiere-mode-ranks">All Counter-Strike 2 Premiere Mode Ranks</h2>



<p>Premiere mode, unlike regular CS2 ranked, requires players to pick and vote on maps to ban before competing. After winning 10 placements in Premiere, you will be given a rating, which is a bit different from the system in the game’s traditional ranked mode.</p>



<p><strong>Here are all Premiere mode ranks in CS2 compared to the game’s traditional ranks:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1,000 – 7,501 (Gray):</strong> Equivalent to Silver Elite Master</li>



<li><strong>7,502 – 11,831 (Light Blue):</strong> Equivalent to Gold Nova 1 to Gold Nova Master</li>



<li><strong>11,832 – 14,998 (Dark Blue):</strong> Equivalent to Master Guardian to Master Guardian Elite</li>



<li><strong>14,999 – 18,401 (Light Purple):</strong> Equivalent to Distinguished Master Guardian to Legendary Eagle Master</li>



<li><strong>18,402 – 19,999 (Purple):</strong> Equivalent to Supreme Master First Class</li>



<li><strong>20,000+ (Dark Purple):</strong> Equivalent to the Global Elite</li>
</ul>



<p>The Counter-Strike Premiere mode is much more focused on points than it is on actual ranks. Still, though, players should be striving to hit Dark Purple, which is the equivalent to Global Elite in the game’s regular ranking system.</p>



<p>To rank up, simply winning matches will skyrocket you through the ranked system, but beware, the competition will be extremely difficult later on, as CS2 has a much more precise competitive base than other games.</p>



<p>What rank are you in Counter-Strike 2?</p>
