<p>The developers of Steal A Brainrot, a popular game within Roblox, are suing the developer of a copycat game in Fortnite called “Steal The Brainrot”.</p>



<p>According to the complaint, which was first reported on by <a href="https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Carpenter at Aftermath</a>, Spyder Games and Speedy Simulator Gaming are suing Thomas Van Der Voort for copyright infringement. They say that Van Der Voort’s game, which was released two months after theres, within the Fortnite Island Creator Program <strong>“copies the Game’s [Steal A Brainrot] protectable expressions, including user interface elements, in-game objects, artwork, level design, animations, design aesthetics, game pieces, and the selection and coordination of game elements, colors, and shapes.”</strong></p>



<p>They <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/937410050/Brainrot-Goes-To-Court#content=query:defendant,pageNum:2,indexOnPage:0,bestMatch:false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">continue to say</a> that similarities in Van Der Voort’s game are “not merely the result of the games existing in the same genre or dictated by function”. It’s alleged that he “made conscious decisions” to copy the choices of Steal A Brainrot, which, within the Fortnite Creator Program, can earn the developers money. Carptenter says that Steal The Brainrot has reached peaks of over 531,000 players.</p>



<p>In a statement given to Aftermath, attorney Adam Starr, who represents Spyder Games and Speedy Simulator Gaming, says that his parties are doing this to protect their work, which they acquired a copyright for in August.</p>



<p>“We always prefer to resolve these matters cooperatively, but when necessary we will take appropriate legal steps to safeguard our IP,” he said.</p>



<p>The suing parties are requesting a jury trial for the claims presented. They are looking to see the infringing game taken down while also receiving damages and profits that can be attributed to the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-have-early-access.1334086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re getting toward the end of the year, which means it’s time for a new Call of Duty game. Black Ops 7 follows BLOPS 6, and if you want to get your boots off the ground quicker than most, early access is the perfect fuel to do so—we’re checking if Black Ops 7 has it for you.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was having a fairly tumultuous build-up toward launch. Battlefield 6 was the shooter on everyone’s lips, and Black Ops 7 possibly felt too similar to its predecessor for some. It all changed in the blink of an eye when Activision declared <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-will-have-non-disbanding-lobbies-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 was getting rid of skill-based matchmaking</a>.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is now back on the menu for many, so let’s check if there’s any possibility of early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-ops-7-early-access">Can You Play Black Ops 7 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Judgment day is near. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no Black Ops 7 early access, meaning it doesn’t matter which edition you buy, all of them will give you access to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 at the same time—release day.</strong></p>



<p>One thing we can definitely say is the same as Black Ops 6 is the decision not to give Black Ops 7 players early access. You have to be patient and pass the time until launch. As usual, there is a super-duper edition (Vault Edition) offering a Season Pass, as well as the usual benefits, such as packs and items for CoD Zombies.</p>



<p>The good thing is that no one can gain an advantage before November 14. Once Black Ops 7 is out, everyone is near-enough on a level playing field and can upgrade weapons, earn attachments, and do everything in between at the same starting point.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-black-ops-7-early">Is There Any Way To Play Black Ops 7 Early?</h2>



<p><strong>No, the only way you could’ve played Black Ops 7 slightly earlier than anyone else was by pre-ordering the game to give yourself an exclusive early access beta window.</strong></p>



<p>If you didn’t know, Black Ops 7’s beta has come and passed. If you pre-ordered BLOPS 7, you were guaranteed a code to play the early access Black Ops 7 beta. That’s it, though, just the beta.</p>



<p>The beta window has closed, as has any chance to play Black Ops 7 before launch. We’ve seen other titles spontaneously announced impromptu betas—like ARC Raifers did—so we can’t theoretically rule out one more chance to play early. If this doesn’t happen, we’ll see you in a persistent Black Ops 7 lobby!</p>



<p>If you did play the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta, let us know if you enjoyed it. Can the removal of disbanding lobbies and a lack of SBMM make this one of the best CoDs ever?

<p>After receiving feedback on the Deluxe Pack: ex special booster pack, Pokémon TCG Pocket developers are working on a new Card Dex Registration update for next year. </p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket recently celebrated its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-year-one-anniversary-update-includes-huge-wonder-pick-buff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first anniversary</a>, and with that, we got some decent improvements, including a new share feature, an upgrade to trading, and a Wonder Pick Buff. Now, the developers are updating how the card players collect are registered in the Card Dex. </p>



<h2 id="h-cards-that-appear-in-multiple-booster-packs-will-be-registered-in-the-tcg-pocket-card-dex-for-all-corresponding-packs">Cards that Appear in Multiple Booster Packs Will be Registered in the TCG Pocket Card Dex for All Corresponding Packs</h2>



<p>According to a recent post on Pokémon TCG Pocket’s official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1981707338969956720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the Card Dex Registration update will be released after summer 2026, and many players aren’t happy about the developers taking so long to implement this change. The new “changes are intended to provide players with a more enjoyable card collecting experience.” Check out how Pokémon TCG Pocket Card Dex will change in 2026 below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, whenever a player procures a card that appears in multiple booster packs, that card will be registered in the card dex for all corresponding booster backs. Which means if you receive a Mewtwo ex from a Genetic Apex booster pack, the card dex will register it for both Genetic Apex and Deluxe Pack: ex. </li>



<li>Secondly, the cards that players have already obtained, which include any cards collected from the Deluxe Pack, will automatically be registered in every applicable card dex retroactively. </li>



<li>Lastly, these changes, along with related UI improvements, will arrive after summer 2026. </li>
</ul>

<p>Battlefield 6’s upcoming Season 1 will come with a series of different challenges that will change the game for the better. In a post by Battlefield Communications, the patch notes reveal that changes will be coming to some of the game’s absurd challenges, improvements to player visibility, and changes to weapon dispersion.</p>



<p>You can see the full patch notes below; some of which are already live.</p>



<p><em>Live Now:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Search: </strong>We’ve made some adjustments to improve how accurately matchmaking aligns with your selected map and mode preferences. The system still maintains flexibility to support reasonable queue times, so players with more specific selections may notice slightly longer waits. We’ll keep monitoring Custom Search performance and continue fine-tuning as needed.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Spawn Bug:</strong> We recently deployed a targeted backend change to address an issue where vehicles could sometimes fail to spawn as expected across certain maps and modes. The current results have shown that it has greatly reduced the number of occurrences and started to improve the balance issues on some map/mode combinations. We are aware of a few outliers that this fix did not address, and we’re working on a fix to resolve these outstanding issues. We also saw that this backend change had a slightly positive impact on Breakthrough win rates, but we are working on further balancing changes that are meant to be more impactful and bring the win rates into a better state.</li>



<li><strong>Portal Server Availability:</strong> Earlier this week, we made XP adjustments for Community Experiences. In case you missed it, check out the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981556746482307086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details</a> on how to get Full XP in Verified modes.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Upcoming Changes:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Player Movement</strong>: We are actively refining player movement to address areas that previously felt inconsistent, while staying true to the gameplay pace and maintaining the core feel of the launch experience. In parallel, we are enhancing sight stability by minimizing reticle movement during specific animations. These adjustments aim to deliver a smoother and more precise aiming experience, all while preserving an immersive first-person feel.</li>



<li><strong>Progression: </strong>We are continuing to monitor the impact of the changes that were made <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979183830113087566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week</a> and already seeing a smoother experience as we roll into Season 1. Some additional areas we are tracking:</li>



<li>XP earned in Escalation and King of the Hill is not always working as intended. We are planning to significantly increase the payout to bring them in line with other modes and will keep monitoring once the changes are live.</li>



<li>We’ve seen all your feedback about the challenges and their criteria, the team’s working on a series of improvements to make challenges more straightforward to understand and faster to complete. Given the scale of challenges, these changes will roll out over at least two updates. Some examples of what we are currently considering are:</li>



<li>Class Assignment – Assault 1 – Get kills while using the Adrenaline Injector – 30 to 3</li>



<li>Class Assignment – Engineer Expert 3 – Repair Vehicles in a Match – From 6000 to 1000</li>



<li>Weapon Assignment – Deadeye 2 – Get headshot kills over 200m with Sniper Rifles – from 150 to 5</li>



<li>In addition, a later game update will reduce the 200m distance</li>



<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> We are actively looking into adjustments to exposure and brightness. This will lead to improvements in places where players have experienced blinding light when looking outdoors, overly dark interiors when looking indoors, and a lack of visibility around weapon optics when zooming in. These adjustments are part of a wider pass focused on improving visibility that we expect to complete later in Season 1.</li>



<li><strong>Weapon Dispersion: </strong>As part of our Season 1 Update 1 (October 28), we’re making several adjustments to how weapon dispersion behaves. These changes are aimed at ensuring each weapon’s accuracy better reflects its intended performance over range. We’ve also fixed a bug that caused dispersion to not decrease as expected when transitioning from sprinting to a prone position.</li>
</ul>



<p>We’ll continue refining how weapon accuracy behaves in battle to make your shots feel more consistent and rewarding across all weapon types. Our upcoming tuning pass will reduce the overall impact of dispersion across multiple weapon types while keeping the core intent intact. Burst-firing will remain the most effective way to control a weapon, and each weapon will still perform best within its intended range. We’ve also identified a couple of bugs that caused weapons to feel less accurate than intended:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Post-Sprint Firing:</strong> Weapons fired immediately after sprinting while zoomed could retain higher dispersion, reducing accuracy.</li>



<li><strong>Movement Start:</strong> Dispersion was increasing faster than it should when players began moving, making even small adjustments unexpectedly impact precision. This was especially noticeable on controllers.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-regarding-battlefield-labs"><strong>Regarding Battlefield Labs</strong></h2>



<p>We are taking a brief hiatus on Battlefield Labs as we prioritize the rollout of Season 1 content. Labs is at its best when we can iterate quickly with you, and it was invaluable in how much it helped us prepare for the launch of Battlefield 6. More updates will be shared when play sessions are returning and we will continue to develop the future of Battlefield 6 together.</p>



<h2 id="h-battle-royale-mode-learnings-and-updates"><strong>Battle Royale Mode: Learnings and Updates</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking of Battlefield Labs, we have updates on the</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Battle Royale mode</a></p>



<p>following the suggestions we received during our play sessions. Your Battlefield Labs feedback has helped us fine-tune key elements for this experience. Here’s a quick look at what changes you may notice the next time you play:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Close-range TTK</strong>: We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li>



<li><strong>Armor Changes</strong>: Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li>



<li><strong>World Improvements</strong>: We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Balance</strong>: We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li>
</ul>



<p>We have also been working on providing smoother performance overall. We have identified and addressed a range of issues that affected performance that we simply couldn’t have done without our players’ involvement in the tests.</p>
