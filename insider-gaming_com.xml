<p>With the Sony PlayStation calendar looking a bit bare, the February 2026 State of Play is the company’s time to shine a big blue spotlight on PlayStation and its PS5 games and products for the rest of the year and beyond.</p>



<p>2026 has already gotten off to a hot start with presentations and showcases. Before the February PlayStation State of Play announcement, we’ve already seen a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-february-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct</a> and the excellent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct</a>.</p>



<p>With the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/saros/" id="164319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saros</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wolverine/" id="376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolverine</a> set to grace 2026, let’s see what else is in store for PlayStation owners.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apex Legends 2026 Roadmap Promises Community-Focused Development]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-2026-roadmap-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1433971</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Respawn Entertainment just unveiled the Apex Legends 2026 roadmap, and it’s a doozy. It covers more than <strong>a year </strong>of content, and it has already set about impressing fans of the battle royale-centric title on social media. In a blog post, the team at Respawn and Electronic Arts uncovered a desire to promote more of a community-focused development cycle moving forward.</p>



<p>In their words, they want to take ‘player feedback into consideration with every decision.’</p>











<p>The full roadmap for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/apex-legends/" id="27">Apex Legends</a> through 2026 and beyond includes <strong>five seasons </strong>of content, the last of which expires in April 2027. It’s one of the most ambitious roadmaps the community has ever seen, but there’s something to be said about promising so much, so soon.</p>



<p>It was just a couple of weeks ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wildlight-entertainment/" id="3393">Wildlight Entertainment</a>, the developer behind <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard</a>, published a 12-month roadmap that looks in danger of being quickly abandoned…</p>



<p>Anyway, here’s a look at the upcoming schedule for the Apex Legends season structure:</p>



<ul>
<li>Season 28: February to April 2026</li>



<li>Season 29: May to July 2026</li>



<li>Season 30: August to October 2026</li>



<li>Season 31: November to January 2027</li>



<li>Season 32: February to April 2027</li>
</ul>



<p>In season 29 and season 32, new Legends will be added, starting with a Skirmisher in just a few months. As the year unravels, countless tweaks and reworks are planned for existing Legends, starting with Fuse, Catalyst, and Bloodhound in the season that’s just dropping as we speak.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The team plans to update POIs across the map pool in the first half of 2026, pushing for a competitive firming up of World’s Edge later in the year.</p>



<p>One of the more divisive topics in the Apex Legends space has been around integrity and anti-cheat, and <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/2026-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post</a> from Respawn cleared up the desires quite nicely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are shooting for best-in-class online integrity, continuing to crack down on cheaters and improve how we keep bad actors out of the Apex Games. We know we have our work cut out for us, but we’re dedicated to the task.</p>



<p>In 2025, we took some big swings at tuning matchmaking and fighting cheaters. We know fighting cheating is a never-ending battle and even a small number of bad actors can impact match quality. </p>



<p>These improvements are signals we’re heading in the right direction to keep more cheaters out of the game overall, and that we’re catching more of them earlier than before. We know there’s more to do in this area in 2026, so expect ongoing updates.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Recently, an overhaul was published regarding the game’s esports ecosystem, and there are major changes on the horizon in that space, too. It’s a sizeable roadmap, but as always, the proof will be in the delivery and how the community receives the changes and additions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Clash Royale devs have amended their blog post to acknowledge Jynxzi’s contribution towards the title’s recent success. </p>



<p>The CEO and co-founder of SuperCell released a new blog post titled The Best Games Haven’t Been Made Yet. One of the focuses of the blog post was the historic year Clash Royale had, and fans, <a href="https://x.com/jynxzi/status/2021283304649970153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">even Jynxzi</a>, were not happy that the creator was not acknowledged for being influential in the game’s success. </p>







<h2 id="h-clash-royale-dev-finally-appreciates-jynxzi-s-influence">Clash Royale Dev Finally Appreciates Jynxzi’s Influence</h2>



<p>SuperCell’s CEO and co-founder, Ilkka Paananen, stated on <a href="https://x.com/ipaananen/status/2021985581929050453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that they have amended the Clash Royale category in the blog post following community reaction. Paananen accepted that the developers “failed to acknowledge the role that creators, pro players, and the broader community played in Clash Royale’s resurgence.” The CEO added that there was never an intent to “diminish anyone’s contribution”. </p>



<p>The blog post then talks about Clash Royale being celebrated through creators self-organizing tournaments, sharing of art and memes, and more. The blog post specially mentions Jynxzi, adding that the creator invested their “own time, money, and energy into bringing Clash Royale back to cultural relevance.” He also managed to introduce the title to many new players and some of the biggest names in streaming. </p>



<p>The blog reveals that Clash Royale’s re-engaged players have doubled, while new players have grown by almost 500%. Additionally, all measures of playtime and engagement grew successfully. </p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ubisoft/" id="26">Ubisoft </a>reported that Assassin’s Creed surpassed expectations this quarter, with session days increasing by 28% year-on-year and a significant growth in active users.</p>



<p>On February 12, 2026, Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2fF3sBktllOX6jrLXUgKci/64d1bdb0998fd5403b32e5329ec01c6c/Ubisoft_FY26_Q3_PR_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported </a>its Q3 sales for the fiscal year. Not only did the company report that its net bookings were up 18% year-on-year, but it also noted that the Assassin’s Creed brand in particular overperformed, with a strong quarter that underscored the franchise’s strength.</p>



<p>Specifically, activity metrics for Assassin’s Creed were up, with double-digit growth in active users. In a quarter that saw the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows on the Nintendo Switch 2 and updates for Assassin’s Creed Mirage, there was a 28% surge in activity year-on-year. There’s also a 7% increase from the previous quarter.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-anticipated-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-is-stalled-for-now">The Anticipated Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Is Stalled for Now</h2>



<p>While the Assassin’s Creed brand remains a tentpole franchise for Ubisoft, the highly anticipated remake of Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag is likely delayed. A previous report noted that an<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/"> unannounced title</a> planned for the fiscal year 2026 has been delayed to the fiscal year 2027. This point was reiterated during an investor call that followed the release of the sales report.</p>



<p>The remake of Black Flag is currently the only game that matches this description. Insider Gaming had reported that the project was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/">slated for release this March.</a> The brand recently underwent a major restructuring, resulting in the cancellation of the planned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.</a></p>







<p>An art book centered on the forthcoming Black Flag remake was recently listed on Amazon. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-listing-surfaces-online/">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent financial update, Ubisoft touched on The Division, the post-apocalyptic shooter MMO that is preparing to celebrate its tenth anniversary. In March, The Division will be a decade old, and this year, Ubisoft plans to unveil an ‘ambitious’ roadmap that includes the launch of The Division: Resurgence.</p>



<p>While we don’t have a firm release date just yet, we now know that The Division: Resurgence, an authentic mobile-first experience, is <strong>planned </strong>for release between February and April 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-big-things-are-coming-to-the-division-this-year">Big Things Are Coming to The Division This Year</h2>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft quietly released The Division: Definitive Edition, which proved to be a disappointing drop for fans of the shooter series. It was assumed that the team at Massive would have produced something more significant for the game’s tenth anniversary, but the ‘special edition’ came without any frills whatsoever.</p>



<p>Regardless, Ubisoft has assured fans that a strong year is ahead for The Division.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2fF3sBktllOX6jrLXUgKci/64d1bdb0998fd5403b32e5329ec01c6c/Ubisoft_FY26_Q3_PR_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial update</a>, which reported strong results, the team insisted that The Division: Resurgence, a mobile game with all the trappings of the core series, is planned for release in Q4 2025-2026. That means, all being well, we’ll have it before April. Right now, the game is undergoing tests that are slowly opening to include more territories.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was confirmed that The Division 2 will be getting ‘a new game mode’ for the tenth anniversary of the franchise, arriving in March 2026. When that date comes around, Ubisoft will take the opportunity to unveil ‘an ambitious roadmap’ for the year ahead.</p>



<p>Given the recent positivity and promising comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/" id="168702">around The Division 3</a>, by the recently departed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/julian-gerighty-leaving-massive-to-work-battlefield/" id="170229">Julian Gerighty</a>, fans are full of anticipation for what lies ahead.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has finally published its latest financial report, outlining the Q3 2025 – 2026 performance portfolio across the company. In contrast to what you might generally believe, the company is in a strong place and is reporting beaten expectations across the board, with key franchises soaring year-over-year.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed, The Division, Anno, and Avatar are all up in terms of net bookings, contributing to a total €1.1 billion, up <strong>18% </strong>year-over-year.</p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-reports-smooth-sailing-in-financial-update">Ubisoft Reports Smooth Sailing in Financial Update</h2>



<p>Ubisoft’s recent financial update opened with bold statements about the company’s performance. It was written that financial delivery in Q3 25-26 is ‘above expectations’ and hitting levels classed as an ‘overperformance’ based mostly on gains secured by Assassin’s Creed.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege is also doing very well, as is Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, with a burst of success being secured by the game’s ‘strongly anticipated third-person update and high-quality From the Ashes expansion release.’</p>



<p>More than 130 million MAUs (Monthly Active Users) are being reported across the Ubisoft estate, covering both console and PC platforms, and in December, a 3% growth in MAUs was recorded year-over-year.</p>



<p>In a statement at the heart of <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2fF3sBktllOX6jrLXUgKci/64d1bdb0998fd5403b32e5329ec01c6c/Ubisoft_FY26_Q3_PR_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the financial update</a>, CEO and co-Founder, Yves Guillemot, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We delivered a solid third-quarter performance,with net bookings growing at a double-digit rate year-on-year, exceeding our expectations. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of player engagement across our core franchises, supported by recent releases and live content updates that continue to resonate with players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft has been pushed from pillar to post in recent months. Days ago, much of the company participated in a walkout, mainly staged to oppose a five-day return to office order imposed by the company, and to recognize plummeting stock values.</p>



<p>The financial update didn’t refer to any of the recent troubles, nor did it outline anything to do with the recent crash in share price.</p>
