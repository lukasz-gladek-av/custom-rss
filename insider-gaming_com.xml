<p>The Finals was released in December 2023, shadowdropped to an audience that was all too eager to receive it, and for a while, it turned heads. It wasn’t long before the free-to-play, live-service shooter dwindled a little, but it remains relatively innovative and fresh, boasting solid destructive mechanics, an entertaining gameplay loop, and a unique aesthetic.</p>



<p>Recently, Embark Studios revealed that an esports scene is on the way and that in 2025, a $100,000 Major will take place. That’s all the information the company parted ways with, but right now, <strong>not</strong> <strong>one organisation </strong>has invested in The Finals, which leaves us wondering who’s going to compete.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-who-will-play-at-the-finals-major">Who Will Play At The Finals Major?</h2>



<p>The Finals Major 2025 is a $100,000 tournament with an undetermined format, structure, and schedule. Nobody knows what it’ll look like, where it’ll be played, or which organisations will field a squad.</p>



<p>The Finals has been around for an entire year, and in that time, it has retained a decent core following.</p>



<p>If we use Steam as a representative example, we can see that the game peaked at 242,000 players when it came out, and right now, it floats around an average of about 14,000 – which <strong>isn’t bad</strong>. It’s a brand-new shooter that had absolutely no following when it dropped, so for it to still be securing those numbers on <strong>one platform </strong>is great.</p>



<p>On social media, Embark Studios posted a short teaser trailer promoting the impending $100,000 Major, but it could be several months before it takes shape.</p>



<p>What organisations do you want to see surface in The Finals? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
