<p>In a recent article published by the Electronic Arts teams behind Battlefield 6, it was revealed that a staggering 2.4 <strong>million </strong>cheat attempts have been blocked by EA’s Javelin anti-cheat system since the game came out on October 10. It was additionally noted that, in the week after launch, <strong>98% of matches </strong>were ‘fair and free of cheater impacts.’</p>



<p>This is only just the beginning for Javelin. It was stressed that Electronic Arts is shaping up to deal with this ‘war on cheating’ in an evolutionary way, and has several steps lined up to combat wrongdoers.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-anti-cheat-is-making-waves">Battlefield 6’s Anti-Cheat is Making Waves</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, it was revealed that <strong>2.4 million cheat attempts </strong>were actively blocked by EA’s Javelin engine, an anti-cheat solution that keeps Battlefield 6 free from abusive operators. To put some numbers into perspective, it was also noted that, during the open beta alone, a whopping <strong>1.2 million </strong>cheat attempts were closed down.</p>



<p>People just won’t give up.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251">team wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are presently aware of, and have multiple detections for, <strong>190 cheat related programs, hardware, vendors, and resellers and their communities</strong>. Since launch <strong>183 of them (96.3%) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This phenomenal effort by Electronic Arts is set to expand with several key initiatives being lined up:</p>



<ul>
<li>Explore Additional OS Security Features</li>



<li>Enforce Against Cheating Hardware</li>



<li>Improving Reporting Flows</li>



<li>Improving Internal Operations Tools</li>



<li>‘Classified’</li>
</ul>



<p>That final note is legitimately taken from the document. Some things are being kept under wraps to avoid ‘tipping off’ the cheat manufacturers as to what’s coming next:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have multiple teams working on various new anti-cheat features and detections across our multi-layered suite of tools across Javelin, the game client, server, and beyond coming online as fast as we can get them ready. As soon as any of these new ways of delivering ban hammers are fully tested and ready we’ll share more but for now we don’t want to tip our hand to any bad-actors looking to ruin your game experience.</p>

<p>2024’s Game of the Year winner is as affordable as ever. It’s a fantastic walk down memory lane for Sony’s exhaustive catalogue of incredible franchises. It’s also the perfect reminder that 3D platformers aren’t dead, and Astro Bot is a premium product from back to front that appeals to all age brackets.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch’s long-awaited and hotly anticipated sequel to Ghost of Tsushima. Ghost of Yotei is another spellbinding action-adventure game with slick swordplay, more weapons and options than its predecessor, and it’s just as good as the original (maybe better?). It’s the biggest PS5 exclusive of the year by far, and is a proper system-selling game.</p>

<h2 id="h-battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</h2>

<p>It feels incredible to have a proper Battlefield game back. Let’s not talk about the last BF game, because Battlefield 6 is fantastic from top to bottom. It features a campaign tailored for single-player enthusiasts, an extensive multiplayer mode packed with maps, mayhem, and a multitude of playlist options. Additionally, there’s Battlefield: RedSec, offering battle royale and extended game modes.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid 3 is considered to be the definitive MGA game for many. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater takes the 2004 original and shows everyone what a modern-day version of it looks like. It will likely scoop up many ‘Best Remaster of 2025’ awards, and it will reward you for investing some money into the epic remake.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 7 will adorn the base of many Christmas trees in Holiday 2025. Treyarch has been given the privilege of delivering back-to-back CoD games, and while Black Ops 7 has had a mixed reception, its online multiplayer is a smooth and swift as any in recent memory. With a campaign, Zombies, and seasonal updates to come, Black Ops 7 is a shred investment and a top gift.</p>

<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>

<p>Turn-based gameplay hit the mainstream once more with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Following in the footsteps of old-school Final Fantasy games, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the first project from a studio very much in its infancy. The result of a GOTY-contending, 30-to-60 hour playthrough you shouldn’t miss at all costs.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part II (Remastered)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Naughty Dog</figcaption></figure>



<p>Last year’s The Last Of Us Part II (Remastered) is the perfect way to capitalize on 2025’s The Last Of Us Season 2 on TV. The second season finally hit screens this year, and it’s based on the events of The Last of Us Part II (Remastered). It’s easily one of the cheapest games on this Holiday 2025 list, and is even cheaper with Insider Gaming’s link.</p>

<h2 id="h-ea-fc-26">EA FC 26</h2>

<p>If there’s a new Call of Duty, you’d better believe there’s a new EA FC game. The feedback-driven nature of EA FC 26 means it’s trying to appeal to you, the player, more than ever. You can grab EA FC 26 for cheap, take your favorite teams to gold and glory, make your own hilarious Pros, and assemble the Ultimate Team.</p>
