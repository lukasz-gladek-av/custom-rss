<p>Skate’s controversial decision to have microtransactions in early access has been exacerbated by an extortionate and terrible-looking Isaac Clarke skin from EA’s Dead Space franchise.</p>



<p>EA’s newest Skate title arrived to much chagrin and dismay. The community feels the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skate-to-enter-early-access-on-september-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skate early access</a> launch is a soulless cash-grab, and the decision to include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microtransactions</a> was never going to go down well. It’s hard to be objective as well when you see the state of the new Dead Space bundle in Skate that EA is charging you a <em>lot </em>of money for.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-space-amp-skate-bundle-is-made-of-cardboard-literally">Dead Space &amp; Skate Bundle Is Made Of Cardboard, Literally</h2>

<p>The new Isaac Clarke bundle in the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Skate</a> shop sure is something. To be fair, it does come with other accessories, including player profile cosmetics and flourishes for your board. But the main reason anyone wants this is for the Isaac Clarke skin.</p>



<p>Did you know Skate 3 had an Isaac Clarke skin that was completely free and simply required a code to unlock? Furthermore, it looked exactly like Isaac’s real suit in the game. In 2025, Skate’s early access offers a bundle that costs upwards of $40, and it looks like a last-second Halloween outfit made of painted cardboard.</p>



<p>We had to study this for ourselves. On the Skate store, you buy the San Van Bucks separately; the cheapest it costs is £30.97 (buying 2,800 SVB and two lots of 500 SVB), which equates to <strong>just over $40</strong>. </p>



<p>Or you can buy the Founder’s Deluxe Pack for $49.99, which has more than enough San Van Bucks and extra content.</p>







<p>What do you think? Is EA going too far with this? Or should it be expected? We’re very interested ot hear your thoughts in the comments below, and through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the most satisfying games ever to release is receiving a sequel, with the release of Powerwash Simulator 2 rapidly approaching, and we’ve got all the details on its Game Pass inclusion status.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-and-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 23</a>, Powerwash Simulator 2 will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released exclusively on current-gen consoles</a>, and is set to offer hours of calm cleaning as you tackle the toughest dirt there is around.</p>



<p>If you want to know whether you can save some money on the title with a Game Pass subscription, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-powerwash-simulator-2-free-on-game-pass">Is Powerwash Simulator 2 Free on Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Clean sweep. Image by Futurlab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Powerwash Simulator 2 is available as a day-one launch on select Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.</strong></p>



<p>Powerwash Simulator 2 will be available to play as soon as it launches with the service, though different tiers of subscription provide different games. While it’s yet to be confirmed, we’re expecting it to only be available on day one with a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>



<p>For those with a Premium membership, Powerwash Simulator 2 may be added to the service in future, but it’s not a first-party Xbox title, meaning it’s not guaranteed to come within the first year of launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-powerwash-simulator-2-on-game-pass">How to Play Powerwash Simulator 2 on Game Pass</h2>



<p><strong>A Game Pass membership is required to play Powerwash Simulator 2 on the service, while the game also needs to be downloaded onto your console and ready to go—though it may be available via the Play Anywhere feature.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not yet confirmed what tier of the service is required to be able to play Powerwash Simulator 2 with a subscription, though the recent changes to the service indicate that it will likely be an Ultimate membership that’s required, with the service recently receiving a price bump.</p>



<p>A step-by-step guide on how to play is below:</p>

<p>Life continues to find a way, with Jurassic World Evolution 3 marking the next stage in the franchise with some major changes, and we’ve got the exact release date and start times for the title.</p>



<p>The third iteration of the franchise, which began back in 2018, Jurassic World Evolution 3 takes a big step forward with the debut of baby dinosaurs and modular building, features that are crucial in sister titles Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster.</p>



<p>If you want to count down the hours until you can build the park of your dreams, or sacrifice guests to a T. Rex, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-jurassic-world-evolution-3-coming-out">When is Jurassic World Evolution 3 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Baby dinos. Image via Frontier Developments</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be released on October 21 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>With no delays to the release date, the game is ready for launch to mark the next era of the franchise for Frontier Developments, following on from two previous iterations of the game.</p>



<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is Frontier’s big release of the year, following on from Planet Coaster 2 in 2024, but the exact time you can dive into the park management sim depends on where you are located in the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-jurassic-world-evolution-3-start-time">Do we Know The Jurassic World Evolution 3 Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Store listings confirm that Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be available to play from 7 AM PT on October 21, with players elsewhere in the world needing to wait until later in the day.</strong></p>



<p>Confirmed by the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP2377-PPSA25153_00-JWEVOLUTION30000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 has a global release and unlocks simultaneously for all players. This isn’t too surprising, as online features are minimal, so there’s no need for a staggered launch to ease stress on the servers.</p>



<p>You will be able to preload Jurassic World Evolution 3 onto your console or PC ahead of launch, reducing the wait time when the doors do finally open, but there’s no way to queue jump the title.</p>



<p>The table below shows the Jurassic World Evolution 3 start times in major time zones across the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger is an action-packed adventure through time and space, with plenty to offer, but as it lands in a period stacked of new releases, questions about the game length are understandable.</p>



<p>With hundreds of Digimon to collect, a gripping story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and plenty of optional content to explore, prepare to sink many hours into Time Stranger.</p>



<p>For a full breakdown of exactly how many hours you can expect to put into Digimon Story: Time Stranger, for both a generic run and a completionist run, you’ll find all the details in our game length guide here.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-digimon-story-time-stranger">How Many Hours to Beat Digimon Story: Time Stranger?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It will take around 40 hours to complete the main story of Digimon Story: Time Stranger, though that time is extended by side quests and difficulty level.</strong></p>



<p>Time Stranger features a host of side-quests to tick off, which add hours to the duration of the game, and it will take even longer if you want to tackle the longer side quests, like defeating all of the opponents in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-paradise-colosseum-great-omni-carnival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradise Colosseum</a>.</p>



<p>The length of the game also depends on the difficulty setting you’re playing on, and whether you can defeat bosses in a single attempt or need to retry several times. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-digimon-story-time-stranger-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Digimon Story: Time Stranger Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>A full completionist run in Digimon Story: Time Stranger will take an additional 100 hours on top of the main story.</strong></p>



<p>This is due to the vast number of tasks that need to be ticked off to boast 100% completion, including obtaining all Digimon, collecting all Digimon Cards, and defeating opponents in the Paradise Colosseum.</p>



<p>There are a whopping 471 Digimon in the game, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-dlc-season-pass-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more to be added in DLC</a>, and 451 cards to collect. Along the way, there’s also a hefty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-achievements-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of achievements and trophies</a> to earn.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, side quests can take a significant amount of time on their own, especially completing the Colosseum. With some battles only unlocking once specific requirements are met, this pumps up the required amount of time to play by a large amount.</p>

<p>FIFA 23, the last FIFA game by EA, will shut down its servers on October 30, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who don’t know, the agreement with Electronic Arts and FIFA came to an end a couple of years ago, with the former <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-officially-unveils-ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-soccer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling</a> EA Sports FC to replace the franchise. The EA FC series began after FIFA 23, making that the last FIFA game that EA created. </p>



<h2 id="h-fifa-23-servers-are-shutting-down-on-october-30">FIFA 23 Servers Are Shutting Down on October 30 </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-sports-fifa-era-is-officially-coming-to-an-end-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ</a>, confirmation that FIFA 23 will shut down its servers was announced on the EA Service Updates <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/legal/service-updates/a-h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a>. If you scroll down to ‘F’, the new update states that online services will no longer be available for Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. Players will still be able to play the game offline; however, no online updates, online co-op, Ultimate Team, Pro Clubs, or any other online features will be available to the player. </p>



<p>The era for new EA FIFA games had already ended when the deal between the two parties ended. However, players now have a few days left to play the last EA FIFA game online, until the next one becomes available. Regarding the next one, 2K Games could potentially be developing the next mainline FIFA video game. EA has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-developers-arent-afraid-of-potential-fifa-2k-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that even if the rumors are true, they welcome the competition and “know how tough it is to make a football game.”</p>



<p>In other news, the first new FIFA game after the breakup with EA has officially been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-new-fifa-game-post-ea-breakup-announced-and-its-not-what-players-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>, and it’s not the game fans likely expected. Additionally, read about Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/">addressing the rumors</a> surrounding a possible partnership between FIFA and 2K Sports. What are your thoughts on FIFA 23 shutting down its servers this month?
