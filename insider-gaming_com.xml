<p>EA Sports College Football 26 was the best-selling game in the United States (US) for July 2026. That marks the second-straight year that EA Sports College Football took the top spot the month it was released.</p>



<p>According to the latest data from Circana, College Football 26 takes the top spot over from Elden Ring: Nightreign, which led the way in May and June. For July, Nightreign finds itself at 16th.</p>



<p>Following College Football 26 comes, well, College Football 26 again. At least, in a way. The EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes both College Football 26 and Madden 26, came in second in sales. That was followed up by Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive Donkey Kong Bananza, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>As far as new games finding themselves in the Top 20, there were 5 games joining the fray. Four of the new releases all were in the Top 5, while the other new release, Grounded 2, came in eighth.</p>



<p>With five new releases in the Top 20, as well as a return of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, that means six games fell out of the list. Leaving the Top 20 were Stellar Blade, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, Mario Kart World, and Elden Ring.</p>
