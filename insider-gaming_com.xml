<p>Use these Roblox Wings Of Glory monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get free Tactical Medals, allowing players to progress through the levels of the game quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of the legendary Tom Cruise movie Top Gun, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-prospecting-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Wings Of Glory is going to be right up your alley. Wings Of Glory is a highly detailed combat flight simulator game that boasts over 150 aircraft, ranging from vintage classics to modern beasts. It features intense 10v10 dogfights in historical locations, allowing players to relive some of the greatest battles the world has ever seen. The fast-paced gameplay can provide hours of endless fun, with six different nations’ aircraft to choose from. Wings Of Glory has extremely realistic flight controls as well as highly customisable planes, making it the ideal game for fans of the aeronautical world. The progression system in the game allows players to get their hands on timely upgrades, but some additional rewards would go a long way, and that’s where the Wings Of Glory codes can come in handy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roblox game developers often release new codes along with updates or special events, mostly through the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/wingsofglory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord</a> server or their socials. However, the easiest way for players to stay up to date with the latest codes would be to simply keep this page bookmarked and check in every now and then. We update this article as soon as any new codes drop, so you never have to worry about missing out on any more free rewards.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ahead of its November 14th, 2025, release, Activision has put out the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launch trailer. Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-release-date-remains-unchanged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of an early release</a>, this all but confirms it’s sticking to its launch date with no early access.</p>



<p>As the next mainline entry, Black Ops 7 is putting a big emphasis on multiplayer. With a co-op campaign and 18 launch multiplayer maps, it’s honing in on what fans want. Despite returning to the futuristic settings of games past,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-not-have-jetpacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without jetpacks</a>, it’s still one of 2025’s biggest titles. Now, we have the launch trailer for the upcoming FPS that showcases just about everything it has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-called-the-biggest-black-ops-yet-in-new-launch-trailer">Black Ops 7 Called “The Biggest Black Ops Yet” in New Launch Trailer</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty Black Ops 7 | PC Features Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8P1Z6CyfEjk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P1Z6CyfEjk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we see a lot of Black Ops 7, from its campaign to multiplayer and zombies. It does show off all of the game’s offerings through gameplay and cinematics. There’s some new footage like the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-standoff-meltdown-maps-season-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2</a>‘s Menendez and campaign locales, but it’s more or less the same. Still, it does state that Black Ops 7 is the biggest Black Ops game ever, which is a bold statement.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if it will live up to the sub-series’ pedigree, given how well-received Black Ops titles are. Some of Call of Duty’s best titles were from Black Ops, like 1 and 2. Even then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-trial-battlefield-6-redsec-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, which came out last year, was one of the more positively reviewed entries in years. As a fan of the series, I do hope Black Ops 7 lives up to the hype, even with the emphasis on multiplayer. We’ll know for sure as we head to November 14th.</p>

<p>With Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 set to release on November 14, Activision has confirmed the final PC specs that players will need for the best performance on their machine. </p>

Also, online Intel and AMD CPUs are supported. </p>



<p>If you plan on playing on a handheld PC, Activision says that Black Ops 7 will run on “most Windows-based handhelds”. It will also feature optimized visuals and “sharper text” for the smaller screens. There will also be “smart power and battery optimization”.</p>
