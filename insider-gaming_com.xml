<p>According to a new report, Nintendo Switch 2 units manufactured in China will face a 145% US import tariff.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2s-from-china-could-face-145-us-tariff">Nintendo Switch 2s From China Could Face 145% US Tariff</h2>



<p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/China-made-Nintendo-Switch-2-in-line-for-145-tariff-hit-supplier-warns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Asia</a> (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jywikr/chinamade_nintendo_switch_2_in_line_for_145/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zukhov-74</a>) reports that the Nintendo Switch 2 and other game consoles manufactured in China will fall victim to “the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.” They recently reviewed an “internal assessment memo” from a “major Apple and Nintendo supplier,” and things don’t seem bright for Nintendo’s upcoming console.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memo states that game consoles manufactured in China will still face the 145% US import tariff for goods made in China, and the Nintendo Switch 2 is “in line for a massive hit.” This could be one reason why the company decided to delay pre-orders, as it wanted to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assess the potential impact</a>” of the tariffs on the US market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report adds that a significant chunk of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles “are made in China” and a “relatively small proportion made in Vietnam.” Hence, it will be hard for the company to manoeuvre through such circumstances. This might also explain why pre-orders for the upcoming console have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed in Canada</a> at the last minute.&nbsp;However, there’s no official word from Nintendo at the moment.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order invites will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-invites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begin rolling out next month</a>. Also, ‘Breath of the Wild’ and its upcoming DLC cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 on the upcoming console</a>.

<p>Schedule 1 players have been warned about malware in some of the game’s most popular mods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/certain-schedule-1-mods-confirmed-to-contain-trojan-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, the official Schedule 1 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jx6vl8/urgent_psa_malware_found_in_2_popular_schedule_1/?share_id=AvZ_njVPdRrRpo99mWvCM&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> has released an “URGENT PSA” for its members, bringing their attention to malware found in popular mods. Players have been advised to uninstall these mods instantly, or they could get in trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-mods-that-were-found-with-malware">Schedule 1 Mods That Were Found with Malware</h2>



<p>The first Schedule 1 Mod found with malware is Froggyp1’s “Increased Stack Size Limit.” The subreddit moderator has confirmed that the original creator has sold their account, and the new owner has introduced a version “which is VERIFIED to be a trojan.” The owner has been banned, and their malicious uploads removed; however, players should look through their files to be sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next Schedule 1 mod in question is “Backpack Mod Reupload,” and this time, even NexusMods have confirmed that it is malware. After deleting the files and changing their passwords, players can take two suggested actions: First, they can use reputable anti-virus or anti-malware software to search individual files for malware. The other way is to use online virus scanning services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the creator of Schedule 1 has provided <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a console port update</a> after imitations appeared on PlayStation.

<p>Borderlands director has stated that the movie flopped because of COVID, as you can’t create a large-scale movie on Zoom Calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an appearance on <a href="https://puck.news/podcast_episode/director-eli-roth-will-kill-you-on-screen-for-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Town</a> podcast (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/eli-roth-on-why-the-borderlands-movie-sucked-you-cant-prep-a-movie-on-that-scale-over-zoom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>), Borderlands director Eli Roth elaborated on how COVID and Zoom Calls hindered the movie’s development. Roth explained that none of them could have predicted “how complicated things were gonna be with COVID,” and the complications became visible not just while shooting but in other processes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-movie-failed-due-to-covid-and-zoom">Borderlands Movie Failed Due to COVID and Zoom</h2>



<p>Roth added that it was total chaos for them, having to do reshoots and pick-up shoots, having six people across different sets, and having each one shut down when a city opened up. More complications were added when there was a COVID outbreak in the area, which meant they “couldn’t prep in a room together,” meet their stunt people or do any pre-visualisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roth concludes, “ You can’t prep a movie on that scale over Zoom”. They thought that they would be able to pull off Borderlands with COVID and Zoom calls; instead, Roth explains, “We got our asses handed to us a bit.”</p>



<p>Borderlands movie had a disappointing release, standing at 10% on the Tomatometer on Rotten Tomatoes. Fans were highly disappointed with the deviation from the source material and some of the casting choices for their favourite characters. However, it wasn’t all bad, as Take-Two’s CEO recently stated that the movie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-disappointing-but-helped-sell-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped sell games</a> even though it was ‘disappointing’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Borderlands 4 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2025.

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone skyrocketed in popularity in the last couple of weeks, thanks to the return of Verdansk.

<p>That’s right – it’s <strong>a single keycap for your keyboard, </strong>and it has a price tag of $79.</p>



<p>The keyboard comes from Drop, and it’s dubbed the CSTM80, a tenkeyless design with a nice camoflague detail around some of the keys. If you want to flex your Warzone fandom, you can purchase the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-artisan-keycap-call-of-duty-warzone-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Drop Artisan keycap</a> that features a miniaturised rendition of the Verdansk Stadium encased in smooth resin.</p>



<p>That’s not all, though. If you purchase the fancy Warzone keycap, you’ll get a series of exclusive in-game items that you won’t find anywhere else. They’re all Corsair-themed if that’s your kind of thing.</p>



<p>Corsair has also introduced a new Stream Deck model to the existing lineup, which is the perfect companion for all those Warzone streamers out there.</p>



<p>Are you enough of a Call of Duty fan that you’d spend $79 on a single keycap? Let me know in the comments, or hit us up on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>DMZ: Nuclear Survival has just been revealed on Steam, but it has no release date. It’s an open-world, multiplayer survival game that two people in Japan have pieced together, and it looks pretty ambitious. In DMZ: Nuclear Survival, you’ll be charged with building an army and crafting bases while exploring an enormous map and messing around with history.</p>



<p>There’s one heck of a story behind DMZ: Nuclear Survival, but there are enough bizarre elements thrown into the mix to make me question the game’s validity.</p>



<p>For example, you can befriend and fight alongside bears, wolves, and <strong>ostriches</strong>. Interesting.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-use-of-the-past">Make Use of the Past</h2>



<p>The core premise of DMZ: Nuclear Survival is that the world has changed thanks to nuclear war, and the planet’s tectonic plates have shifted to form Pangea (again), a super-continent. For some reason, this has made it so that ancient ruins, ‘such as pyramids, terracotta warriors, and Roman temples’ are much easier to excavate.</p>



<p>Not only that, but players can pull relics and valuables from these locations across a procedurally generated map and use them to ‘resurrect powerful soldiers from ancient genes’.</p>



<p>That means alongside your strangely WWI- and WWII-themed private military contractors, you can have Roman soldiers and ‘Eastern martial artists’ fight for you. And bears – don’t forget the bears.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>DMZ: Nuclear Survival will reportedly launch with PvE <strong>and </strong>PvP modes, and dedicated servers will be able to support <strong>over 100 players</strong>. Also, this upcoming survival game will have an offline single-player mode, which is rare in this type of title.</p>



<p>With in-depth base-building mechanics, intense combat scenarios, untold exploration potential, and first-blush visuals that look pretty good, DMZ: Nuclear Survival is either going to be a hit with survival fans, or it’ll be some kind of weird rug-pull.</p>



<p>We’ve seen games like this emerge before with bold promises and nothing to really deliver.</p>



<p>You can wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316500/DMZ_Nuclear_Survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DMZ: Nuclear Survival</a> now, exclusively on Steam.</p>
