            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-price-possibly-revealed-by-gamestop-and-it%E2%80%99s-shockingly-low.1284513/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been discovered by eagle-eyed Hollow Knight fans that Silksong has been listed on GameStop on Nintendo Switch for just $19.99.  This price has prompted many to believe it’s a ‘simply a placeholder’ because they can’t understand why Team Cherry isn’t charging more for one of the most anticipated games of 2025.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that users have reportedly tried to check out with Hollow Knight: Silksong in their basket at that price, but it ‘does not go through.’</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-just-19-99">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Just $19.99?</h2>



<p>In a post that surfaced on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n3hj7a/gamestop_listed_silksong_with_price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight subreddit</a>, it was revealed that GameStop has priced the upcoming title at just $19.99.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>When Hollow Knight was released way back in 2017, it came with a price tag of just $14.99, but it was a brand-new title from a remarkably small team. It was said that Team Cherry wanted to make the game accessible to more players, which is still a theme prevalent among some small studios today.</p>



<p>The lowest price Hollow Knight dropped to is around $5.99.</p>



<p>On Reddit, users started debating the price, with some being bewildered that Team Cherry isn’t pushing the popularity of the game to charge more. One user wrote, ‘I was ready to pay 40 bucks. Am I crazy? I’m not even as big a fan as you guys, but it’s been the going rate for quality games, especially if they’re a sequel to a well-loved one.’</p>



<p>Many stressed that Team Cherry doesn’t <strong>need </strong>to charge more because ‘they are really rich because of Hollow Knight.’</p>



<p>Another user pointed out how the price is potentially harmful to subscription services:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Wild if true.</p>



<p>At that price there’s basically zero reason to play it on Game Pass unless you already have it. PC Game Pass is $12 a month, Xbox is $15. A few more $ to keep the game for life is a no brainer honestly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will be released on September 4 after years of painstaking waiting. Are you going to pick it up, whatever the price is? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Predecessor is getting it’s next big update next week. Developer Omeda Studios has announced that version 1.8 of the free-to-play MOBA will go live on September 2nd. The update introduces a new map mechanic called World Shift and adds a highly anticipated hero, Demon King Akeron.</p>



<p>World Shift is a mechanic that changes the battlefield in real time. During a match, paths, objectives, and environmental hazards can appear or disappear, keeping teams on their toes. </p>



<p><strong>“This isn’t just a visual upgrade,”</strong> Omeda says. <strong>“The World Shift reshapes strategy on the fly, demanding swift adaptation and tight teamwork.”</strong></p>



<p>Aside from the new mechanic, Akeron joins Predecessor as a tank/off-lane/jungle hero with a playstyle all his own. He can climb walls to strike from above and focuses on controlling areas while staying strong in extended fights. Players can tweak his passive, ultimate, and movement abilities to suit different strategies. Akeron is part of the ongoing Ashes of the Damned storyline, bringing the next chapter of the game’s story to life.</p>



<p>While those are the two major additions, Predecessor Version 1.8 also sees the launch of a new ranked season, battlepass updates, and even the launch in a new location: Japan. With the launch of the game in Japan, players will have a dedicated Asia server to provide the best connection possible. </p>



<p>Lastly, performance updates for the new with 1.8 include support for Nvidia DLSS with AMD FSR support coming later. Additional changes cover improvements to the in-game store, user interface, and mini-map.</p>



<p>Predecessor’s 1.8 Update launches on September 2nd for all players. Let us know if you plan on checking it out in the comments below.</p>
