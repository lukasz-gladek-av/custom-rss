<p>Following the announcement that a Death Stranding Director’s Cut will be coming to Xbox, Kojima Productions has also announced that the Death Stranding IP now belongs to the developer. </p>



<p>The announcement, which came via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20241107-317236/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">automaton-media</a>, read, “In addition, KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS announced that the IP for this work will belong to the studio. They said that they will continue to connect more fans around the world in various forms of entertainment”.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is scheduled to release for the PlayStation 5 in 2025. However, recent news could suggest that the game could launch on day one on the Xbox platform and PC, too, if PlayStation didn’t get some form of marketing/exclusivity deal.</p>



<p>Regardless<span>, today’s announcement of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-xbox-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death Stranding Director’s Cut on Xbox</a>&nbsp;suggests that Death Stranding</span> 2 will eventually be released on Xbox and PC. </p>



<p>We’ll have to wait for an additional announcement of such details, with the most likely announcement coming at Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards this December (granted, if PlayStation doesn’t have some exclusivity). </p>



<p>Death Stranding on the Xbox will be published by 505 Games.</p>
