<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wolfenstein/" id="2953">Wolfenstein 3 </a>could finally be in the works.</p>



<p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to a report from MP1st,</a> a casting call has been uncovered tied to the project. This appears to be our first look at the plot details. The project is codenamed “Valkyrie,” and it is attached to two people who previously worked on several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/machinegames/" id="87686">MachineGames </a>titles: performance director Tom Keegan and casting director Emily Schweber. Keegan directed performances for the cast of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-2/" id="97055">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the story centers around a character named Sofiya. She’s described as a Ukrainian orphan aged 8 to 11 who forms a bond with William Blazkowicz, the franchise’s main protagonist. The young character is also said to be traumatized by War, making her suspicious, but she’s ultimately labeled a strong survivor. </p>



<p>The casting call also notes that performance capture is scheduled to begin in April, with shooting dates planned for later in 2026 and extending into the next year.</p>



<p>MachineGames had previously stated that they always intended to continue the franchise. Jerk Gustafsson, studio director, said earlier this month that while he wouldn’t comment on a timeline for the third game’s release, they were never finished with the franchise. Read his full comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/machinegames-still-plans-to-finish-the-wolfenstein-trilogy/">here</a>.</p>







<p>There’s still no exact confirmation from the studio, but we may be inching closer to finishing the Wolfenstein Trilogy. Insider Gaming will continue to report on the franchise’s future as more information becomes available.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight/" id="164327">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> is slated for release later this year, and it’s already promising to honor the multiple eras of everyone’s favorite billionaire playboy-turned-vigilante.</p>



<p>That same attention to honoring the bat’s legacy will also be evident in the gameplay of the upcoming title. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tt-games/" id="462">TT Games</a> isn’t afraid to say they’re influenced by Rocksteady’s iconic Batman: Arkham series, but they still want to make sure the story focuses on core characters that let the gameplay shine, while also offering the kind of quirky experience only LEGO can provide.</p>







<h2 id="h-lego-batman-promises-collectibles-honoring-the-bat-s-decades-long-legacy">LEGO Batman Promises Collectibles Honoring the Bat’s Decades-Long Legacy</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-are-not-leaving-anything-behind-how-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-balancing-old-and-new-ign-fan-fest-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking to IGN at IGN Fan Fest 2026,</a> Jonathan Smith, Head of Development at TT Games, elaborated on the team’s approach to the game’s story, which centers on core characters and promises multiple collectibles, allowing everyone to enjoy a Bat Cave full of memorabilia.</p>



<p>“We then want to give you lots and lots of options to see the full range of what those characters can be by giving you more than a hundred different suits to collect,” he said. “So you still get that moment in the Bat Cave where you’ve got all the different suits from all the different characters arrayed in front of you, colorful and glorious. You’re still compelled to want to complete that collection.”</p>







<h2 id="h-lego-batman-will-be-a-game-for-all-bat-fans">LEGO Batman Will Be A Game for All Bat Fans</h2>



<p>Furthermore, Smith explains why he’s not worried about a game like this alienating traditional fans looking for something more akin to the Arkham series, believing that the LEGO games offer broad appeal across multiple generations of players.</p>



<p>“On the contrary, what we find with all our LEGO games is that the more we can draw upon different aspects of a character, the wider we can make our gameplay, the more appealing it is to us as players, and to younger players and older players,” he answers. “There’s something about Lego that just translates well for everybody. So the more we can put into that, we don’t find that it misses the mark for anyone at all. It just brings more to the party.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The latest Xbox Wire has announced updates to cloud screening quality for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members. They’ve also announced updates to ROG Xbox Ally and more.</p>



<p>The latest Xbox Wire has tied together a major change to Xbox platforms. The top change spotlighted an upgrade to Xbox Cloud Gaming. They have begun to allow up to 1440p, higher bitrate streaming for Game Pass Ultimate members. This update is specifically for current and last-gen consoles, joining the PC app, handhelds, and other tech that can run Game Pass.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-rog-xbox-ally-updates">New ROG Xbox Ally Updates</h2>



<p>They have also announced upgrades to the ROG Xbox Ally family of handhelds, including the ability to easily format removable storage. This update also works with officially licensed SanDisk microSD cards made exclusively for the handhelds. Now, when you’re installing a game on your Ally, you can select your removable storage Drive and format them directly.</p>



<p>They’ve also announced an update to graphic shaders on the Ally handhelds. When playing certain games, Ally and Ally X players will now see a pop-up indicating whether shaders were pre-compiled. Advanced Shader Delivery preloads game shaders during download to ensure a smoother experience when opening a game for the first time.</p>







<p>Other updates include adding Reanimal, High on Life 2, and Dragon Quest VII Reimagined to the handheld compatibility program. Reanimal is listed as “mostly compatible,” while the other two games are optimized for handheld play.
