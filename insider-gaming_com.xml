            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier today, FaZe Clan unveiled its 2026 esports jersey, and fans were immediately displeased by the excessive ‘Rollbit’ branding that was slapped on the front and shoulder of it. In recent weeks, the heavy marketing push that Rollbit has been making into streaming and content creation has left fans and viewers dismayed at some, but no matter what, the bags keep flowing.</p>



<p>The jersey would look fantastic, some argue, if the sponsorship branding were either toned back or removed entirely, but that’s not going to happen.</p>



<h2 id="h-faze-clan-s-new-rollbit-jersey-sparks-outcry">FaZe Clan’s New Rollbit Jersey Sparks Outcry</h2>



<p>On social media, FaZe Clan uncovered the jersey that the pro teams under the banner will be sporting for the next year of competition. Fans were quick to point out that once prestigious sponsorships like Nissan and G-Fuel have long been removed, and in their place sits a glaring ROLLBIT sponsorship.</p>



<p>The jersey, which is a nice black and red digital camo design, has come under intense criticism by fans, commenting that the FaZe logo is ‘smaller than the Rollbit branding’.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Rollbit has been the cause of some inflammation across the esports and streaming industries of late, offering immense bags to high-ranking streamers to host gambling streams, some of which have thrown entire fanbases into question. Now, that influence is being felt in esports via sponsorships like this.</p>



<p>In one comment, a user wrote a damning review:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the gambling sponsor being larger than the team logo and in several places I highly doubt many will sell. Glad I got mine a few years ago when it looked like a team jersey (with) a few sponsors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another wrote, ‘I thought this was FaZe, not Team Rollbit.’</p>



<p>Other fans were less critical and stressed that the jersey is ‘fire’, while some tried to field some suggestions:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Idk how i feel bout that big rollbit logo in the middle of it if you left that off and just kept it with the red and black design continuing on the front it’d be clean</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the actors nominated at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has spoken up about his surprise nod. Even more so, the actor goes as far as to credit the nomination to his French counterpart.</p>







<p>As one of 2025’s biggest games, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 seemingly came out of nowhere to some. Sporting incredible turn-based combat and excellent performances, it’s no wonder <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it broke records</a> at this year’s Game Awards. Its most impressive feat is having three of its cast (Ben Starr, Jennifer English, and Charlie Cox) nominated for Best Game Performance. Still, it seems one of the actors has responded to the nomination, and in a pretty interesting way.</p>



<h2 id="h-charlie-cox-credits-maxence-cazorla-for-game-awards-2025-nomination">Charlie Cox Credits Maxence Cazorla for Game Awards 2025 Nomination</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/bursinxmurdock/status/1992178421779083283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a video at La Conve/Animex</a> in Mexico, Daredevil actor <strong>Charlie Cox</strong> is asked about <strong>his nomination for his role as Gustave in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>. Humbly, the actor <strong>credits the nomination to Maxence Cazorla</strong>, who played and did motion capture for the role in French. Cazorla also plays Esquie in both the French and English dubs of the title. Charlie’s response, seen in the video, is available below,</p>



<p>“<strong>I’m thrilled for this nomination</strong>,” says Cox. “<strong>I’ve said this before, and I think it’s important to say…there’s an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla, who did almost all of the motion capture for that role in that game [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33]. Any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him. The performance of that character is really down to him, and my voice just was part of that process.</strong>“</p>



<p>Even still, fans were quick to praise Charlie’s great performance. Without getting into spoilers, Gustave is essential to the narrative, so it’s not surprising to see Charlie get his flowers. However, Cox’s co-stars, Jennifer English (Maelle) and Ben Starr (Verso), are hot off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/golden-joystick-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Joystick wins</a>, so they do have a better chance. The three are going up against Silent Hill f’s Konatsu Kato, Indiana Jones and the Golden Circle’s Troy Baker, and Ghost of Yotei’s Erika Iishi. We’ll know who takes the trophy home on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 11th, 2025</a>.</p>

<p>Great Scott, it looks like Back to the Future is coming to Fortnite Chapter 7! Furthermore, players will be able to ride in style in the franchise’s iconic DeLorean sooner than later.</p>







<p>The upcoming Chapter 7 of Fortnite has been highly anticipated by fans for quite a bit. After a rather successful season, which featured The Simpsons, it seems the nostalgia factor is getting turned up now. Chapter 7 is starting with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Kill Bill collaboration</a>, which sees Uma Thurman’s The Bride duel against assassin Yuki. However, the ode to classic cinema isn’t over, as an iconic car from a legendary franchise is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-pass-leaks-reveal-back-to-the-future-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially driving its way</a> to the live-service game.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-delorean-from-back-to-the-future-coming-to-fortnite-on-november-29th">The DeLorean from Back to the Future Coming to Fortnite on November 29th</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Amazing to see a whole new generation get to experience the DeLorean in the upcoming  <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Fortnite</a> Chapter 7💥 </p><p>The HYPE is real!</p><p>Fortnite has always been innovative and ahead of the pack with its digital V-Bucks ecosystem and arguably the most culturally relevant game of this… <a href="https://t.co/bFmpat6r1X">pic.twitter.com/bFmpat6r1X</a></p></div>— DeLorean Labs 🏎️🔥 (@DeLoreanlabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeLoreanlabs/status/1992590960539120080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DeLoreanlabs/status/1992590960539120080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from DeLorean Labs</a>, the company showed off a first look at the in-game version of the DeLorean. It looks like it comes from a picture from <a href="https://x.com/BATPLAY47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BatPlay47</a>, known for his Fortnite leaks. The Fortnite version of the car looks almost identical to the one used in Back to the Future, as well as the real-life counterpart. In addition, it will come out on November 29th, 2025, the same day as Chapter 7.</p>



<p>For those who don’t know, the Back to the Future movies, which were released in the latter half of the 1980s, used the DeLorean as a plot device. With upgrades from Doc Brown, the vehicle could travel through time at light speed, sending him and Marty McFly to different periods like the Wild West and the future. While it is also a notable car brand, the avid popularity of the movies made it a household name, still to this day. With the collab, perhaps we’ll see Marty and Doc join as playable skins? We’ll have to wait and see what’s in store for Chapter 7.</p>
