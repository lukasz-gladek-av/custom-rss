<p>In the 11+ years since the ID@Xbox program was announced, the indie game self-publishing program has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generated more than $5 billion</a> in payments to indie developers, according to Microsoft. The program shows no signs of slowing down, with over a thousand games released just in the past year.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-id-xbox-program-has-generated-billions-for-indie-game-developers">The ID@Xbox Program Has Generated Billions for Indie Game Developers</h2>



<p>The amount of money generated though the ID@Xbox program and given to indie developers has greatly increased in recent years. In 2020, the program’s director Chris Charla <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/what-idxbox-is-doing-for-the-next-generation-of-indie-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> ID@Xbox paid developers close to $2 billion since 2014, and had paid out more than $1.5 billion just in royalties since the program’s start. By 2022, Xbox reported that total royalties paid out had increased to $2.5 billion.</p>



<p>Since the program’s inception, some of the most popular and successful indie game titles have made their way to Xbox Game Pass. Just in the past year, Microsoft claims that over 1,000 games were added to Game Pass through ID@Xbox over the past year, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 2024 indie game of the year, Balatro</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/idxbox-showcase-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ID@Xbox showcase from this Februar</a>y highlighted over 21 titles slated to come to Game Pass as well, including Revenge of the Savage Planet and Lies of P: Overture. 33 Immortals, a 33-player co-op raid from Thunder Lotus Games that was shown off at the ID@Xbox showcase, is out today. Xbox says that the program’s upcoming lineup includes several titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Descenders Next, FBC: Firebreak, and the highly anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/towerborne-xbox-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Xbox has announced that Towerborne will be launching on Xbox Game Preview on April 29. The game will be available on Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC via the Xbox app, and Game Pass all on the same day.</p>



<p>The announcement came via the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/towerborne-game-pass-xbox-game-preview-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Xbox channels</a>, with the game also being available for press at this weeks GDC event.</p>



<p>Alongside the release on Xbox, Towerborne will get new features such as cross-platform play and progression between PC and Xbox consoles, couch co-op on Xbox consoles, and a new class skills progression system.</p>



<p>“Probably the biggest change to the game itself, Class Mastery is an all-new progression system that makes every Ace unique, based on individual player choices,” Xbox says. “By completing missions, players earn Skill Points, allowing you to fine-tune your chosen class, unlocking Focus Skills and Class Mechanics that drastically change how you play. And don’t worry, you can swap your Skill Points freely between missions, meaning you can experiment and find the perfect build.”</p>



<p>Developed by Stoic and published by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/xbox-game-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Studios</a>, Towerborne first released on PC in early access in September 2024. Despite early strong impressions, the game had only hit a peak concurrent player count of 596 on Steam, with only 12 concurrent players playing at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Towerborne is a side-scrolling action-role playing game where the player takes control of the heroes of the game called ‘Aces’, who must set out to reclaim lost territories and make the land of Belfry safe. </p>



<p>Will you be playing Towerborne? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Split Fiction has only been out for a little under two weeks—as of writing—and the game has seen incredible success in a short period of time. But that doesn’t mean developer Hazelight is resting on its laurels. In fact, Hazelight is already working on its next game.</p>



<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9-_n3vqsAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Hazelight head Josef Fares confirmed that the studio began working on its next title about a month ago. </p>



<p>“Split Fiction is the best-received game we have done, everybody is super happy, but I’m so fully focused and excited on the next thing, that we’ve already started,” Fares said. </p>



<p>Fares added that the next game is still “way too early” in its development, but they have about 130 pages so far of current ideas for the game’s story.</p>



<p>“[It’s] mostly in the story, what’s going to happen but a little bit in gameplay as well,” he said. “It’s kind of like, ‘this is where we start, this is where we’re going.”</p>



<p>With Split Fiction having done so well at release, Fares says that the studio has a belief that it can do anything it puts effort towards. He said that the overall mood of the company is as good as its ever been, and there is a confidence of topping its past releases.</p>



<p>“We just feel like, when we talk in the lunchroom or we talk to each other, we’re like, ‘Oh shit, we feel we can do better than this.’,” he said. “That’s how confident we feel, and people are very happy and excited. It’s a very happy place, Hazelight.”</p>
