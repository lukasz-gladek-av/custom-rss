            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-turned-heads-in-2024-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-next-for-the-tactical-shooter.1090059/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024, and while the launch was ‘far from flawless’ (as the dev says), it made a splash in the tactical shooter scene and attracted stacks of players. It stormed up the charts on streaming platforms, and as 2024 unravelled, MADFINGER Games coaxed the game into a better space.</p>



<p>Today, Gray Zone Warfare has sold more than 1.5 million units, and at the peak, 322,600 players were concurrently exploring this open-world, intense game. In a recent press release, MADFINGER doubled back to look at the game’s performance in 2024 before dipping into what comes next for Gray Zone Warfare.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-build-the-game-with-them">‘Build the Game with Them’</h2>



<p>In a recent press release, MADFINGER Games said they invite ‘you to build the game with them’. In the months ahead, Gray Zone Warfare will receive two major updates, introducing key elements like deeper and richer PvP content and a dynamic weather system.</p>



<p>It was just weeks ago that MADFINGER rolled out the Night Ops update, which was a pivotal point for the game that pushed it into new territory in terms of review sentiment on Steam.</p>



<p>Through 2024, MADFINGER Games fixed 2163 bugs, according to data revealed in the aforementioned press release. Many of these fixes were spread across the 19 releases pushed throughout the year.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare isn’t your average tactical shooter. It blends a few genres, offering players a unique ‘extraction shooter’ feel in a wide, open world that isn’t bound by a raid timer. It has survival elements, including health mechanics, weight management,  and the need to stay fed and watered.</p>



<p>Players are invited to join factions, spawning at a starting base that they’ll use to get kitted, call in a helicopter, and jet off across the map – a fictional, sprawling world called Lamang. It’s visually sumptuous and intense, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I had the chance to play it</a> before it landed in early access last year. I loved every minute.</p>



<p>If you want to give Gray Zone Warfare a try, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479810/Gray_Zone_Warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pick up a copy on Steam</a>.
