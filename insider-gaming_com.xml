<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>

<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/logan-pauls-pokemon-card-buyer/</link>
            <guid>1437574</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The talk of the Pokémon&nbsp;world has been the elusive Pikachu Illustrator card in Logan Paul’s possession, or should that be rectified, formerly, in his possession. The world’s most expensive Pokémon&nbsp;card is now even more valuable, and the identity behind the buyer is fascinating.</p>



<p>Logan Paul once sported his outrageously expensive Pikachu Illustrator card around his neck as he walked down the ramp for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe/" id="1631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrestlemania</a>. Dubbed ‘The most coveted card in the world,” the PSA Grade 10 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Illustrator card is as rare as a Pokémon card gets, and it changed hands for an extraordinary sum in 2026.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A once-in-a-lifetime purchase. Credit to Logan Paul</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>AJ Scaramucci is now the owner of the world’s most expensive Pokémon card after buying the Pikachu Illustrator card from Logan Paul for $16.492 million in an auction.</strong></p>



<p>Monday, February 16, 2026, will go down in history as one of the most extraordinary auctions ever.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p><a href="https://goldin.co/item/logan-paul-personally-owned-1998-pokemon-japanese-corocoro-promo-raretua0w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goldin</a> has recognized that Paul’s Pikachu Illustrator PSA 10 card (with gold chain and all!) was sold for exactly <strong>$16,492,000</strong>—including Buyer’s Premium. </p>



<p>AJ Scaramucci is the lucky bidder who has claimed this incredible collector’s item, and Guinness World Records has said it’s the most expensive trading card ever sold at any auction.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>AJ Scaramucci reveals he’s starting a “planetary treasure hunt” after spending $16.49M on the Pikachu Illustrator</p><p>“My ambition for the card is just a small story.

<h2 id="h-who-is-aj-scaramucci">Who Is AJ Scaramucci?</h2>



<p><strong>AJ Scaramucci is a wealthy venture capitalist, and you might know the name as he is the son of former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.</strong></p>



<p>After winning the card, Scaramucci told Paul he wanted to collect even more unique items:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m on a quest to buy a T-Rex dinosaur fossil, I’m going to buy the Declaration of Independence, and I’m not stopping there. This was only the beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You can’t knock the man’s ambitions! It remains to be seen if Scaramucci manages to obtain any of his other targets. The guarantee is that he now owns the only PSA 10-graded Pikachu Illustrator card in the world—the only one of the 39 to 41 cards printed.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-did-logan-paul-buy-his-pokemon-card-for">How Much Did Logan Paul Buy His Pokémon Card For?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A record broken. Credit to Logan Paul</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It seems like peanuts now, but Logan Paul had originally set the record for the most expensive Pokémon card trading purchase when he bought the Pikachu Illustrator card for $5.275 million in 2021.</strong></p>



<p>Not bad profit, all things considered. Paul has made about $10 million profit from selling the card, and the Guinness World Record you can see above now goes to AJ Scaramucci.</p>

</ul>



<p>If Scaramucci is true to his word about collecting, then this record is likely to be broken again, and no one else will ever get to own this particular Pikachu Illustrator. If you have other ideas, you’d better get saving.</p>



<p>Is any collector’s card worth this much money? Or has AJ Scaramucci got himself an item that anyone would do anything for?

<p>One of the most well-received games of 2025 could be heading to Xbox Game Pass. A post on social media on Monday talked about the future of additions to Xbox Game Pass this year, with a not-so-subtle tease of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve got quite the release slate lined up for Xbox Game Pass so far, this is going to be a huge year,”</strong> <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/2023442179625259508?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the “email” reads.</a> <strong>“Oh, and speaking of upcoming releases… well, I shouldn’t say too much, but if you’re getting quite hungry for a fun adventure, all I can say is that something big is about to be deliverance’d to Xbox Game Pass…”</strong></p>







<p>While not specifically naming the game, using the term “deliverance’d” is a dead giveaway for what’s to come. Xbox is getting ready to announce the next wave of games for the service, which could see it come sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance is already available on the subscription service for those with an Ultimate, PC, or Premium membership.</p>







<p>Are you excited about the idea of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 coming to game pass? Leave your thoughts down in the comments and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>The fifth chapter of Poppy Playtime is almost upon us, and console fans are bound to be wondering whether they can get in on the action. </p>







<p>It’s not one they’ll want to miss, either, as it’s rumoured to be the final part of the long-running saga. If you’re a PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch owner and a fan of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a>, here’s whether you can continue the journey or not.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On PlayStation 5? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Watch your step. Image by Mob Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite Chapters one through three being available on Sony’s latest console, Chapter 5 of Poppy Playtime will not be readily available on PlayStation 5 at launch. </strong></p>



<p>The franchise was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally released on PC</a> all those years ago, and ever since, the titles have first and foremost debuted there. Console ports were eventually developed for some older chapters, but it looks like PS5 fans will have to miss out—at least at launch.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that a PS5 port will be developed in the future, but how far away it is remains to be seen. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s equally bad news for Xbox fans, as Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 won’t be available on either Xbox console alongside the PC launch. </strong></p>







<p>Xbox fans often get the short end of the stick, with numerous titles opting to miss their systems in recent years. However, Chapter 5 of Poppy Playtime should arrive on Xbox eventually; it’s just a matter of when. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo fans don’t fare any better; Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 will not be on the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch.</strong></p>



<p>It might be majorly disappointing for Poppy Playtime fans, but there is a silver lining. As has been mentioned numerous times, console ports will arrive in the future, typically a few months after the PC release. It’s a shame, but console ports take time, especially for Indie devs like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mob-entertainment/" id="3160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mob Entertainment</a>. </p>

<p>Mob Entertainment has excelled at delivering grit-your-teeth, bite-your-nails action through the Poppy Playtime series. It’s always been a well-priced franchise for such replayable content, but questions are being asked about Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s price.</p>



<p>Greater quality means more work, which unfortunately factors in increased cost. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a> has gotten bigger as the years have gone on, but so has its price tag. Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 could be the end for the franchise, and it could go out with an expensive bang.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5">How Much Is Poppy Playtime Chapter 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Needs more light. Credit to Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>While there is no official confirmation as yet, Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is expected to cost about $25, possibly going up to $30.</strong></p>



<p>Everything shown from the Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 gameplay trailer suggests this is the most complete game to date. Mob Entertainment’s indie project has gone from free-to-play to a fairly premium price tag.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s unlikely Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is going to buck the trend, and it’s looking very likely that the price will go up again. In keeping with the previous chapter’s increase, Chapter 5 is probably going to cost in the region of $25-30 or £20-25. </p>



<p>Chapters 2 through 4 have seen a five-dollar increase each time. Still, this is mostly guesswork based on previous games and logic, so this is only a prediction for now.</p>



<p>This guide will be updated with the accurate price once the game is out and everyone knows for sure, so keep checking back!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-have-previous-poppy-playtime-chapters-cost">How Much Have Previous Poppy Playtime Chapters Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Historical data shows that each new chapter has raised the price between $5-10, with the first game having started as a free-to-play download.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, the first game was (and still is) completely free to play. The journey had to start somewhere, and the price has only gone up as the years have gone by.</p>
