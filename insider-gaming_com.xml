<p>Microsoft’s Q2 2025 (October – December 2024) has revealed Xbox’s gaming revenue declined, but saw slight growth in via game pass.</p>



<h2 id="h-cut-to-the-chase">Cut to the Chase</h2>



<p>Xbox’s key points for Q2 2025 are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gaming revenue declined 7% (down 8% CC)</li>



<li>Xbox content and services revenue grew 2% driven by growth in Xbox Game Pass</li>



<li>Xbox hardware revenue declined 29%</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-does-it-mean">What Does it Mean?</h2>



<p>It’s always hard to judge the long term effects of quarterly financials as they don’t paint a broader picture of the company as a whole. On first impressions, Xbox content and services revenue growth by 2% seems like a good indicator for Xbox Game Pass, but during the months in which the hotly anticipated Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 released, I would have expected a little more movement. However, its growth matches Microsoft’s guidance at 2%</p>



<p>Xbox’s revenue decline is something that we should hopefully see changed in the coming months, as Xbox’s new strategy is to release its games across more platforms and thus, increase revenues. But again, it’s somewhat surprising considering a big quarter with Call of Duty. </p>



<p>Xbox’s hardware revenue decline shows a sharp decrease at 29%, which is frankly a shocking statistic during the holiday period. For context, Xbox hardware grew by 3% during the same quarter last year. That being said, Xbox’s new focus on the cloud will undoubtedly have an negative impact on hardware sales.</p>

<p>Is there anything like the refreshing taste of an ice-cold Nuka-Cola after finishing an Expedition to Atlantic City? But what if you’re craving something different, like a Nuka-Cola Wild? Here is where to find Nuka Cola Wild in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-nuka-cola-wild-in-fallout-76"><strong>Where to Find Nuka Cola Wild in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<p>You can find <strong>Nuka Cola Wild in Fallout 76</strong> by purchasing one from <strong>Bubbles </strong>at <strong>The Whitespring Resort</strong>. Alternatively, you can find a single bottle at <strong>Eta Psi House</strong> on <strong>Fraternity Row</strong>, just inside the basement, with all of the Nuka-Cola merchandise and theming.</p>



<p>If you intend to visit Bubbles and buy their stock of Nuka-Cold Wild, along with all the other unique flavors, you better bring a fat stack of caps. At almost 40 caps per bottle, Wild will set you back somewhat!</p>



<p>But what makes Nuka-Cold Wild so unique and refreshing? It’s the company’s answer to the ever-popular Sunset Sarsaparilla from out west, toward New Vegas. The soda pop features a distinctive flavor profile meant to compete with Nuka-Cola’s direct competitor, the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company, after the former failed to buy out the latter in a corporate takeover.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-make-your-way-to-huntersville-in-fallout-76-for-power-armor-and-loot">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/huntersville-in-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Make Your Way to Huntersville in Fallout 76 for Power Armor and Loot</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-nuka-cola-wild-stats-in-fallout-76"><strong>Nuka Cola Wild Stats in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to its unique flavor and color, Nuka-Cola Wild has distinct effects that make it ideal for anyone traveling alone in Appalachia for extended periods.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Effects</strong></td><td><strong>Water</strong></td><td><strong>Disease</strong></td><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td><strong>Value</strong></td></tr><tr><td>+5 Rads<br>+40 HP<br>+25 AP</td><td>15%</td><td>0%</td><td>1</td><td>38</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The massive boost to Hit Points and Action Points makes Nuka-Cold Wild in Fallout 76 the go-to beverage for those running low on Stimpaks or running various perks that boost the effects of food and drink items.</p>



<p>The +5 Rads isn’t too terrible, either. You can deal with a bit of radiation, right?</p>



<p>What flavor of Nuka-Cola do you think would taste best in the real world? Let us know your thoughts in the comments, and share a few screenshots of your character in Fallout 76 over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>!</p>

<p>Several Bend Studio contractors have reported on their LinkedIn profiles that they will no longer be working at Bend Studio from February 14.</p>



<p>The news comes just two weeks after it was reported that PlayStation had cancelled two of its live service projects, one of which was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service God of War game by Bend Studio</a>. </p>



<p>The number of those effected is currently unclear, but according to some posts, only a handful of contractors were given full-time opportunities, while others where let go.</p>



<p>Bend Studio’s game cancelled means that the studio has not published a game since Days Gone in 2019, which sold 7.32 million units by February 2022, a number obtained by the Insomniac Games leaks.</p>



<p>With current game development timelines, it means that almost certainly it will be a decade between Days Gone and whatever is next for Bend Studio.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on if anyone at Bluepoint, another studio who faced a project cancelation has been effected.</p>



<p>What do you think Bend Studio will be working on next? Would you like to see Days Gone 2? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>In the latest BioWare update on the development of the next Mass Effect stage, the developer says it does not “require support from the full studio,” and has moved several employees to other teams at Electronic Arts. While the developer says it is reimaging how the company works, it still touts the leadership of veterans of the original trilogy.</p>



<hr>



<p>Following the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, a “core team at BioWare” is hard at work on the next Mass Effect game, the company <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2023/08/23/an-update-on-the-state-of-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in a blog post</a> today. However, an unclear number of employees have been moved to “other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.” IGN has also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that a small number of Dragon Age team members have had their roles terminated.</p>



<p>In their post, BioWare highlighted members of the veteran leadership leading production on the next Mass Effect game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Michael Gamble: Manager and Producer on Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3, and Andromeda.</li>



<li>Preston Watamaniuk: Lead Designer on the original trilogy.</li>



<li>Parrish Ley: Cinematic Animator for the original trilogy.</li>



<li>Derek Watts: Art Director for the original trilogy.</li>
</ul>



<p>Many believe this next Mass Effect title is a make-or-break release for BioWare. Dragon Age: The Veilguard went through a lengthy, turbulent development cycle, and despite some critical success, the 1.5 million copies sold was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/">half of what Electronic Arts expected</a>. This combined with EA Sports FC 25 missing internal expectations resulted in a massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-stock-drops-17-percent/">17% drop in EA’s stock value</a>. Veilguard’s game director Corrine Busch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/">left the company earlier this month</a>, after 18 years with the company.</p>
