<p>G2 has just swept Team Spirit in the grand final of the BLAST Premier: World Final event in Singapore to net the $500,000 prize. In this blink-and-you’ll-miss-it tournament, eight teams landed in Singapore to fight for the lion’s share of the $1 million prize pool. This event effectively marked the end of a year-long BLAST Premier schedule.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unstoppable">Unstoppable</h2>



<p>G2 Esports has had a pretty good year in the Counter-Strike space, except for <strong>that blip</strong>. In June, the squad picked up the top spot at IEM Dallas, beating Vitality in the GF to win $100,000. From there, things got a little choppy. </p>



<p>The team won the BLAST Premier Fall Final event and scooped $200,000, and then barely one week later, the squad fell out of IEM Rio in <strong>last place</strong> after winning <strong>nothing </strong>and ending up securing a prize worth just $4,000.</p>



<p>And now in another switch-up, the team has won the BLAST Premier World Final and picked up half a million dollars.</p>



<p>If that’s not representative of the volatility of the esports business, I don’t know what is.</p>



<p>G2 had a nice run in the group stage, but a stellar performance from Astralis meant that the future was almost written. Astralis netted a +24 map count during the groups, which was more than three times the performance of any other team – G2 included. It fell apart in the semifinals, though, as Team Spirit forcefully ejected Astralis from the running.</p>



<p>In the grand final, it came down to Spirit and G2, but in a wondrous spree, the latter team produced a 3 – 0 scoreline, sweeping Spirit clean out of the competition and picking up the trophy.</p>



<p>That’s not it for Counter-Strike esports, though. We’ve still got the Perfect World Shanghai Major to unravel later this month, which bears a massive $1.25 million prize pool. Can G2 end the year on even more of a high by claiming the top spot there as well?</p>

<p>The LVL Dome Arena in Berlin played host to the Thunderpick World Championship over the last week or so. On a lucrative stage, 16 of the world’s top CS2 teams descended upon Germany for their shot at winning the $500,000 grand prize. By the time the dust had settled, it was The MongolZ – a ten-year-old Mongolian organisation – that secured the trophy.</p>



<p>It has been a mixed bag of a year for MongolZ. In June, the team claimed the top spot at the YaLLa Compass event in Abu Dhabi. That was the biggest win – by cash value – that the team had ever secured, until now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-prestigious">Getting Prestigious</h2>



<p>The MongolZ has been competing in the Counter-Strike space for more than a decade, and this marks the squad’s biggest win by value as the organisation walks away $500,000 better off.</p>



<p>In front of a remarkably small audience in Berlin, The MongolZ produced a perfect record in the group stage and then breezed through the playoffs, effortlessly defeating Imperial, 3DMAX, and finally, Heroic, in a best-o-f-five grand final showdown. This underrated event might not pull in the numbers on streaming platforms, but it’s super impactful for teams and their communities.</p>



<p>This was a huge win for The MongolZ, as the favourite to slam the tournament was Heroic. In the group stage, Heroic produced the best map record, and then in the playoffs, the team didn’t drop a single round until they clashed against The MongolZ. </p>



<p>On social media, the team celebrated its win:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>First of all, GG WP to HEROIC! </p>



<p>Secondly, thank you to everyone involved in making the Thunderpick World Championship 2024 possible. </p>



<p>Lastly, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you to everyone who came to Berlin to support us. It means the world to us. </p>



<p>Your boys did it!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is only the second iteration of the Thunderpick World Championship, which is sponsored and backed by the betting platform of the same name. Last year, the $500,000 event was won by FaZe Clan – and for that event, The MongolZ didn’t even receive an invitation.</p>



<p>The Thunderpick World Championship will return next year.</p>
