<p>A known Fortnite insider has claimed that DC collabs for Fortnite will increase after Multiversus has been shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR, known for Fortnite leaks and rumours, <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885376822830932335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke about</a> Warner Bros.’s “new tactic” for DC in gaming after Multiversus was discontinued. The insider revealed that due to Multiversus, DC had stopped collaborating with other games. However, since the title has announced its shutdown, its new strategy is to “double down on collabs with other games again,” this list includes Epic’s popular battle royale, Fortnite.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has always had DC skins, but the collaboration is nowhere near how they have partnered with Marvel, with the latter getting new skins with each new movie or series. Fortnite already has some iconic DC skins, such as the Joker, Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman (multiple variants of him), and other heroes and villains. However, players would like to see a Fortnite season themed around the DC universe, especially with James Gunn and Peter Safran’s new DCEU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multiversus <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-is-officially-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its official shutdown last week, with the game’s fifth season serving as the final update for the game. The last time to play Multiversus online will be May 30. After that, the game can only be accessed through the local gameplay mode, which allows you to fight solo against AI opponents or with up to three friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite Festival is seemingly bringing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-sabrina-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a> next season. Also, the game might receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-red-hulk-falcon-and-superman-skins-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Hulk, Falcon, and Superman skins</a> next. What are your thoughts on Fortnite receiving more DC content after Multiversus is shutting down?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>The Six Invitational 2025 is one of this year’s esports calendar’s biggest and most valuable events. Ubisoft backs this super-sized tournament, which features a massive prize pool worth $3 million – with $1 million going to the winning team. It’s set to run from February 3 – 16, and in that window, 20 of the best Rainbow Six Siege teams on Earth will go head-to-head.</p>

<p>These phases have been dubbed the ‘Group Stage’, ‘Playoffs’, and ‘Finals’ – only the <strong>Finals </strong>stage is open to the public at the arena in Boston.</p>



<p>The action kicks off with an intense Group Stage, with all 20 teams (both invited and qualified) taking to the stage behind closed doors (but on stream) to battle it out in a best-of-three ‘Round Robin’ rotation. Four teams will be sent home, while 16 will go into the Playoffs.</p>



<p>Only six teams will make it to the Finals stage.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 created two concurrent player peak records on Steam within a week, the latest one bringing the number to just under 100,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a week ago, Red Dead Redemption 2 hit a new all-time peak of 86,717 on Steam, beating the 2023 record of 77,655. The latest number has been topped, too. Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/red-dead-red-dead-redemption-2-player-surge-on-steam-rockstar-games-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, RDR 2 hit an all-time peak of 99,993 in the past 24 hours (at the time of writing), according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1174180/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. However, its new record is not even close to Rockstar’s 2013 hit title, GTA V, which managed to peak at 364,548 almost a decade ago and has brought in more than 200,000 players in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what’s responsible for Red Dead Redemption 2 setting new player peak records on Steam? It’s none other than a discount, with Rockstar’s 2018 action-adventure game receiving a massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redeption-2-breaks-steam-concurrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% discount</a> on the platform, bringing its price down to $15. Grabbing Red Dead Redemption 2 for this price is an absolute steal, and the sale is not limited to RDR 2. The Rockstar Games Steam Sale offers up to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/rockstarpublishersale2025?tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80% discount on their games</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 features the most expansive and immersive open-world Rockstar has created, a world you could get lost in. If you don’t want to play the story, you can still get hours of content just by exploration, with each character in the open world having a new story and each corner opening a new secret. And that’s just one of the beauties of the games; the visuals, storytelling, character design and soundtrack of RDR 2 are second to none.&nbsp;</p>
