<p>During today’s earnings call, Sony revealed that the PS5 has sold over 75 units in its lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During Sony’s <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a> today, the gaming and network services segment was the highlight of the show. PS5 crossed the 75 million milestone by selling 9.5 million units in Q4. PlayStation Networks’ monthly active users were up, too, increasing from 118 million in FY23 Q3 to 129 million in FY24 Q3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s not all; PS5 and PS4 topped 95.9 million units sold in software, gaining a 6.2 million increase from last year’s 89.7 million. During this time, 11.6 million units of first-party games were sold, which decreased from 12.3 million last year. Moreover, out of the 95.9 million, 74% were full-game digital software downloads, down from last year’s 77%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to PlayStation 5’s growing sales, the current-generation console is just 1.5 million units behind the PS4 in outselling it during the same period. The console manufacturer believes that this number will only increase with the release of first-party games like Ghost of Yotei and third-party games like GTA 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-remastered-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> is coming to PlayStation 5 with Pro and VRR support on April 25. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here’s everything that was announced</a> during PlayStation’s State of Play event yesterday. What are your thoughts on the PS5 selling over 75 million units?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>During the State of Play event, Split Fiction, the new project from Hazelight, received a new trailer showcasing some of parts of the campaign.</p>



<p>Hazelight is the studio behind popular titles like A Way Out and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=it+takes+two">It Takes Two</a>, with the latter winning the Game of the Year award in 2019.</p>

<p>Continuing their established style, Split Fiction is a cooperative game featuring two protagonists, Mio and Zoe. The two are writers who specialize in distinct genres; one focuses on sci-fi adventures while the other creates fantasy stories. In the beginning of the game, they find themselves trapped within their own narratives.</p>



<p>With a diverse level design, stunning visuals, and highly creative gameplay, Split Fiction could be a serious contender for Game of the Year.</p>



<p>Split Fiction will be released on March 6th for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and the EA app. Players will also be able to invite a friend to play for free on any platform (with crossplay between PS, Xbox &amp; PC) using the Friend Pass.</p>
