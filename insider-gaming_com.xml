            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has pushed live the Expedition Project window in ARC Raiders <strong>today</strong>, which means that players can finally make good on their efforts over the last few weeks and <strong>leave Speranza</strong>. This is effectively the game’s global reset mechanic, only unlike other extraction games, it’s an optional step.</p>



<p>Users have spotted that the <strong>next </strong>Expedition window should arrive in ARC Raiders from February 22 onwards, if the countdown is anything to go by.</p>







<h2 id="h-one-finished-and-into-another">One Finished and Into Another</h2>



<p>If you’ve completed your Expedition Project today, you’ll be faced with the daunting task of starting from scratch. That means you’ll find yourself at level one with an empty stash, no skills, and empty workbenches, amongst other things.</p>



<p>It also means you’ll be taking advantage of certain temporary buffs, a small stash boost, and an exclusive new skin, <strong>Patchwork</strong>.</p>



<p>Those completing the Expedition Project have noticed that you can start building your <strong>next </strong>Expedition caravan <strong>instantly</strong>. As soon as you’ve reset that event, you start moving on to the next one. That means that you’ll work through the phases all over again, collecting the resources required to go a second time around.</p>



<p>Now to what’s next.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders players on PC can use a trick to manipulate the game. They do this by changing their system date while <strong>in the game,</strong> forcing the state forward and tricking the game’s internal calendar. By doing this, some users have revealed future map conditions, trials, and other additions.</p>



<p>Those completing the Expedition have been given a fresh timer, but if you just manipulate the game in this way, you could have seen that timer anyway.</p>



<p>Given that each Expedition loop, or ‘season’, lasts two months, this was hardly rocket science.</p>



<p>Unlike the Expedition itself. That’s rocket science.</p>



<p>So, if you’re wondering when the next Expedition hits in ARC Raiders, you’ve got something of an answer. It’s worth stressing that these things are subject to change until the update is firmly delivered, as <strong>the current Expedition </strong>was delayed by Embark Studios.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re going to be hitting the wipe in ARC Raiders.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has debunked past claims that it has told its gaming division Xbox that it must target a 30% profit margin.</p>







<p>The debunking came as part of a new <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/21/xbox-console-war-playstation-switch.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC report</a> that spoke with Microsoft about multiple issues and reports the company has seen over the past year.</p>



<p>CNBC acknowledges that a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> said Microsoft has set its gaming division, Xbox, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ambitious goal of achieving a 30% profit margin</a>, which has led to layoffs and cancelled projects. </p>



<p>According to Bloomberg, the target was set by Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer, Amy Hood, who said that the 30% target was “accountability margins” across the company, including Xbox. The report was subsequently backed up by other industry figures, who said that they had heard similar news of the ambitious targets.</p>



<p>The 30% target is much higher than the industry standard, which averages 17-22%.</p>



<p>In response to the rumour, Microsoft reportedly told CNBC that while the company does set ambitious goals, the reported 30% profit margin target was incorrect.</p>







<div><p>Xbox has had a tough year, with thousands of jobs impacted and several projects cancelled, including The Initiative’s Perfect Dark, Rare’s Everwild, and ZeniMax’s MMO under the codename Blackbird. Last week, it was announced that Xbox would not be having an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbbox-wrapped-not-coming-budget-constraints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Xbox Wrapped’ this year due to budget constraints</a>.</p><p>It’s currently unclear whether Bloomberg will redact or offer more insight into Microsoft’s ambitious goals, but should we get more information, we will update this article.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ark 2’s release window has been updated again, and the developers are now targeting 2028. </p>



<p>During the latest Snail Games Investor Day (via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>), the co-founder of developer Studio Wildcard, Jeremy Stielglitz, confirmed that Ark 2 is planned for a 2028 release. The game’s release window has changed several times since the title was first announced. It was set for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ark-2-still-planned-for-late-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late 2024</a> release, then the developers changed that with no new date. Now, it seems we will have to wait at least two more years before we see Ark 2 in action. </p>







<h2 id="h-ark-survival-ascended-sells-over-4-million-copies-will-get-ark-2-inspired-update-in-2027">Ark Survival Ascended Sells Over 4 Million Copies, Will Get Ark 2 Inspired Update in 2027</h2>



<p>However, players will be able to get their “first taste” of Ark 2 slightly earlier than 2028, but it will still be a long wait anyway. The developers reveal that a significant update is planned for Ark Survival Ascended, inspired by the sequel, which is set to be released towards the end of 2027. Snail Games had another major announcement for Ark Survival Ascended, revealing that the latest version of the game has sold over 4 million copies. </p>



<h2 id="h-ark-lost-colony-to-bring-new-features-and-story-will-be-portrayed-through-mappa-anime">ARK: Lost Colony To Bring New Features and Story Will be Portrayed through Mappa Anime</h2>



<p>As we wait for Ark 2’s release, the next major expansion for Ark Survival Ascended is coming soon. Ark: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ark-next-major-expansion-set-scene-ark-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Colony</a> will introduce a new narrative and expand the title’s scope. The developers have also confirmed that it will include new features, such as the ability to “recruit human characters to your tribe that are controlled by the computer.” Additionally, the narrative of this expansion will be showcased through Mappa anime scenes starring Michelle Yeoh and UE5 Metahuman cinematics featuring Madeleine Madden, Auli’i Cravalho, and Karl Urban.</p>



<h2 id="h-ark-survival-ascended-roadmap">ARK: Survival Ascended Roadmap</h2>



<p>The developers also revealed the following projects we can look forward to before Ark 2 releases in 2028. We will first see the arrival of Ark: Survival of the Fittest, an esports-focused spin-off of the core game, where 60 players battle, culminating in a showdown between dinosaur armies. This will arrive in the first quarter of 2026. </p>



<p><span>In the second quarter of 2026, players will see the arrival of Bob’s True Tales: Tides of Fo</span>rtune, a pirate-themed expansion for the base game and a new map called&nbsp;ARK Genesis. The third quarter of 2026 will see the arrival of ARK World Creator, a new upgrade that helps “turn the modding tools in the game into something more akin to what is seen in&nbsp;Fortnite’s&nbsp;UEFN&nbsp;or&nbsp;Roblox.”</p>



<p>Then, in the fourth quarter of 2026, Ark Dragontopia will arrive, followed by Ark Atlantis in 2027 Q1. The second quarter will see ARK: Bob’s True Tales Galaxy Wars release, which is all about large space ships, space battles, star fighters, and more. Lastly, 2027 Q4 will see the release of Legacy of Santiago, a prequel to Ark 2 that ties into that narrative and tests the game’s mechanics and features. This is “most likely not the last update for&nbsp;ARK: Survival Ascended”, said the devs. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Blue Prince Denies Alleged Usage of Generative AI]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blue-prince-generative-ai-allegations-statement/</link>
            <guid>1389901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Blue Prince’s publisher has spoken out against sudden allegations of using Generative AI in the title. The news comes after Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had its wins at the Indie Game Awards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revoked due to using AI-generated elements</a>.</p>



<p>Generative AI usage in video games has been a hot topic for quite some time. Just recently, Larian Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to using Gen AI</a> for pre-production purposes and many were displeased with the Baldur’s Gate 3 developer. The conversation on whether it’s ethical or not has been a huge debate, so it only went bigger when The Indie Game Awards revoked Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 of its wins for Best Independent Game and Best Debut Indie Game. The winner of the Best Independent Game then became Blue Prince, a puzzle rogue-like and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of 2025’s best-reviewed titles</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, allegations of Dogubomb, the creator, using Generative AI in Blue Prince appeared out of nowhere. It went big when The Escapist called out the company in <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news-indie-game-awards-clair-obscur/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a since-edited article</a>. Now, the publisher and developer have spoken up about the allegations.</p>







<h2 id="h-blue-prince-did-not-use-generative-ai-during-development-says-publisher">Blue Prince Did Not Use Generative AI During Development, Says Publisher</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For people that need confirmation:&nbsp;<br>There is no AI used in Blue Prince. The game was built and crafted with full human instinct by Tonda Ros <a href="https://twitter.com/dogubomb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dogubomb</a> &amp; his team.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/RawFury/status/2002748999388844330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement from publisher Raw Fury</a>, the studio defends Blue Prince and its developer, Dogubomb. In particular, it responds to the claims that the game used Generative AI during development. The studio posted on social media the following:</p>



<p>“<strong>For people that need confirmation:&nbsp;There is no AI used in Blue Prince</strong>,” says the statement. “<strong>The game was built and crafted with full human instinct by Tonda Ros (Dogubomb) &amp; his team. It is the result of eight years of development, fuelled by imagination and creativity, and we are extremely proud of what Tonda has achieved.</strong>“</p>



<p>With The Indie Game Awards, the criteria was that no game would use AI, and developers had to verify it in order to be considered. The allegations of Blue Prince using it were baseless, as the article had no evidence to back it up. The crackdown on AI usage in games will likely be ever-present come 2026. Whatever the case, it’s a shame one of 2025’s best titles had to deal with the allegations, especially after a big win.</p>

            <guid>1389892</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GFA Games recently unveiled a new roadmap for PIONER following the game’s entering early access on December 16. The post-apocalyptic MMO has started to slowly turn heads on account of how much potential it has wrapped up in a package that’s already evolving.</p>



<p>It’s GFA Games’ first project as a collective, and if the new roadmap is anything to go by, it has a bright immediate future; the long-term prospects are yet to be estimated.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-to-pioner-in-2026">What’s Coming to PIONER in 2026?</h2>



<p>In a roadmap published on social media, the team at GFA Games unveiled what’s coming next for PIONER.</p>



<p>Launched into early access on December 16, PIONER presents players with a gritty, STALKER-inspired rendition of a Soviet-era island, torn apart by cataclysms, anomalies, and bloodthirsty factions. It’s an open-ended, open-world title that has scores of content to uncover and explore, and despite being in early access, it’s pretty well optimized.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re excited to present the PIONER Early Access roadmap for Q1 2026.</p><p>What’s coming:</p><p>– A New Year event featuring a wide variety of themed items;<br>– New story quests, raids, PvP maps, and more <a href="https://t.co/VBP5GOBZ0q">pic.twitter.com/VBP5GOBZ0q</a></p></div>— PIONER (@PionerGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PionerGame/status/2002061384939618385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Here’s what’s coming in Q1 2026 for PIONER, and in the final days of 2025:</p>



<p><strong>December</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Year Event at Wandering Pass</li>



<li>New World Event</li>



<li>New Themed Items</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>January</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Main Story Quest</li>



<li>New World Events</li>



<li>New Raid Mission</li>



<li>New PvP Map</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Main Story Quest</li>



<li>New World Events</li>



<li>TBC</li>



<li>TBC</li>
</ul>



<p>In <strong>March</strong>, the game will get a ‘big update’, the team has teased.</p>



<p>PIONER is ambitious, especially for the size of the studio behind it and the nature of its launch. It obviously takes a lot from other titles, but the delivery feels unique and populated enough to be very enjoyable.</p>



<p>Feedback on Steam is mixed at present, and the stock so far has been collated from just 1,000 reviews. Many of the positive reviews have stressed the fact that this is an early access title and ‘shouldn’t be expected to be perfect’, which is what most of the negative reviews are focusing on.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-teams-105-million-vct-2025-partnership/</link>
            <guid>1389880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Riot Games has announced that the teams participating in the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour collectively received over $105 million, marking one of the most financially significant seasons in the game’s relatively short history. VALORANT debuted in the esports space in 2020 and has been steadily growing ever since.</p>



<p>Riot shared the information in an annual competitive recap that revealed a whopping $86 million had been generated through in-game item sales during this year’s tournaments.</p>







<h2 id="h-valorant-hit-milestones-in-2025">VALORANT Hit Milestones in 2025</h2>



<p>The recent recap published by Riot Games revealed stunning revenue that directly lined the pockets of VALORANT teams in 2025, but it went further than that. For instance, VALORANT Masters Bangkok, a tournament that ran from February to March this year, hit a viewership record in the game’s vertical.</p>



<p>From September to October, VALORANT Champs played out in Paris, and one of the most dramatic grand final showdowns in recent memory took place. These events helped boost those coffers immeasurably.</p>



<p>As stated, $86 million of that $105 million cap came from in-game cosmetics, including the yearly Champions Collection. This supersized bundle nearly <strong>doubled </strong>the revenue produced by similar bundles released in 2024. </p>



<p>Fan participation across the broader ecosystem also reached new heights. The Game Changers Pick’Em feature surpassed two million entries. That record is indicative of the growing popularity of the progressive space in VALORANT, which fans <strong>love</strong>.</p>

<p>Fnatic, one of the oldest esports organizations in Europe, is reportedly evaluating a sale that would come with a whopping $100 million price tag. In a report shared late last week, it was suggested that multiple parties are interested in securing the brand, and Fnatic has brought in a consultancy firm to engage investors.</p>



<p>Potential buyers are said to include companies across a broad array of verticals, including traditional sports, media, and entertainment.</p>







<h2 id="h-fnatic-wants-a-full-acquisition">Fnatic Wants a Full Acquisition</h2>



<p>In early reports, it has been suggested that some serious investors are eyeing up Fnatic, one of the most iconic brands in the modern esports space. Fnatic boasts a legacy that few organizations can attest to, and despite having recent drops in revenue, the company is still bursting with potential.</p>



<p>Historically, the organization has been one of the first labels in esports to innovate and expand beyond mere competition. In 2016, the company launched Fnatic Gear, a high-end peripherals division, which went on to sell <strong>one million units </strong>before the brand was sold to Sony’s INZONE label.</p>



<p>It should be stressed that $100 million is one hell of a target. In recent years, esports organizations have been bought and sold for far less, despite being valued internally with much higher price points.</p>



<p>For instance, Luminosity was sold in 2025 for just over $3 million, and FaZe Clan was valued at just $18 million in 2023. The latter organization once peaked with a valuation of $725 million, but the tumultuousness of the company proved too volatile in too short a time.</p>



<p>Analysts have argued that if any organization can command that tag, it’s Fnatic.</p>
