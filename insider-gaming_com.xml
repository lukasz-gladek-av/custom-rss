<p>If you’re looking for a new gacha-RPG, then Arknights: Enfield might be for you. But we all know gaming is better with friends, so there’s one question on everyone’s mind—does <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-preload-guide-file-sizes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a> have multiplayer?</p>



<p>The game will expand the Arknights universe, which was founded with the original Arknights back in May 2019. Instead of the former tower-defence gameplay, you can expect a fusion between combat and factory-building. </p>







<p>If that’s enough to get you to jump into Arknights: Endfield, then Insider Gaming can let you know whether you can expect multiplayer or co-op during your time on Talos-II.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-arknights-endfield-have-multiplayer">Does Arknights: Endfield Have Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One of the many characters. Image by Hypergryph.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Arknights: Endfield does feature multiplayer features, but not in the traditional sense. </strong></p>



<p>You won’t find yourself stumbling across other players in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-platforms-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a>, as it’s primarily a single-player experience. However, there are some nifty multiplayer features that you can engage in with your friends, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Visiting a friend’s reception room</li>



<li>Seeing someone’s team composition</li>



<li>Sharing Blueprints and Facilities</li>



<li>Helping friends with their OMV Dijiang</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-does-arknights-endfield-have-co-op">Does Arknights: Endfield Have Co-op?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Arknights: Endfield does not have co-op, but there is a chance it could be added at a later date.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, you’ll have to stick it out alone in Arknights: Endfield, as there won’t be any co-op at launch. That means you won’t be able to join a friend’s world, but there’s a chance that could change in the future.</p>







<p>Most games of a similar genre tend to have some form of co-op, such as Genshin Impact. Considering over 35 million people have signed up to play, it’d be a real missed opportunity if Hypergryph don’t add co-op in the future. As things stand, though, it remains a pipe dream.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release of Crimson Desert is coming fast. On Wednesday morning, developer Pearl Abyss announced that the game has officially gone gold.</p>



<p>The “gone gold” announcement comes nearly two months before the game’s planned March 19 release date. </p>







<p><strong>“We’re thrilled to announce that Crimson Desert has gone gold,”</strong> they said on <a href="https://x.com/crimsondesert_/status/2013974920120987867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>. <strong>“On behalf of the team at Pearl Abyss, thank you to our fans around the world for your support and for reaching this milestone with us. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Stay tuned for more news, and see you in Pywel on March 19!” </strong></p>



<p>With the game going gold, that means, apart from something catastrophic, the game will hit its planned release date. Crimson Desert will be available for $69.99. A Deluxe Edition is also available for $79.99. The Deluxe Edition of the game comes with a Kairos Plate Set, a Balgran Shield, and Exclaire Horse Tack Set. </p>







<p>When it launches in March, Crimson Desert will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A Portuguese retailer has posted the Switch 2 release date for Borderlands 4, suggesting the game will launch on the platform on February 27, 2026. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed indefinitely</a> back in September 2025 as the developers needed additional time to work on the game. Since then, we have yet to receive a new release date from the developers, but it might be arriving soon if the Portuguese listing is indeed true. </p>







<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-switch-2-game-key-art-listing-appears-online-with-release-date">Borderlands 4 Switch 2 Game Key Art Listing Appears Online with Release Date</h2>



<p>The Borderlands 4 Switch 2 listing has appeared on the Portuguese website, <a href="https://www.gamingreplay.com/pt/pre-reservas-nintendo-switch-2/32061-borderlands-4-game-key-card-switch-2-5026555072694.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming Replay</a>. The listing states that the release date is set for February 27, 2026, and that it will be a Game Key Card priced at €69.99. Interested buyers in the region can already pre-order the Switch 2 version on the website. </p>



<p>Back in November 2025, the Take Two CEO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-sales-results-softer-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the launch sales numbers for Borderlands 4 were&nbsp;“a little softer” than they would’ve liked, but expects it to do well “in the fullness of time”. Hopefully, the Switch 2 launch can help increase these numbers significantly. </p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is the fourth instalment of the highly popular looter shooter series, which features billions of weapons, a variety of enemies, and exciting co-op gameplay. The latest instalment takes players to a brand-new planet called Kairos, which features 4 fresh Vault Hunters. It also features a massive open world filled with enemies, dynamic events, and quests.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GameStop Has Patched the ‘Infinite Money’ Trade Glitch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-has-patched-the-infinite-money-trade-glitch/</link>
            <guid>1411894</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GameStop has issued a statement revealing that the ‘Infinite Money Glitch’ used when trading in items has been patched. </p>



<p>GameStop is one of the few offline video game stores that continues to operate effectively, consistently providing new deals and offers to its customers. Just two months ago, they launched a unique promotion called “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-trade-anything-day-coming-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Trade Anything Day</a>.” Now, they have introduced a new offer on pre-owned games. However, some customers took unfair advantage of this promotion, prompting GameStop to put an immediate stop to it.</p>







<h2 id="h-customers-were-buying-and-trading-in-the-switch-2-at-gamestop-for-extra-credit">Customers Were Buying and Trading in the Switch 2 at GameStop for Extra Credit </h2>



<p>This is how the infinite money glitch worked at GameStop stores. The company was offering a 25% bonus on the trade-in value of any pre-owned item. Customers would buy a Nintendo Switch 2 for $414.99, along with a pre-owned game that costs no more than $0.99. When they traded in both of these items, a promotional bonus was triggered, increasing the trade credit to $472.50. This effectively gave the customer $57.51 in store credit.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GEgSUUJ758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTuber</a> who exposed this glitch revealed that they were able to make $600 across both their trade cards and also get the Switch 2 they traded for at an even lower price, since it was tagged as pre-owned once it was traded in. </p>



<p>GameStop has now issued a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/2013691078109733056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> revealing that customers could repeat this process as many times as they wanted, creating an infinite money glitch. However, the glitch has been patched, and customers will not be able to “convert basic arithmetic into an endless revenue stream.” At the same time, the company will not stop promotions, and even though they “applaud the creativity,” they don’t want their stores to be used as “infinite money printers”. </p>



<p>Check out GameStop’s complete statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>GameStop is aware of the “GameStop Infinite Money Glitch,” exposed by YouTuber RJCmedia. </p>



<p>By purchasing a Nintendo Switch 2 for $414.99 and then immediately trading it back in along with the purchase of a pre-owned game, a promotional bonus was triggered that increased the Switch 2 trade credit to $472.50. </p>



<p>In short, our system briefly valued the pre-owned trade more than the new retail cost of the console itself, creating a narrow window where customers could repeat this transaction over and over again to amass infinite trade credit. </p>



<p>Effective immediately, the glitch has been patched. Trade promotions have been updated to ensure customers can no longer convert basic arithmetic into an endless revenue stream, and balance has been restored. </p>



<p>GameStop remains committed to offering promotions that reward our customers, and while we applaud the creativity, we gently remind everyone that our stores are not designed to function as infinite money printers.</p>

<p>The Midnight Walkers is stumbling into view with an early access release on the horizon, giving players a new PvPvE zombie extraction shooter to sink their teeth into.</p>



<p>With over 300,000 wishlists on Steam, anticipation is high for The Midnight Walkers, and the countdown for the release date is well and truly on.</p>



<p>If you’re chomping at the bit and are eagerly awaiting the release date of The Midnight Walkers, Insider Gaming can help you count down to the exact minute of release.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-midnight-walkers-release-date">What is The Midnight Walkers Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming in hot. Image via  Oneway Ticket Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The official release date for The Midnight Walkers is January 29, but players in some regions will be able to play a day earlier.</strong></p>



<p>Developer Oneway Ticket Studio is based in Korea, so release times are adapted to their time zone, which means the official release date isn’t actually solid. Instead, it flows with the regions of the world, but the doors will open to players simultaneously.</p>



<p>The Midnight Walkers does not have a staggered release, so there won’t be any situations where players in one region can access the game while others are locked out, and the length of the wait is the same for all players.</p>



<p>However, theoretically at least, some players will be able to play ahead of the official release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-midnight-walkers-countdown-exact-start-time">The Midnight Walkers Countdown: Exact Start Time</h2>



<p><strong>The Midnight Walkers official release time is 6 PM PT on January 28, with the exact time of entry varying for players across the world.</strong></p>



<p>Release times come from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2795540/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, which shows that players in the United States will be able to start playing the game earlier than the official January 28 release date.</p>



<p>The table below shows the exact start time for The Midnight Walkers in major time zones across the world, so you can jump in as soon as the doors open. If there are any changes to the release times, this guide will be updated.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">The Midnight Walkers Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">6 PM – Jan. 28</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">8 PM – Jan. 28</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">9 PM – Jan. 28</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Jan. 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – Jan. 29</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
