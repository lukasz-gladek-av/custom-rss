<p>Warner Bros. Discovery Leaders recently spoke about WB Games’ biggest franchises returning in 2027 or 2028. </p>



<p>Details about Warner Bros. Games have been scarce recently, with the last update coming in January 2026, revealing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-held-layoffs-late-last-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs late last year</a> that affected executive-level employees. Now, the leaders have spoken about what’s in store, and it seems some big things are coming next year and the year after. </p>







<h2 id="h-2025-was-a-year-of-reset-for-wb-games">2025 Was a Year of Reset for WB Games</h2>



<p>Warner Bros Discovery lead, JB Perette, spoke about the return of WB Games’ biggest franchises during an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/biz/news/warner-bros-discovery-david-zaslav-hbo-sale-1236673449/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>. Perette first spoke about last year being a “reset” for the company, as they were “distracted” with pursuing “too many IPs with too broad a set of studios.” 2026 will feature two releases from WB Games: LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight and the upcoming Game of Thrones-inspired mobile game, Dragon Fire. </p>

<p>However, Perette stated that fans should look forward to 2027-28, as that’s when the “real fruits will start coming”. The Warner Bros. Discovery lead teased that WB Games will “return” to some of their biggest franchises in the coming years. Though no specific franchises have been mentioned, players have already started speculating about upcoming titles in the Hogwarts Legacy franchise (The sequel is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-in-production-at-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to be in production</a>) or the Batman Arkham series. </p>
