<p>Windrose has surpassed a major milestone pertaining to Steam wishlists.</p>



<p>Windrose is an upcoming pirate-themed survival, crafting, open-world PvE game. A demo was released during Steam Next Fest on February 17, where the game reached 22,000 concurrent players. Following that public demo, the game has been wishlisted by over 1 million Steam accounts.</p>



<p>The development team commented on the milestone with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3041230/view/498346952550778886?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a message on Steam.</a></p>



<p>“This past week has been a real whirlwind for our team with all the attention the game has been getting. And as the spotlight grows, so do expectations. We’re working hard every day to live up to them,” they wrote. ” Our biggest goal is to ship a great game and let you be the judge. It may take time, but with your support, this journey becomes a lot easier (and a bit more swashbuckling, too).”</p>



<p>The game was announced back in December during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted Showcase. There’s no set release date or price point for the game at this time. It is currently scheduled to release in 2026.</p>

            <guid>1443232</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Chris Stockman, the design director of the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/saints-row/" id="1267">Saints Row</a>, has provided an update that is disheartening for the series’ fans.</p>



<p>The last we heard of Saints Row, Stockman said he had been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saints-row-1-director-asked-to-create-a-pitch-for-a-prequel/">asked to create a pitch</a> for a prequel to the series. At the time, he said that his dreams were a little closer to coming true. However, in his latest update, he seems to believe that the franchise as a whole is a thing of the past.</p>







<h2>Chris Stockman Feels Embracer Has No Ability to Do Anything with Saints Row</h2>



<p>There hasn’t been a Saints Row game since 2022. Replying to a user on Discord, Stockman said that he believed the franchise was dead. He went on to express his belief that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embracer/" id="2740">Embracer</a>, the parent company that owns the Saints Row IP, has no ability to do anything with the platform and stated that they ghosted him after he tried his best to offer a pathway forward.</p>



<p>“I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately. I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it. I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a pathway forward, but they’ve ghosted me,” he said.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Remember when we got excited about the prospect of a Saints Row prequel? Well according to Saints Row 1 Design Director Chris Stockman, Embracer is completely ignoring the idea.

Saints Row is once again dead.</span></p></article></div>







<h2 id="h-stockman-s-take-on-gta-6">Stockman’s Take on GTA 6</h2>



<p>Saints Row was once viewed as an alternative to Grand Theft Auto. GTA 6 is still on the way and is the most anticipated game of its generation. </p>



<p>Chris Stockman has previously stated that he believes the upcoming Grand Theft Auto Title would be deserving of a $100 price point. Read his full comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-deserves-100-saints-row-director-insists/" id="152091">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An apparent accident on the Southeast Asian YouTube page for Bandai Namco has revealed that the forthcoming Dragon Ball Game, codenamed Age 1000, is actually the next Xenoverse game in the Dragon Ball franchise.</p>



<p>The reveal was spotted by several individuals online when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bandai-namco/" id="1300">Bandai Namco</a> Southeast Asia had placed the Age 1000 reveal trailer in a now-deleted playlist titled “DRAGON BALL Xenoverse 3.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-xenoverse-3-has-been-a-long-time-coming">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 3 Has Been A Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>It’s been nearly a full decade since the last game in the franchise was released. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2/" id="2178">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a> was released in October 2016. The game has received numerous quality-of-life updates and has proven to be one of the most enduring modern Action RPGs.</p>



<p>The premise of the Dragon Ball Xenoverse titles is for players to create their own character in the universe of Z Fighters and level them up while experiencing brand new stories featuring classic heroes and villains from the Dragon Ball franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/" id="171842">When the game was revealed in January</a>, some believed it would be a follow-up to Dragon Ball Online, a 2010 MMORPG that has since been replaced by the Xenoverse line.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-game-features-new-work-from-akira-toriyama">The Game Features New Work From Akira Toriyama</h2>



<p>Despite his unfortunate passing in 2024, this new game will feature work from Akira Toriyama himself. Work began on the Age of 1000 project more than half a decade ago, and as such, Toriyama was able to work on world-building for the new title and brand-new characters.</p>



<p>More information about the game will be revealed during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour on April 18 and 19.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlestate Head Responds to Tarkov Support Ticket in the Most Nikita Way Possible]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlestate-nikita-respond-tarkov-support-ticket/</link>
            <guid>1443049</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In case you’re not at all connected to the extraction shooter space, you should know that Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlestate-games/" id="1450">Battlestate Games</a>, can be a little confrontational on social media. The prolific developer, who has more than 350,000 followers on Twitter (now X) alone, has long been known for having zero filter when it comes to public-facing comments.</p>



<p>From suggestions on how to improve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> to condemnation of how Battlestate handles in-game issues, Nikita stares down hundreds of targeted posts and comments every day. Recently, one of those incoming comments was regarding a support ticket for Tarkov, which Nikita responded to in classic fashion.</p>







<h2 id="h-inflammatory-isn-t-the-word">Inflammatory Isn’t The Word</h2>



<p>On social media, Nikita Buyanov found himself, as he often does, sharing teaser clips of upcoming Escape from Tarkov updates. He often shares short mash-ups of real-world scouting, team activities, development footage, and weapons and attachments that are about to land in Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter game.</p>



<p>He did just that on February 21, uploading footage teasing the upcoming Tarkov event that will welcome Icebreaker to the game in a new, super-sized event.</p>



<p>In the comments, <a href="https://x.com/JborgKasper/status/2025177817642598489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one user wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have been playing this game since 2019 and been supporting in, and im not getting the support i think i should!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nikita, being a man of the people, took an interest in this user’s comment and asked what he needed from him. Lo and behold, a support ticket reference was handed over, and it took Nikita just an hour to deduce what was going on:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>you used radar cheat</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The response has since racked up 150,000 impressions, many of which are the result of Nikita’s fans backing him in this very ‘Tarkov-like’ scenario. Many praised Nikita’s transparency and bagged on the original poster for exposing themselves. Shortly after, the player who posted the comment declared they’d never cheated in their lives, but it’s not hard for Battlestate to detect such activity.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape From Tarkov With Nikita - EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcetkc8gq1w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov has long had a problem with cheaters, which Nikita himself has referred to as fighting a multi-headed hydra. It’s the fight of a lifetime for many multiplayer-focused developers, but Battlestate Games and Escape from Tarkov often get it in the neck more than your average studio.</p>



<p>Of course, Nikita went a bit wavy shortly after, when another user commanded him to get off Twitter and optimise Escape from Tarkov, to which <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/2025236246625484871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he responded</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>don’t f***ing tell me what to do boy. i want to sit on twitter a little, before i will go and personally optimize the game</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Nikita</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Digital Price Surfaces Online At £89.99]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eagle-eyed gamers eager to determine the pricing structure for this year’s release of Grand Theft Auto 6 have stumbled on a digital listing for the game on Xbox. While it’s almost certainly a placeholder, the listing has the price of the standard game at £89.99, which would likely result in a $99.99 price tag in the United States.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that the same site also has an option to purchase a PC code for the <strong>Rockstar Games Launcher</strong>, and that version is boasting a more acceptable pricing point of £60.99, a random number indeed.</p>







<h2 id="h-placeholder-prices-are-pretty-common-for-gta-6">Placeholder Prices Are Pretty Common for GTA 6</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first proposed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">GTA 6</a> pricing point we’ve seen in recent months, and it certainly won’t be the last.</p>



<p>The latest indication regarding GTA 6’s expected price comes from Loaded, formerly CD Keys. The digital storefront has long been a purveyor of game and DLC codes for almost every major platform in the space. It’s favored heavily by PC gamers because it often offers cut-price codes, even at launch.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 surfaced recently on the site, bearing an £89.99 tag for the Xbox version of the game, and a £60.99 tag for the <strong>PC </strong>code.</p>



<p>Right now, there’s no indication that GTA 6 will be launching on PC alongside console platforms in November. We’ve also seen <strong>no confirmation </strong>from Rockstar or Take-Two regarding the game’s price, which has long been a point of contention in the gaming space.</p>



<p>For some, this could be the most expensive ‘standard game’ ever released, with the bottom-most tier of the game running up a bill of anything from $70 to $100. If Loaded’s placeholder price is any kind of accurate, we’ll see the price edge towards the latter end of that scale.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Digging deeper into the <a href="https://www.loaded.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-pc-rockstar-games-launcher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTA 6 Loaded listing</a>, we can see basic descriptors about the game. There’s a summary, screenshots procured from Rockstar’s official slate, and information suggesting it will come with online multiplayer at launch.</p>



<p>It’s nothing to write home about, and you could bet safe money on this being an arbitrary placeholder, but you never know, right?</p>



<p>Case in point, Loaded also has a listing <a href="https://www.loaded.com/state-of-decay-3-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for State of Decay 3 on PC</a>, and that’s one of the most veiled games in the business right now. It was announced years ago and doesn’t have any kind of release window, but Loaded believes it’ll drop at £19.99 when it hits, which is almost <strong>definitely </strong>incorrect.</p>
