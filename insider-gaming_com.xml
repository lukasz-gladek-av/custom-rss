<p>With the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro here, players have been eagerly awaiting details on what games will be getting PS5 Pro improvements, and how they’ll be implemented. One game that won’t be getting any sort of PS5 Pro upgrade, however, is Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>In a response to a <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fan on social media</a>, the game’s official account confirmed that players shouldn’t expect an update for the game.</p>



<p>“We currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch,” the post reads. </p>

<p>The reveal shouldn’t come as a surprise as CD Projekt Red has moved on to work on the next installment in The Witcher franchise as well as a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. Still, the news wasn’t met without its fair share of disappointment.</p>



<p>“Please reconsider this decision,” <a href="https://x.com/ThatGuyNamedTre/status/1859264991620206790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one fan said</a>. “The demand for a Pro patch is high and would give everyone an excuse to do another playthrough.”</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://x.com/RightChandMan/status/1859315618752741738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another</a>: “Really hope this gets reconsidered! It’s one of the best modern games and it deserves a pro patch.”</p>
