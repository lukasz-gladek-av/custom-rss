<p>The Valve Fremont, which is the long-rumored console running SteamOS, has appeared on popular benchmarking platform Geekbench. The appearance comes as rumors of Valve’s return to Steam consoles continue to swirl.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13390426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geekbench listings</a>, the Valve Fremont features a six core/12 thread processor running at 3.2 GHz base frequency. The device tested also has 8GB of DDR5 memory. </p>



<p>It should be noted, however, that just because it appears on Geekbench, it doesn’t mean the specs are 100% locked in. There could be various changes between when the testing appears and when something becomes official or is released. One example is that on the benchmark, it mentions running Windows 11 Pro. The final device would likely have the SteamOS Linux-based operating system.</p>

<p>Rumors of a new Steam console from Valve have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been circulating for months</a>, known Valve insider Brad Lynch has talked about the device for a while, and added some more context after it showed up on Geekbench.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1958024995273068544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to Lynch</a>, Valve Fremont is a “TV focused PC box/console running SteamOS” that “has [a] dedicated HDMI port.” He addes that it’s a semi-custom CPU based on Hawk Point 2 with the integrated GPU removed. </p>



<p>Lastly, speaking of the GPU, it has a dedicated AMD RX 7600 that will all fit in a custom Valve case.</p>



<p>When it launches, the Valve Fremont is expected, according to Lynch, to release alongside the new “Ibex” controller, “Deckard” VR headset, and it’s “Roy” controllers.</p>



<p>Valve has yet to confirm the existence of the Fremont console. But with official benchmarks appearing online, it could be only a matter of time before things become official.</p>
