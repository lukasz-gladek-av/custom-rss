<p>Several sources have revealed that Ubisoft will be shutting down XDefiant in June 2025.</p>



<p>The news was mentioned in an internal all-hands meeting today. The decision was made due to poor player numbers and a lack of player spending, according to sources familiar with the decision to sunset the game.</p>



<p>It’s understood that layoffs will impact a significant number of employees at the San Francisco studio and supporting studios, with some staff already receiving severance information. Another wave of layoffs will happen in February, with Ubisoft San Francisco and Osaka closing its doors. Around 170-180 people are understood to be losing their jobs.</p>



<p>Season 3 will be the last entire season of XDefiant, with a skeleton crew maintaining the title until June 2025. According to those familiar with the situation, Ubisoft will be updating XDefiant players on refunds for cosmetic items and other purchases at a later date.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>XDefiant started its uphill battle soon after the release of Season 1, with a lack of player spending having the team scrabbling to cut costs. </p>



<p>In August 2024, Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/">XDefiant was on borrowed time</a> despite initially having strong player numbers. Frustrations within the studio were always aimed at its leadership, who refused to take responsibility for the project’s shortcomings, which could have been avoided with a better studio culture, said the people.</p>



<p>In late March 2024, I&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/behind-xdefiant-toxic-work-culture-crunch-and-years-of-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on the studio’s toxic work culture</a>, and despite an internal investigation that concluded last month, I&nbsp;was told that the issues had been swept under the rug and that its problems were still prevalent.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best Counter-Strike 2 Maps]]></title>

<p>The Counter-Strike 2 maps are a big reason why the tactical shooter has retained its spot as the most popular multiplayer game on Steam for years. Valve has meticulously rotated maps in and out of the active duty pool for over a decade, keeping the gameplay grind fresh and giving maps time time to be remade.</p>



<p>But which CS2 maps are the best?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-maps">Best CS2 maps</h2>



<h3 id="h-mirage">Mirage</h3>



<p>Mirage is the pillar of consistency in the Counter-Strike map pool. It is the only map that has not received a major rework since it was first added in 2013, and it’s the only map that has been featured in the pool at every single Major. It’s a balanced map that provides several different approaches to both the T-side and CT-side players, with plenty of opportunities for AWP play and coordinated smoke executes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-ancient">Ancient</h3>



<p>Ancient is only a few years old, and doesn’t have the same longevity as some of Counter-Strike’s most iconic maps, but it’s one of the best additions to the map pool in years. It’s one of the most fun maps to watch and play, given the breakneck pace that both the CT-side and T-side teams need to play at to control areas like Mid and the B Ramp.</p>



<h3 id="h-train">Train</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Train’s unique map design has had players chomping at the bit for it to eventually return to CS2 in November 2024. Not only did it arrive with a fresh coat of paint, but with a number of gameplay improvements, including cleaned up areas around the bombsites that allow for much easier calling and wider angles. The core gameplay ideas are still there, but the changes allow new ideas to be used as well. Welcome back, Train.</p>



<h3 id="h-overpass">Overpass</h3>



<p>Overpass was the first Counter-Strike map designed by Valve <a href="https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2014/04/9284/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for competitive play in mind</a>, and it shows. This map gives a little bit of everything: areas that reward patience or fast-paced play, and sites that can be held or retook with clear communication. Alongside Train, Overpass is a map that Counter-Strike fans and pros cannot wait to see return to the active duty map pool.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 3 (PS3) era could’ve been the end of PlayStation as we know it. That’s according to former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-playstation-30th-anniversary-interview-with-shawn-layden-it-was-a-fight-to-get-the-sony-name-on-the-machine-they-didnt-want-to-be-associated-with-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Layden spoke on a number of topics about the console that turned 30 on December 3. One of the topics, in particular, centered around the PS3 and its disastrous launch in 2006.</p>



<p>For those who either don’t remember or were too young, the PS3 was panned at its launch due to the console’s pricing, lack of launch titles, and development issues, among other concerns. It’s a moment in time that Layden said had people at the company “happy to have survived”.</p>



<p>“PS3 was Sony’s Icarus moment,” he said. “We had PS1, PS2… and now we’re building a supercomputer! And we’re going to put Linux on it! And we’re going to do all these sorts of things! We flew too close to the sun, and we were lucky and happy to have survived the experience, but it taught us a lot.”</p>



<p>Layden continued buy saying that Sony learned for the development of the PS4 that they don’t necessarily have to build everything for the console in-house. It’s ok to buy components if possible.</p>



<p>“You can manage the cost better,” he said. You can argue with vendors, get better deals instead of building your own thing.</p>



<p>“We also learned that the center of the machine has to be gaming. It’s not about whether I can stream movies or play music. Can I order a pizza while I’m watching TV and play? No, just make it a game machine. Just make it the best game machine of all time. I think that’s what really made the difference. When PS4 came out, it set us against what Xbox was trying to do. [They wanted to] build more of a multimedia experience, and we just wanted to build a kick ass game machine.”</p>



<p>The PS3 ultimately rebounded from its launch to sell 87.4 million consoles. That put it just ahead of the Xbox 360’s 85.7M in lifetime sales but below the Wii’s 101.6M.</p>



<p>What do you think of Layden’s view that Sony was happy to have survived the PS3 launch and era? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
