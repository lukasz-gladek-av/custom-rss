<p>A new report reveals that the director of ‘Chernobyl’ is set to direct the upcoming Assassin’s Creed series for Netflix. </p>



<p>Things have been progressing rather quickly for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series lately. Just last month, players were informed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toby Wallace from Euphoria</a> has been cast as the lead in the show. There was also a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-setting-ancient-rome-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> in November that spoke about the setting of the upcoming series. Now we know who will direct the show, and Netflix has locked in a major name. </p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series-is-centered-on-a-secret-war-between-two-shadowy-factions">Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series is ‘Centered on a Secret War Between Two Shadowy Factions’</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/assassins-creed-netflix-directed-johan-renck-1236610672/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> reveals that Johan Renck, the Swedish director behind HBO’s highly rated ‘Chernobyl’ series, will be at the helm for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed. Renck has also directed series like ‘The Last Panther’ and episodes of popular shows like ‘Breaking Bad,’ ‘The Walking Dead,’ ‘Vikings,’ ‘Bates Motel’ and more. </p>



<p>Additionally, Roberto Patino and David Wiener will be the creators, showrunners, and executive producers for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed adaptation. Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Matt O’Toole, and Genevieve Jones of Ubisoft Film &amp; Television will be coming on as executive producers. </p>



<p>The plot of the upcoming adaptation hasn’t been revealed, but we do have some idea now, thanks to the logline. It states that the series will focus on a secret war between two shadowy factions. One of these factions is “set on determining mankind’s future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will.” We all know which two factions the series has always revolved around. ‘</p>



<p>Additionally, the logline also says that Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series will follow the characters “across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity’s destiny.” </p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared on the PEGI ratings</a> site.

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty’s First Nintendo Switch Title is ‘Nearly Done’, It’s Claimed]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In February 2023, Microsoft inked a 10-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms. The deal was signed amidst Microsoft’s landmark acquisition of Activision Blizzard, but fast-forward to today, and the Nintendo space is still without a Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>According to one insider, that might be about to change. In a recent claim posted to social media, it was suggested that Call of Duty is ‘a few months’ away from launching on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-call-of-duty-coming-to-switch">When is Call of Duty Coming to Switch?</h2>



<p>According to Windows Central’s Jez Corden, the first Call of Duty ‘Switch version’ is set to land on the platform in ‘a few months’. Corden explained that the spanner in the works concerned the lack of developer kits for the Nintendo Switch 2, which has been a pretty public issue since <strong>before </strong>the console launched in June.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Corden didn’t explain which Call of Duty title is being ported to Nintendo Switch 2, leaving it up to fans to surmise what’s on the way. There’s a lengthy line-up to pick from. It could be Call of Duty Warzone, which would promote the fastest adoption on Nintendo Switch 2, or it could be a recent release like Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Fans aren’t too sure about Black Ops 7 being released on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>If we were betting people, I think the safest wager would be in the Warzone stakes.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-call-of-duty-switch/">Sledgehammer Games started hiring</a> for developers with ‘AAA mobile or Nintendo Switch’ experience, which was telling enough.</p>
