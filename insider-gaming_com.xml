<p>Dante’s Inferno 2 was expected to be the successor to EA’s new hack-and-slash franchise at the time. For whatever reason, it never happened, and it’s been on the shelf for the last 15 years. While some bits and pieces have come out over the years, we’ve now gotten a proper look at the canceled ‘Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio’&nbsp;title.</p>



<p>Dante’s Inferno was touted as the next big hack-and-slash game to rival the likes of God of War and Devil May Cry—it also looked and played a lot like the former. We used it in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-to-play-like-ninja-gaiden-4-top-hack-and-slash-games-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best games to play like Ninja Gaiden 4 list</a>, and despite the God of War comparisons, Dante’s Inferno reviewed decently, sold respectably, before a potential Dante’s Inferno 2 disappeared off the face of the Earth…until now.</p>



<h2 id="h-dante-s-inferno-2-would-have-been-the-second-game-in-a-trilogy">Dante’s Inferno 2 Would Have Been The Second Game In A Trilogy</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dante of War. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Dante’s Inferno saw Dante—a Templar Knight—battle through horrible monsters and bosses through the Nine Circles of Hell. Its combat, nifty camera angles, puzzles, and bosses were reminiscent of God of War.</p>



<p>A full report from IGN has dug deep into history and uncovered many lost tidbits about Dante’s Inferno 2. It includes screenshots, concept drawings, and how the game’s story would unfold—as well as a third game!</p>



<p>‘<strong>Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio</strong>‘ was the official title for the second game. IGN says it had: “A 240-page script penned by Assassin’s Creed 2 co-writer Joshua Rubin that outlines every stage, boss battle, and plot point planned for Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio.”</p>



<p>The sequel would also have shifted away from the God of War influences and looked to forge its own identity.</p>



<p>IGN’s report outlines and details every single level throughout the game, with the Seven Sins being a huge aspect, and how Dante would climb Mount Purgatory. Furthermore: “Visceral planned for Dante’s Inferno 2 to include <strong>co-op and multiplayer modes</strong>.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>What a ride it could’ve been. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another document uncovered finds that the sequel’s conclusion would set up the events of “Dante’s Inferno 3: Paradiso.” You can check out more details and screenshots in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dantes-purgatorio-the-cancelled-sequel-to-eas-dantes-inferno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>‘s full findings.</p>

<p>Where Winds Meet is one of the biggest and most anticipated releases on the horizon in 2025, and we’ve got all the details on when you can preload the game to jump into the action.</p>



<p>After achieving vast success in China, Where Winds Meet <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases globally on November 14</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC and PlayStation 5</a> as a console exclusive title, with millions of players already pre-registering for the game.</p>



<p>If you can’t contain your excitement and want to preload Where Winds Meet in advance so you can dive straight into the game on launch, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-you-preload-where-winds-meet">When Can You Preload Where Winds Meet?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nearly there. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Preloads for Where Winds Meet will be available from November 12 at 2 PM PT, NetEase has confirmed to Insider Gaming.</strong></p>



<p>This gives you plenty of time to download Where Winds Meet in advance for launch, and preloading is recommended due to the large file size and the fact that servers will likely be stretched by an influx of players the moment the game goes live.</p>



<p>The table below shows when preloads for Where Winds Meet will be available in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Where Winds Meet Preload Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – Nov. 13</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-winds-meet-file-size-explained">Where Winds Meet File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Exact file sizes for Where Winds Meet depend on your platform, with PC users having several options to download, while PlayStation 5 has a single version.</strong></p>



<p>Users on PC have three different versions to choose from, with the Lite version clocking in at 68 GB, the Standard version requiring around 100 GB of space, and the Ultimate version requiring 120 GB—though the Ultimate version of the game may not be available immediately.</p>



<p>For PlayStation 5 players, the download size is around 108 GB total, and there are no other options for the download. </p>



<p>Bear in mind that these sizes are subject to change and could increase with day-one patches.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-where-winds-meet">How to Preload Where Winds Meet</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to preload Where Winds Meet, you can do so by visiting your platform store once the preload has been made available.</strong></p>



<p>On Steam, simply search for ‘Where Winds Meet’ in the store and find the preload option, which is available without needing to spend any additional cash due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-price-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title’s free-to-play status</a>.</p>



<p>The approach on PlayStation 5 is similar, requiring you to search for ‘Where Winds Meet’ in the PS Store, though make sure you click the right version, as there is a paid-for pre-order edition that provides additional rewards. If you just want the free-to-play version, make sure you select it.</p>

<p>The rewards available for pre-registration are cosmetic or currency-related, though the first two have not been detailed fully and are merely indicated as ‘gifts’ for now.</p>

<p><strong>All redeemable rewards in Where Winds Meet are not automatically added to your inventory and must be claimed manually using the in-game Letter system.</strong></p>



<p>The Letters feature is accessible from the main menu within the game as an option to select on the right-hand side of the same screen where you can change your gear and skills, view quests, and change appearance.</p>



<p>It’s worth keeping an eye on your Letters in-game, too, as there will be a bunch of rewards to claim throughout your progression in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to hold firm high up the leaderboards on almost every platform since being released on October 30. The third-person extraction shooter has proven to be a refreshing change of pace for many fans of the genre, introducing a post-apocalyptic landscape that encourages social interaction and collaboration rather than mindless combat.</p>



<p>It’s a sensational title that has proven it can hold its own against the titans of the genre, so much so that it has managed to earn high enough ratings to become the top-rated <span>multiplayer<strong>-only</strong></span><strong> </strong>shooter in almost ten years.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-is-the-shooter-of-the-decade">ARC Raiders is the Shooter of the Decade</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has stumped up <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Metascore of 87</a>, which is admirable for a new IP created by a relatively young studio whose debut game earned a Metascore of 80. In terms of Metacritic alone, ARC Raiders is now the highest-rated multiplayer-exclusive shooter to hit the market in almost a decade.</p>



<p>It’s topped only by Overwatch (2016), which earned a Metascore of 91 and has a similar operating model in that it <strong>only </strong>accommodates multiplayer gameplay.</p>



<p>If it weren’t for Overwatch, ARC Raiders would be lining up to be the highest-rated multiplayer-only shooter <strong>to ever be released</strong>. It’s topped in the shooter categories by games that came before, like Halo 2 (95), Gears of War (94), and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (94), but they’re all games that feature other modes and elements, including single-player campaigns.</p>



<p>With a Metascore of 87, ARC Raiders is on par with some truly heavy hitters:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ghost of Tsushima</li>



<li>Subnautica</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</li>



<li>Batman: Arkham Knight</li>



<li>Forza Motorsport 6</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops</li>



<li>Halo Infinite</li>



<li>Kingdom Hearts II</li>



<li>Fallout 4</li>



<li>Silent Hill</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders also shines in the ‘User Score’ rating on Metacritic. At the time of publishing, ARC Raiders boasted a User Score of 8.9, which is <strong>glowing</strong>. That aligns it with games like Metal Gear Solid, Max Payne, Resident Evil, Half-Life, StarCraft, A Link Between Worlds, Bloodborne, Portal 2, and Mass Effect 2, to name just a few games.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has created something truly special in ARC Raiders, and as the studio plans to support the game for the next ten years, it’s likely it’ll be evolving for some time to come.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/david-jaffe-god-of-war-creator-xbox-grave-joke/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98this-is-an-xbox%E2%80%99-god-of-war-creator%E2%80%99s-graveyard-joke-draws-criticism.1345294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hours ago, a user on social media uploaded an image of their father’s grave, recalling memories of being bought their first Xbox and falling in love with gaming. By way of a tribute to that, the user had placed two Xbox controllers on the grave, saying that their late father could ‘play along from up there’.</p>



<p>David Jaffe, the creator of God of War and Twisted Metal, quoted the post and wrote ‘This is an XBOX’, echoing Microsoft’s recent marketing campaign and prompting many to criticize the developer for an ill-timed and inappropriate comment.</p>



<h2 id="h-was-david-jaffe-mocking-the-deceased">Was David Jaffe Mocking the Deceased?</h2>



<p>The recent post on social media by David Jaffe has not been met with a positive sentiment:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Jaffe was most recently in the news for uploading a YouTube video explaining that Connie Booth, a 34-year veteran of Sony, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/connie-booth-was-fired-from-playstation-its-claimed/">was <strong>fired </strong>out of the blue</a>.</p>



<p>Under the graveyard post on social media, Jaffe attempted to defend his position after gamers came for him, but his response just stoked the flames further:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Oh shut up, you f***ing babies. My parents are dead as well, it sucks. And even WHEN they died- my dad died on Halloween and you can BET we laughed about it- we tried to accept and grieve and mourn and at the same time we didn’t become a bunch of overly serious assholes<a href="https://x.com/davidscottjaffe/status/1986283772808138817"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comments under the post cast aspersions, and while some understood that Jaffe might have meant something different, most bagged on his timing and the nature of his comment.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘How desperate for attention are you?’ While another said, ‘Just because you made fun of your dad dying, it does not give you the right to do it to other people, you stinky loser.’</p>



<p>Do you think David Jaffe was in the wrong for what he said? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
