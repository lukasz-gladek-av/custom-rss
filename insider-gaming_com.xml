            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-free-to-play-battle-royale-gamemode-has-been-datamined/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New leaks have revealed that Battlefield 6 will indeed have a free-to-play Battle Royale coming to the game.</p>



<p>The information originates from several different dataminers, who have been able to datamine Battlefield 6 having gained access to the files via Battlefield Labs. Last week, over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 concept art images of Battlefield 6 leaked</a> because of dataminers.</p>



<p>Allegedly, the datamines reveal that a Battle Royale gamemode will be coming to Battlefield 6, which was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously exclusively reported by Insider Gaming</a>. </p>



<p>According to the datamines, the gamemode (which Insider Gaming understands to be in development by Ripple Effect), will have a lot of traditional features that you’d come to expect from a Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Such features include solo, duo, trio, and squad matches, an armor system, call-ins, loot rarity, update kits and weapons, and a shrinking zone. </p>



<p>Also mentioned was a “free-to-play component”, which is understood to be the core Battle Royale experience. Gauntlet, another mode that Insider Gaming reported on in the past was also mentioned and referred to in some of the game files.</p>



<p>As for if a Battlefield Battle Royale experience for Battlefield 6 can be success or not is unclear, but this time around DICE and EA seem to be doing the right thing by at least making the experience free-to-play. It’s believed such a decision was made by Byron Beede, the new General Manager of the franchise and who had been previously leading live service for Call of Duty.</p>



<p>It seems that this time around Battlefield wants to follow a similar to model of Call of Duty and Warzone, where the free-to-play experience brings in the players, with the hope that some cross progression and customization can eventually convert players into premium purchases of the full game with its campaign and multiplayer. </p>

<p>April 2 will go down in history as a monumental day for the Nintendo Switch 2. We finally got a deep insight into the console specifications and how it will perform, but I did not have the Switch 2 nearly being called the Super Nintendo Switch on my bingo card.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 has a release date</a>, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eye-watering price tag</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price of games</a> is a serious conversation to be had. The name of the Switch 2 has barely mustered a whisper, though. We all assumed it would be called the Nintendo Switch 2, it ended up being called the Nintendo Switch 2, and this very nearly wasn’t the case.</p>



<p>An interesting developer interview shows history could’ve looked very different. </p>



<h2 id="h-we-nearly-had-the-super-nintendo-switch-instead-of-the-switch-2">We Nearly Had The Super Nintendo Switch Instead of The Switch 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It would have been cool. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">special interview</a> with Nintendo developers Kouichi Kawamoto, Takuhiro Dohta, and Tetsuya Sasaki was released on the Nintendo website shortly after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 Direct</a> showcase.</p>



<p>Many questions and musings about the Switch 2’s development were posed. Topics covered include cross-platform capabilities between the Switch 1 and Switch 2, improvements in the Nintendo Switch 2, and the device’s name.</p>



<p>One interview question stood out: “However, we haven’t touched on the name yet…How did you land on the name Nintendo Switch 2?” </p>



<p>The answer was interesting: “There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one. We even considered ideas like “Super Nintendo Switch.” However, Super NES, which came out after the NES, couldn’t play NES games. Since Switch 2 can play Switch games, it didn’t feel right to use the same naming convention as Super NES. Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we’d like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo.” So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2,” said Kawamoto.”</p>



<p>So there you have it! The name “Super Nintendo System” was on the cards, but I question how close we were to the name. Nevertheless, it’s a cool detail and one to remember as trivia for obscure Nintendo quizzes in the future.</p>



<p>Should it have been called the Super Nintendo System? Would it have been a neat throwback to yesteryear? Let us know over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Has Put in an Offer to Acquire The Entire TikTok Platform]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-big-acquire-tiktok-platform/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-has-put-in-an-offer-to-acquire-the-entire-tiktok-platform.1153071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-big-acquire-tiktok-platform/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As the TikTok ban looms in the United States following President Trump’s extension of the shutdown, Amazon has reportedly made an eleventh-hour bid to acquire the entire platform. This news comes from the New York Times, wherein it was also revealed that <strong>nobody appears to be taking the offer seriously</strong>.</p>



<p>In recent months, a few potential buyers have been touted in the press, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">Bobby Kotick</a> and the owners of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kick-intends-to-buy-tiktok-us/">Kick.com</a>.</p>



<p>Could Amazon be about to acquire the biggest video-sharing platform in the world?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-last-minute-purchase">Last-Minute Purchase</h2>



<p>Amazon could be set to acquire TikTok to prevent the platform from being eradicated from the United States – and to pry it from the hands of its Chinese owners. TikTok faces a nationwide ban in America following concerns being raised regarding the inherent security of the app, given the ties it has to Beijing.</p>



<p>The recent article posted in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/media/amazon-tiktok-bid.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New York Times</a> explains that ‘parties who have been involved in the talks do not appear to be taking Amazon’s bid seriously’.</p>



<p>That might be down to how the bid has surfaced:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The bid came via an offer letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, according to a person briefed on the matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Attempts to reach ByteDance (TikTok’s owner) and Amazon have been fruitless, and nobody has any insight into how much Amazon has put forward for the acquisition or to what extent it <strong>could </strong>go ahead. </p>



<p>Amazon already owns Twitch, the premier streaming site that outclasses competing platforms like YouTube and Kick.com. If it were to acquire TikTok, it would have a dominant hold over content creators and streamers worldwide. </p>



<p>Unfortunately for Amazon, TikTok might not be for sale in the first place. In a statement released on January 18, ByteDance revealed a willingness to let TikTok go dark in the United States if the government enforced the ban.</p>



<p>Do you think Amazon buying TikTok is a shrewd move? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you wanted to indicate the power of the Nintendo Switch 2, look no further than this tidbit – <strong>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is coming to Switch 2 when it launches on June 5.</strong> The impending arrival of CDPR’s open-world epic was revealed today during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, stunning fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Dozens of games were revealed for the Nintendo Switch 2, including both brand-new titles and re-releases of older games, like Star Wars: Outlaws and Hogwarts Legacy.</p>



<p>Am I going to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 just to experience Cyberpunk 2077 from an all-new angle? Yes, I am.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-night-city">Back to Night City</h2>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a rags-to-riches story like no other. When it debuted in 2020, it was a shambolic title that left people bewildered. It crashed in terms of reviews, fell down the charts, and came under fire from investors and shareholders.</p>



<p>Today, it’s considered one of the best open-world RPG titles ever made.</p>



<p>The turnaround is one for the history books, and although development has officially stopped on the game to facilitate the next title (and The Witcher 4), there’s one last run around the block left in the tank for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>It was revealed earlier today that Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5 when the console hits the market. The Ultimate Edition is the best way to experience the game, given that it’s bundled with Phantom Liberty, a phenomenal expansion that was the first and last major piece of DLC for the game.</p>



<p>Netizens were quick to make jokes about the processing power of the Nintendo Switch, suggesting that Cyberpunk 2077 will look nothing short of laughable on the handheld console, but the new unit has a little more under the hood than the predecessor. It won’t look as good as it can on other platforms, but that’s the sacrifice you make for the convenience of gaming on the go.</p>



<p>Do you plan on buying Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2? Let me know in the comments, or hit up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/motorsport-games-stock-falls-below-1-as-questions-mount/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Motorsport Games is officially a penny stock. At 9:50am ET, the company’s stock was trading at less than $1 on the NASDAQ. The stock has sense rebounded back above $1 as of publishing, but it remains in flux. </p>



<p>The stock has fallen over 7% over the last five days. Looking back a bit further, it has fallen by nearly 20% since the company reported its 2024 fourth quarter earnings on March 21. </p>



<p>Reasons for the stocks falling are multiple. Not only is the United States market a volatile place right now, but Motorsport Games has seen its value drop over the last couple of years. The company has lost both its Indy Car and NASCAR licenses, and currently only develops one game: Le Mans Ultimate. </p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that the game has sold more than 100,000 copies since it released in early access in February 2024. However, the company itself is still losing millions of dollars per quarter, reporting a fourth quarter loss of $2.9 million. This comes despite the company increasing its revenue for 2024 by 25.7% ($8.7 million) compared to 2023 ($6.9 million).</p>



<p>Motorsport Games also has, as of February 28, 2025, $1.2 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand. With the limited amount of funds, the company said in its <a href="https://ir.motorsportgames.com/news-releases/news-release-details/motorsport-games-reports-fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent earnings report</a> that it didn’t believe it had “sufficient cash on hand to fund its operations over the next year”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the company has continued to have multiple discussions regarding either a complete buyout or, at the very least, the selling of more assets. Those talks, however, have not resulted in any known finalized deal as of publishing.</p>



<p>What do you think of Motorsport Games’ stock continuing to fall? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
