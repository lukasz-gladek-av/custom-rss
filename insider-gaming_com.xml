<p>If you’ve ever wanted to create the wackiest and wildest Black Ops 7 content imaginable, you can now do so with the new green screen innovation found in one of the game’s various matchmaking features.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 has some interesting new features. There’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-what-is-cursed-mode-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cursed Mode</a> and, from a gameplay perspective, there’s a significant lack of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-no-aim-assist-cod-world-champ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aim Assist</a>. There’s so much more in between, but we know why you’re here: Call of Duty’s first-ever in-game green screen—which is exactly as it sounds.</p>

<p>It seems like Treyarch is specifically catering to streamers and content creators with the introduction of a new green screen map. The first-time-ever feature can only be found in <strong>Private Match</strong>—which makes sense—and it literally is just a green screen map, and wouldn’t be ideal for a competitive lobby.</p>



<p>Once you load into the map, the world is just one giant green screen. This allows you to seamlessly create thumbnails for all types of content creation.</p>







<p>Here’s what Treyarch had to say on it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A little surprise for content creators: our new Green Screen map is available in Private Matches for all your thumbnail creation needs. This has been a goal for us ever since we added a green screen to the Studio map back in BO2. Go forth and create!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Black Ops 2 only had the green screen as a bit-part aspect of a wider map. However, this is a fully-fledged green screen map, acting as your own personal home studio. It allows you to switch out your guns, pose with them, and handily whip up thumbnails.</p>

<p>To be fair, in a game that’s had its fair share of ups and downs already, this feels like a bona fide winner. It’s a perfect quality of life addition that makes the lives of many easier. Plus, even if you’re not a content creator, who’s to say you can’t find some inspiration and bring out the inner-Picasso from within?</p>



<p>Is this a smart move from the dev team? What other game-changing content like this could CoD do?

<p>Escape from Tarkov has just been pulled offline by Battlestate Games for a whopping 24 hours, and potentially longer if the 1.0 rollout needs to be extended. This is to allow the teams at Battlestate to deploy the complete overhaul coming with the 1.0 version of the game, which is the culmination of more than 10 years of development.</p>



<p>Tarkov going offline is a significant moment for the game, as when it comes back up, nothing will ever be the same again…</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-tarkov-back-online">When is Tarkov Back Online?</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be back online when the 1.0 update has been deployed. Battlestate Games has stressed it will be 24 hours from 11:00 GMT, which means 11:00 GMT <strong>tomorrow</strong>, it should be ready to go. When you boot tomorrow, you’ll be loading a new version of Escape from Tarkov, and for the first time in eight years, it <strong>won’t be a beta</strong>.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 version comes with a new map, weapons, and equipment, and much more besides. The game will wipe and introduce a new campaign that players can follow to ultimately <strong>escape from Tarkov</strong>, securing one of four endings to wrap up the game’s core loop.</p>



<p>PvE players will need to wipe their game (but it’s not mandatory) if they want to complete Escape from Tarkov’s new story.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-error-262-in-escape-from-tarkov">What is Error: 262 in Escape from Tarkov?</h3>



<p>Don’t worry, this is just the error message Battlestate Games has applied to the Escape from Tarkov launcher while the 1.0 deployment is being rolled out.</p>



<p>This weekend, a Twitch Drops campaign will go live, with thousands of streamers coming forth to broadcast the 1.0 version for the first time. Typically, a Tarkov wipe heralds a monumental time for the game, and it skyrockets on platforms like Twitch. This will be no different, as this is the most significant event in the game’s storied history.</p>







<p>Love it or hate it, Escape from Tarkov is likely back and (we hope) better than ever. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re most excited about from the 1.0 Tarkov update.</p>
