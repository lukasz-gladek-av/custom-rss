<p>Embark Studios has delayed the upcoming next part of the ARC Raiders’ Expedition Project. The Expedition, which now opens a few days later, will give you new items but practically wipe out your progress.</p>



<p>One of 2025’s hottest games has been the extraction shooter ARC Raiders. Made by Embark Studios (The Finals), the shooter has been quite popular with players and streamers. From peace pacts to all-out war, the title has already topped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-searched-game-2025-drop-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most-searched games</a> on Google and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-map-visit-25-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consistently broken player records</a> on Steam. On the roadmap, it was teased that the next expedition departure would be announced. Now, Embark Studios has revealed more info on the next Expedition, including a two-day delay.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-expedition-project-now-starts-december-17th-launching-december-22nd">ARC Raiders Expedition Project Now Starts December 17th, Launching December 22nd.</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>After a minor delay in the tunnels, the Expedition departure window will open on Dec 17; this is your Raider’s chance to roll out in the Caravan you’ve built and leave the Rust Belt behind.<br>Prepare to start a fresh new adventure with a brand new Raider, and…</p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1997350326311989689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog</a> on the ARC Raiders site, Embark Studios revealed that the next Expedition won’t start its window on December 15th as planned. Instead, the Expedition window will last from December 17th to the 22nd. Now, instead of players leaving on December 20th, the 22nd is now when those who signed up will depart The Rust Belt on their Caravan.</p>



<p>While the details of the Expedition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-have-optional-progression-wipes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are known</a>, the blog mentions some information regarding it. For one, player progress will be wiped, which includes blueprints, skill tree, level, stash, workshop, and crafting abilities. However, permanent upgrades like more inventory slots, XP boosts, and skill points will be included. It is a big choice to go on the Expedition, but seeing how ARC Raiders has shaped up to be since release, it does seem like a risk worth taking.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Duct Tape Challenge monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Pets, Potions and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you a fan of racing games with a quirky side? If so, Duct Tape Challenge is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-death-ball-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that will definitely be worth your time. Despite being a car-related game on paper, Duct Tape Challenge offers an alternate experience to players, with the main objective being to tear through multiple layers of duct tape. Players must upgrade their cars to make them faster and give them more destructive power, as the number of layers destroyed determines how many coins they earn at the end of the run.&nbsp;</p>







<p>These coins can be used for various things within the game, including upgrading cars, buying pets, stat multipliers and a lot more. These rewards encourage players to keep grinding and beat their personal bests, as the power spikes from even the smallest of upgrades are clear to see. Although simply playing through the game will give players the resources they need to progress, using redeem codes can be a good way to get ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New codes are usually released through the game’s official Discord server, or sometimes through the developers’ socials as well. However, keeping track of these can be a hassle, especially considering that players are not notified when a code expires. That’s where this page can be a lifesaver, as we update this article as soon as any new codes drop. Bookmark this page to never miss out on any free rewards again.&nbsp;</p>
