<p>Fortnite’s early access FPS game mode, Ballistic, is finally getting a new map, Hammer Fall, three months after it launched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s Ballistic game mode was released in early access on December 11, 2024, and since that day, players have been messing about in just one map, Skyline 10. However, Fortnite has just announced v.34.20, which will introduce Ballistic’s first new map since launch, along with balancing changes, economy adjustments and bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-hammer-fall-gets-added-to-fortnite-ballistic">Hammer Fall Gets Added to Fortnite Ballistic</h2>



<p>Hammer Fall is the latest castle-themed map introduced for Fortnite Ballistic, adding a medieval theme to the game mode. The “castle’s verticality” will differentiate this map from Skyline 10, providing “comfortable cover, angles to hold, and corners to play.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hammer Fall will first be released as a shell map, meaning it will arrive without any environmental art. This will allow the devs to quickly change the map’s layout if there’s any feedback. The final art and finishing touches will be added to Hammer Fall once Fortnite Ballistic players thoroughly test it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-ballistic-balancing-and-economy-changes">Fortnite Ballistic Balancing and Economy Changes</h2>



<p>The new Fortnite Ballistic v34.20 update will add buffs to weapons like Hammer Pump Shotgun, Frenzy Auto Shotgun, Thunder Burst SMG and Striker AR. Some weapon prices have been adjusted, too.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-weapon-buffs">Weapon Buffs</h3>



<ul>
<li>Hammer Pump Shotgun’s fire rate has slightly increased, and its point-blank damage has increased significantly.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Frenzy Auto Shotgun’s point-blank and mid-range damage have increased.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Thunder Burst SMG’s damage and fire rate have slightly increased.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The range at which damage falloff begins has been reduced for the Striker AR.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-economy-adjustments">Economy Adjustments</h3>



<ul>
<li>Reaper Sniper Rife: Price decreased from 4700 to 4500 Credits.</li>



<li>Striker AR: Prince increased from 2500 to 2700 Credits.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Nemesis AR: Price increased from 2500 to 2700 Credits.</li>



<li>Drum Gun: Price decreased from 3500 to 3200 Credits.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-upcoming-changes-to-fortnite-ballistic-nbsp">Upcoming Changes to Fortnite Ballistic&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/ballistic-34-20-balance-changes-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> for the Fortnite Ballistic v34.20 update, the developers addressed all the feedback they have received so far. Players want new maps, weapons, gadgets, additional starter pistols, better ways to deal with AFK players, new additions to the HUD, and efficient inventory management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have stated that adding new weapons and gadgets to Ballistic is one of their main priorities, and they will arrive soon. New pistol options will also come. They are currently figuring out how to deal with AFK players. However, they have confirmed that an “option to surrender” is in development and will likely arrive in summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The devs have discussed new crosshair options and ways to improve inventory management regarding HUD additions. However, they don’t have concrete plans to share right now. They are working on a change to show which player on your team has the Rift Point device better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, their other major priority is “dialing in the first-person feel and improving the core of how the game handles first-person weapons.” These are being worked on and will be revealed in the “improvements and fixes” sections of upcoming blog posts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pacific Drive, which was released last year, hit <strong>one million sales </strong>last month. Now, the team at Ironwood Studios is preparing to release the next major update for the game, dubbed Endless Expeditions. In a reveal trailer posted a short while ago, the new features coming with the Endless Expeditions update were revealed, and they’ve been very well received.</p>



<p>Nestled in amongst the changes and tweaks sits the ability to suspend a run, which is a mechanic that <strong>many </strong>of the game’s fans have been asking for.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-endless-entertainment">Endless Entertainment</h2>



<p>In the one-minute trailer posted by Ironwood Studios, the Endless Expeditions update was revealed in full.</p>



<p>Coming next month are several overhauls and additions to Pacific Drive, the post-apocalyptic indie title that sees players assume control of a ‘relic’ in the form of an old car. It’s up to them to explore an ever-changing world, solve quests, uncover mysteries, and upgrade their vehicle to no end to better survive the troubled wastes around them.</p>



<p>The trailer (which you can see below) revealed that the following elements are coming with Endless Expeditions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cluster spawning (no idea what that is)</li>



<li>Suspend run (save, exit, and resume)</li>



<li>Improved tools: Thermal Vacuum, Plasma Scrapper</li>



<li>IDA’s Exchange (new discoverable Zone trader)</li>



<li>Over one hour of new radio music</li>



<li>New cosmetic rewards for the garage</li>



<li>Even more lore to discover</li>



<li>And of course, <strong>Endless Expeditions</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Players can embark on journeys that never end with the Endless Expeditions feature. Ironwood Studios has described the new mechanic in the description under the trailer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set off from the garage on new continuous drives – Expeditions. Dangerous and filled with their own unique rewards, these challenging trips will test even the most seasoned breacher.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ironwood noted that this is the ‘biggest update yet’ in Pacific Drive.</p>



<p>Endless Expeditions will be released in Pacific Drive on April 3rd on all applicable platforms.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[InZOI Is Now The Number One Most Wanted Game on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inzoi-is-now-the-number-one-most-wanted-game-on-steam.1143816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>InZOI will be released in just a few days, and it has blown past all comers to secure the number-one most-wanted spot on Steam. In the last week, it was creeping up the chart, and now it has beaten the likes of Hollow Knight: Silksong, Deadlock, and Elden Ring: Nightreign. In a 7-day window, it has found its way to 50,000 new followers on Valve’s PC platform.</p>



<p>Many people are curious whether inZOI will be the top-tier Sims competitor it’s shaping up to be. It certainly has the visual effects to go the distance, but is there enough meat on the bones to satisfy the average gamer for as long as a Sims game can?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-coming-soon">Coming Soon</h2>



<p>InZOI will be released worldwide on March 28, which is partly why it has jumped up the Steam wishlist chart to <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/?sort=id_asc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">occupy the number-one spot</a>. It has beaten some of the most widely-anticipated games in recent days, including Mecha BREAK, Borderlands 4, and Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<p>At first blush, inZOI looks nothing short of impressive, giving gamers an entire city to play around with and offering remarkable depth when it comes to things like character creation. On March 28, the game will enter an early access period, where it’ll adopt a semi-premium price tag. </p>



<p>It’s set to arrive exclusively on PC as the early access period plays out, but it’ll eventually land on console platforms in the future – we just don’t know when. It all depends on how long it’s in that early access ‘testing’ period.</p>



<p>Last year, gamers were able to get hands-on with inZOI’s character creation menu, which is intensely detailed and deep, offering ways to customise your character that we’ve never seen before in a game like this. That’s one of inZOI’s unique selling points – it goes beyond the cosmetic and into the obsessive in some ways.</p>



<p>Do you plan to pick up inZOI when it’s released on March 28? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nemesis-system-why-created-monolith-wb-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Nemesis system introduced in 2014’s Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor was a phenomenal thing. It gave players a living, breathing force to fight, one that would learn how you played and keep coming back for more, adapting to your tactics and providing a deeper challenge time after time.</p>



<p>It was last seen in 2017’s Shadow of War, and following the closure of Monolith last month, it seems unlikely we’ll see it again for a <strong>very long time</strong>. In a recent video, a former VP of WB Games explained exactly why the Nemesis system was created in the first place, but the real reason reveals a gaping flaw in the plan all these years later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-didn-t-work">That Didn’t Work</h2>



<p>Laura Fryer, formerly a VP at WB Games who oversaw studios including Monolith, recently went on record talking about her time at the company. She oversaw Monolith’s operations since 2008, which means she was around for the inception of the Nemesis system.</p>



<p>The reason it was created is a little convoluted but it all comes down to money.</p>



<p>WB Games identified a financial flaw in the industry in the form of second-hand game sales. Players would buy a game once and then sell it back to a store as a ‘trade-in’, with it then changing hands again and again, most likely. WB Games was concerned with seeing no value on those successive sales and ‘only getting paid for the first copy sold’.</p>



<p>The solution? Make people play for longer and have more fun so they didn’t sell their game at all.</p>



<p>That’s how Fryer put it in her recent video (thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-warner-bros-exec-reveals-the-real-reason-shadow-of-mordors-much-loved-nemesis-system-was-created" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> for the spot).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With Shadow (of Mordor), we faced the same problem.</p>



<p>How do we create a single-player game that is so compelling, that people keep the disc in their library forever? We knew Monolith’s game engine wasn’t yet capable of having a fully open world like a GTA, and this team wasn’t interested in going the multiplayer route. But we still had to solve for the constraint. </p>



<p>And this thinking is what led to the Nemesis system, arguably one of the most creative and coolest game features in recent memory.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5f65WksXqA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fryer stressed</a> that second-hand game sales were ‘a disaster’ for developers who were missing out on the ‘millions of dollars’ generated by that particular market. The Nemesis system made players want to hold on to their game for a little longer because it was so unpredictable and it evolved with the gamer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="My Time with Monolith" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5f65WksXqA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Sadly, the Nemesis system didn’t pan out as intended. It was due to appear in the Wonder Woman game that Monolith was working on before being shuttered by WB Games in February 2025. It’s now under lock and key at WB Games for another decade, so unless it’s used in a Batman game or something, it’s unlikely you’ll ever see it again.</p>



<p>Fortunately for WB Games, the industry has changed and drastically fewer people buy second-hand software anymore.</p>
