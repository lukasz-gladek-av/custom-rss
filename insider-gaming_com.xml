<p>The co-lead designer of Starfield is sharing his thoughts on the problems the game encountered.</p>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann, once known for his work on the Elder Scrolls series for Bethesda, was also co-lead designer of Starfield. Now, he’s discussing some of the difficulties the team faced during the production and development of Starfield and comparing them to his work on The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.</p>







<h2 id="h-kuhlmann-feels-starfield-failed-to-come-together-as-a-cohesive-game">Kuhlmann Feels Starfield Failed to Come Together as a Cohesive Game</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/skyrims-co-lead-designer-says-starfields-main-problem-is-that-it-never-fully-cohered-as-a-game-it-was-a-releasable-game-but-it-wasnt-the-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with PC Gamer</a>, Kurt Kuhlmann explained that, when the game released, he felt it was a good game and suitable for release, but not a great one. He mentions that within Bethesda, some were surprised the game failed to win over players.</p>



<p>One advantage Starfield had was its smoother launch compared to Fallout 76, and Kuhlmann says that difference is why Bethesda gave it so much development time.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When it came out, I thought it was a good game,” says Kuhlmann. “It was a releasable game, but it wasn’t the best.… </p>



<p>“We had tried to take this huge leap into this new genre with all these new systems and things … I don’t know that you should expect that if you jump into the space combat genre that you’re going to be better or as good as games that just do that, and have maybe been doing it for multiple iterations, right? Like, it was good enough. It wasn’t, like, embarrassing.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann also recently discussed his decision to leave Bethesda and his vision for the sixth Elder Scrolls game. Those interested can read his comments on how Star Wars would have influenced the game’s direction at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-loremaster-says-tes6-could-have-taken-star-wars-inspired-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this link.</a></p>

<p>Three classic Far Cry games are now officially playable at 60 frames per second, thanks to a new update on January 21.</p>



<p>A trailer for Far Cry 3: Classic Edition, which received a 60FPS update, had previously surfaced, and the team behind the game teased similar updates for Far Cry Primal and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. Now, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4MfNeJwzHOgosbS4JfJZ39/3-far-cry-classics-now-run-at-60fps-on-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft has announced that </a>updates enabling all three games to run at 60FPS are available on all current-gen consoles. </p>



<p>Additionally, all three games are heavily discounted on the PlayStation Store until February 4. Far Cry 3 and Far Cry Primal (Apex Edition) are 75% off, while Blood Dragon is 60% off.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Far Cry 3, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, and Far Cry Primal will now run at 60 frames per second (FPS) on PS5, PS5 Pro, and Xbox Series X|S, thanks to a slate of free updates delivered today. As chaos erupts in the Rook Islands, the dystopian future of 2007, and across the Stone Age, the updated frame rate gives players a smoother experience and allows the beautiful (or desolate) locations to shine all the brighter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to being available for purchase, all three titles are playable on PC with Ubisoft+, on Xbox via Ubisoft+ Premium or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and on PlayStation through PlayStation Plus Premium or Extra.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: Beyond Good & Evil 2 Survives Ubisoft’s Project Purge]]></title>

            <guid>1412572</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that one of Ubisoft’s longest in-development projects, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has survived Ubisoft’s latest round of project cancellations.</p>







<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 continues to make headlines as the longest-in-development title ever, having been in development since its reveal on May 30, 2008, with a total of 6445 days at the time of writing, or, for those who hate math,&nbsp;17 years, 7 months, and 22 days. </p>



<p>However, the current version of the game has been in development since around 2017, which still means a good 8-9 years of development.</p>



<p>Regardless of records and long-ass development timelines, though, Ubisoft still thinks that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has something to give. Despite the recent restructuring that has seen six games cancelled, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, sources tell Insider Gaming that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still in active development, at least for the time being.</p>



<p>In 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-studio-sees-major-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 saw significant changes</a> with Ubisoft Montpellier being under investigation “over an unprecedented number of developers experiencing burnout and going on sick leave.”</p>



<p>According to sources, constant changes, pushbacks, and the lengthy development time have likely cost Ubisoft $500+ million in development costs. But, at least for the time being, Ubisoft feels like it’s a cost that is justified.</p>







<div><p>As for when Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will release, it’s anyone’s guess, but it’s possible the game still won’t be seen for a number of years.</p><p>What do you think of Beyond Good and Evil 2 still being in development after so long? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p></div>

<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog team has unveiled a new audio drama that leans into a noir-inspired atmosphere.</p>



<p>On January 20, the Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel <a href="https://youtu.be/BftIr01R0uU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released a trailer</a> for a new audio drama titled “The Chaotix Casefiles,” launching on January 27 on various podcast platforms. The series centers on Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee, who run the Chaotix Detective Agency. The series also teases appearances from Sonic and Dr. Eggman.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The world of Sonic the Hedgehog has been thrust into a not-so-dark, not-so-stormy, hard-boiled detective story that probably nobody saw coming. This show has it all. Massive mystery, investigative intrigue, and saxophone. Lots and lots of saxophone.</p>



<p>Follow Sonic and the intrepid Chaotix Detective Agency as they take on their biggest case yet. This high-flying, action-packed adventure will take them across the world, fighting for every clue they can find. It’s one heck of a tale. Which is good, because this story might be the only thing that can save their lives.</p>



<p>All will be revealed in Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles. Coming soon to wherever you get your podcasts.</p>

<p>On January 20, 2026, Nintendo shadow-dropped a free update to Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns originally launched on the Nintendo Wii over a decade ago, was later ported to the Nintendo 3DS, and an updated version of the game arrived on the original Nintendo Switch in early 2025. However, the new free update went live this week, adding new game modes, enhanced visuals, and a new playable character. </p>







<h2 id="h-dixie-kong-finally-arrives-in-donkey-kong-country-returns">Dixie Kong Finally Arrives in Donkey Kong Country Returns</h2>



<p>When Donkey Kong Country Returns first arrived on the Nintendo Wii in 2010, it was heralded as a return to the glory days of the Donkey Kong series on the Super Nintendo. However, while Diddy Kong was originally a playable sidekick, Dixie Kong was absent from the games until Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze was released on the Nintendo Wii U.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/a-free-update-is-out-now-waitaminute-is-that-dixie-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Now, the new free update</a> to Donkey Kong Country Returns HD for the Nintendo Switch family of consoles adds a playable Dixie Kong for the first time. Instead of using Diddy’s jetpack to fly through the air, players will be able to use Dixie Kong’s Helicopter Spin.</p>



<p>Additionally, the free update boasts enhanced visuals and resolution, as well as faster load times, specifically for the Nintendo Switch 2. GameShare is also supported on the Nintendo Switch 2, allowing players to play with a friend who doesn’t have the game via a local wireless connection. There’s also a new Turbo Attack Mode that serves as a time trial.</p>







<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-s-moment-in-the-sun">Donkey Kong’s Moment in the Sun</h2>



<p>Ever since the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo’s oldest mascot and the leader of the bunch, Donkey Kong, has been back front and center in the first year of the new Switch. Donkey Kong Bananza was the first standout 3D platformer of the new console, featuring DK’s redesign and the return of King K. Rool.</p>



<p>DK is also featured in Mario Kart World and is slated to be a major focal point of the campaign mode in Mario Tennis Fever. That game is slated to feature<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-unveils-new-features-and-characters-in-mario-tennis-fever-gameplay-overview-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> the largest roster in series history</a>.

<p>Layoffs have taken place at Starbreeze Studios, the developer behind Payday 3, marking another difficult moment for the studio following the game’s troubled launch.</p>



<p>Multiple employees took to LinkedIn on Wednesday to confirm that layoffs were taking place. As of writing, Starbreeze has yet to officially announce the layoffs. </p>







<p><strong>“Today, many of us at Starbreeze, Stockholm, got sad news and I’m now seeking a new role and would appreciate your support,”</strong> said QA Alexander Pereswetoff-Morath. <strong>“After over 7 years, the longest I’ve ever been at any company in any industry, my time has (more than likely) come.”</strong></p>



<p>Senior Tech Producer Sabina af Jochnick added, <strong>“Due to the recent layoffs at Starbreeze, my role has been identified as at risk of redundancy, so I’m beginning to look at what’s next.”</strong></p>



<p>Since launching in 2023, Payday 3 has faced a number of problems. It’s launch was so bad with players frustrated and leaving the game altogether that Starbreeze ultimately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-fires-ceo-tobias-sjogren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired its CEO</a> Tobias Sjögren. Starbreeze even announced in late 2024 that it was going to invest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-less-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“significantly less”</a> in year two content for Payday 3. </p>







<p>Despite the lower investment in the game, the studio had continued to update and support the game. It’s most recent update—Update 3.1—on January 13 included a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1272080/view/494965447846790101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Shopping Spree” heist</a> along with a number of game balance changes. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Starbreeze for clarification on the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>
