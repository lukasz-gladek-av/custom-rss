<p>IEM Katowice is considered a prestige event in the massive Counter-Strike 2 calendar, and the best CS2 players there are delivering. The best players in the world are competing in the $1 million tournament, and both some familiar and new faces are shining the brightest.</p>



<p>Here are the best CS2 players from IEM Katowice after the conclusion of the group stage.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-from-iem-katowice-2025-group-stage">Best CS2 Players from IEM Katowice 2025 Group Stage</h2>



<h3 id="h-danil-donk-kryshkovets">Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</h3>



<p>Is anyone else surprised? You shouldn’t be. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last year’s consensus best player</a> of the year has <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/players?event=8034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the highest rating</a> of any player after the IEM Katowice group stages. He also finished with the highest ADR (average damage per round) rating and K/D differential of any player. Unsurprisingly, he was the lead man in Spirit’s playoff-clinching win over GamerLegion.</p>



<h3 id="h-guy-nertz-iluz">Guy “NertZ” Iluz</h3>



<p>Liquid may have fallen short of reaching IEM Katowice playoffs, but fans can be happy with how NertZ performed in Katowice. The team’s newest addition was an absolute force in creating opening kills, and was only outdone in ADR by donk. NertZ is clearly an upgrade for Liquid, and once the team cleans some things up, they should be a more familiar face in playoffs.</p>



<h3 id="h-oldrich-pr-novy">Oldřich “PR” Nový</h3>



<p>Every year, a new player emerges and threatens to break into the top echelon of Counter-Strike players. This year, an early contender for rookie of the year is Oldřich “PR” Nový, a 17 year old Czech player for GamerLegion. After some impressive matches against paiN and MOUZ, PR had a head-turning performance against the once great Astralis. On Mirage in particular, he dropped a staggering 29 kills and only died 7 times. PR and GamerLegion ultimately fell to donk and Spirit, missing playoffs, but he’s a player to keep watching in the future.</p>



<h3 id="h-ismailсan-xantares-dortkardes">İsmailсan “XANTARES” Dörtkardeş</h3>



<p>Eternal Fire is one of the hottest teams at the start of 2025, and XANTARES is a big reason why. The veteran rifler was having a solid event throughout groups, but he shined the brightest in a thrilling multi-overtime Nuke game against FaZe. XANTARES dropped a server-high 49 kills on Nuke, and won 12 out of 16 opening duels, pushing Eternal Fire over the finish line and into playoffs over FaZe.</p>



<h3 id="h-everyone-on-navi">Everyone on NAVI</h3>



<p>NAVI are the best team of 2024 and winners of the first CS2 Major, and everyone on the roster has been red hot in Katowice. Of the top 10 players according to HLTV player ratings, four of them are NAVI players: b1t, jL, iM, and w0nderful. NAVI defeated both FURIA and The MongolZ handedly, and took down donk and Spirit in an incredible series to guarantee playoffs.</p>

<p>Once you’ve got a few hours into Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll find yourself revelling in pomp and circumstance at a wedding in Semine. This is one of the pivotal moments of this open-world RPG, but it has a particular task that might be tricky for some.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the wedding mission, you’re prompted to congratulate the newlyweds, but the bride and groom are nowhere to be seen. This can leave you searching for a while, as the location they’re in is not at all obvious – and you might never think to look there.</p>



<p>In this short guide, I’ll help you find the newlyweds in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-find-the-bride-and-groom-in-kingdom-come">Find the Bride and Groom in Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>The wedding mission is one of the highlights of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. It’s the culmination of several hours of gameplay, and hopefully, you’ll be well-prepared to deal with everything it offers. In one moment, you’ll be duelling guards, and in the next, you’ll be procuring special alcohol for Moravian guests.</p>



<p>It’s a busy time.</p>



<p>At the end of the mission, you prepare to leave the wedding, but first, Henry of Skalitz wants to congratulate the newlyweds, but they’ve disappeared and nobody knows where they are.</p>



<p>Here’s where you’ll find the <strong>bride</strong> (Agnes) at the wedding:</p>



<p>Head away from the ceremony area through the arch leading to the dining area – nearby where the Moravian crew is sitting. Directly ahead of you will be a dead-end with a door to the left, with a guard posted outside. If you head in there, you’ll see it leads into a wine and beer cellar – it’s in here that you’ll find the bride.</p>



<p>If you’ve come here previously with the Moravian task, you’ll already have evacuated the strict guard from inside. Otherwise, you might need to distract him some other way. Either way, this is where to find the newlyweds in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>I won’t spoil what happens when you’ve found the bride – have fun!</p>
