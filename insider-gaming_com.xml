<p>Up until launch, there’s been a mystery surrounding Highguard, but some of the best information surrounding the game came from an unlikely place. The full trophy list has been revealed for Highguard, and it looks like there’s going to be a lot to unpack. </p>



<p>When it was revealed as the final game at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Game Awards</a>, it’s fair to say that people were underwhelmed to see another free-to-play hero-shooter. However, it’s been developed by some of the masterminds behind Apex Legends and Titanfall, so it deserves a fair chance in the spotlight.</p>







<p>If you’re planning on giving Highguard a chance, here’s the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-list-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy list</a> you can work on completing during the raids. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-highguard-trophies-amp-achievements">All Highguard Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>

<p><strong>Judging by the Trophy list, it doesn’t seem like you’ll need to sink an overwhelming amount of time into Highguard to 100% it. </strong></p>



<p>Considering it’s a multiplayer shooter, you’ll need to perform certain feats during an online match, but there’s nothing outrageous that demands an elite calibre of skill. A lot of them simply need you to complete matches—that shouldn’t be too hard, right?</p>







<p>That’s enough preamble, though. Here’s the complete Highguard Trophy list from start to finish.</p>

<p>As usual, PlayStation has one extra Trophy thanks to its ever-coveted Platinum Trophy, which sadly aren’t available to you Xbox gamers out there. But there’s still a healthy batch of Achievements to grind towards, and none of them seem too intensive. Get them all done, and your Gamerscore should rise by a fair amount. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t sit still in Hytale before something else changes! Hytale’s founder promised constant improvements, and Update 2 brings new gameplay mechanics, dozens of fixes, and so much more in its January patch notes.</p>



<p>Hytale’s popularity remains strong in its early weeks. This is being helped by the game’s frequent updates and patch notes. Initial changes included adding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-dinosaurs-hytale-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dinosaurs</a>, for example. Hytale Update 2 is another fairly hefty proposition, and there’s much to look forward to and discuss.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-update-2-release-date">Hytale Update 2 Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>Hytale founder Simon Collins-Laflamme has said Update 2 is arriving “this weekend,” which means it’ll drop between January 23 and January 25.</strong></p>



<p>To add to this, he’s already confirmed that “Update 3 is already in the works,” and the grind never stops!”<a href="https://hytale.fandom.com/wiki/Simon_Collins-Laflamme#articleComments"></a></p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-changes-in-hytale-update-2">Biggest Changes In Hytale Update 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hunt down the void. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pickaxe progression and Mining have been reworked, and new Magic is being added to Hytale, along with a host of cosmetic and customization changes. There are also tons of gameplay fixes, balance tweaks, and overall QOL improvements across visual and audio.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a fairly meaty update that targets all aspects of Hytale. Obviously, the standout aspects of Update 2 are the physical gameplay flourishes. New magic will sharpen up and broaden the action, making it even more fun.</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme recently revealed he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-founder-unhappy-with-games-mining-outlines-thousands-of-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t happy with the state of the game’s Mining</a>, which is why it’s not a surprise to see how it’s been changed in Update 2: “Pickaxe progression reworked: mining speed now scales with pickaxe quality.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Highguard’s Trophy List has surfaced online, revealing the most information about the game we have received yet, including mechanics, game modes, and more.</p>



<p>The upcoming free-to-play, PvP raid shooter by Wildlight Entertainment, Highguard, was revealed during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2026</a>, with a brand new flashy trailer. However, since then, the game’s marketing has been almost nonexistent, with virtually no information revealed 4 days before its release. Interestingly, the Highguard Trophy List is doing the job for them. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-trophy-list-reveals-brand-new-details">Highguard Trophy List Reveals Brand New Details </h2>



<p>There is a wealth of information contained in Highguard’s Trophy List, which was discovered on <a href="https://www.exophase.com/game/highguard-psn/trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Exophase</a>. This list covers various aspects of the game, including mechanics, game systems, characters, and more. It mentions features such as Shieldbreakers, Domesplitter, Revivals, Enemy Orbs, Wall Breaking, and Generators. Additionally, the list includes the names of certain weapons, like the BigRig LMG. Furthermore, it highlights other items, including chests, Rare &amp; Legendary items, and more.</p>



<p>The trophy list also goes through all the different types of Wardens in the game, including Assault Warden, Defensive Warden, Recon Warden, Support Warden, and Destruction Warden. Interested readers can check out Insider Gaming’s Highguard Trophy guide <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>Highguard has some big names attached to it, with the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall working on the title. However, even though the game is set to release on January 26, 2026, the game’s official YouTube channel has just one video: the reveal trailer shown at The Game Awards. Players have been waiting for more information on the title, but it seems the trophy list might have to suffice until release. </p>







<p>In other news, Highguard developers did not pay for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the spot at The Game Awards finale</a>. Additionally, some players suspect that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-dead-on-arrival-gamers-fear-a-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title could flop</a>.

<p>The next star of Fortnite Festival may have been uncovered by dataminers, suggesting that the Pink Pony Club could be on it’s way to the game.</p>



<p>Season 12 in Fortnite, starring LISA, is heading toward a conclusion, having been in the game since November 2025, and the end date of February 5 is right around the corner. Now, it appears her successor has been uncovered.</p>







<h2 id="h-chappell-roan-potentially-coming-to-fortnite">Chappell Roan Potentially Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pink Pony Club. Image via Itsmeleaky on X</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hints that Chappel Roan is coming to Fortnite have been uncovered by <a href="https://x.com/itsmeleaky/status/2014267037674013053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Itsmeleaky on X</a>, who uncovered items in the games files that hint towards the pop star entering the fray.</p>



<p>A microphone and drumset have been discovered in Fortnite’s files, but the biggest hint ofall comes from a significant makeover to the beloved Fortnite llama, which appears to have been inducted into the Pink Pony Club.</p>



<p>The design of the llama looks extremely close to the horse that Chappel Roan has utilized in her concerts around the world, and is therefore a direct hint at the collab.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/2014267385348284507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, who shared the image, added that the collab was not confirmed, and, while the items were found in files, the headliner for the next season of Fortnite Festival could be changed.</p>



<p>If Chappell Roan were to star as the headliner of the next Fortnite Festival season, she would add to the library of Jam Tracks in the game, which already includes hits The Giver, Hot to Go, and Good Luck, Babe!</p>







<hr>



<p>Would Chappell Roan be a good choice for the headliner in the next Fortnite Festival season? Share your thoughts in the Insider Gaming Discord.</p>

<p>The co-lead designer of Starfield is sharing his thoughts on the problems the game encountered.</p>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann, once known for his work on the Elder Scrolls series for Bethesda, was also co-lead designer of Starfield. Now, he’s discussing some of the difficulties the team faced during the production and development of Starfield and comparing them to his work on The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.</p>







<h2 id="h-kuhlmann-feels-starfield-failed-to-come-together-as-a-cohesive-game">Kuhlmann Feels Starfield Failed to Come Together as a Cohesive Game</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/skyrims-co-lead-designer-says-starfields-main-problem-is-that-it-never-fully-cohered-as-a-game-it-was-a-releasable-game-but-it-wasnt-the-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with PC Gamer</a>, Kurt Kuhlmann explained that, when the game released, he felt it was a good game and suitable for release, but not a great one. He mentions that within Bethesda, some were surprised the game failed to win over players.</p>



<p>One advantage Starfield had was its smoother launch compared to Fallout 76, and Kuhlmann says that difference is why Bethesda gave it so much development time.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When it came out, I thought it was a good game,” says Kuhlmann. “It was a releasable game, but it wasn’t the best.… </p>



<p>“We had tried to take this huge leap into this new genre with all these new systems and things … I don’t know that you should expect that if you jump into the space combat genre that you’re going to be better or as good as games that just do that, and have maybe been doing it for multiple iterations, right? Like, it was good enough. It wasn’t, like, embarrassing.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann also recently discussed his decision to leave Bethesda and his vision for the sixth Elder Scrolls game. Those interested can read his comments on how Star Wars would have influenced the game’s direction at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-loremaster-says-tes6-could-have-taken-star-wars-inspired-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this link.</a></p>

<p>Three classic Far Cry games are now officially playable at 60 frames per second, thanks to a new update on January 21.</p>



<p>A trailer for Far Cry 3: Classic Edition, which received a 60FPS update, had previously surfaced, and the team behind the game teased similar updates for Far Cry Primal and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. Now, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4MfNeJwzHOgosbS4JfJZ39/3-far-cry-classics-now-run-at-60fps-on-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft has announced that </a>updates enabling all three games to run at 60FPS are available on all current-gen consoles. </p>



<p>Additionally, all three games are heavily discounted on the PlayStation Store until February 4. Far Cry 3 and Far Cry Primal (Apex Edition) are 75% off, while Blood Dragon is 60% off.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Far Cry 3, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, and Far Cry Primal will now run at 60 frames per second (FPS) on PS5, PS5 Pro, and Xbox Series X|S, thanks to a slate of free updates delivered today. As chaos erupts in the Rook Islands, the dystopian future of 2007, and across the Stone Age, the updated frame rate gives players a smoother experience and allows the beautiful (or desolate) locations to shine all the brighter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to being available for purchase, all three titles are playable on PC with Ubisoft+, on Xbox via Ubisoft+ Premium or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and on PlayStation through PlayStation Plus Premium or Extra.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: Beyond Good & Evil 2 Survives Ubisoft’s Project Purge]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/</link>
            <guid>1412572</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that one of Ubisoft’s longest in-development projects, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has survived Ubisoft’s latest round of project cancellations.</p>







<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 continues to make headlines as the longest-in-development title ever, having been in development since its reveal on May 30, 2008, with a total of 6445 days at the time of writing, or, for those who hate math,&nbsp;17 years, 7 months, and 22 days. </p>



<p>However, the current version of the game has been in development since around 2017, which still means a good 8-9 years of development.</p>



<p>Regardless of records and long-ass development timelines, though, Ubisoft still thinks that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has something to give. Despite the recent restructuring that has seen six games cancelled, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, sources tell Insider Gaming that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still in active development, at least for the time being.</p>



<p>In 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-studio-sees-major-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 saw significant changes</a> with Ubisoft Montpellier being under investigation “over an unprecedented number of developers experiencing burnout and going on sick leave.”</p>



<p>According to sources, constant changes, pushbacks, and the lengthy development time have likely cost Ubisoft $500+ million in development costs. But, at least for the time being, Ubisoft feels like it’s a cost that is justified.</p>







<div><p>As for when Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will release, it’s anyone’s guess, but it’s possible the game still won’t be seen for a number of years.</p><p>What do you think of Beyond Good and Evil 2 still being in development after so long? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog team has unveiled a new audio drama that leans into a noir-inspired atmosphere.</p>



<p>On January 20, the Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel <a href="https://youtu.be/BftIr01R0uU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released a trailer</a> for a new audio drama titled “The Chaotix Casefiles,” launching on January 27 on various podcast platforms. The series centers on Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee, who run the Chaotix Detective Agency. The series also teases appearances from Sonic and Dr. Eggman.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The world of Sonic the Hedgehog has been thrust into a not-so-dark, not-so-stormy, hard-boiled detective story that probably nobody saw coming. This show has it all. Massive mystery, investigative intrigue, and saxophone. Lots and lots of saxophone.</p>



<p>Follow Sonic and the intrepid Chaotix Detective Agency as they take on their biggest case yet. This high-flying, action-packed adventure will take them across the world, fighting for every clue they can find. It’s one heck of a tale. Which is good, because this story might be the only thing that can save their lives.</p>



<p>All will be revealed in Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles. Coming soon to wherever you get your podcasts.</p>

<p>The brand management team behind the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise kicked off the year with a trailer revealing that 2021 would be a big celebration of the 35th anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog’s debut on the Sega Genesis in 1991. It appears that this audio drama is the first of much more content to come.</p>



<div><p>As for the Chaotix Detective Agency, the Chaotix first appeared on the Sega 32X in a game helmed by Knuckles the Echidna in 1994. However, beginning with Sonic Heroes in 2004, the trio began making more regular appearances as fan-favorite auxiliary characters in the series.</p><p>Now, they’re getting their own hard-boiled spotlight in this upcoming podcast, beginning January 27.</p></div>
