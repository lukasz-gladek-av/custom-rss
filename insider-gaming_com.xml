<p>An insider has revealed that the arrival of Red Dead Redemption on current-gen consoles doesn’t mean that Red Dead Redemption 2’s enhanced version will not be coming. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Rockstar Games came with some massive announcements about Red Dead Redemption yesterday. It was revealed that the game will not only be available for current-gen consoles as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-owners-on-last-gen-consoles-are-eligible-for-free-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free upgrade</a>, but will also be playable on iOS and Android devices through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-new-announcements-do-not-negate-rdr2-from-happening">The New Announcements Do Not Negate RDR2 From Happening </h2>



<p>Reliable insider NateTheHate was recently told on <a href="https://x.com/natethehate2/status/1989053149097976264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that they should change their insider sources, as they didn’t predict the announcement of Red Dead Redemption’s current-gen port. However, NateTheHate responded to this post, stating that this announcement “doesn’t negate” the fact that Red Dead Redemption 2 is also receiving the current-gen upgrade. </p>



<p>When asked about what he knows regarding the release window for Red Dead Redemption 2’s enhanced version, Nate revealed that he was told it should arrive “a few months after” the release of the Nintendo Switch 2. This was the information he had since the beginning of this year, but since then, GTA 6 has been delayed, and Rockstar is known for doing “whatever they want”. Hence, the release timelines for these games are always subject to change. </p>







<p>In other news, Red Dead Redemption 2 recently became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-become-the-fourth-best-selling-game-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth best-selling game ever</a>, surpassing Mario Kart 8 in units sold. Additionally, more enhanced version <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-enhanced-claims-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims surfaced online</a> as the anniversary drew close.

<p>If you’ve ever wanted to create the wackiest and wildest Black Ops 7 content imaginable, you can now do so with the new green screen innovation found in one of the game’s various matchmaking features.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 has some interesting new features. There’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-what-is-cursed-mode-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cursed Mode</a> and, from a gameplay perspective, there’s a significant lack of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-no-aim-assist-cod-world-champ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aim Assist</a>. There’s so much more in between, but we know why you’re here: Call of Duty’s first-ever in-game green screen—which is exactly as it sounds.</p>

<p>It seems like Treyarch is specifically catering to streamers and content creators with the introduction of a new green screen map. The first-time-ever feature can only be found in <strong>Private Match</strong>—which makes sense—and it literally is just a green screen map, and wouldn’t be ideal for a competitive lobby.</p>



<p>Once you load into the map, the world is just one giant green screen. This allows you to seamlessly create thumbnails for all types of content creation.</p>







<p>Here’s what Treyarch had to say on it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A little surprise for content creators: our new Green Screen map is available in Private Matches for all your thumbnail creation needs. This has been a goal for us ever since we added a green screen to the Studio map back in BO2. Go forth and create!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Black Ops 2 only had the green screen as a bit-part aspect of a wider map. However, this is a fully-fledged green screen map, acting as your own personal home studio. It allows you to switch out your guns, pose with them, and handily whip up thumbnails.</p>

Go forth and create! <a href="https://t.co/zxonI8Eha7">pic.twitter.com/zxonI8Eha7</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1989005194781450488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>To be fair, in a game that’s had its fair share of ups and downs already, this feels like a bona fide winner. It’s a perfect quality of life addition that makes the lives of many easier. Plus, even if you’re not a content creator, who’s to say you can’t find some inspiration and bring out the inner-Picasso from within?</p>



<p>Is this a smart move from the dev team? What other game-changing content like this could CoD do?
