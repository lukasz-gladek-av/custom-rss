<p>NCSoft’s and PlayStation’s Horizon Steel Frontiers is not the only multiplayer game on the horizon; Guerrilla Games has something cooking in this space as well. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Horizon Steel Frontiers is a new MMORPG that was revealed yesterday. It is launching for PC and mobile devices, but we do not have a release date yet. Also, a new interview recently revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-developers-used-ai-extensively/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI was used ‘extensively</a>‘ in the development process of the upcoming multiplayer game. </p>







<h2 id="h-guerrilla-s-horizon-multiplayer-title-is-their-next-big-project">Guerrilla’s Horizon Multiplayer Title is their ‘Next Big Project’</h2>



<p>The clarification about Guerrilla’s Horizon multiplayer title came through a post by Jason Schreier on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a>. Schreir stated, “Just to clear up some confusion I’ve seen,’ Horizon Steel Frontiers’ from NCSoft is different from the multiplayer Horizon game that’s in development at Guerrilla Games.” Schreier added that Guerrilla Games’ upcoming Horizon multiplayer title is their “next big project”. He also thinks that NCSoft’s MMO is “meant for Asian markets”. </p>



<p>The Horizon franchise has been in the news a lot lately. Earlier this year, it was all about Sony’s Horizon clone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-copying-the-horizon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit against Tencent</a> for the latter’s upcoming title, Light of Motiram. Then the focus shifted to NCSoft and PlayStation’s Horizon Steel Frontiers, which dropped an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN-NNgWIyIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10-minute video</a> revealing some gameplay and other elements of the title. And now, we have been informed that another Horizon multiplayer game is on the way; it seems the series fans have a lot to look forward to in the coming years. </p>







<p>In other news, court documents have revealed that the Horizon Zero Dawn movie is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-movie-planned-to-release-in-2027-court-documents-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned to release in 2027</a>. Additionally, Tencent recently responded to the lawsuit, stating, “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-responds-to-sony-horizon-clone-lawsuit-fame-does-not-create-a-trademark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fame doesn’t create a trademark</a>.” What are your thoughts on another Horizon multiplayer game being worked on by Guerrilla Games?

<p>An insider has revealed that the arrival of Red Dead Redemption on current-gen consoles doesn’t mean that Red Dead Redemption 2’s enhanced version will not be coming. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Rockstar Games came with some massive announcements about Red Dead Redemption yesterday. It was revealed that the game will not only be available for current-gen consoles as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-owners-on-last-gen-consoles-are-eligible-for-free-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free upgrade</a>, but will also be playable on iOS and Android devices through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-new-announcements-do-not-negate-rdr2-from-happening">The New Announcements Do Not Negate RDR2 From Happening </h2>



<p>Reliable insider NateTheHate was recently told on <a href="https://x.com/natethehate2/status/1989053149097976264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that they should change their insider sources, as they didn’t predict the announcement of Red Dead Redemption’s current-gen port. However, NateTheHate responded to this post, stating that this announcement “doesn’t negate” the fact that Red Dead Redemption 2 is also receiving the current-gen upgrade. </p>



<p>When asked about what he knows regarding the release window for Red Dead Redemption 2’s enhanced version, Nate revealed that he was told it should arrive “a few months after” the release of the Nintendo Switch 2. This was the information he had since the beginning of this year, but since then, GTA 6 has been delayed, and Rockstar is known for doing “whatever they want”. Hence, the release timelines for these games are always subject to change. </p>







<p>In other news, Red Dead Redemption 2 recently became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-become-the-fourth-best-selling-game-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth best-selling game ever</a>, surpassing Mario Kart 8 in units sold. Additionally, more enhanced version <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-enhanced-claims-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims surfaced online</a> as the anniversary drew close. What are your thoughts on the insider revealing that Red Dead Redemption 2’s enhanced version is still coming?
