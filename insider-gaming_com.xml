<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is available to the world and, with a new game mode unlocking after completion of the campaign, it’s natural to ask about the length and how many missions there are to complete—and we have the answer.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 makes some big changes to the campaign this year, introducing four-player co-op and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Camos to unlock</a>, giving players more to dig out from the experience.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering what the full length of the Black Ops 7 campaign is and want to know how many missions there are to churn through, we’ve got all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-long-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">How Long to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7?</h2>

<p><strong>Full completion of the main story in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign takes around five hours to complete, though this can be longer.</strong></p>



<p>If you are playing the campaign solo, completion time will be longer as progress will be harder and therefore slower. If you want to blitz through the campaign as quickly as possible, it’s highly recommended that you gather a squad to help push through the hordes of enemies more quickly.</p>



<p>Campaign completion will also take longer if you’re hunting down all of the Intel scattered in the game, or if you’re farming for the exclusive Camos. If you’re doing the latter, however, I recommend you hold off until you complete the campaign and unlock the Endgame mode.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-missions-in-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign">How Many Missions in Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 11 total missions in the Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign, not including the Endgame mode, which you will be automatically entered into for the first time when the campaign is complete.</strong></p>



<p>Each mission is unlocked periodically, fleshing out the main story, though it’s a bit of a fever trip jumping to different locations and years, so don’t worry if you’re struggling to keep up.</p>



<p>Many of the missions begin in an open-world environment in Avalon, but there are markers to follow so you won’t get lost.</p>



<p>A full list of the missions in the Black Ops 7 campaign is below:</p>



<ol>
<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Inside</li>



<li>Distortion</li>



<li>Escalation</li>



<li>Disruption</li>



<li>Collapse</li>



<li>Fracture</li>



<li>Quarantine</li>



<li>Suppression</li>



<li>Breakpoint</li>



<li>Containment</li>
</ol>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-server-capacity-tripled-for-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-games-has-tripled-escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-server-capacity-ahead-of-1-0-release.1354528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the biggest issues that plagues Escape from Tarkov players every time there’s a new update is server queues. The game suffers under the weight of incoming players, and those same players feel that burn. From lengthy queue times to network instability, Tarkov’s servers often crumble around a wipe or new major update.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has well and truly prepared for that ahead of the game’s 1.0 release, dropping later today. In an episode of Tarkov TV, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio, confirmed that Escape from Tarkov’s server capacity has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of the release.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-major-networking-issues-eliminated">Tarkov’s Major Networking Issues Eliminated</h2>



<p>It’s a huge time for Escape from Tarkov. The game is finally graduating from the beta state it has sat in for almost eight years, becoming a full release and landing on Steam, amongst other things. The super-sized update introduces a new map, a non-linear campaign, fresh weapons, and more than 1,000 bug fixes.</p>



<p>In the most recent episode <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/battlestategames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of Tarkov TV</a>, Nikita also confirmed that a huge investment has been made in the game’s server capacity and infrastructure, and that the server makeup has been <strong>tripled </strong>ahead of launch.</p>



<p>This was preceded by a tongue-in-cheek reference by Nikita that begged players not to ‘overload their servers, please.’</p>







<p>Every time a major update has hit the Escape from Tarkov ecosystem, it has led to massive server queues and instability, placated only by users inevitably drifting away because of those issues.</p>



<p>The 1.0 update of Escape from Tarkov arrives after more than a decade of development, which has seen the face of the spearhead extraction shooter evolve numerous times.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mark Rubin Said Ubisoft Did NOT Cancel Splinter Cell to Make XDefiant]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mark-rubin-splinter-cell-ubisoft-xdefiant/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-rubin-said-ubisoft-did-not-cancel-splinter-cell-to-make-xdefiant.1354525/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, it was suggested that Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was canceled before it saw the light of day. This tidbit came from Nick Herman, the co-founder of AdHoc Studio, the creator of the recent title ‘Dispatch’, starring Aaron Paul. Herman stressed that he left Ubisoft after the project was canceled and opened a new studio, AdHoc, in 2018.</p>



<p>However, Mark Rubin, who is best known as the executive producer on the failed arena shooter, XDefiant, took to social media to refute claims that his team was making Splinter Cell and was ordered to pivot and focus instead on XDefiant.</p>







<h2 id="h-splinter-cell-did-not-become-xdefiant">Splinter Cell Did Not Become XDefiant</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Mark Rubin stressed that a recent rumor published first by Bloomberg is <strong>not true</strong>. This rumor suggests that Ubisoft was working on Splinter Cell but ‘switched’ to XDefiant. Rubin categorically denies that it was the case, stating that they were working on a game for a year, but the team was ‘struggling to find the fun.’</p>



<p>He then pushed the point again that it ‘was NOT a Splinter Cell game.’</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1989545807247487122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full quote</a> from Rubin:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Saw the rumor from Bloomberg that we were working on Splinter Cell game before switching to XDefiant. I can say that is not true.</p>



<p>When I got to Ubisoft they had been working on a game for a year that was very ambitious but was struggling to find the fun. And it was NOT a Splinter Cell game. </p>



<p>I then canceled that one and let the team pitch any game ideas they wanted. There were some cool ones but I felt the scope/difficulty was too hard on some ideas so we stuck with an arena shooter and we found the fun quickly. </p>



<p>So no we didn’t pivot off Splinter Cell to make XDefiant. Now maybe they were thinking about working on Splinter Cell before I got there but it was never a thing while I was there. My experience with Ubisoft was they are very open to whatever the studio wants to do which is great but I do wish we could have used external engines.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-splinter-cell-ubisoft-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent claim from Nick Herman</a>, co-founder of AdHoc Studios, was that Ubisoft ‘stopped caring about’ the game the team was working on. Herman would leave around a year before Mark Rubin arrived in 2019.</p>







<p>Ubisoft is still working on a remake of the original Splinter Cell title, which is working with a reported release window of 2026.</p>



<p>Do you wish we’d gotten a new Splinter Cell game in the last ten years or so? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Warframe is a popular third-person online shooter set in a different solar system known as the Origin system. Having originally been released on both PC as well as console in 2013, Warframe has since captured the imaginations of thousands of gamers, with a dedicated player community existing even today. It received ports for the latest generation of consoles in the last few years, and even got an iOS version in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being a fully free-to-play game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warframes-switch-2-port-delayed-by-backlog-of-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a> boasts solid accessibility, with the fast-paced gameplay and combat experience also being praised by passionate fans over the years. Although Warframe, like most F2P games nowadays, does offer microtransactions, all of the key elements of the game can be earned by simply playing and progressing through the various modes and events. Some cosmetic items can even be claimed for free by players, using the various redeem codes that the developers release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lawsuit between Bungie and writer Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case, which revolved around possible copyright violations of Destiny 2 from Martineau’s work, has been going on for around a year.</p>







<p>Destiny 2 is one of Bungie’s biggest and most recent games, released in 2017. With several expansions, the free-to-play title is still going <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-new-details-on-bungie-restructuring-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somewhat strong</a>. However, last year, a writer named Matthew Martineau <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-being-sued-for-copyright-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against Bungie for possible copyright infringement. His claim was that the company stole various narrative elements from his work for the Red Legion plot and The Curse of Osiris expansion. Surprisingly, the case survived Bungie’s dismissal and was on its way to court. Now, it seems it has been settled and over with.</p>

<p>Obtained by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, the lawsuit between Bungie and Matthew Martineau has been settled. The case has been dismissed and will not go to court. In a statement from the court filing, it says,</p>



<p>“The court having been advised that all parties have firmly agreed upon a compromise in this matter; it is ordered that this action be and is hereby dismissed as to all parties, without costs and without prejudice to the right, upon good cause shown, within sixty days, to reopen the action if the settlement is not consummated,” the order reads. “In addition, the court specifically retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement if settlement is not consummated within sixty days.”</p>



<p>However, if the settlement is not completed in 60 days, the case will go to trial. As it stands, though, a compromise has been made, and no legal action will occur. Without speculation, a settlement usually means both parties are at fault.</p>



<p>While the claims made by Matthew Martineau do seem a bit much, Bungie isn’t a stranger to copyright infringements. During the alpha of Marathon, the company was caught <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stealing assets</a> from artist ANTIREAL for several designs. After the controversy, the game was delayed and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet to be released</a>.&nbsp;</p>
