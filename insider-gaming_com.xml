<p>2K has a habit of rewarding its player base for simply playing. WWE 2K25 follows suit and provides regular Locker Codes to enter. If you do so, you get bonuses ranging from in-game currency to gameplay modifiers. Let’s see what March 2025 Codes we can dig up for WWE 2K25.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> lets you be whatever you want: The Face That Runs The Place, The American Nightmare, The Apex Predator, or any other gimmick-infringement-worthy monikers. It has as much content as a WWE game has ever had—plus the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wwe-2k25-ratings-roster-confirmed-so-far-every-superstar-legend-dlc-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest roster to date</a>!</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter which feature pulls you in providing it gets the job done. To ensure you don’t become a jobber though, keep up with the latest Locker Codes.</p>

<p><strong>Below are the current Active Locker Codes for WWE 2K25 in March 2025. We’ve also been kind enough to provide the exact characters you need to enter as well. </strong></p>



<p>Double-check what you’ve typed if you get an error, these systems can be finicky. If you get it right, you get a nice <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25</a> reward.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-wwe-2k25-locker-codes">How to Redeem WWE 2K25 Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>You must venture into the WWE 2K25 Settings screen to find the Locker Codes option. Here, input the codes and redeem your free content.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s some more precise instructions if you’re unsure of what to do:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up WWE 2K25.</li>



<li>Go to <strong>MyFaction</strong>.</li>



<li>Head to the <strong>Live </strong>option on the left when the game mode has loaded up.</li>



<li>Go to the bottom and press on <strong>Locker Codes</strong>.</li>



<li>Enter an Active Locker Code.</li>



<li>If entered correctly, a prompt appears confirming it’s worked and you receive the item!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-expired-locker-codes">WWE 2K25 Expired Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>There are no expired WWE 2K25 Locker Codes at the time of writing.</strong></p>



<p>The above statement is true for now, but the ever-changing nature of Locker Codes ensures it won’t be accurate forever. If you try an Active Code and it doesn’t work, there’s every chance 2K has decided to take it offline.</p>



<p>Remember to always be quick and stay on top of the newest Locker Codes!</p>

<p>2K’s Locker Codes scheme is a great incentive for keeping on top of WWE 2K social media. Goodies and boosts at no extra cost are always welcome. If you think we’ve missed any codes, be sure to post them below.</p>

<p>Atomfall fits <strong>very nicely </strong>into my wheelhouse. It’s (kind of) a post-apocalyptic, semi-open-world adventure set in the rolling hills of Cumbria, England, and it’s riddled with combat sequences, stealthy escapades, and dense mysteries. I recently played Atomfall for just over an hour, exploring more of what is my most anticipated game of 2025.</p>



<p>My exclusive session took place a few hours into the game, so I had plenty of toys to play with, and I quickly found myself plunged into a stunning world fraught with danger, intrigue, and opportunity.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-atomfall-is-coming">Atomfall is Coming</h2>



<p>Atomfall has been described as ‘Fallout in the United Kingdom’, and that’s not far off the mark. It has post-apocalyptic vibes, roaming robots, mutated creatures, and a solid mix of factions. The world is dangerous and expansive, the survival elements are front and centre, and the game boasts a branching narrative that can be approached from multiple angles.</p>



<p>It also has skill paths, it suits a range of play styles, and the core of the story is set around a nuclear disaster.</p>



<p>I’ve had my eye on Atomfall since it was revealed, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at Gamescom 2024</a>, I had the chance to play an earlier build – and fell in love. This extended preview that I recently enjoyed was nothing short of sumptuous, giving me the freedom to explore a large area of the game and uncover some key secrets – which I won’t spoil here.</p>



<h2 id="h-atomfall-my-impressions">Atomfall – My Impressions</h2>



<p>From what I’ve seen, Atomfall is turning into a sharpened survival title with more than a few innovations. The world looks brilliant, combat feels satisfying, and the gameplay focuses nicely on a balance between open-endedness and dedicated investigations. It’s a mystery game at heart, and players are tasked with ultimately solving what happened in the world to cause this disaster.</p>



<p>There are multiple endings, which can be discovered by aligning with or turning against factions, but it all boils down to getting access to the Windscale Power Plant and finding out what happened – and dealing with it accordingly. That’s the gist I’ve got from my experience with Atomfall, anyway.</p>



<p>Along the journey, players must contend with rampaging raiders, twisted tribes, and some fairly ethereal enemies. It’s not all aggressive, though – there are plenty of friendly, generous folks out there in Atomfall, should you be willing to risk the wilderness to find them.</p>



<p>I had nothing but a good time with Atomfall. I love the pacing of the game, which is fairly slow but can quickly turn on its head when you get into a fight. It’s designed for the player to prioritise stealth and subterfuge over bold-faced combat, which is a refreshing change from the games I’m used to playing of late.</p>



<p>In the hour that I played, I didn’t experience any issues, and I found myself genuinely interested in learning about the events of the world around me through notes, books, and other scraps I could pick up to inform me about the game’s lore. There’s a lot to catch up on, and I’m <strong>intrigued and eager </strong>to learn more.</p>



<p>The set pieces are nice, the animations are clean, and some of the more technical mechanics, like the need to manage your stamina and inventory, present a fair challenge without being too finicky. </p>



<p>I can’t wait for more.</p>



<p>Atomfall will be released on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC on March 27.</p>
