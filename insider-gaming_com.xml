<p>Calling all PlayStation Spartans in training, there’s a hydra-sized God of War Sons of Sparta Trophy List for you to climb, making the arduous trek to Olympus seem like child’s play.</p>



<p>A Metroidvania <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> title was a constant discussion in the rumor pipeline for a long time. The speculation suggested a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured God of War Metroidvania game would feature Kratos’ Brother</a>, and it does. </p>



<p>Now that Sons of Sparta is here, there’s no mystery left, other than its Trophy List. A mystery solved in this guide right now.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-trophies-amp-achievements">All God of War Sons of Sparta Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>

<p>God of War Sons of Sparta technically has two Trophy Lists: A listed one and a secret list of hidden trophies—obscured to prevent spoilers. In the main list, you need to find most (if not all) collectibles and upgrades, find lore, and battle strong enemies who would rather see Kratos and Deimos be unalived.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>God of War Sons of Sparta takes fans back further than they’ve ever been in the franchise’s long history. A true origin story, Sons of Sparta is a unique adventure, so let’s check if it’s available on platforms not named PS5, such as Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>The ‘uncs’ of this generation might shudder to hear that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> is over 20 years old now. There’s a lot of history, which means there’s plenty for the newer generation to revisit—hence the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Remake Trilogy</a> being a great learning lesson for many.</p>



<p>However, God of War Sons of Sparta is a new chapter telling the oldest tale.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-on-pc">Can You Play God of War Sons of Sparta on PC?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a time to be alive. Credit to Santa Monica Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite Sony’s good relationship with PC, God of War Sons of Sparta is not available to buy on any PC storefront.</strong></p>



<p>It seemed unthinkable that God of War could ever be playable anywhere other than on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation/" id="81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation </a>console. This changed when the 2018 reboot received a PC port. This was eventually followed up by Kratos and Atreus’s Ragnarok rumble slamming its way down on PC, too.</p>



<p>But for now, God of War Sons of Sparta remains on PC, with no PC port in sight. As history has taught us, never rule out the possibility of a Spartan journeying across foreign lands.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-on-xbox">Can You Play God of War Sons of Sparta on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Never has a God of War game been on Xbox, and this doesn’t change with Sons of Sparta.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox has started to dig into its catalog of classics as of late and hand iconic titles over to Sony. As yet, the PlayStation brand hasn’t been quite as generous. Xbox’s GOW (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gears-of-war/" id="55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War</a>) has made its first roadie run to PlayStation, but you’ll have to wait and see if Sony’s GOW will Spartan Change over to Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play God of War Sons of Sparta on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>You also can’t play God of War Sons of Sparta on Nintendo Switch or the Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>This was probably the least likely of the three, but it needed clarity. Sorry to disappoint overall. You asked, and IG answered. In this day and age of games going multi-platform and crossing to different sides, though unimaginable, never say never when it comes to God of War Sons of Sparta getting a PC, Xbox, or Switch port.</p>



<p>You’ll hear it here first if they do!</p>



<p>Are you disappointed by the news? Are the Sons of Sparta and Remake Trilogy announcements enough to want to make you finally upgrade to a PS5?

<p>God of War Sons of Sparta is one of 2026’s biggest and best shocks without question. A new GOW game is a shock, but if you want to know how much it is first, or if it’s on disc, this guide has all the answers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026 Sony</a> State of Play had no right to drop bombshell after bombshell. If you thought the news that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Remake Trilogy</a> is coming was big, a shadow-dropped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Sons of Sparta</a> was a Cronos-sized surprise</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-on-disc-physical-edition-explained">Can You Buy God of War Sons of Sparta On Disc? Physical Edition, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Like a fever dream. Credit to Santa Monica Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>God of War Sons of Sparta is currently a digital-only game, meaning you can buy it from the PlayStation Store on PS5 and nowhere else.</strong></p>



<p>This is likely a case of shocking everyone with an impromptu shadow drop first, accumulating millions in sales and copies sold, then giving the game a second lease of life later down the line with a physical copy.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-stars-again-during-february-2026-sony-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saros Stars Again During February 2026 Sony State of Play</a></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s hard to shadow drop a game on disc, making digital the only logical and viable solution. You can buy either God of War Sons of Sparta Standard Edition or Digital Deluxe Edition to complement your virtual game collection.</p>



<p>The latter comes with several benefits, including in-game items, a digital artbook, soundtrack, and PlayStation Avatar: A fine gift from the Gods of Olympus.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta">How Much is God of War Sons of Sparta?</h2>



<p><strong>God of War Sons of Sparta is $29.99 through the US PlayStation Store or £24.99 in the UK.</strong></p>



<p>For a brand-new God of War game with premium polish, this is a pretty decent price tag. Attaching the God of War brand to anything in 2026 could warrant a hefty price tag, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/santa-monica-studio/" id="87635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Santa Monica</a> and Sony have been quite generous here.</p>

</ul>



<p>Furthermore, if you want to stump up a bit more Gold, the Digital Deluxe Edition is $39.99 USD or £32.99.</p>
