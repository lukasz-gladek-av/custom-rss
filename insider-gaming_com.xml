<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth hits PC via Epic Games Store and Steam on January 23, 2025. Ahead of the release, we now know the recommended system requirements for the title. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC system requirements have been divided into three graphics presets: Minimum (30fps/1080p), Recommended (60fps/1080p) and Ultra (60fps/2160p).

<p>The Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls update is more star-studded than an all-star Avengers movie line-up, and we’ve got everything you need to know about the free-to-play shooter’s first major content injection.</p>



<p>Season 0 is coming to an end, sparking the beginning of a new chapter. Marvel Rivals has got off to a start so sharp even Blade would cower—joking, he would never do this. Rivals is the new kid on the block looking to stay and make its presence known until it matures into a wise Doctor Strange-esque figure. The first few weeks firmly established the hero shooter’s impressive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player count</a>, but Season 1 is the first real test.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls isn’t make or break, but it could shape the F2P title’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-release-date">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fantastic. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>January 10 is the start date for Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls</strong>, neatly coinciding with the end of Season 0.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals X</a> social media channel posted a <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1876297704340385803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message</a> on January 6 saying, “Season 1: Eternal Night Falls begins on Jan 10, 2025.”</p>



<p>If you’re familiar with any live-service shooter—Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Overwatch are common contemporaries—you’ll recognize the Battle Pass formula stays the same. Each pass has a counter showing you how many days are left. The final day allows the title to execute a seamless transition to the new season.</p>



<p>Some downtime or maintenance might happen, but otherwise, in this circumstance, we expect Marvel Rivals Season 0 to end with its timer on January 10, and Season 1 to get underway.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-start-time">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Start Time</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-arrives-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1’s Eternal Night Falls</a> commences at <strong>1 AM PST / 3 AM CT / 4 AM ET / 9 AM GMT</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, the verification comes straight from the same X status cited above. Check out the start time specific to you, make sure everything is updated and ready to go, grab some chips, and be heroic.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-heroes-in-marvel-rivals-eternal-night-falls">New Heroes in Marvel Rivals Eternal Night Falls</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-dropping-a-fantastic-4-trailer-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a> featuring <strong>Mr Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and The Thing</strong> are the confirmed names making a spectacular entrance in Season 1. Also, <strong>Dracula</strong> has been outed as another potential character to use in the shooter.</p>



<p>We know this for definite as the Season 1: Eternal Night Falls Official Trailer&nbsp;showed off the fab foursome. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Doom</a> teased for weeks now, you feel it’s all coming to a head in Eternal Night Falls. The reveal also strongly insinuates Dracula as a villain: “The Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science. <strong>Ignite the battle against Dracula with the Fantastic Four in Marvel Rivals!</strong>“</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if it’s just the Fantastic Four, or if Doctor Doom and Dracula are out for blood too.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-leaks">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Leaks</h2>



<p>Popular leaks suggest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultron</a> is another character set to join the fray, and a host of <strong>buffs &amp; nerfs</strong> to key heroes are coming.</p>



<h3 id="h-ultron">Ultron</h3>



<p>A bunch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals leaked character rumors</a> are in the wild, but Ultron could be sooner rather than later. Renowned leaker <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals – Leaks &amp; Info</a> thinks “Ultron releases Season 1 and he’s a Strategist.” Additionally, their <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1869869444455117276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1869869444455117276%7Ctwgr%5E1bb1dd9231dc5324b962d40043263ee880ea27c0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fmarvel-rivals%2Fmarvel-rivals-season-1-update-3022179%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leak</a> also has a full look at <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1869868212927524964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ultron’s abilities and difficulty rating</a> of <strong>Two Stars</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-buffs-amp-leaks">Buffs &amp; Leaks</h3>



<p>The Marvel Rivals – Leaks &amp; Info X page has also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1875777797676736764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">outed a ton of buffs and nerfs</a> which could impact Rivals’s meta.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at the characters expected to be reworked in Season 1—for better or worse.</p>



<h4 id="h-buffs">Buffs</h4>



<ul>
<li>Captain America</li>



<li>Cloak &amp; Dagger</li>



<li>Storm</li>

</ul>



<h4 id="h-nerfs">Nerfs</h4>



<ul>
<li>Hawkeye</li>

<p>Everything in this section is considered a leak until we hear more, so take the information with a pinch of salt for now.</p>

<p>Microsoft has announced that it is bringing Xbox Cloud Gaming to LG Smart TVs. The <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company says</a> that the deal will bring the feature to new LG Smart TVs later this year. </p>



<p>With Xbox Cloud Gaming, LG Smart TV owners who are Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will be able to stream games from the library within the gaming portal. In addition to games in the service, players will also be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-of-own-games-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream their select games</a> that they happen to own on the TVs.</p>



<p>“This gives players even more choice in how they enjoy their favorite games,” Corporate Vice President of Xbox Lori Wright said. “We’ll share more details on the Xbox Cloud Gaming experience with LG TV in the coming months.”</p>







<p>It’s currently unclear if any older models — those released in 2024 and sooner — will get access to the feature in the future.</p>

<p>As promised, Marvel Rivals released their Season 1 trailer today, January 6. We now know that Eternal Night Falls and the Fantastic 4 will arrive on January 10, 2025, at 1 AM PST.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1876297704340385803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> is, unfortunately, a cinematic one, so we do not get to see gameplay for the Fantastic 4. However, we do learn about the overarching plot. With the arrival of Season 1, darkness will cover New York, with Doctor Strange trapped in an Entangled Astral Plane. Dracula and Doctor Doom are making their moves, disrupting the moon’s orbit and releasing an army of vampires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as things start looking grim for the heroes, we see the new additions to the Marvel Rivals roster take charge and protect the work against the evil forces of Dracula. On January 10, we will see the likes of Mr Fantastic, Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, and The Thing join the battle in Marvel Rivals Season 1. If luck is on our side, we might receive a gameplay trailer showcasing these characters in action before they arrive later this week.</p>
