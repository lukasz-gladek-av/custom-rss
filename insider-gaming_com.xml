<p>Sonic Rumble, after multiple delays, will finally release in November on mobile devices and PC.</p>



<p>The self-proclaimed “ultimate arcade royale” game has been in the works for quite some time. Meant to capitalize on the Fall Guys trend, Sonic Rumble lets fans play as their favorite Sonic characters and duke it out with friends in speedy mini-games. Early tests went well, but the game saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-delayed-yet-again-by-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a few delays</a> this year and last. Now, it seems it has finally&nbsp;landed on a release window, as well as addressed some fan feedback.</p>

<p>Everyone is waiting patiently to see what Grand Theft Auto 6, Rockstar Games’ next open-world epic, will be priced at. For the longest time, the belief has been that the game will be priced at a whopping $100 for the standard edition, and the divisive potential price point has split the community down the middle.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, one of the creators of Saints Row spoke about Grand Theft Auto 6 and insisted that Take-Two and Rockstar Games can charge what they want for what might be the biggest game ever made.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-gta-6-push-the-pricing-boundaries">Will GTA 6 Push The Pricing Boundaries?</h2>



<p>If there’s one game that can ‘get away with’ a $100 price tag, it’s probably Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>That’s what Chris Stockman, Design Director on the first Saints Row game, insisted in a recent exclusive <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Esports Insider</a>. When asked about the <strong>potential </strong>for Grand Theft Auto 6 to emerge with a $100 price point (and likely more for a special edition), Stockman offered his two cents:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They’re the only ones that can get away with it.</p>



<p>I don’t think it’s a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that there’ll be a tremendous amount of backlash if&nbsp;everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope it’s $100. I think it deserves to be $100.</p>



<p>The scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stockman revealed that Grand Theft Auto 3, released in 2001, was so awe-inspiring that it opened his eyes to the possibilities of gaming. In his words, he believed it was ‘the future of games’. Five years later, he’d play a pivotal role in bringing Saints Row, a solid GTA competitor, to the market.</p>



<p>It was predicted in July that GTA 6 will make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-make-7-billion-two-months-analyst-predict/">an eye-watering <strong>$7 billion</strong></a><strong> </strong>within two months when it’s released in May 2026. These unprecedented predictions are based on the expectation that GTA 6 will be the fastest-selling game in history. It will easily surpass anything made to date.</p>
