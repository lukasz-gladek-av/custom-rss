<p>WWE 2K26 is just about two months away, and players will have some new matches to enjoy when they load up the game.</p>



<p>In addition to learning that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CM Punk will be the featured superstar</a> in the game’s Showcase mode, sources have told Insider Gaming what to expect from match types this year.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-new-wwe-2k26-match-types">What Are The New WWE 2K26 Match Types?</h2>



<p>In total, there are four new match types coming to this year’s game. One of which, Insider Gaming understands, has been in the works for quite some time.</p>



<p>The first new type is the I Quit match. The match hasn’t been seen since WWE 2K14, but is making a return after 13 years (the game launched in October 2013).</p>



<p>Another match returning after 13 years is the Inferno Match. In it, players can win by setting their opponent on fire. As you perform heavier moves, the flames will get larger. The last returning match is the 3 Stages of Hell. A match type that hasn’t been seen since the days of Smackdown vs. Raw, this match has players select three different stipulations for a 2-out-of-3 falls match.</p>







<p>As far as the new match coming, the Dumpster Match is making its debut in the WWE 2K series. While it’s unsure, at this point, exactly how it’ll work, it’s possible that it’ll be akin to the casket match. Exact details on the match are expected to come in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>One last bit regarding a match type that debuted last year, Intergender Matches are returning to the game. It’s also been said that they will even be a part of MyFACTION.</p>

<p>It seems that the worlds of Fortnite and Fall Guys are going to collide again as a new collaboration has been teased. </p>



<p>A lot of rumours around Fortnite collaborations have been surfacing lately, with names like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-office-x-fortnite-collaboration-could-be-coming-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-chainsaw-man-could-be-the-next-anime-collaboration-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainsaw Man</a>, and more popping up. However, these were just rumours; now we have a confirmed collaboration on the way, and it’s with a game that Fortnite has already collaborated with in the past. </p>







<h2 id="h-fall-guys-mention-a-ball-in-fortnite-collaboration-tease">Fall Guys Mention ‘A Ball’ in Fortnite Collaboration Tease</h2>



<p>The confirmation of the 2026 collaboration between Fortnite and Fall Guys comes via an <a href="https://x.com/FallGuysGame/status/2012164984047120647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) from the latter. The post states, “Beans caught practicing… something involving a ball. Might want to keep an eye on this, Fortnite.” Players have already started speculating what the “ball” could mean, with some guessing it’s basketball-related, while others think it could be related to other sports that involve a ball. </p>

<p>Fortnite and Fall Guys collaborated back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-fall-guys-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024</a>, through the ‘Where We Fallin’ event. In this special event, players had to find a Golden Bean Idol, which would then transform them into a Fall Guys bean and let them compete in an obstacle course in the sky. Players would earn Gold, Silver, or Bronze tier loot based on how quickly they complete the course.</p>



<p>The Fall Guys collaboration also made it to Creative, where players could not only create their own obstacle-course-filled islands but also explore 6 Islands published by Mediatonic. </p>







<p>In other news, check out the Fortnite update 39.20 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch notes</a>, which introduced the South Park collab to the game.
