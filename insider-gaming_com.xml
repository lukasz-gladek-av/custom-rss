<p>Nintendo has confirmed its next Nintendo Direct event will take place on Thursday, March 27 at 10am ET/7am PT. The announcement comes just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-direct-expected-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">days after rumors</a> began of an event happening this week.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://x.com/nintendoamerica/status/1904896350853960065?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a> announcing the event, this Nintendo Direct will feature “around 30 minutes of upcoming games for Nintendo Switch”. What it wont include, however, is anything regarding the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>The company is, instead, choosing to keep all of that under wraps until the new console’s Direct on April 2. </p>



<p>As far as what games to expect, there are questions regarding the state of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. According to a new claim, the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-wont-be-at-nintendo-switch-2-direct-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be present</a> at the Nintendo Switch 2 event. That has lead many to wonder if it will be shown at this current-generation Direct or kept off until a later date.</p>



<p>Recently, Insider Gaming learned of Nintendo’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans for game launches</a> around the Nintendo Switch 2. According to sources, the company is set to release its launch window games in three waves.</p>



<p>Thursday’s Nintendo Direct will air on the company’s YouTube channels and in the video player below.</p>

<p>The First Berserker Khazan follows the typical conventions of many contemporary Soulslikes. It has a plethora of intimidating bosses and looks to jump you at every opportunity. But let’s see if Khazan has one of the most basic controls—a jump button. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is happy for you to die over and over. This is why I would consider the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-the-first-berserker-khazan-have-difficulty-settings-easy-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty settings</a> if you haven’t already. It’s also happy to thrust you into multi-mob ambushes and test your patience. But it also has elements of traversal and exploration. </p>



<p>You’ll come across various paths and routes in The First Berserker Khazan. So much so it’ll leave you wondering if Khazan has a jump button, and we have the answer.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-jump-button-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">Is There a Jump Button in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We tried it, so you don’t have to. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan does not have a dedicated jump button, meaning all combat and platforming is conducted on the ground or through interactive prompts.</strong></p>



<p>If we use FromSoftware as an example, jumping has rarely been a feature of Souls games. The developer built the genre and opted to ignore a jump function for years. It’s only recently, with the likes of Sekiro and Elden Ring, that we’ve seen jumping become prevalent.</p>



<p><a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan</a>‘s first few hours do a great job of setting the scene. They introduce you to basic attacks, then eventually new weapons, and even the Javelin. But along the way, you see various items on ledges, and gaps that look like they are crossable.</p>



<p>You’d think a man of Khazan’s now-powerful and almost demonic stature should be able to perform a simple jump. Alas, the weary warrior cannot. He can bring down giant yeti bosses and wield Greatswords that it would take 3 or 4 men to lift, but he is incapable of leaving the ground.</p>



<hr>



<p>Do you think Soulslike games should include jumping more regularly in the gameplay? Or does it provide an extra layer of challenge you seek in the genre? Let us know your thoughts.</p>

<p>General Khazan’s story is a morbid and merciless one until his body is inhabited by an ethereal presence. In real life, a voice actor adds the depth and detail to Khazan’s character, so let’s see who gets the credit in The First Berserker Khazan.</p>



<p>The story goes that General Khazan is deemed a traitor guilty of treason. His body is relentlessly tortured and mutilated as a result, to the extent that his arms’ tendons are cut. He’s on the brink, until the Blade Phantom penetrates Khazan’s almost lifeless husk and imbues the character with otherworldly strength.  </p>



<p>Khazan engages with numerous characters throughout the story, and you hang onto his every word. We have one person to thank for being able to do this in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-plays-khazan-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">Who Plays Khazan in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You can feel the pain and anguish. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ben Starr is the voice actor for General Khazan in The First Berserker Khazan.</strong></p>



<p>Starr described the role of Khazan as “terrifyingly sexy” in an interview with Gamespot. He talked about how interesting the game looked and declared, “I really want this” when auditioning.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ben Starr REALLY Wanted This Voice Role | The First Berserker: Khazan" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ZKM_wIWKBk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-who-is-ben-starr-amp-what-has-he-been-in">Who is Ben Starr &amp; What Has he Been in?</h2>



<p>Ben Starr is now regarded as a breakout star in the games industry after a solid career mixing TV roles and voice-over work in games. His headline-making performance arrived in 2023 when Starr claimed the lead role of Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy 16.</p>



<p>He would reprise the role in subsequent FF16 DLCs—Echoes of the Fallen Rising Tide—as well as a guest star in Tekken 8.</p>



<p>Since then, Starr has lent his talents to the role of Prometheus in Hades 2. According to his <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5471977/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB page</a>, his schedule is (unsurprisingly) starting to fill up as the actor also has upcoming roles in various games: Warframe 1999, Date Everything, and Clair Obscur Expedition 33.</p>



<p>More hilariously, you might recognize the actor from the Balatro Friends of Jimbo Pack 3 trailer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Balatro - Friends of Jimbo (Pack 3) | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1r1LVgAGXlE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>If Starr can keep up this level of top-class performances and roles, he has the potential to join Nolan North, Troy Baker, Laura Bailey, and other peers in the upper echelons of voice-acting excellence!</p>



<hr>



<p>I think Ben does an excellent job in the role of Khazan and adds to the story. Do you agree? Is the actor deservedly earning his pips? Who else do you think Ben Starr would be perfect to play the role of in future games? Drop a comment and let us know.</p>

<p>Minecraft’s ‘A Minecraft Movie’ live event has arrived, and players can hang out with cast members like Steve, Garrett, Henry, Natalie and Dawn in the game today.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-a-minecraft-movie-live-event-start-and-end">When Does A Minecraft Movie Live Event Start and End?</h2>



<p>A Minecraft Movie live event was released on March 25 at 2:30 PM PT and will last until April 7 at 2 PM PT. Players can find the live event through the main menu of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. If it is not visible, you need to update to the latest version of the game. When you load up the limited-time event, will Steve be waiting to take you on your new adventure?&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-live-event-mini-games">A Minecraft Movie Live Event Mini-Games</h2>



<p>A Minecraft Movie live event features three mini-games where players interact with a different cast member for each new activity. Like the movie, players will fight against the Piglins and defend the Midport Village.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-mining-with-henry">Mining With Henry</h3>



<p>Henry will require the players’ help with some good old mining for resources to build defences and weapons. Players will meet Henry at the Mineshaft and must dig for resources while defending themselves from the pesky Pilgins.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-protecting-the-payloads-with-natalie-and-dawn">Protecting the Payloads with Natalie and Dawn</h3>



<p>In this Minecraft Movie live event, mini-game players will help Natalie and Dawn protect their resources from waves of Pilgins while escorting transport carriages.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-defending-the-walls-with-garrett-nbsp">Defending the Walls with Garrett&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Three huge Nether portals have opened at the outskirts of the village, and hordes of Pilgins are rushing in to wreak destruction. Garrett and the players must take these Pilgins head-on while showcasing their archery skills. However, you are not the only one shooting projectiles.&nbsp;</p>



<figure>
<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>
</figure>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-s-midport-village">A Minecraft Movie’s Midport Village</h2>



<p>The event also includes a new settlement, the Midport Village, which features shops, unique structures, adorable mobs, and hidden items. Thus, players have much more to do than fight in this Minecraft movie live event.&nbsp;Some of these items will be helpful when faced against the Pilgins. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-minecraft-yearn-cape">Minecraft Yearn Cape</h3>



<p>During the battle for Midport Village, players will receive six challenges, and after completing them, they will be rewarded with the Yearn cape. The Yearn cape features the “stunning art of a mineshaft inspired by Steve’s longing for the mines.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-minecraft-home-and-menace-capes">Minecraft Home and Menace Capes</h3>



<p>On the other hand, the Home and Menace Capes can be claimed by “watching a Minecraft creator for at least 3 minutes on Twitch and TikTok, respectively.” Players will receive a 5×5 redemption code for two capes, one inspired by Steve’s love for the mines and the other by Nether portal’s aura of danger.</p>



<p>All three capes will also be available in Bedrock and Java Edition, provided players use the same account on both editions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The First Berserker Khazan is a Soulslike, which means it’s difficult. Powerful mobs, even more deadly bosses, respawning enemies, and limited health. The genre isn’t for everyone, and despite the incredible aesthetic of Khazan, people want to know how difficult Neople’s Souslike is.</p>



<p>It took a long time for the Souls genre to win me over. I owned Demon’s Souls on day one, and hated it—now I love it. The unrelenting difficulty and intensity of boss fights aren’t for everyone.

<p><strong>Yes, The First Berserker Khazan has difficulty settings, allowing players to choose between Easy mode and Normal.</strong></p>



<p>After my first death to <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan</a>‘s first major boss fight, I was presented with the screenshot above (I’m not sure if it’s the same for everyone). You can see two different settings laid out with easy-to-read descriptions, which you can check out here:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Easy: </strong>“This difficulty is intended for players who are unfamiliar with action games.”</li>



<li><strong>Normal:</strong> “This difficulty is intended for players who are familiar with action games and enjoy the challenge and sense of achievement that the genre is known for.”</li>
</ul>



<p>For the longest time, Soulslikes have avoided optional difficulty settings like the plague. I don’t know if it’s a pride thing or if it’s the notion of toughness that comes with the territory of playing a Souls title. But companies are starting to ease up on the “it’s this or nothing” approach.</p>



<p>2024’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-record-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a> is a recent example of a Soulslike having distinct difficulty settings. Thankfully, The First Berserker Khazan has followed suit with its <strong>Easy </strong>and <strong>Normal </strong>options.</p>

<p><strong>Your The First Berserker Khazan difficulty decision rests on whether you want to enjoy the story or relish the challenge of combat.</strong></p>



<p>The First Berserker’s premise is fascinating, so it makes sense if you’re in it for Khazan’s journey. If constantly dying frustrates you and you want to progress the narrative, <strong>I recommend picking Easy</strong>.</p>



<p>However, if you enjoy combat, are happy to keep dying to bosses and learn their movesets in the hope of overcoming the imperious foe, <strong>stick with Normal</strong>. I play on Normal, I enjoy seeing the game over screen constantly, but I also live for the feeling of satisfaction when I finally beat a boss on my 153rd attempt.</p>
