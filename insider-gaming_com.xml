<p>Amazon’s Mass Effect series won’t be an adaptation of the original Commander Shepherd trilogy, confirms BioWare and EA. Even more so, it’ll be an original story set after Mass Effect 3.</p>



<p>The Mass Effect series has rightly become the premier narrative-driven game and a must-play for any gamer. Despite an okay third entry, the first two games are some of the best RPGs on the market, even after almost two decades. The last entry in the series, Mass Effect Andromeda, didn’t meet fan expectations, so any new project is welcome. Last year, Amazon announced that it would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-tv-series-officially-in-development-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be making a Mass Effect TV series</a> for Prime Video. Now, we know a bit more about the direction they are going, and it’s an interesting one.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>As part of N7 Day, celebrating the USS Normandy in the game, <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog was posted</a> on the official Mass Effect site. Series executive producer Mike Gamble spoke at length about the future of the series. While no updates on the new Mass Effect were shared outside of that it’s in production, the Amazon show was talked about. In the piece, he states,</p>



<p>“<strong>The writers room is going strong, and we’ve got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game</strong>,” Gamble says in the blog. “<strong>The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe’s timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won’t be a retread of Commander Shepard’s story – because after all … that’s YOUR story, isn’t it?</strong>”</p>



<p>As Gamble said, the show is <strong>now in the writing stage</strong> and will, surprisingly, <strong>not adapt the original trilogy</strong>. This means that, more than likely, Commander Shepard and the Normandy crew will not be in attendance. However, despite being an original story, it will take place <strong>after the events of Mass Effect 3</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to what ending may be canon is unknown, but it’ll be interesting to see how it goes. Mass Effect is a space opera, so it does translate well into a show akin to Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek. As a fan, I’m excited to see what’s in store, especially since it’ll be a brand new adventure.</p>



<p>What do you think about Amazon’s Mass Effect not adapting the original trilogy? Would you’ve liked to see Commander Shepard and crew in live-action? Do you think the show will work with an original story?
