<p>Helldivers 2 has sold more copies on Xbox than PlayStation within the first six days of launch. </p>



<p>The Xbox launch has been a great plan for Helldivers 2, contributing to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-player-numbers-surge-on-steam-after-xbox-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam player count</a> in recent days as well. Moreover, Arrowhead has also released the collaboration with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-collab-with-halo-odst-lands-with-xbox-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HALO ODST</a> alongside this launch, along with all the content the game has released since launch may have helped push more players over the edge. Now, new sales details for Helldivers 2 on Xbox have been revealed.</p>

<p>Season 4 of Marvel Rivals is rapidly approaching, bringing major changes and additions to the game, and we’ve got all the early details for the patch notes.</p>



<p>As is customary with a new season in Marvel Rivals, a new playable character, new maps, and new Team-Ups are being added, while there was also the big announcement that the game will finally be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-trailer-confirms-ps4-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on PlayStation 4</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve split the early patch notes for Marvel Rivals Season 4 into specific sections below to make it easier to navigate.</p>



<h3 id="h-angela-new-playable-character">Angela – New Playable Character</h3>



<p>Angela, Asgard’s Assassin and sister of Thor, is arriving at the start of Season 4 as the latest playable character, filling the Vanguard role.</p>



<p>Equipped with Ichors, a type of living fluid that can be used to create various weapons. A razor-sharp spear is used to dive on enemies, while a shield is used to block incoming damage. Finally, the Ichors can be transformed into dual axes to dish out significant damage.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kidas-ceo-says-roblox-age-verification-measures-are-%E2%80%9Ceasily-bypassed%E2%80%9D-and-are-%E2%80%9Cnot-the-full-answer%E2%80%9D.1288464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite The Roblox Corporation’s best intentions to protect children with new age verification tools, Kidas CEO Ron Kerbs believes it’s not enough, and has told Insider Gaming that Roblox needs to incorporate “Real-time behavioral monitoring.”</p>



<p>A new wave of age verification has emerged in the last 12 months, with businesses worldwide beginning to clamp down on who can access specific content. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a> is reportedly getting age verification, for example, and Roblox has added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-adding-video-selfie-security-measures-to-protect-teenagers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">security measures to protect teenagers</a> in 2025.</p>



<p>There have been concerns that while this is a good start, a lot more needs to be done.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-requires-real-time-behavioral-monitoring-says-kidas-ceo">Roblox Requires Real-Time Behavioral Monitoring, Says Kidas CEO</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No Roblox game or community is truly safe! Image credit: Roblox Corporation</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ron Kerbs is the CEO of <a href="https://getkidas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kidas</a>: A “Cybersecurity company committed to enhancing the safety of young gamers in the digital realm. Employing advanced AI technology, ProtectMe monitors and mitigates cyberbullying, online predators, and other digital threats in real time.</p>



<p>The company’s goal is simple: Protect kids and young gamers from online predators and harassment so they can enjoy video games with safety and peace of mind.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has obtained an exclusive quote from Ron discussing Roblox’s recent age verification measures:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Roblox’s new age verification effort is a step in the right direction—but it’s not the full answer. While technology like facial analysis and ID scans can help restrict access to mature content, these tools are still easily bypassed and don’t address the most pressing safety issues kids face online every day.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kidas has seen evidence of how predators operate and take advantage of younger children, and is doing all it can to increase security measures:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that no verification method—AI or otherwise—can guarantee that the person behind a screen is who they claim to be. We’ve seen kids be groomed and scammed by individuals who pass verification checks but still engage in harmful behavior. What’s needed isn’t just more gates, but better guardrails. Roblox and platforms like it must invest in real-time behavioral monitoring, not just one-time identity checks. Protecting kids isn’t about proving you’re over 13—it’s about detecting when a conversation is going dangerously off track and stepping in fast. We applaud the intention. Now let’s raise the standard for execution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We definitely need to see more action like this and companies paying greater attention to child safety. Kidas says it’s protected over 400,000 gamers and counting and issues an alarming statistic on its home page: “3&nbsp;out of&nbsp;5 U.S. kids who play online games will be scammed or harassed before age 18.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming wants to know what <em>you </em>think. Is enough being done to protect young gamers who just want to experience the joys and thrills we all had growing up playing games without the fear of strangers and predators on the internet? Please let us know.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-price-rewards/</link>

<p>Helldivers 2 shows no signs of slowing down, with releases coming thick and fast, with the new Dust Devils Premium Warbond now available—but is it worth it?</p>



<p>After the long-awaited Xbox launch last week, which coincided with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a>, a fresh update has brought a wealth of new challenges. Whether you’re taking down the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-hive-lord-hp-best-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hive Lord</a>, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-destroy-spore-lung/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destroying Spore Lungs</a>, new gear will not go amiss.</p>



<p>We’ve got all the details on the Dust Devils Premium Warbond here, including a breakdown of what’s included and whether it’s worth spending your hard-earned Super Credits on.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-dust-devils-premium-warbond">How Much is The Dust Devils Premium Warbond?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of gear. Image via Arrowhead Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2 costs 1,000 Super Credits, the standard price of Warbonds in the game.</strong></p>



<p>This translates to $9.99 in real-world money, though you don’t need to spend at all, as Super Credits can be farmed in the game. You can also use a Warbond Token to unlock the full pass.</p>



<p>As usual with Warbonds in Helldivers 2, there is no limited-time period to make the purchase, and it will remain available permanently, so you can purchase it whenever you like.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-helldivers-2-dust-devils-premium-warbond">All Rewards in the Helldivers 2 Dust Devils Premium Warbond</h2>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Warbond in Helldivers 2 has a total of 22 rewards to claim, including two armor sets, three Stratagems, and a new assault rifle.</strong></p>



<p>Rewards in the Dust Devils Warbond are geared around the latest content drop, introducing Hive planets, providing effective firepower to take down the threats they pose, along with accompanying cosmetics.</p>



<p>We’ve got a full breakdown of every reward in the Dust Devils Warbond below, including the Medals required to unlock them.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Reward</th><th data-align="center">Type</th><th data-align="center">Medals Required</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Rightful Occupier</td><td data-align="center">Cape</td><td data-align="center">8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-42 Federation’s Blade</td><td data-align="center">Helmet</td><td data-align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">7</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Hellpod</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-42 Federation’s Blade</td><td data-align="center">Armor</td><td data-align="center">45</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rightful Occupier</td><td data-align="center">Player Card</td><td data-align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AR-2 Coyote</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">35</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Speargun</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">85</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-191 Scorpion</td><td data-align="center">Helmet</td><td data-align="center">45</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-191 Scorpion</td><td data-align="center">Armor</td><td data-align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Windswept Wayfarer</td><td data-align="center">Player Card</td><td data-align="center">7</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Windswept Wayfarer</td><td data-align="center">Cape</td><td data-align="center">25</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Shuttle</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Expendable Napalm</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">85</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Solo Silo</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">110</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Raider’s Cheer</td><td data-align="center">Emoted</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Exosuit</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">32</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Vehicle</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">G-7 Pineapple</td><td data-align="center">Throwable</td><td data-align="center">65</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Burier of Heads</td><td data-align="center">title</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-the-dust-devils-premium-warbond-worth-it">Is the Dust Devils Premium Warbond Worth it?</h2>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2 is definitely worth purchasing for additional firepower to take down the Hive Worlds introduced in the Into The Unjust update.</strong></p>



<p>With missions on the Hive planets taking you deep underground, where your Stratagems are ineffective unless you manage to find an opening in the tunnel system, the weapons included in the Dust Devils Warbond are the perfect tools for the job.</p>



<p>The AR-2 Coyote assault rifle is ideal for mowing through the Terminid hordes, with the incendiary ammunition packing a punch, and the G-7 Pineapple cluster frag grenade is similarly effective for taking out large groups of enemies.</p>



<p>Both pale in comparison with the EAT-700 Expendable Napalm, a single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs, and the MS-11 Solo Silo, which calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote—though the latter may require being outside of the cave system.</p>



<p>The Dust Devils Warbond is a worthwhile addition for any Helldiver, though it’s particularly useful for any new Xbox players who perhaps don’t have an arsenal as expansive as their PC and PlayStation counterparts just yet.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers have confirmed plans to introduce Placement Matches to the ranked mode for new seasons, though there is no details on exactly when it will release.</p>



<p>Since its launch in December 2024, Marvel Rivals’ ranked set-up has attracted criticism from players, particularly at the start of new seasons when things reset, as higher-ranked players drop several tiers.</p>



<p>This has made the first few days of a new season in ranked incredibly unbalanced, a frustrating experience for players, but devs have been listening to feedback and announced plans to bring placement matches into the fray.</p>

<p>Announced at the end of the latest <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1963300965437538535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dev Vision video</a> ahead of the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 on September 12</a>, Marvel Rivals devs acknowledged the discussions in the community on the back of the recently released details explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how the matchmaking system works</a>.</p>



<p>It was confirmed that the team is “already working on implementing Placement Matches,” but, as it is a “complex feature with a lot of moving parts,” the team needs “more time for development and thorough testing.”</p>



<p>While Placement Matches won’t be ready for the drop of Season 4, the team is “pushing forward as quickly as we can.”</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Placement Matches will be a major feature that drops as part of Season 5, which is expected to launch in early November. Exact details of the Season 5 launch are not known, though the start date should be revealed by the Season 4 Battle Pass.</p>
