<p>The full roadmap for Season One of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been revealed by Activision.</p>



<p>Launching on November 14th, Black Ops 7 is the latest installment in the iconic FPS series. Putting an emphasis on Multiplayer, the game is set to hone in on what fans want when it comes to the series. Furthermore, the series returns to the futuristic settings of games past, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-not-have-jetpacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though without jetpacks</a>. With the release fast approaching, the team has shown off what players can expect at launch, as well as Season One.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The biggest year in Black Ops history starts with BO7 launch, and it's just the beginning. Season 01 will be our most massive season yet üí•</p><p>üöÄ 18 MP maps and 2 Zombies experiences on Nov. 14<br>‚ò¢Ô∏è Nuketown 2025 on Nov. 20 <br>üî• 7 Multiplayer maps in Season 01 <br>üßü 3 Zombies maps in‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/qeau4DVBiB">pic.twitter.com/qeau4DVBiB</a></p></div>‚Äî Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1981422889497690225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1981422889497690225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Twitter/X post</a>, Activision revealed the content of the launch and Season One of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. At release, the game will have 18 Multiplayer maps and two Zombie maps for players to enjoy. A week later, the iconic Nuketown will make a return, nicknamed Nuketown 2025. After that, six maps, including Meltdown and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-showcase-tokyo-game-show-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previously revealed Yakei</a>, will come out. More maps are expected to be revealed at a later date. Furthermore, three new Zombies maps will be included in Season One, including two Survival ones.</p>



<p>Given that the game will launch on Xbox Game Pass, like Black Ops 6, it‚Äôs sure to be quite the hit. However, the decision may hurt sales, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sales-microsoft-cost-millions-game-pass-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it did last year</a> for Microsoft/Xbox. Even still, with the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, it‚Äôs clear the genre still has some juice in it. While the open beta didn‚Äôt go too well in terms of numbers, Black Ops 7 remains a heavily anticipated title for many. Fortunately, it seems it‚Äôll be supported for long after November 14th, should it all go well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-datamine-reveals-battle-royale-is-to-release-on-october-28th.1333198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A datamine for Battlefield 6 has revealed that the highly anticipated Battle Royale is currently set to launch on October 28th, 2025. The strings of code which have been posted online refer to a mode codename ‚ÄúGranite‚Äù, which Insidier Gaming can verify is the Battle Royale gamemode.</p>



<p>First leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>, who revealed that the mode will have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 28th release date</a>, he took to X (formerly Twitter) today to reveal that code within the game files also now confirms his past reports.</p>



<p>In a follow-up tweet, he posted the strings of code revealing that Granite, the codename for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale, is currently set to go live during the Season 1 release on October 28.</p>



<p>Of course, things are indeed subject to change, but ModernWarzone‚Äôs confidence, especially over the last couple of days around the date, tells us that he‚Äôs almost certainly not wrong. While Insider Gaming isn‚Äôt currently able to independently verify the news, it‚Äôs certainly looking like a shadowdrop of the mode is on the horizon.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play">Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Free to Play</h2>



<p>Insider Gaming first exclusively reported on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Battle Royale</a> in February 2024, which we reported at the time that it was planned to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play experience</a>. At the time of writing, Battlefield Studios has only confirmed the game mode‚Äôs existence and hasn‚Äôt said when it will release or whether it will be free-to-play.</p>



<p>That said, we likely don‚Äôt have long to wait before hearing more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 76 PS5 and Xbox Series Upgrade Coming in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-upgrade-coming-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has revealed that Fallout 76 is <strong>finally </strong>getting a native version of the game in 2026, with a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X &amp; S version being released in a few months. This announcement came amid the news that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-getting-anniversary-edition-november/">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a> <strong>and </strong>a Switch 2 version are also incoming.</p>



<p>Not much information was given away, but this is something that Fallout 76 fans have been wanting for a very long time. What‚Äôs next on the list is crossplay, but we doubt that it‚Äôll ever come.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-76-current-gen-upgrade-coming">Fallout 76 Current-Gen Upgrade Coming</h2>



<p>During the Fallout Day broadcast, Bill LaCoste, lead producer, revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Early next year, a native version of Fallout 76 will be coming to Xbox Series S and X and PlayStation 5. This update will take full advantage of their hardware capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fallout 76 is the most up-to-date Fallout game on the market, taking the form of an open-world MMORPG that took the rulebook tied to Fallout and threw it clean out the window in 2018. It has since become the cash cow of the series, and Bethesda Game Studios has kept the game pumped full of updates.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs easy to assume what will arrive with the current-gen upgrade of Fallout 76, of course.</p>



<p>We can envision higher base resolutions, a higher frame rate (60 FPS upgrade, most likely), cleaner textures, and faster loading times. That‚Äôs usually the run-of-the-mill stuff associated with current-gen upgrades, and Fallout 76 on <strong>consoles </strong>has long needed them.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the current-gen version of Fallout 76 being released? Let me know what you‚Äôre thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>During the Fallout Day Showcase, Bethesda Game Studios unveiled a <strong>new trailer for Fallout 4</strong>, ten years after it hit the market in 2015. The trailer, which was kind of better than anything published before the game came out, revealed that an ANNIVERSARY EDITION is coming to the market on November 10.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition of Fallout 4 will come with all expansions, plus Creations is being added to the game, bringing a whole host of curated expansions, mods, and other upgrades and changes.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced-by-bethesda">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Announced by Bethesda</h2>



<p>Today‚Äôs Fallout Day bonanza included a stunning announcement: Fallout 4 is coming back with an Anniversary Edition. It has been ten years since the best-selling title dropped, and it‚Äôs still one of the most popular Fallout experiences ever made.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition comes with all DLCs and expansions released for the game in the years that followed the launch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>



<li>Far Harbor</li>



<li>Automatron</li>



<li>Nuka-World</li>



<li>Contraptions Workshop</li>



<li>Wasteland Workshop</li>



<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>
</ul>



<p>More than 150 Creations will be added to Fallout 4 via the Anniversary Edition, and Bethesda also revealed that the game will feature <strong>unreleased items</strong>, just to keep things feeling fresh. These items will be discoverable through a new menu, added in an upcoming update to Fallout 4 ‚Äì you won‚Äôt need the Anniversary Edition to obtain this content.</p>
