<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was released little more than a month ago, storming up the charts and becoming known far and wide as a contender for many Game of the Year awards. It stunned players with its depth, visual splendour, and intense realism, and with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense roadmap ahead</a>, the game has plenty of life left in its medieval lungs.</p>



<p>Since Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 hit the market, one of the gameâ€™s most prolific actors, Luke â€˜LordHansCaponâ€™ Dale, has positively exploded. He has become a superstar streamer in a matter of weeks, pulling in and retaining an audience and securing solid accolades in no time at all.</p>

<p>Luke Dale portrays Hans Capon in the Kingdom Come universe, and heâ€™s front and centre as the game kicks off, with many of the second titleâ€™s most pivotal moments revolving around his existence. In the first game, which dropped back in 2018, he was someone to be hated, but in KCD2, heâ€™s a lovable rogue who youâ€™ll go to great lengths to keep safe.</p>



<p>In the days that followed the launch of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on February 4, Dale kickstarted a streaming campaign that saw his popularity levels skyrocket across Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>In January 2025, the talented actor streamed the first Kingdom Come title in anticipation of the follow-up, netting a peak viewer count of around 350 viewers. Little more than two weeks later, he was picking up peak figures of 20,000 viewers. In one post on social media, Dale revealed he was in the 0.01% of streamers on Twitch by numbers alone.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Dang. Iâ€™m in the top 0.01% of streamers in the world ðŸ«¶ 

Shall we get to number 1? </span><a href="https://twitter.com/KaiCenat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KaiCenat</a><span> Iâ€™m coming for you bro ðŸ‘Š </span></p></article></div>







<p>It didnâ€™t end there, though.</p>



<p>Luke Dale, who went so far as to get a Kingdom Come tattoo while live, went from 32,000 subscribers on YouTube when the game dropped to 102,000 subscribers at the time of writing. He racked up 15,000 followers on Twitch in around two weeks and managed to secure a Twitch Partner spot after streaming Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 just <strong>eight times</strong>.</p>



<p>Before 2025, heâ€™d streamed just three times, <a href="https://streamscharts.com/channels/lordhanscapon/streams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to StreamsCharts</a>. Thatâ€™s one hell of a hot streak.</p>



<p>It helps that Dale is genuinely a nice guy with a penchant for performing, and his role as Hans Capon in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is fantastic and bursting with clippable, quality sequences.</p>



<p>If you want to follow Luke Daleâ€™s latest streams, you can find him on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LordHansCapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lordhanscapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a>.</p>
