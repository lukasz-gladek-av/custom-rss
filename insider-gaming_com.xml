<p>Marvel Rivals Season 2 is fast approaching and set to introduce two new heroes, a new map, and a slew of changes to both its features list and gameplay.

<p>Prepare your lines and gather your bait; it’s time to test the upcoming Fallout 76 fishing update on the Public Test Server. Those using the PTS will now be able to head to The Mire and find Fisherman’s Rest, kickstarting the ‘Casting Off’ questline that teaches players the wonders of fishing in Fallout 76.</p>



<p>Getting your first fishing rod is only the start – there’s a whole world out there in this long-awaited update, including legendary fish, a range of bait and upgrades, and even collectable Axolotls. Bethesda Game Studios has gone so deep on the Fallout 76 fishing update that even the world’s weather can impact your chances of catching the best fish.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-casting-out">Casting Out</h2>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios is bringing fishing to Fallout 76 as a full-fledged micro ecosystem. It introduces new daily quests, collectables, and activities, adding another layer of entertainment to the post-apocalyptic endgame.</p>



<p>Players will be required to buy, loot, or unlock bait, which ranges from Common to Superb, then head to the various bodies of water around Appalachia to cast out and (hopefully) catch some great fish.</p>



<p>Naturally, this update unlocks new cooking recipes, as you can fish for the table as well as fish for prize catches that you can display around your C.A.M.P.</p>



<p><a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/FJGd9MX5Mkrg45M3eAoIk/inside-the-vault-fishing-in-appalachia-public-test-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a release</a>, Bethesda Game Studios revealed that common fish can be found all over the world, but each region will have specific fish locked to that zone. There are also variants scattered around in each region, such as ‘glowing’ fish.</p>



<p>Oh, and there are a dozen unique Axolotls to capture while fishing in the irradiated waters of West Virginia.</p>



<p>Those with a penchant for fishing will feel right at home with this Fallout 76 update. Your rod isn’t just practical but cosmetic, and with that in mind, you can tweak your rod style, bobbers, reels, and skins. The team has advised that some fish will be ‘near impossible’ to catch without upgrading your rod – so get grinding!</p>
