<p>A new season is deploying in Marvel Rivals with the launch of Season 5, which naturally comes alongside a fresh balance patch with buffs and nerfs, and we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>Season 5 in Marvel Rivals features all the tweaks we’ve come to expect with the seasonal transition of the title, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-team-up-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shake-up to Team-Up Abilities</a>, and tweaks are made to specific heroes to ensure they all remain viable.</p>



<p>For a breakdown of all the buffs and nerfs present in Marvel Rivals for the Season 5 launch, we’ve got all the information you need.</p>

<p><strong>Season 5 sees potentially the biggest balance changes of all, and remarkably, there’s not a single nerf at launch. Instead, a host of characters are receiving buffs.</strong></p>



<p>For Vanguards, stand-out changes include Peni Parker’s Cuber-Webs now providing the same Healing Over Time and Movement Boost to ally players as she receives, while Magneto’s Metal Bulwark and Iron Bulwark have had their cooldowns seperated, although the shield value is reduced from 250 to 200.</p>



<p>In the DPS scene, Mister Fantastic’s Bonus Health has been tweaked to provide an addition of 350 Maximum Health and a one-time heal of 350, which is removed upon exiting his inflated state, while Squirrel Girl’s Burst Acorn damage has been increased to 110 from 100.</p>



<p>Finally, two Strategists have seen their base health increased, with Cloak &amp; Dagger and Loki receiving the boost, while Invisible Woman can now deploy a shield in front of her.</p>



<p>Here’s a full list of all the characters affected with buffs and nerfs in Season 5.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is set to switch over into a new season with the launch of Season 5, with two new characters joining the battlefield, and the roadmap for the season has revealed when Rogue will be playable.</p>



<p>Rogue is one of two new additions to the Marvel Rivals character roster in Season 5, alongside her partner, Gambit. However, while Remy LeBeau will be available from the start of Season 5 on November 14, players will have to wait a little bit longer for Rogue’s arrival.</p>







<h2 id="h-rogue-joins-marvel-rivals-on-december-12">Rogue Joins Marvel Rivals on December 12</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to come. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>NetEase has shared an <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1988683430242943375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official roadmap</a> for the content coming in Season 5, which reveals the release date for several new costumes, the start of the Anniversary Event, where players can earn up to $25 worth of currency for free, and the launch of the 18-vs-18 Conquest Annihilation game mode.</p>



<p>However, the biggest news of all confirms just how long the first half of the season will last, as it’s revealed that Season 5.5 will begin on December 12.</p>



<p>We don’t yet know all of the content that will be launching at the start of Season 5.5, but we do know the mid-point in the season will mark the arrival of Rogue.</p>







<p>Given the time of the year Season 5.5 launches, it’s expected that a Holiday Event to cover Christmas and the New Year will be on the cards at some point, while Season 6 will launch in January 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Several’ Tier 1 Counter-Strike 2 Events Won’t Happen in 2026, It’s Confirmed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/several-tier-1-counter-strike-events-not-happening/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98several%E2%80%99-tier-1-counter-strike-2-events-won%E2%80%99t-happen-in-2026-it%E2%80%99s-confirmed.1352164/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent post on social media, the CEO of PGL, Silviu Stroie, confirmed that ‘several’ high-tier Counter-Strike 2 tournaments won’t take place in 2026. This is because an announcement pathway wasn’t followed, which unfortunately violates Valve’s tournament operation requirements.</p>



<p>The post on social media confirmed that <strong>none of the Starladder events </strong>in 2026 will take place, and two of the three Fissure events in 2026 have also been struck from the schedule.</p>







<h2 id="h-cs2-events-slashed-from-the-schedule">CS2 Events Slashed From the Schedule</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/ssilviu/status/1988490449951015313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The post</a> from Silviu Stroie, CEO of PGL, reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Several CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 won’t take place, as they missed the deadline for announcing the additional details. None of the Starladder CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 will take place. The same applies to two of the three Fissure CS2 Tier 1 events in 2026 (Playground 4 and Playground 5). So far, there has been no Starladder announcement for any Tier 1 event in 2027.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In one of the most important comments under the post, a user wrote, ‘How can this happen? Like, if you know that this is a requirement, there’s like a 0% chance of missing the deadline if it’s your main business.’</p>



<p>Valve’s tournament operation requirements demand that organizers provide ‘additional information’ within a certain timeframe after an initial announcement. That deadline was missed by some, and therefore, these tournaments will not be allowed to go ahead.</p>







<p>Neither of the organizers impacted by this confirmation have provided a statement to say what’s happening, but Stroie also mentioned that no Starladder events have been announced (at Tier 1) going into 2027, which is cryptic to say the least. This was later refuted by Starladder, as the company revealed that ‘the next Tier-1 Starladder event comes in October 2027’.</p>



<p>Are you bothered about the loss of these events, or do you feel that there are already enough Counter-Strike tournaments lined up? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>This weekend, Escape from Tarkov hits a 1.0 state after a <strong>decade </strong>in testing and development. It’s a monumental time to be a fan of the spearhead extraction shooter, and the release comes as the genre is experiencing something of a boom, spurred onwards by the recent arrival of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games confirmed that Escape from Tarkov will have a new Twitch Drops campaign that’s kicking off to celebrate the launch of the game on November 15, this coming Saturday.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-twitch-drops-coming">Tarkov Twitch Drops Coming</h2>



<p>From November 15 to December 6, Tarkov fans will be able to watch their favorite streamers exploring the new 1.0 update that brings the game into an entirely new world. The drops will reward players with different reward crates, containing some loot that could be considered highly exclusive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hideout Targets</li>



<li>Tarko Figuring</li>



<li>Nikita’s PMC Voice</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a split between the rewards coming to the Escape from Tarkov Twitch Drops campaign, and that’s between <strong>free </strong>and <strong>paid-for </strong>rewards. If you dish out subscriptions during the event, you’ll unlock even more content in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 Subs – Cap, M-2 Brown &amp; Secure Container</li>



<li>3 Subs – PMC Dogtag (Twitch)</li>



<li>1 Sub – Hideout Decor</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p><a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was stressed</a> that the split is timed differently, too. The free drops run until November 28, while the paid rewards will stay live until December 6.</p>







<p>More content will be added, per a graphic published by Battlestate Games, so expect plenty of rewards to flow going into Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release – provided you watch those streaming the game. The 1.0 update is highly anticipated and will bring a new map, story, and many other quality-of-life improvements and upgrades.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has a new supersized update inbound called North Line, and it introduces a new map, new ARC enemies, weapons, quests, and more. It will be made accessible via a community event that requires all users to contribute to a project to bust open a tunnel leading to the new map, Stella Montis.</p>



<p>Many are wondering when the North Line update will be released. It’s coming out today, but the release time for the update isn’t clear. Read on to learn what we know about the ARC Raiders North Line update release times.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-north-line-releasing-on-arc-raiders">When is North Line Releasing on ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The North Line update for ARC Raiders will be released today, November 13, at 09:30 AM GMT / 04:30 AM ET / 01:30 AM PT.</strong> This timing convention is to allow for a unified launch of the update across all platforms and territories.</p>



<p>Fans of the post-apocalyptic extraction shooter will be able to enjoy some of the trappings of the North Line update when it drops, but the bulk of it will come after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-arc-raiders-map-open-breaking-new-ground/">the Breaking New Ground event</a> has been completed.</p>



<p>This is where players must contribute Metal Parts, Fabric, Chemicals, Plastic Parts, and Rubber Parts to the centralized project to open up the tunnels to Stella Montis. Here, players will be able to explore a new path in ‘Staking Our Claim’, digging deep into Stella Montis, facing new ARC threats, and preparing for the <strong>next </strong>major ARC Raiders update – Cold Snap.</p>







<p>There’s a busy roadmap ahead, and Embark Studios has promised to support ARC Raiders for the next decade, so expect plenty more maps, modes, weapons, and more to be added in the coming months to make way for that lifecycle.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov is finally being ‘released’ this week after a decade in alpha and beta stages. It brings an end to years of development that have culminated in Escape from Tarkov being the most popular extraction shooter ever made. It’s a paradigm shift of a title that’s evolving into a 1.0 state this coming Saturday.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, suggested that a drastic balancing mechanic might be put into play for Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform.</p>







<h2 id="h-they-might-wipe-the-pve-flea-market">They Might Wipe the PvE Flea Market</h2>



<p>Nikita suggested in a recent interview with Pestily that the team at Battlestate Games might wipe the Flea Market <strong>specifically on the PvE platform </strong>when 1.0 drops. Pestily addressed the Flea Market being ‘filled with stuff’ that PvE players have collected over many months, impacting the mode’s economy.</p>



<p>Nikita said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We will see. Maybe we will wipe the Flea Market, for example.</p>



<p>Nobody said that we can’t do that. We can wipe the Flea Market, and nobody will say anything to us, because the Flea Market is just a sub-system that we can wipe.</p>

<p><br>Escape from Tarkov players focused on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-players-need-to-wipe-for-full-release-quest/">PvE will need to wipe their accounts</a> to access the new story being introduced with 1.0. This story will finally allow players to <strong>escape from Tarkov</strong>, presenting them with a branching campaign with multiple endings.</p>



<p>This is bad news for the PvE players (like myself) who have spent the last year racking up a phenomenal stash and building the strongest character they’ve ever made, simply because PvE <strong>doesn’t automatically wipe</strong>.</p>







<p>The economy that has been created because of that is a little skewed, so pushing for a reset of this kind might be a neat balancing tactic.</p>
