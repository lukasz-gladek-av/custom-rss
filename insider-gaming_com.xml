<p>Graham Greene lit up screens throughout a glittering 45-year career. The acclaimed actor did it all and has sadly passed away at the age of 73. Many gamers will fondly recognize and remember him for his incredible portrayal of Rains Fall in Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>



<p>My first memory of Graham Greene was his role as Detective Joe Lambert in Die Hard with a Vengeance. He plays a valiant cop who ultimately tries his best to save kids he believes are in mortal danger. This is one of countless roles Graham accrued over his 40-plus-year career before his untimely passing on September 1.</p>



<p>Despite a resume anyone would snatch up in a heartbeat, Graham only had one video game role—Rains Fall in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-could-launch-on-switch-2-this-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve played <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RDR2</a>, you know how important Rains Fall is to the story. He does his best to rein in his son—Eagle Flies—and advocates peace wherever possible.</p>



<p>Graham absolutely nails the role perfectly. It’s a wonder that this was his lone video game opportunity when you think about it. Technically, it wasn’t the only gaming project the actor was attached to.</p>



<p>In 2023, Graham played Marlon in HBO’s epic adaptation of Naughty Dog’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-receives-fewer-emmy-nominations-than-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> for one episode. He was also in 2008’s Turok: Son of Stone—but that reference is a bit more out there.</p>



<p>The actor graced TV shows, movies, and one of the greatest video games of all time, and it’s his role as Rains Fall that further cemented his legacy in the memories of millions of gamers.</p>



<p>Do you have a favorite Graham Greene role over the decades? Let me know, and also let us know if this is giving you the edge to go back and play Red Dead Redemption 2 for the tenth time.</p>

<p>The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test was the game’s first proper hands-on opportunity. Don’t cry because it’s over, smile that it happened. Or if that doesn’t work, you can always enjoy the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds demo speeding your way.</p>



<p>This isn’t Sonic’s first foray into kart racers. Team Sonic Racing performed very well, and clearly well enough to warrant a full sequel. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworld-release-date-trailer-features-minecraft-persona-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is that very sequel, and it’s just had its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Network Test</a>. These types of tests are common and an easy way to ascertain a multiplayer title’s online connectivity and stability.</p>



<p>The beta has finished, meaning if you didn’t get a chance to log in, you’ve missed this window. But as one door closes, another opens.</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-demo-launches-in-september">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Demo Launches In September</h2>

<p>We’ve learned that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is debuting a new single-player demo in “mid-September,” thanks to the Sonic The Hedgehog <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X page</a>.</p>



<p>“The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test has officially ended! Thank you everyone for participating! And in case you missed it… A single-player demo will be released in mid-September! We hope you keep coming back for more races!” said the page in a September 2 message.</p>



<p>September is a busy month in the gaming calendar. The likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 26</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a> are some of the monstrous names propping up the month. If you can find time, a Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds demo will be wedged into the middle of this.</p>

Can it handle the gargantuan task of beating Mario Kart World?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>POE2 player numbers have been dwindling in recent weeks. This happens to many games after their initial launch and hype. But players have flooded back to Path of Exile 2 to make player count numbers blow up—thanks to the ‘Third Edict’ update and free weekend incentive.</p>



<p>Arguably, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-all-boss-powers-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4</a>‘s biggest competitor is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-best-class-build-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>. The ARPG launched to great success in December 2024. Over half a million of you flooded the Path of Exile 2 servers to see what the fuss was all about. Peak numbers were still close to the 200K mark by January 2025, and things have tailed off a bit—save for the April 2025 update.</p>



<p> However, a free weekend opportunity combined with a huge new content update has revitalized the ARPG sequel once more.</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-third-edict-update-amp-free-weekend-boosts-numbers">Path of Exile 2 Third Edict Update &amp; Free Weekend Boosts Numbers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roaring back into life. Image credit: Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Path of Exile 2 was free-to-play for everyone from August 29 to September 1. Whether you own the game or don’t, everyone was entitled to download the game and try it out.</p>



<p>This was to get as many eyes and hours on the game’s Third Edict content update as possible.</p>



<p>According to the POE 2 <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3826469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>: “You will get access to all the content currently available in Path of Exile 2, including the newly released Third Edict Content Update. There are no limits to character leveling, and all progress made during this period will be saved to your account. When the Free Weekend ends, you can continue playing by purchasing an Early Access key or by waiting until Path of Exile 2 becomes free to play at full release.”</p>



<p>For reference, Steam Charts says Path of Exile 2 achieved around 8,000 players on average in July 2025, with a peak of around 14,000. Whereas August 2025 saw an average of about 25,000 users, but a peak of over 352,000! The average would’ve been low throughout the whole month, up until the free weekend right at the end of the month.</p>



<p>Did you get a chance to play Path of Exile 2 during the free weekend? Are you going to continue to play it? It seems to be a bold strategy that paid off for Grinding Gear Games.

<p>A reputable social media has found traces of the first Marvel Rivals PS4 update. It’s long been suspected that a PS4 version of the superhero shooter would happen eventually, thank the Star Lord, it seems to be coming.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-c9-mean-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has been a huge hit for NetEase Games. It’s surprising, really, as Marvel fans are insatiable for the hero shooter and anything Marvel-related in general. It takes the best of Overwatch and sprinkles in its own flair and features to make an excellent free-to-play shooter.</p>



<p>Many people still haven’t made the step up to current-gen hardware, and if you’re a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS4</a> user, it might be good news for you.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A confusing message. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, this has been uncovered: “Marvel Rivals Update 01.01 Released. (PS4 Version).”</p>



<p>This would suggest the first update and patch notes for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-version-might-become-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals’ debut on PS4</a>. This is the most recent update on the port, and the X page posted on August 13 with another message indicating the port was happening: “Marvel Rivals – PS4.”</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals on PlayStation 4 feels like reality more than a dream, and if you are a last-gen owner, you finally get to see what the fuss is all about. Also, I’d hazard a guess that if Marvel Rivals is coming to older PlayStation hardware, then Xbox One owners might also be in luck! I’m worried about the game’s performance, but let’s hope it holds up!</p>



<p>Stay tuned for updates and details.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Which Call of Duty is Free?—Play COD For Free, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/which-call-of-duty-is-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-call-of-duty-is-free-%E2%80%94play-cod-for-free-explained.1286088/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty has existed for more than two decades, and in that time, dozens of games have been released to flesh out the franchise. It’s arguably the most popular first-person shooter series of all time, and today, we’re helping people get a taste of it by answering an all-important question: ‘Which Call of Duty is free?’</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll outline which Call of Duty games are free and which ones you need to pay for.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-free-call-of-duty-games">Are There Free Call of Duty Games?</h2>



<p>Few franchises sell quite so many copies as Call of Duty does. It’s a titan of the gaming industry, and every year, even amidst bad press, the annual Call of Duty release tops the charts. In 2022, Modern Warfare II was released, and within ten days, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-2-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had topped $1 billion in sales</a>.</p>



<p>However, as it’s a premium franchise, Call of Duty can be expensive, and typically, every new title will boast a top-tier pricing point as well as a paid battle pass and other in-game bundles and items that also cost real money. It can get very pricey, very quickly, and for some players, the need to find a free Call of Duty game arises. </p>



<p>With that in mind, which Call of Duty is free?</p>



<h2 id="h-good-news-you-can-play-call-of-duty-for-free">Good News: You <em>Can </em>Play Call of Duty For Free</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: Activision</figcaption></figure>







<p>There are two ways that you can play Call of Duty for free, and they’re both dramatically popular. </p>



<p>Firstly, there’s the Warzone ecosystem. This battle-royale-backed platform features one of the most popular titles to ever emerge into the genre, boasting hundreds of millions of players and an ever-changing landscape. It debuted in 2020, and in the years that it has been active, it has seen all-new maps, modes, events, and the growth of a massive community.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Warzone (in every capacity) is free to play across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms – it’s also a crossplay title, which has served to unite cross-platform players. There’s a possibility that Warzone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-mwii-ported-to-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also be available on Nintendo devices</a>.</p>



<p>If Warzone isn’t your kind of thing, then you can get started with the <em>other </em>free Call of Duty game – COD Mobile. This is a handheld-exclusive game that has existed since 2019, and it’s a monumental title that, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1112479/call-of-duty-mobile-downloads-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to Statista</a>, secures around four million new downloads every single month.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Mobile incorporates content from several successful COD games, featuring a wide range of game modes, a battle royale mode, and plenty of customisation options. It’s free-to-play, but there are many microtransactions under the surface that fuel the development of the game itself.</p>



<p>That answers the titular question, ‘which Call of Duty is free’. There’s a battle royale platform that also includes an extraction shooter sub-mode and a mobile platform that is ever-expanding. That’s not a bad selection, considering it’ll cost you absolutely nothing to get involved with either of them!</p>

<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> which Call of Duty game is your favorite</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Map Leak Shows Large US Setting For ‘Season One’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-map-leak-large-us-setting/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-map-leak-shows-large-us-setting-for-%E2%80%98season-one%E2%80%99.1286064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another major Battlefield 6 leak is circulating on social media, with the culprit uploading ten minutes of gameplay from a previously unseen map, titled either Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm. The ten-minute video showcases a stunning, large map reportedly set in California, and it has been dubbed the first map to come to Season One of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>It’s a positive look, regardless of how the content has surfaced. Fans were asking for larger maps following the end of the recent open beta, and that’s exactly what this leaked map represents.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-battlefield-6-leak-reveals-larger-map">Latest Battlefield 6 Leak Reveals Larger Map</h2>



<p>In a ten-minute video leaked by the same source that uncovered the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 battle royale map</a>, we get a walkthrough of what is either named Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm. This naming convention comes from the original poster who first shared the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6ap3s/bf6s_season_1_map_badlands_video_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video on Reddit</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the linked video uploaded on Streamable:</p>



<p><strong><em>Video removed by copyright request</em></strong></p>



<p>Bizarre perspective aside, the video offers a neat look at one of the larger maps coming to Battlefield 6, assumedly with the game’s first season. There are oil derricks spread across a vast, rocky area, pitted with long sight lines and many avenues that would make vehicular combat on this map a dream.</p>



<p>Another area on the map appears to house an airstrip with some hangars, and there are factory-style buildings, rolling hills, and even what looks like a small village. It’s a super diverse map with plenty to uncover. It’s the kind of thing that large-scale Conquest fans have been begging for, and I can certainly see it becoming a fan favorite at first blush.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-and-answers-today-september-2%E2%80%94clues-for-tuesday-813.1286061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nothing gets your day started in a better way than an invigorating run around today’s <em>New York Times Connections </em>puzzle. This daily word game has become a firm favorite worldwide since being released in June 2023. I’m a huge believer in keeping my brain sharp, and I can’t think of a more effective way to do that than with the NYT’s selection of mind-taxing games.</p>



<p>With that being said, today is a whole new day, and that means fresh NYT Connections hints and answers are here, waiting to be discovered and utilized. If you’re scratching your head about today’s NYT Connections, read on. I’ll help you figure out every group in today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections-and-how-do-you-play-it">What is NYT Connections and How Do You Play It?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <strong>everywhere</strong>, and it can be played either on a desktop device or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-today-s-nyt-connections-hints">What Are Today’s NYT Connections Hints?</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #814</p>



<ul>
<li>STIRRING</li>



<li>MYSTERY</li>



<li>CHRISTMAS</li>



<li>SWEARING</li>



<li>HOUSE</li>



<li>MOUSE</li>



<li>HERRING</li>



<li>EARRING</li>



<li>EXPLETIVES</li>



<li>PLEATHER VEST</li>



<li>OUROBOROS</li>



<li>NECKLACE</li>



<li>MESH SHIRT</li>



<li>FOUR-LETTER WORDS</li>



<li>HISTAMINE</li>



<li>PROFANITY</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Credit: New York Times</figcaption></figure>







<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em>These words might get you ‘bleeped’ on television</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>T’was the night before… these words took center stage</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Fashion choices that scream 1993 pop culture icon</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word begins with a little ownership</em></li>
</ul>



<p>I didn’t have as much of a challenge with today’s NYT Connections words as I thought I might. That’s not always true, as some mornings I’ll be in a stupor trying to figure them out, especially the purple group, which is often <strong>obscure</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, September 2.</p>

</ul>



<p>And here’s the visual solution for today’s NYT Connections:</p>

<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>To play today’s Wordle, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head to the game’s website.</a> If you just want to go right to today’s answer without any tips or tricks, you <strong><a href="#h-today-s-wordle-answer-for-september-2-2025-wordle-game-1536">can click right here</a>.</strong></p>



<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> The following information will include spoilers on today’s, and yesterday’s, edition of Wordle. If you don’t want the answer given to you, stop scrolling.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-wordle">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p>Wordle is a daily online word puzzle created by Josh Wardle, who first created the game as a prototype in 2013 and released it in 2021. It challenges players to guess a <strong>five-letter word</strong> in six attempts or fewer, using clues from previous guesses. The game became a viral hit in late 2021 due to its simplicity, shareable results, and the excitement of solving a new puzzle every day. Wordle has even inspired countless spin-offs and daily challenges across social media.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-wordle">How To Play Wordle</h2>



<p>Wordle is a simple but addictive word puzzle. Each day, players get <strong>six attempts</strong> to guess the five-letter word answer. After each guess:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a trending topic online.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-do-wordle-games-reset">When Do Wordle Games Reset</h2>



<p>A new word is added to Wordle <strong>every day at 12am or Midnight EST.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-tips-on-how-to-play">Tips On How To Play</h2>



<p>While everyone has a different strategy for how they play the game to get today’s Wordle answer, there are tips and tricks you can use to help you get the daily words in as few attempts as possible.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Use a word with common vowels and consonants (like SLATE or STRAW) to reveal useful letters early.</li>



<li><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Don’t just rearrange your first word to find the answer. If you don’t know it right away, pick a second word that uses different letters you haven’t tried yet. This will help you narrow down your options quicker.</li>



<li><strong>Tip 3: </strong>Don’t use duplicate letters too early. If you think a word has a duplicate letter, wait until you’re more confident the letter appears twice in the word.</li>



<li><strong>Tip 4:</strong> Wait on uncommon letters. To make it easier, try and find all the common letters first. Once you’ve ruled out any common vowels or consonants, then give letters like “J”, “X”, or “Z” a try.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-hint-for-today-s-wordle-answer-game-1536">Hint for Today’s Wordle Answer—Game #1536</h2>



<p>Without giving the Wordle answer completely away just yet, here are a couple helpful hints for today to get you started:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hint 1:</strong> Today’s Wordle answer starts with the letter <strong>“M”</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hint 2: </strong>Today’s Wordle answer has just <strong>one vowel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hint 3:</strong> It’s another word for <strong>“power”</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Use these clues to narrow down your guesses and increase your chances of solving <strong>Wordle #1536 for September 2, 2025.</strong></p>
