<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the ongoing price increases in RAM due to the rise in AI could delay the next generation of console releases.</p>







<p>We first mentioned the rumor during our Insider Gaming Weekly episode on December 19th, where we mentioned that we had heard that there are already ongoing talks at the high levels on what the RAM availability could mean for the next generation.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="No One Is Buying Video Game Consoles - Insider Gaming Weekly" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nCctuh3N2g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>From what we’ve heard, the industry as a whole is concerned about RAM availability (as they should be) and what that is going to mean for mass-producing consoles at a competitive price point. Not only for the next generation, but it could also mean that yet more price increases for current generation consoles will hit us in 2026.</p>



<p>RAM modules have increased in price by several hundred percent in the past few months due to the demand for AI, and with the pursuit of AI seemingly not going away anytime soon, RAM availability could continue to be a bottleneck. Or at the very least, the RAM shortage will mean that prices will continue to hike.</p>



<p>It leaves console producers in a very tricky spot moving forward, and while consoles have traditionally been subsidised to a certain extent in the past, it seems like RAM availability and price increases will mean that the next-generation of consoles, which were already believed to be much higher in price than previous generations, could be extortionate.</p>



<p>From what we understand, the situation has led console manufacturers to debate whether the next generation of consoles should be delayed from their intended 2027-2028 release window, with the hope that RAM manufacturers will be able to build out their infrastructure to produce more RAM, therebyallowing prices to drop.</p>







<p>Regardless of what happens, though, it seems that the next couple of years could see the current generation of consoles increase in price further. </p>

<p>When people look back on 2025, they’ll likely find a year that will go down as one of the best for games of the last decade or more. From surprising success stories like Peak and Blue Prince to major AAA blockbusters like Death Stranding 2: On The Beach and Pokémon Legends: Z-A, there was something for everyone this year. But only one game could claim the title of the Insider Gaming community’s 2025 Game of the Year.</p>



<p>After a two-week voting period in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>, the readers voted Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as the Game of the Year.</p>







<p>Released on April 24, 2025, Clair Obscur’s visuals along with the story centered around mortality resonated with players around the world. The game has received near universal acclaim from many, and even walked away with other Game of the Year awards from various events.</p>



<p>The voice acting is some of the best there’s been in years, and even the music can compete with the likes of major motion pictures and games with near billion-dollar budgets. It’s honestly hard to find much to critic about the game, which is why it one with such a large amount of the votes. </p>







<h2 id="h-other-games-received-votes-too">Other Games Received Votes, Too</h2>



<p>While other votes for games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-insider-gaming-community-best-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Multiplayer</a> and Indie Game of the Year were close, Game of the Year was one of the more lopsided. Clair Obscur received 27.8% of the votes while the second-place game, ARC Raiders, earned 14.8%. Rounding out the Top 5 were Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (13.9%), Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (12.2%), and Ghost of Yotei (8.7%).</p>



<p>Other games receiving votes were Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Dying Light: The Beast, Split Fiction, Donkey Kong Bananza, Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Year In Review: Was 2025 The Year of The Extraction Shooter?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/2025-year-of-the-extraction-shooter/</link>
            <guid>1393624</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the wide world of gaming, few genres embody the risk and reward loop as starkly as the extraction shooter. It’s a genre constructed around the concepts of triumph and devastation, with these games demanding mechanical skill and psychological resilience. In 2025, extraction shooters blew up all over again, but can we honestly say that the genre <strong>took over </strong>this year?</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the stock of extraction shooters released in 2025 and determine if this really was the year of the extraction genre.</p>











<p>Typically, extraction shooters are unwelcoming titles that thrive on punishing mechanics. The likes of Escape from Tarkov have kept the genre from entering the mainstream too much, boasting complex mechanics, no guidance systems, and combat that can see you gunned down by a single shot.</p>



<p>But in 2025, extraction shooters became <strong>much more accessible</strong>.</p>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite launched on Steam and allowed players to access a free Tarkov alternative with some more forgiving mechanics. Escape from Duckov emerged as a single-player, satirical take on Tarkov, and it was equal parts adorable and relatively easy.</p>



<p>And let’s not forget the breakout extraction adventure of 2025, ARC Raiders. Embark Studios’ second title was praised for its organic community-driven growth rather than corporate hype and punishing gameplay loops.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-surge-of-shooters">A Surge of Shooters</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In 2025, a sheer surge of extraction titles was released or updated with fresh content and upgrades. Everything from Gray Zone Warfare to Zero Sievert, and from The Forever Winter to Escape from Tarkov had a limelight moment in 2025, allowing for untold exposure across the industry to these challenging titles.</p>



<p>And we’re not done yet, as there are more to hit the market, such as Bungie’s Marathon.</p>



<p>This abundance of extraction shooter goodness created something of a paradox. The slew of extraction shooters meant that fans had more than ever to enjoy, but the saturation came thick and fast, potentially running the risk of diluting what it means to be this tougher-than-average title feeding a niche market.</p>



<p>It seemed that every developer was at least <strong>considering </strong>the extraction shooter model in some way.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters in 2025 were so much bigger than just <strong>games</strong>. Titles like ARC Raiders proved to be monumental things that got everyone buzzing about something <strong>new</strong> and <strong>energetic</strong>. This year, streamers and content creators <strong>blew up </strong>alongside the biggest extraction titles, and it’s not every genre that can do that.</p>



<p>It was also the year that developers started playing with the concept of the extraction shooter, seeing how far they could push the envelope. That’s partly why Embark Studios made an extraction <strong>adventure </strong>game and not an extraction shooter specifically.</p>







<p>It depends on your perspective, but it’s easy to claim that 2025 <strong>was </strong>the year of the extraction shooter. From the sheer number of releases to the records set and broken by the most popular launches, the extraction vertical was a smash hit in 2025.</p>



<p>Many of the genre’s most capable purists have voiced their concerns about too many casual extraction shooters potentially tuning down the genre, but they’re shouting into the void mostly. If this isn’t the year of the extraction shooter, then it’s certainly the year that the genre evolved.</p>



<p>It’s a transformation that could either strengthen or weaken extraction shooters, depending on how you look at it.</p>



<p>This was a landmark year, either way. In 2025, extraction shooters became household names, and in terms of viewers, creators, and streamers, these games positively soared. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Hack is Reportedly ‘Blown Way Out of Proportion’, Say Sources]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-hack-false/</link>
            <guid>1393474</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent slew of claims about a series of hacks and breaches at Ubisoft have been blown way out of proportion, according to people familiar with the events that have unfolded over the past couple of days.</p>







<p>Various rumours and claims of a Ubisoft breach began after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-hack-servers-shut-down-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company shut down Rainbow Six Siege servers</a> following a hacker who gifted players a combined $339,960,000,000,000 in in-game currency. According to sources familiar with the breach, Ubisoft intends to perform a rollback to undo this change.</p>



<h2 id="h-multiple-breaches-at-ubisoft">Multiple Breaches at Ubisoft</h2>



<p>However, the Rainbow Six Siege breach wasn’t the only hack that Ubisoft suffered. According to other groups of hackers (and has subsequently been circulating online), Ubisoft suffered a massive breach with some 900GB of data compromised. Allegedly, the data included source code, internal tools, and development materials of Ubisoft’s upcoming and previous games.</p>



<p>It now seems that these claims were, in fact, untrue. The group with such claims haven’t been able to provide any evidence of the alleged breach.</p>



<p>Sources within Ubisoft have told Insider Gaming that the company’s security team have been made aware of some breaches earlier this year following leaks surrounding projects such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-multiplayer-shooter-project-scout-rumor-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Scout’</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since-cancelled Far Cry game</a> codenamed ‘Talisker’.</p>



<p>Another group that claimed to have breached user information has since backtracked, saying that it was false.</p>



<p>According to sources familiar with some of the groups who alleged such breaches, they say that the hacks were “blown way out of proportion” and some individuals “just wanted clout” from the hack that made headlines.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, but has not received a response due to the holidays. Should we receive one, we will update this report.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo Switch Online is the premium subscription service available for Switch and Switch 2 users to try. Unlike PlayStation’s PS Plus and Xbox’s Game Pass, which provide access to a library of current-gen and previous-gen games, NSO gives players access to a range of classic games from previous Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p>If you combine Nintendo Switch Online with the Expansion Pack, then players can get access to a library of games from almost all classic Nintendo consoles, including NES, SNES, Game Boy, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, SEGA Genesis, and Nintendo GameCube games. </p>



<p>In 2025, NSO members had access to some top-tier classic games through Nintendo Switch Online, including hits from popular franchises like Zelda, Mario, and more. Check out Insider Gaming’s top 10 picks of Nintendo Switch Online games that you need to try out in 2025:</p>



<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a Nintendo Switch Online user in 2025 and haven’t played The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, then you are missing out. What’s more, it is the highest-rated game of all time on Metacritic. Do you need any more convincing after that? It was the first 3D Legend of Zelda game, making Hyrule more alive than ever before thanks to environmental storytelling, a good mix of exploration, puzzles, and combat, and memorable characters. </p>



<h2 id="h-super-metroid">Super Metroid</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Metroid is a 1994 SNES game that was the third installment in the series. It saw Samus Aran face off against Space Pirates in her quest to recover the last Metroid. Super Metroid is a fantastic 2D side-scrolling action adventure, where you explore large areas while being able to run, jump, crouch, and fire in different directions. The game also features other types of power-ups that can enhance Samus’ arsenal or grant special abilities. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-windwaker">The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion members received the original GameCube version of The Legend of Windwaker for the Switch 2 in 2025. Wind Waker was released in 2002 and brought a significant change to the series, with the developers exploring a brand-new art style. Additionally, the game also had Link visiting clusters of islands across the Great Sea, where he used a sailboat called King of Red Lions to navigate through</p>



<h2 id="h-super-mario-world">Super Mario World</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Mario World is another classic hit that Nintendo Switch Online players shouldn’t miss out on in 2025. The title was released in 1991 for the SNES and quickly became a fan favorite. Though most of it was similar to the series, the game came with a new gameplay feature that would become iconic to the series. The feature in question is Yoshi, the rideable dinosaur who could walk faster, eat enemies, and spit them like projectiles. Super Mario World is also the best-selling SNES game. </p>



<h2 id="h-f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>F-Zero is a classic racing game set in a futuristic world. The game is similar to previous titles in the F-Zero series; however, what makes it unique is the introduction of a story mode where players can complete 9 chapters as Captain Falcon. The game features a variety of tracks with tubes, jumps, and roller coaster-like paths. There are also a variety of machines in the game, each behaving differently. </p>



<h2 id="h-fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is an installment that is separate from the continuity of other games. It is set in the fictional continent of Magvel, where two royal siblings fight to keep hostile sources from invading their kingdom. The title is a tactical RPG featuring turn-based combat, with players battling allied, player-controlled, and enemy units. Each unit has the ability to evolve through experience points; however, it also features a perma-death system, where if a unit dies, it can’t return for the rest of the campaign unless the player restarts the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-goldeneye-007">GoldenEye 007</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have ever been a fan of the James Bond series and wish to try a classic FPS title, then you can’t go wrong with GoldenEye 007. It is based on the 1995 film, in which you play the iconic MI6 agent James Bond, facing a criminal syndicate that plans to deploy a satellite weapon. The game was originally going to be a side-scroller for the SNES, but ended up becoming a first-person shooter inspired by games like Doom, released for the Nintendo 64, and became the third-best-selling game on the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-rayman-2-the-great-escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rayman 2: The Great Escape was a special installment in the series, as it marked the move from 2D to 3D. Just like others, it is a platformer released for the Nintendo 64 in 1999, where players run through linear sequences, battle robotic pirates, collect lums, and solve puzzles. The primary weapon in the game is Rayman’s fists, and as you progress, the game gives you more abilities with charged attacks, ranged attacks, and more traversal methods being added to the player’s arsenal.</p>



<h2 id="h-golden-sun">Golden Sun</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Golden Sun is a fantasy RPG that was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001, and it eventually received two more installments over the years. The game has you playing four characters as you embark on a quest to protect the world from a destructive force called Alchemy. The title features several interesting characters to interact with, monsters to fight, and new abilities and equipment to acquire. </p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-64">Mario Kart 64</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mario Kart 64 is a cart-racing game and the second installment in the series. It was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 and eventually became the second-best-selling game on the platform. The gameplay is broadly similar to other games in the series, where you choose one of 8 Mario franchise characters to race across the game’s 20 courses inspired by areas in Super Mario games. Players also get special abilities and power-ups that are unique to the Super Mario series. </p>
