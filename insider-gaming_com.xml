<p>It appears that the development of Project Ethos will move forward as 2K has hired a new studio head at developer 31st Union. According to a report from Variety, Ben Brinkman has been hired away from Respawn Entertainment to lead the game.</p>



<p>Brinkman comes in to replace former 31st Union president Michael Condrey, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-fires-31st-union-president-after-project-ethos-poor-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who was fired back</a> in February.</p>



<p>A memo to staff, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/project-ethos-update-31st-union-ben-brinkman-1236553878/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquired by Variety</a>, from 2K President David Ismailer called the community feedback to Project Ethos “enlightening.”</p>



<p><strong>“It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do,” it continued. “It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity. It’s been inspiring to see how far you’ve come. You took the feedback to heart and reimagined Project ETHOS with a renewed vision – one that’s poised to deliver on its promise to our players. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Our confidence in Project ETHOS grows every day. To further the incredible progress you’ve made, I’m excited to welcome Ben Brinkman as the new Studio Head of 31st Union. After several months of conversations, Ben officially joins us on Monday, October 20.”</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned, Brinkman comes to 31st Union from Respawn, where he served as an executive producer on Apex Legends since 2020. Before joining Respawn, Brinkman was a producer at Activision and Treyarch, working on the Call of Duty franchise since 2008. He’s been in the industry since the late 1990s, with other stops at EA and 2K over 20 years ago.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Reportedly Moving Surface Manufacturing Out Of China, Could Do Same With Xbox]]></title>

<p>Microsoft is reportedly making changes to where its hardware is built. According to Nikkei, Microsoft is looking to move manufacturing of its Surface devices out of China as early as 2026.</p>



<p>The report (<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/supply-chain/microsoft-aims-to-make-most-new-products-outside-china-from-2026-sources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywalled</a>) says that Microsoft will look to move data center servers, component production, and device assembly out of the country. They say that Microsoft has asked multiple supppliers to help with preparation for the move.</p>



<p><strong>“The scope is quite wide and covers components, parts and product assembly for new product introductions of both notebook computers and server products,” </strong>a supply chain executive told Nikkei.<strong> “Microsoft hopes all of these can be manufactured entirely outside of China starting from 2026 at the earliest.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as server production, one source told the outlet that Microsoft had already started moving server production out of China. It’s said that Microsoft has requested <strong>“at least 80% of the bill of materials (BOM) for servers come from outside the country.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the Surface production, Nikkei says that Microsoft is “pushing to increase non-China production of the Xbox videogame consoles”. That said, there hasn’t been any sort of requirement made to bring all Xbox manufacturing out of China yet. </p>



<p>This report of Microsoft’s manufacturing plans comes as trade tensions between China and the United States intensify. Donald Trump has threatened to place 100% tariffs on goods from China on November 1st, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/13/trump-meeting-xi-china-tariffs/86672514007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">though a meeting between</a> Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could cool those threats.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>During the latest The Crew Showcase, it was announced that The Crew 2 has received a new update today, October 16, introducing a Hybrid Mode (offline mode).</p>



<p>The Crew 2’s offline mode was announced back in September 2024, and earlier this year, Ubisoft Ivory Tower <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-will-begin-testing-the-crew-2-offline-mode-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that testing for it would begin on April 30. Within just a few months, the new Hybrid Mode will be delivered and was shadow-dropped in an update today. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-crew-2-s-hybrid-mode-lets-you-play-the-game-without-an-internet-connection">The Crew 2’s Hybrid Mode Lets You Play the Game Without an Internet Connection</h2>



<p>In a new <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/motorfest/news-updates/44AueZeJRbz9H2BxrCJueZ/what-you-cant-miss-from-the-crew-showcase-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the developers of The Crew 2 announced that their brand-new offline mode is available today. The latest update will allow players to switch between the original online experience and the latest Hybrid mode. The Crew 2 was built on online multiplayer, so some features will not be available, including multiplayer modes, global rankings, and livery sharing, which require an internet connection. </p>



<p>The developers will provide a full breakdown of the differences between the original online mode and The Crew 2’s new offline Hybrid mode in a dedicated article. This article will also include details on how players will access and manage their offline save files in the latest update. The developers also stated that “This update represents a major milestone in our commitment to ensuring long-term access to The Crew 2 for all players.” </p>
