<p>Dragon Ball Z Kakarot devs have just revealed the release window for Daima Pack Part 2, along with details on the new content. </p>



<p>Back in February 2025, developers revealed that Dragon Ball Z Kakarot will receive Daima—Adventure Through The Demon Realm Pack as additional DLC <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-dlc-part-1-and-2-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">across two packs</a>. The first pack was released in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-has-revealed-new-daima-dlc-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July 2025</a>. The release window for the second pack has now been announced, and it is arriving early next year. </p>







<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-pack-part-2-arrives-in-early-2026-with-mini-vegeta">Dragon Ball Z Kakarot Daima Pack Part 2 Arrives in Early 2026 with Mini Vegeta</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-pack-part-2-arrives-early-2026-new-character-and-fresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> by Bandai Namco reveals that Dragon Ball Z Kakarot Adventure Through The Demon Realm Pack part 2 will release in 2026. This new pack will add Vegeta (mini) as a new playable character, along with a new boss fight against Tamagami Number Two, and new enemies from the demon realm.

They also revealed Tamagami Number Two’s Skills along with the other enemies. </p>

<p>Players will also face two new enemy types as they explore the First Demon World. The first enemy type is the Gendarmerie Tank, known for its heavy hitting and powerful ranged and charged attacks. The other enemy type is Gendarmerie Officers, strong enemies that can summon reinforcements and attack from every angle. </p>



<p>From the looks of it, the Daima DLC might not end with the second part, as we are yet to see Goku’s glorious Super Saiyan 4 transformation arrive for the game, which was teased at the very end of the new trailer. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At The Game Awards 2025, Larian Studios announced the next game in the long-running Divinity franchise. And with the new game on the mind of players, Larian has decided to give owners of Divinity: Original Sin 2—the last game in the series—a free update.</p>



<p>Available starting today, Larian has released a Divinity: Original Sin 2 – Definitive Edition upgrade for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<p>Details on what the free update entails from a technology standpoint haven’t been revealed just yet. The only thing certainly known is that, for PlayStation players, the game it’s PS5 Pro optimized. When more details become available on what the optimizations are and differences from the base version, they’ll be added to this story.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Released originally in 2017, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a sequel to 2014’s Original Sin. While the games are intertwined a bit, Larian has said that Original Sin 2 is a “standalone game and can be experienced on its own.” However, they “ecommend trying out Divinity: Original Sin for the best experience!”</p>



<p>The premise of the second game in the Original Sin subseries is you playing in a world where the Gods are dead. Your player holds powers of a “forbidden magic”, and you find yourself quarantined because of it.</p>







<p>“The Magisters of the Divine Order want to “cure” you of your powers,” the description reads. “But the Order has secrets of its own. Secrets that threaten everyone. If the world remains godless, chaos will rule.”</p>



<p>What do you think of Larian giving a free update for Divinity: Original Sin 2 on current-gen consoles?

<p>Tomb Raider’s co-creator has commented on the new remake, Legacy of Atlantis, revealing that he prefers new chapters. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 was a fantastic event for Tomb Raider fans.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem director has arrived with new details about the upcoming title after their big reveal at The Game Awards 2025, stating it’s almost like playing two games. </p>



<p>Capcom has kept a lot of stuff under wraps since Resident Evil Requiem was revealed, with Leon Kennedy being playable as the biggest secret of them all. However, we had an idea from the leaks, but confirmation was required. Now that Leon has been officially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>, the director has revealed how the gameplay of both characters contrasts. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-s-leon-and-grace-sections-are-almost-equally-split-but-heavily-differ-from-each-other">Resident Evil Requiem’s Leon and Grace Sections are ‘Almost Equally Split’, But Heavily Differ From Each Other</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Resident Evil Requiem director Akifumi Nakanishi&nbsp;spoke about Leon and Grace’s gameplay, along with other details. Nakanishi first revealed that “in terms of gameplay, Grace and Leon’s playable sections are almost equally split,” with the structure being similar to Revelations. The director added that Leon isn’t “well suited to horror”, hence his sections “focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action”. Grace has the scarier sections, and the devs are “really emphasizing the difference in their experiences this time.”</p>



<p>Nakanishi explains that the two experiences are “almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together.” Players would feel like “jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna,” he said while laughing. The director also revealed that Leon’s chapters are where the players will feel safer and scared again when Grace comes back on. It is a “consciously designed horror structure,” he stated. </p>

Additionally, Requiem might have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveal-new-playable-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another playable character</a>.

<p>Resident Evil insider has revealed details about the release windows for Code Veronica and Zero Remakes. </p>



<p>Based on insider information, it was already known that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next remakes</a> in development for the Resident Evil franchise are allegedly Code Veronica and Zero. The insider had also revealed earlier that these games are scheduled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2027/2028</a>, but didn’t have exact details. Now, he is back with more. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-code-veronica-remake-will-reportedly-be-announced-next-year-and-release-in-2027">Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake Will Reportedly be Announced Next Year, And Release in 2027</h2>



<p>The new details about Resident Evil Code Veronica and Zero Remakes come from a prominent insider, Dusk Golem. Most recently, their highly anticipated leak about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon being playable</a> in Requiem was proven to be true through a new trailer at The Game Awards 2025. Now they are back with a new scoop, this time providing us with the announcement and release windows for the next remakes in the franchise. </p>



<p>According to Dusk Golem’s new post on <a href="https://x.com/aestheticgamer1/status/1999736688848113831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), they have heard that Code Veronica will be announced in 2026 and released in 2027. The Zero Remake is scheduled to release in 2028. Readers should take this information with a grain of salt, as there is no official announcement regarding these release windows, and they may change depending on how development progresses. </p>







<p>Back in October 2025, it was reportedly revealed that Resident Evil 0 Remake is in development under the nickname ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-0-remake-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chamber</a>‘ and won’t be released until 2028. Additionally, Resident Evil Requiem leak suggests there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveal-new-playable-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another playable character</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-flickering-flames-update-notes/</link>
            <guid>1383409</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has published all the information you could want to know about the upcoming Cold Snap update, which includes the Flickering Flames event and the new Raider Deck. The update drops on all platforms <strong>tomorrow</strong>, and there are stacks to learn about what’s coming next in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The update includes a new community challenge, a fresh series of Feats to complete to unlock free rewards, and map conditions that present a dire threat to Raiders everywhere.</p>







<h2 id="h-cold-snap-new-map-condition">Cold Snap: New Map Condition</h2>



<p>From December 16, ARC Raiders players will be able to jump onto maps blanketed with snow and featuring a new map condition: Cold Snap. This condition is harmful and poses a serious threat to players:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>During the&nbsp;<strong>Cold Snap&nbsp;</strong>condition<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>the clock is ticking. The freezing weather will cut your Raider down in minutes unless you get indoors, or heal up quickly. Bear this in mind when engaging other Raiders – getting pinned down in the open is a death sentence during a Rust Belt winter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Flickering Flames is the new event coming to ARC Raiders tomorrow. The details have been outlined in a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/whats-coming-in-the-december-update">recent blog post</a> published by Embark Studios:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Below ground, the tenacity of the human spirit endures. Despite food scarcity and rolling blackouts, survivors gather to light candles, swap war stories, and appreciate what little they have. The festival of&nbsp;<strong>Flickering Flames</strong>&nbsp;is about to begin.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Candleberry</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Bush&nbsp;</strong>forms the centerpiece of these festivities. For Speranzans, this hardy plant is a versatile asset during the winter months: boiling the berry creates a wax that burns for hours. Crushing them yields a refreshing juice while the roots make for a tea that drives out the toughest colds. Candleberries make hearty stews, warming soups, and gifts of perfume and soap, while the wreaths can be fashioned into festive decorations that offer Speranzans a hint of Topside’s greenery. Speranza needs A LOT of them for the Candleberry Banquets!</p>



<p>Speranzans rely on other essential items through the winter too.&nbsp;<strong>Light and heat sources</strong>&nbsp;boost morale and help keep Speranzans comfortable, while giving them the best chance to fight through to the spring.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you collect Candleberries and ‘other special items’, you’ll receive Raider Tokens, new items, rare utility items, weapons, cosmetics, and merit tokens, so there’s some give and take there. Players can unlock Merits simply for playing ARC Raiders, but finding and extracting Candleberries will elevate their gains.</p>



<p>An all-new Raider Deck will be introduced from <strong>December 26th</strong>, featuring a series of exclusive <strong>and free </strong>unlocks:</p>

<p>With our Winter Update, we’re also introducing our second<strong>&nbsp;free, permanent Raider Deck. Available from the 26th December</strong>, The Goalie Raider Deck lets you unlock a series of items, Raider Tokens, and Cosmetics as you earn Cred Topside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flagship skin of the new Raider Deck is an old world outfit that some Speranzans have claimed was worn by the world’s most fierce and respected gladiators. Who knows, really? But hey, it comes with a pretty cool new hockey stick Raider Tool.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As explained, the new skin comes with the first new Raider Tool, which takes the form of a hockey stick, because why not?</p>



<p>Flickering Flames is a limited-time, winter-themed event that runs from December 16 until January 13, so be quick if you want to maximize your rewards.</p>
