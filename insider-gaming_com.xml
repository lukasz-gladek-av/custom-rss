<p>Neople’s The First Berserker Khazan has sleeper-hit potential, and its 2025 release isn’t one to miss. Whether you want to know which platforms it’s on, how much it costs, or how to play its exclusive demo, we have everything you need to know before you become a berserker yourself.</p>



<p>2024 smashed it in the Soulslike department. FromSoftware delivered its long-awaited Shadow of the Erdtree DLC—Radahn still gives me nightmares—and Stellar Blade was more than stellar. Now, it’s time to look ahead to 2025. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is the first hard-hitting heavyweight in the Soulslike division.</p>



<p>Khazan’s backstory is nearly as brutal and horrific as the punishing gameplay. But to see if this is the start of something special, I’m here to guide you through the title’s key tidbits before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-first-berserker-khazan-come-out">When Does The First Berserker Khazan Come Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re hyped. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Prepare yourself for The First Berserker Khazan’s March 27 release date.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, the vengeance-hungry warrior graces screens in March. Not content with battling those who wronged him, <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a> also has to stave off the presence of other March 2025 games including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-platforms">The First Berserker Khazan Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC users can prepare for The First Berserker Khazan launch.</strong></p>



<p>I’m afraid it’s bad news if I haven’t mentioned your platform. PS4 and Xbox One users have to miss out, as do Nintendo Switch owners. I keep questioning if any 2025 releases will get an eventual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> port. The console is supposed to be a million times more powerful (might be an exaggeration) and a future Switch 2 launch might not be out of the question.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-demo">How to Play The First Berserker Khazan Demo</h2>



<p><strong>Search for The First Berserker Khazan demo on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, download it, and get playing.</strong></p>



<p>It’s honestly this simple. But here are some handy instructions to follow precisely if you’re struggling:</p>



<ol>
<li>Choose which platform you want to play The First Berserker Khazan demo on.</li>



<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>The First Berserker Khazan</strong>.</li>



<li>Select the free demo.</li>



<li>Click to download it.</li>



<li>Once it’s ready, you can jump straight into the The First Berserker Khazan demo.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-editions-amp-price">The First Berserker Khazan Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan has two editions: Standard Edition ($59.99/£49.99) and Deluxe Edition ($69.99/£54.99).</strong></p>



<p>Neople is dispensing with luxuriousness where The First Berserker Khazan is concerned. It’s just a Standard or Deluxe Edition to pick from. Most games release with several editions, so this is a more straightforward selection for once.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s not a full-price release, nor is it getting the hype of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> or even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, but don’t sleep on The First Berserker Khazan. It looks brutal and bold. Do you think it could be this year’s Shadow of the Erdtree? Or is it another Soulslike clone? Leave your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p>Details about Cliffhanger’s upcoming Black Panther game have surfaced online thanks to a popular leaker, and it seems players will be able to try out characters like T’Challa, Killmonger, Shuri and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new information about Cliffhanger’s Black Panther game comes from the popular Call of Duty leaker TheGhostOfHope. Their latest post on <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1892746064505246088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) provides players with exclusive details on the upcoming game, such as character choice, combat details, POV, exploration, narrative aspects, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details reveal that the upcoming Black Panther game will allow players to choose their protagonist, which varies from T’Challa to M’Baku, Azari, Shuri, Killmonger, and more. Each Black Panther will have unique weapons, armour, and gadgets. Regarding combat, players can expect “authentic African Martial Arts mixed with Superhuman strength/agility” along with tech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding exploration, the upcoming Black Panther game will feature cities, savannahs, and other locations where players will experience different cultures and interact with new characters. The game will feature an over-the-shoulder POV. Lastly, Black Panther’s story will react to your choices and actions, providing players with “unique stories, missions &amp; dynamics” in return.</p>



<p>The Black Panther game was announced by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-black-panther/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA in 2023</a>, with Cliffhanger Games developing the AAA title. Monolith’s Kevin Stephens is leading the project, and the team includes veterans from top franchises like Halo Infinite, God of War, Call of Duty, and others.&nbsp;A job listing from last year confirmed an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-panther-game-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world setting</a> for the game.</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals has crossed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-hits-40-million-players-within-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">40 million players</a> in three months.

<p>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is, without any doubt, one of the best games in the entire series. It debuted on PlayStation 2 way back in 2004, and since then, it has remained a cult classic title, the subject of many memes, and the target of re-releases and remasters. It features a collection of boss fights, each one as memorable as the other, and all of them unique in their way. </p>



<p>In this list, I’m breaking down all the Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights, ranking them in order of how awesome they are to behold.</p>



<hr>







<p>It’s mostly subjective, right? For one man’s trash, there’s another man’s treasure – and that’s the same thing with these boss fights. They’re all special in their way, but some of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/metal-gear-solid/">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3 boss fights are so iconic that they’ll stick in our minds forever.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-the-pain">9. The Pain</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Pain is the first member of ‘Cobra’ that we get to fight in MGS3: Snake Eater. As such, his fight is relatively plain and easy to overcome, and his abilities are rather weak and not all that impressive. He can control bees – that’s about it. </p>



<h3 id="h-8-the-shagohod">8. The Shagohod</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>You wouldn’t think that going up against an enormous, nuclear-capable tank would be a boring boss fight, but that’s just what it is. It’s memorable because you’re fighting something so massive, but it’s an on-rails scene followed by a repetitive mechanism that sees you bring the behemoth to its knees relatively quickly.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-the-sorrow">7. The Sorrow</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Sorrow’s battle is one of the cleverest Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights, as it’s built around how you’ve played the game up until that point. If you’ve killed lots of enemies, your battle here will be ‘longed out’, but if you’re on a no-kill run, it’ll be over quickly. It rewards users with a nice camo suit, but ultimately, this fight is a walking simulator – but a smart one.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-ocelot">6. Ocelot</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ocelot is cool – he’s one of the best Metal Gear Solid characters of all time and a memorable one at that. He and Naked Snake clash three times in Snake Eater, but the most exciting fight with him is his first one, when he is using his dual revolvers across a crevice – it’s the scene from which a few memes surfaced over the years. </p>







<h3 id="h-5-the-end">5. The End</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fighting The End can either be an intense slog riddled with jumpscares or it can be the easiest battle in the world. Originally, users could trick the game, setting the time/date on their PlayStation 2 forward by a week once they’ve met The End, and he’d die in-game of old age… Clever, right? Otherwise, players could take part in a thrilling cat-and-mouse sniper battle across several regions of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-fear">4. The Fear</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Fear lives up to his name by basically offering up the creepiest Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fight in the game. He’s a strange, fork-tongued man who can dislocate his limbs at will, scramble up trees like a spider, and strike at Naked Snake with a crossbow in relative silence. With his remarkable camouflage, players are left to rely on sounds to track him, and he leaves traps everywhere to trip Snake up.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-the-fury">3. The Fury</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Fury is a phenomenal boss that fights the player in a suffocating battle backed up by an overwhelming flamethrower and a whole lot of anger. He’s not insanely difficult to kill, but he can devastate the player very quickly in the close-knit, phobia-inducing environment in which the fight takes place. At the end of the fight, he supernovates and explodes in a brutal, cataclysmic eruption.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-colonel-volgin">2. Colonel Volgin</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>As the big baddy in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Colonel Volgin makes for a fantastic opponent. There are plenty of secret tricks the player can use to turn the tide of battle, but his abilities alone make his face-off one of the best Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fights in the game. He’s a powerful fighter with electromagnetic and lightning powers, and visually, he’s one of the most impressive bosses in Metal Gear history.</p>







<h3 id="h-1-the-boss">1. The Boss</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>If there’s a more emotional boss battle in gaming, I don’t know what it is. At the very end of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Naked Snake must fight his mentor – The Boss. She means a huge amount to Snake, but still, he must do away with her, and that means an intense battle between the master and the apprentice must take place. It doesn’t help that the soundtrack to this fight is incredible and the setting is nothing short of beautiful. It’s such a dramatic battle, it’s the best Metal Gear Solid 3 boss fight on record.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Being Sued For ‘Artificially High Prices’ on PlayStation Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-store-lawsuit-artificially-high/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-being-sued-for-%E2%80%98artificially-high-prices%E2%80%99-on-playstation-store.1115181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-playstation-store-lawsuit-artificially-high/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed that a Dutch consumer group has filed a class action lawsuit against Sony. The organisation – Massaschade &amp; Consument – alleges that Sony is keeping prices on the PlayStation Store ‘artificially high’ and is abusing a position of power by preventing players from buying digital versions of PS4 and PS5 games elsewhere.</p>



<p>The class action lawsuit joins others that have surfaced recently in Portugal and the United Kingdom, and this particular suit is exclusively reserved for residents of the Netherlands.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-re-paying-too-much-for-playstation-games">‘You’re Paying Too Much for PlayStation Games’</h2>



<p>The class action lawsuit, which was discovered first by ‘<a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/231990/nederlandse-stichting-start-massaclaim-tegen-sony-om-prijzen-playstation-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tweakers</a>‘, states clearly in the headline that ‘you’re paying too much for PlayStation games’. The suit has dubbed the alleged overpayments ‘Sony Tax’, and it stresses that all PlayStation gamers in the Netherlands have a right to compensation.</p>



<p>On February 17, the legal body wrote to Sony to ‘hold it liable to the abuse of its dominant position and its further unlawful conduct in relation to the PlayStation 4 and 5.’</p>



<p>Netherlands residents <a href="https://www.massaschadeconsument.nl/collectieve-acties/playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can register</a> as part of the class action lawsuit for free by completing a simple form. The only requirement is that you’ve made a digital purchase via the PlayStation Store at some point since November 29, 2013. You must also be at least eight years old.</p>



<p>In a statement on the site promoting the class action lawsuit, it was explained what Sony is doing wrong:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The gaming industry is now bigger than the film, TV and music industries combined. Sony, as the manufacturer of the world’s best-selling console, is one of the most powerful – if not the most powerful – players in this market. And with such power comes responsibility. In the EU, it is illegal for large companies to abuse their position to make more profit at the expense of consumers. Yet Sony does not fully comply with these rules.</p>



<p>When you buy a digital game or in-game content, Sony ensures that this can only be done via its own PlayStation Store. Sony keeps the market for itself in this way and can keep the prices artificially high. As a result, you pay more, without getting anything extra in return. This is also called the <strong>‘Sony Tax’.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In November 2023, Sony faced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-being-sued-5-billion-class-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whopping £5 billion class action lawsuit</a> in the United Kingdom for this very same reason. That case was kicked off in 2022, but the most recent documentation about the lawsuit was published midway through 2024, and the results of the proceedings are unclear.</p>



<p>Do you think Sony has an issue with PlayStation Store prices? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
