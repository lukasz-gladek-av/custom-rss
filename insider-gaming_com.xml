<p>NetEase revealed today that Marvel Rivals has surpassed 40 million players since its release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by Daniel Ahmad on <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1892494212127502565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), NetEase released its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results today, revealing a new milestone for its hero shooter. Marvel Rivals reached 10 million players within the first 72 hours, 20 million within the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-celebrates-20-million-players-with-a-free-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two weeks</a>, and has amassed 40 million within three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The results <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-unaudited" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that their Season 1 update, which arrived in January 2025, provided them with a “surge” that helped Marvel Rivals cross the 40 million mark and become one of Steam’s top sellers and most-played games globally. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-patch-notes-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 </a>brought a host of new balancing changes to the game along with fresh content such as Fantastic 4 characters, new maps and more. </p>



<p>Moreover, NetEase’s Where Winds Meet has reached 15 million players across PC and mobile, and their Justice mobile game has topped iOS download charts for Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The financial results arrived right after an entire Marvel Rivals team in the United States was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-laid-off-as-netease-guts-entire-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly laid off</a>. The developers revealed later that this decision was made to “adjust the Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game.” You can check out the complete statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-releases-statement-on-marvel-rivals-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Tripwire Interactive has finally blessed us with Killing Floor 3 and a release date nine years after KF2. The second title delighted in the decimation and deliberate dissection of Zeds. Now, they’re back, and we’re back too to deliver unto them a three-course meal of bravado, bullets, and brain splatters.</p>



<p>Killing Floor has always been no-nonsense in what it’s trying to accomplish. Waves of Zombies (Zeds) trying to kill you, and us trying to repel their unsubtle advances with extreme violence and explosions. I spent many hours in Killing Floor 2 eliminating Zeds, earning cash, upgrading my gear, and having a tense showdown with the final boss.</p>



<p>It would appear <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-announced-along-with-closed-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a> is more of the same, and that’s a good thing. So let’s dive into the latest entry in the series and check out its launch date, platforms, and much more.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-killing-floor-3-come-out">When Does Killing Floor 3 Come Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Take that! Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>March 25 is Killing Floor 3’s scheduled release date—unless something changes at the last minute.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, March 2025 is a busy month. But, if there’s one thing we need, it’s a ferocious first-person shooter in the mix. <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Killing Floor 3</a> looks to distance itself from the pack with an affordable entry point and unique selling attributes.</p>



<h2 id="h-killing-floor-3-platforms">Killing Floor 3 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are the listed platforms for Killing Floor 3.</strong></p>



<p>I find most games releasing in 2025 are doing the same thing: Releasing on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It’s rare to see old-gen ports, and even rarer for a third-party title to get Nintendo Switch attention. The eventual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> could change things of course, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.</p>



<h2 id="h-killing-floor-3-editions-amp-price">Killing Floor 3 Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Killing Floor 3 has three different editions to consider: Standard Edition ($39.99/£34.99), Deluxe Edition ($59.99/£51.99), and Elite Nightfall Edition ($79.99/£69.99).</strong></p>



<p>There’s no ultra-deluxe-premium edition for Killing Floor 3. But there are physical copies if you want to go that route—although not all editions are available in physical form.</p>



<p>Check out each edition and its price here.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Killing Floor 3 Edition</th><th data-align="center">Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$39.99 or £34.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$59.99 or £51.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Elite Nightfall Edition</td><td data-align="center">$79.99 or £69.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>March 2025 is shaping up to be a chaotic month for video game releases. Alongside Killing Floor 3, brace yourselves for the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://www.talesoftheshire.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>.</p>

<p>A new Lord of the Rings Game is coming—Tales of the Shire. It has a release date, and we know its available platforms. You can put the swords away and forget about cave trolls as Tales of the Shire is a different type of LOTR title.</p>



<p>The early months of 2025 are quite stacked. So much so <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-the-shire-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game</a> is going under the radar. This could be for two reasons: The reception to Gollum and Return to Moira and the attention being given to other releases. But Tales of the Shire is a new type of Lord of the Rings game likely appealing to a large demographic.</p>



<p>It’s a life sim where you get to experience the day-to-day life of a hobbit in the Shire. You don’t need to pack wellies for the Dead Marshes, and Isengard can stay where it is for now. Let’s find out the juicy details for Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game has a March 25 release date.</strong></strong></p>



<p>It arrives during a busy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-biggest-video-game-releases-of-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 2025</a> with the likes of Killing Floor 3, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. <a href="https://www.talesoftheshire.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tales of the Shire</a> might be the one for you if you’re not into life sims instead of shooters, post-apocalyptic titles, and wrestling</p>



<h2 id="h-tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game-platforms">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch are the peculiar choices of platform for Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game.</strong></p>



<p>I say peculiar because seldom do you see a title release for the Switch, and not old-gen PS4 and Xbox One consoles. This is the reality of the situation, so if you do own any of these formats, you can celebrate and get ready for elevenses.</p>



<p>If you are on old-gen, don’t rule out future ports if the game succeeds.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you picking this one up as a Lord of the Rings fan? Or because you enjoy life-sim games in the region of The Sims and Stardew Valley? Plus, can Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game break the recent jinx and deliver a solid LOTR title?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-2%E2%80%99s-tower-raid-mode-is-now-permanently-in-the-game.1114101/</guid>

<p>Dying Light 2: Stay Human has a new permanent game mode, but it’s one you’ve probably played before. The team at Techland has pushed ‘Tower Raid’ into the game permanently, bolstering the intense roguelite mode with fresh challenges and mechanics.</p>



<p>As a live-service title, Dying Light 2 is regularly updated with new content drops, bounties, limited-time events, and skin packs. Out of all those deliverables, Tower Raid is one of the most positively received add-ons since the game emerged in 2022, and fans are happy to see it made into a permanent fixture in the open-world, zombie-slaying title.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fail-get-tougher-repeat">‘Fail, Get Tougher, Repeat’</h2>



<p>Tower Raid is what it sounds like. Players – either solo or with friends – are tasked with ascending a tower packed with enemies that get increasingly difficult to defeat the higher you go. There are three difficulty tiers, with the topmost level, ‘Elite’, being nothing short of punishing – but it yields incredible rewards.</p>



<p>Players are invited to pick from four classes, each boasting a unique skill set and loadout. The inherent roguelite nature of the mode means that you can mix and match your playstyles to see what works best, as every time you enter the tower, you’ll never really know what to expect.</p>



<p>To welcome the permanent mode, Techland has added new rewards to the ‘Raid Hub’, fronted by a trader called Sola. If you play Tower Raid, you can unlock:</p>



<ul>
<li>Office Day Outfit</li>



<li>Kuai Dagger</li>



<li>Silenced Pistol</li>
</ul>



<p>Amongst other things, of course.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end here, though. Techland has stressed that, after a few weeks on the market, a survey will be posted for players to give their feedback about the upgraded Tower Raid mode. That means that things could get even better.</p>



<p>Recently, Techland laid out a roadmap of content in celebration of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/">10th anniversary of Dying Light</a>. I caught up with the team to learn about what happened to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-dying-light-my-apocalypse-edition/">$386,000 collector’s edition</a>, and at Gamescom, I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/">spoke to Roger Craig Smith</a> about the upcoming release of Dying Light: The Beast.</p>

<p>The Gamescom team has revealed a monumental partnership between Gamescom Asia and the Thailand Game Show, the fruits of which will be witnessed later this year. Gamescom is the leading name in gaming events and over the last four years, the Asian representation of that label has gone from strength to strength.</p>



<p>Now, Gamescom Asia will be relocated from Singapore to Bangkok, linking up with the Thailand Game Show to welcome more visitors than ever before.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-historic-collaboration">‘Historic Collaboration’</h2>



<p>In a press release published by the Gamescom PR team, the new partnership was celebrated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This partnership is a game-changer for the region’s games industry. gamescom asia’s success has been built on a solid foundation in Singapore, where it has flourished since its inception in 2021, positioning Southeast Asia as a hub for gaming innovation. </p>



<p>By joining forces with Thailand Game Show, we are unlocking unprecedented opportunities to connect global video game players with one of the world’s most vibrant and passionate gaming communities. With its rich culture and expanding gaming ecosystem, Bangkok is the ideal stage for this exciting next chapter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The President of Thailand’s Digital Economy Promotion Agency echoed that sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The collaboration between gamescom asia and Thailand Game Show marks a significant milestone for Thailand’s growing role in the global gaming industry. This partnership strengthens our commitment to advancing digital innovation and creativity. </p>



<p>DEPA and the local gaming industry are excited to be part of this unified event, creating new opportunities for global collaboration, investment, and talent development, and reinforcing Thailand’s position as a leading destination in the digital entertainment sector.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The 2024 edition of Gamescom Asia attracted more than 40,000 attendees from 78 countries, the press release explained. It’s not as gargantuan as the core version of Gamescom, which takes place annually in Cologne, Germany, but it’s growing – and that’s all that matters.</p>



<p>This kind of ‘combination activity’ isn’t a new concept. Last year in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-mcm-comic-con-same-event/">MCM and EGX</a>, two of the biggest pop culture and gaming events in the nation, joined forces to produce one mega event.</p>
