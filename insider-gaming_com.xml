            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong is rapidly approaching a conclusion after a release date for the title was finally announced after years of waiting.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4</a>, bringing an end to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">years of development</a>, and the desire to get hands-on with the game is understandable, with our verdict being that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong is worth the wait</a>.</p>



<p>Now, players around the world are preparing for the launch and want to know if pre-orders are available, which we’ve got all the details for here.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-available-to-pre-order">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Available to Pre-Order?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ready? Image via Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> <strong>is not currently available to pre-order or purchase on any storefront.</strong></p>



<p>With the long-awaited release date of the title on the horizon, the desire to secure a copy of Hollow Knight: Silksong is understandable. However, for the time being at least, you’ll need to be patient for a little while longer for pre-order details to emerge.</p>



<p>None of the platforms where Hollow Knight: Silksong is currently available has pre-orders listed. However, those with an Xbox Game Pass subscription can add the title to their ‘Play Later’ section, which should pre-download the full game before release.</p>



<p>That will likely change as the release date of September 4 edges closer, so keep an eye out for pre-order details to emerge.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-preload-hollow-knight-silksong">Can You Preload Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<p><strong>Preloading Hollow Knight: Silksong is not currently available on any platform, though this will likely change as the release date approaches.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, storefronts do not currently have Hollow Knight: Silksong listed and available to purchase, which means that preloading the title is also out of the question for the time being.</p>



<p>The closest option to preloading currently available is through the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9n116v0599hb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft store</a>, which has a ‘Get Game Pass’ button beneath the title alongside a note that confirms the title is “coming soon to Game Pass.” If you already have Game Pass, clicking this option will provide details of your subscription.</p>



<p>Preloading Hollow Knight: Silksong in full should be an available option provided before the launch period, and, with less than two weeks until the title releases at the time of writing, it shouldn’t be a long wait.</p>



<p>Will Hollow Knight: Silksong live up to the hype and be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Developers Explain Matchmaking System After Player Criticism]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism.1277979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals developers have lifted the lid on the matchmaking system used in the title following a wrath of criticism from players.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, NetEase confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals does not use the controversial EOMM</a> matchmaking system and promised to explain how matchmaking works in a future video.</p>



<p>That video has now been shared, detailing the process of matchmaking and explaining why larger party groups of four-to-six players have been banned in higher ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-matchmaking-explained">Marvel Rivals Matchmaking, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots of detail. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the video <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1958627668536311945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter), it was explained that several factors are taken into account when queuing for matches, including team composition and your competitive score—the latter calculated by Base Points and Performance Points.</p>



<p>Base Points depend on the outcome of the match, your current competitive score, and the average competitive score of the enemy team. Performance Points, meanwhile, reflect how well you perform in the match, but this doesn’t just tally up stats from the game due to the variety of characters.</p>



<p>The longer you wait for a match, the broader the search will become. When fighting in a part, you’ll only fight against similar-sized parties.</p>



<p>Questions have been asked on why Rivals has not introduced role-based matchmaking to the game, and the answer is that it would result in longer queue times. Similarly, that’s why four-player and six-player teams at higher ranks have also been restricted in a recent update.</p>



<p>Check out the full video below.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’ve heard your feedback on matchmaking and ranking in Marvel Rivals, and your voices matter! </p><p>Check out our Lead Combat Designer, Zhiyong, as he shares our developer insights on the matchmaking and ranking system. </p><p>Watch the full video to see the systems behind the game! <a href="https://t.co/OmErw2WMgU">pic.twitter.com/OmErw2WMgU</a></p></div>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1958627668536311945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>

<p>The latest set coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket has leaked ahead of an official reveal, showing that the legendary beasts of Johto will be the main focus.</p>



<p>Leaks for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new set have been rather consistent and accurate, detailing what players can expect ahead of time before an official reveal takes place.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s A4a set, set to release next week, follows on from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-a4-card-set-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wisdom of Sea and Sky A4 set</a> released last month and is once again focused on the second generation of Pokémon.</p>



<h2 id="h-suicune-raikou-amp-entei-star-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-a4a-set">Suicune, Raikou, &amp; Entei Star in Pokémon TCG Pocket A4a Set</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a leaked trailer <a href="https://x.com/UniteVids/status/1958758609996714277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter), pack art featuring Suicune was ripped open to reveal a host of new cards, including Suicune ex, before a transition to a volcano environment where Entei ex appeared. Then, Raikou ex made an appearance.</p>



<p>The legendary trio will clearly be the stars of the new set, which could be the penultimate set before a big shake-up in Pokémon TCG Pocket that introduces Mega Evolution to the game.</p>



<p>Mega Evolutions’ arrival will mark the start of the second season in the game, potentially changing the rules and pushing the sets to ‘B’, though at this stage it’s merely speculation.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has teased a “big update” later this year, though, which aligns with suggestions it could reformat the meta and transition into the next stage.</p>

<p>In a social media post, the Splitgate 2 development team at 1047 Games promoted the #StopKillingGames campaign. It was seen as somewhat ironic by some gamers, and they took to the comment section under the post to jibe or berate 1047 following the disastrous, self-imploding launch of Splitgate 2 in June.</p>



<p>After Splitgate 2 failed to make a mark in June, hampered by controversial comments and decisions made by 1047 Games’ leadership team, the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled back to beta</a>. The fans left waiting are now holding out for <strong>another launch</strong>, but we don’t know when that’ll be.</p>



<h2 id="h-splitgate-2-didn-t-make-fps-great-again">Splitgate 2 Didn’t Make FPS Great Again</h2>



<p>The downfall of Splitgate 2 began when 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx took to the stage at Summer Game Fest to make some controversial statements about his title. He was wearing a hat emblazoned with the message <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-apologizes-for-sgf-controversy/">‘Make FPS Great Again’</a>, which was enough to trigger many gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>Following that, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-drops-fans-concerned-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some microtransaction prices</a> and design choices further impacted the Splitgate 2 launch, and once the creators moved away from the game, the player count crumbled.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the 1047 Games team was caught begging fans to still have faith:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">give us one more chance at our relaunch 🙏</p>— Splitgate 2 – Beta (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1958637786728157577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The ‘one more chance’ comment was followed up with a similar sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Totally understand we’ve disappointed. Hope we’ll be able to earn your trust back!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And in another:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve definitely made some mistakes along the way, but supporting our community is always our top priority.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s unlikely that Splitgate 2 will be able to make much of a splash when it does eventually re-emerge. The damage has been done, and despite the game boasting some innovative mechanics, players won’t forget what happened this year with the game’s original launch.</p>



<p>Are you waiting for Splitgate 2 to come out (again)? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following a string of controversies and concerns about child safety, Roblox has become the target of several campaigns demanding action, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-petition-ceo-resignation-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the resignation</a> of the CEO of the Roblox Corporation. Many believe that Roblox is shutting down in 2025, collapsing under the weight of all these scandals, but is it true, and will a Roblox ban surface this year?</p>



<p>It’s time to clear this up once and for all. Is Roblox getting shut down, and if not, why do so many people think it is?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-roblox-getting-shut-down-on-september-1st">Is Roblox Getting Shut Down on September 1st?</h2>



<p>Across social media and content platforms, a ‘hoax campaign’ was kicked off, claiming that Roblox will be banned from September 1st. This somewhat ludicrous claim came amidst an ongoing debate regarding the safety of children on the platform.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that there’s an inherent problem at the heart of Roblox. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-child-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is being sued</a> by the state of Louisiana, Chris ‘To Catch a Predator’ Hansen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chris-hansen-roblox-plans-documentary-predator-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is making a documentary</a> about it, and content creators are trapping malicious users on the platform.</p>



<p>But is this enough to warrant Roblox shutting down?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-roblox-shutting-down">When is Roblox Shutting Down?</h2>



<p><strong>Roblox is not shutting down on September 1st, or any other date. </strong>The game is not going to be taken offline because of the ongoing controversies, as it still functions as a popular platform for tens of millions of gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>Roblox indeed has an insane and very public issue right now, but it’s not enough to bring the game to a complete shutdown.</p>



<p>If you’re one of the many users wondering if Roblox is being banned, fear not – the game is safe for now.</p>



<p>Let me know on the Insider Gaming forum if you have any concerns about the security of Roblox right now.</p>
