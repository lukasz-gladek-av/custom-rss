<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s seasonal content moves on with Season 2. If you’re after the Black Ops 7 Season 2 start date and times, this hub has everything you need to know about the next season and new additions.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-reloaded-starts-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is one of the least commercially successful CoD titles in years; you’re all still playing it anyway. A steady player count means there’s an incentive for Treyarch to deliver the goods to retain the current community. What better way to do this than with a stacked second season?</p>



<p>Season 2 is looking to carry on the game’s early momentum.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-7-season-2-coming-out">When Is Black Ops 7 Season 2 Coming Out?</h2>

<p><strong>Black Ops 7 Season 2’s expected release date is currently February 5.</strong></p>



<p>Seasonal live-service models have a certain level of consistency when it comes to start dates and times. As one season ends (usually signified by that season’s Battle Pass end date and time), the next begins. Using Season 1 Reloaded’s data, it’s a fairly logical assumption that Season 2 begins on February 5.</p>



<p>If this changes, IG will update you.</p>







<h2 id="h-expected-black-ops-7-season-2-start-times">Expected Black Ops 7 Season 2 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>As pretty much all Call of Duty seasons start at 9 AM PT, you can look forward to Black Ops 7 Season 2 starting at 9 AM PT first, with other regions facing a slightly different time relative to time zones.</strong></p>



<p>No extra words needed for this one, just check out the table below to see when Season 2 should get underway where you live.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Black Ops 7 Season 2 Start Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 AM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12:00 PM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 PM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—January 9</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-new-black-ops-7-season-2-content-ranked-amp-new-maps">All New Black Ops 7 Season 2 Content: Ranked &amp; New Maps</h2>



<p><strong>Early indications are that BLOPS 7 Season will add Ranked Play for the first time in this iteration, along with new and classic maps, and the usual slew of guns and game modes.</strong></p>



<p>At this early juncture, it’s safe to assume the usual carousel of seasonal content is coming. The armory needs restocking with new toys, game modes are needed to inject new life into the core gameplay, and it wouldn’t be a new season without the new Battle Pass and cosmetics, would it?</p>



<p>But two main additions will likely dominate the headlines: Ranked and Maps.</p>



<h3 id="h-maps">Maps</h3>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-7-season-2-maps-have-already-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Black Ops 7 Season 2 Maps leaked</a> well ahead of time. They include <strong>Plaza</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Slums</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Yemen</strong>. There’s always going to be remasters, as it’s easy for the devs, and it helps boost the content count for a new season. On the other hand, no one’s going to reject the chance to play on different maps, especially classics.</p>



<p>There are likely going to be more announced.</p>



<h3 id="h-ranked-mode">Ranked Mode</h3>



<p>You’ve been asking for it, and Treyarch is finally delivering. Ranked Play is coming to BLOPS 7, and it starts with Season 2. Furthermore, it doesn’t appear to be a midseason drop either: Insider Gaming has more on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ranked-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Mode release date</a>.</p>



<p>This signals a new grind for the more experienced and hardcore users among you.</p>

<p>A new report about The Witcher 3’s upcoming rumoured DLC says it could take players to a brand-new region. </p>



<p>Talks about a new The Witcher 3 DLC have been circulating on the internet for quite some time now. Lastly, we learned that the rumoured expansion is scheduled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in May 2026</a>. Now, it seems some additional details about this expansion have surfaced online, suggesting exploration of Zerrikania. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-3-s-rumoured-dlc-could-be-centered-around-the-zerrikania-region">The Witcher 3’s Rumoured DLC Could Be Centered Around the Zerrikania Region</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw?fbclid=IwY2xjawPKJn1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQBzcnR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN Poland</a> reveals that they have been aware of The Witcher 3’s rumoured DLC for some time; however, they decided not to disclose any information until now. According to what they had learned then, it seems that The Witcher 3’s DLC will take players to a brand-new desert region, where they will encounter exotic fauna and culture, a lot like “Dune-Style” Witcher. What’s more, there are a lot of hints in the games and the books about this region. </p>



<p>The Manticore School is situated in the Zerrikanian desert, which Geralt discovered in The Witcher 3’s Blood and Wine DLC. Additionally, many characters have referenced the school or the desert in the series. There’s also speculation that this is where Ciri could take her Trial of the Grasses and become a Witcher before the arrival of The Witcher 4. </p>



<p>However, information about this new region for The Witcher 3’s DLC surfaced years ago; players should definitely treat it with caution.</p>







<p>In other news, CD Projekt RED has confirmed that The Witcher 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not release in 2026 and the new trilogy will stick to the 6-year plan</a>. Additionally, check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-sword-replica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-scale replica</a> of The Witcher’s Aerondight Silver Sword.
