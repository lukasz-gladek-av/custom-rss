            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed that two panels centered around The Division 2 will take place at Gamescom next week. The team will be hosting a meet-and-greet event alongside two presentations designed to reveal the future of The Division 2, including the ‘big Division 2 project’ that Ubisoft has just started talking about.</p>



<p>It was also noted that The Division: Resurgence, the all-new mobile game that’s in development now, will be showcased.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-big-division-2-project">What is the Big Division 2 Project?</h2>



<p>I’ve got no idea, but thanks to a new social post from Ubisoft, I know we’ll get more clues next week when Gamescom unravels.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is what the team said about what’s coming to Gamescom from Ubisoft, where The Division 2 is concerned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Division 2 will be at Gamescom this year, with two panels and two meet-and-greets.</p>



<p>Our first panel will take a look at the creative and art direction behind Battle for Brooklyn, and we’ll also give you a small glimpse at what’s coming next for the seasons.</p>



<p>In our second panel, we’ll talk about how your feedback is shaping The Division 2, share some updates about The Division: Resurgence, and reveal more about the ‘big Division 2 project’. We’ve only just started teasing it, but we’re really excited to give you an update.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you can’t make it to Cologne (hint: we’ll all be there!), you can watch both panels online across Ubisoft’s channels.</p>



<p>Battle for Brooklyn was released earlier this year and was met with positive sentiments from the community. After more than six years, The Division 2 is still alive and well, and judging from Ubisoft’s comments, it’s about to get even better.</p>



<p>Are you going to tune in to see what Ubisoft is teasing for The Division 2? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The start date and times for the Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta are vital if you want more action. The first beta destroyed all expectations, literally, on its debut, so let’s check out the Week 2 Beta and all-new content included.</p>



<p>Well, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-impressions-battlefield-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> has been worth the wait. EA and Battlefield Studios have put their blood, sweat, and explosions into BF6. The first week of the beta blew up in more ways than one by bringing in over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 players</a>—destroying CoD’s all-time Steam peak.</p>



<p>We’re not done yet, though. The Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta is back and bigger and better than before. This hub has everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-week-2-beta-start-amp-end-dates">Battlefield 6 Week 2 Beta Start &amp; End Dates</h2>

<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 beta starts on August 14 and wraps up on August 17.</strong></p>



<p>You get nearly 100 hours of pure bombastic Battlefield 6 action if you want it. The open beta might be the final chance you get to play <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> before launch.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs can be considered the game’s alpha period. This makes August a definitive beta test. With only a couple of months to go until the official Battlefield 6 release, I’d advise you to make the most of the Week 2 Beta.</p>



<p>See you on the Battlefield—revive me if you see me! </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-week-2-beta-start-times">Battlefield 6 Week 2 Beta Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>It’s confirmed that the Weekend Two Battlefield 6 Beta starts at 08:00 UTC—the same as Week One.</strong></p>



<p>I’ve already extensively covered the nature of Battlefield 6’s Week Two beta and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when you can play it again in a separate guide</a>. It includes more specific regions and time zones to help you out.</p>



<p>But yes, it’s the same start and end times as the first BF6 open beta. This should make your life a lot easier.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta">How to Play Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More maps to break. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to have played Battlefield Labs, be an EA Play Pro member, or use the Battlefield 6 website to gain access to the Week 2 Beta.</strong></p>



<p>One of the most commonly asked questions about the BF6 beta is about how you can take part. Many mistakenly believe you need to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-have-to-pre-order-battlefield-6-to-play-the-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order Battlefield 6 to play the open beta</a>. This is simply not the case.</p>



<p>The easiest of these solutions is using the BF6 site. Let me walk you through the instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 website.</a></li>



<li>Click on ‘Download Now’ on the starting screen.</li>



<li>Press ‘Select Platform’</li>



<li>Choose the platform you want to play the beta on.</li>



<li>It will take you to the format’s storefront.</li>



<li>Purchase the free beta.</li>



<li>Download the Battlefield 6 open beta on your console or computer.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-6-weekend-2-new-content">All Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 New Content</h2>



<p><strong>Week 2 introduces the new Empire State map and new game modes, including Rush.</strong></p>



<p>The first thing to note is that all content from Week 1 is back! Siege of Cairo, Liberation Peak, Breakthrough, etc, are all here for you to enjoy. The second week could have left it there, but Battlefield Studios has thrown more toys in the playbox.</p>



<p>Check out each <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new map and mode</a> in Week 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-2025-roadmap-reveals-engine-update-and-new-missions-%E2%80%98from-old-and-new-friends%E2%80%99.1269096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl was one of my favorite games of 2024. It was plagued by a pretty rocky launch, disrupted by bugs and performance issues, but I was one of those able to look beyond and see the utter gem of a game underneath. In the (almost) year that has followed the launch of STALKER 2, developer GSC Game World has worked tirelessly to improve it.</p>



<p>Recently, the team at GSC posted a new STALKER 2 2025 roadmap, uncovering everything coming to the irradiated open-world title in the coming months.</p>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-engine-rework-coming">STALKER 2 Engine Rework Coming</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525350789598676383?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GSC Game World revealed</a> that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl will get an engine update soon, porting the game to Unreal Engine 5.5.4 to further improve optimization. This will go hand-in-hand with launching ‘phase two’ of the Zone Kit, allowing for better modding with enhanced audio and narrative tools.</p>



<p>Beyond that, <strong>stacks </strong>of changes are coming to STALKER 2 with the 2025 roadmap:</p>



<ul>
<li>New anomalies</li>



<li><strong>New missions ‘from old and new friends’</strong></li>



<li>New weather scenario</li>



<li><strong>Master difficulty preset</strong></li>



<li>Extended day/night cycle</li>



<li><strong>Stashes loot rework</strong></li>



<li>Stamina and energy drinks rework</li>



<li><strong>Immersive display mode</strong></li>



<li>Player equipment UI update</li>



<li><strong>Local save backup restoration</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Not only that, but a special ‘Discord Holiday Event’ has been teased by the team.</p>







<h2 id="h-stalker-2-ps5-launch-coming-soon">STALKER 2 PS5 Launch Coming Soon</h2>



<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is set to be released on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro this year. The latter launch will bring further upgrades and enhancements to the game, leaning on the computing power of Sony’s enthusiast console.</p>



<p>For now, the game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-announced-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to PlayStation 5</a> in Q4 2025, which is in the coming months. It’ll likely receive a solid release date at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony, given that the game is playable on PlayStation 5 Pro during the event.</p>



<p>GSC capped off the STALKER 2 2025 roadmap by stating: ‘Mission targets may be moved from 2025 to later dates in case of Zone instability.’</p>
