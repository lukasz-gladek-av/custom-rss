<p>Nine esports organizations have been announced for the Overwatch Champions Series partner program. While a small handful of teams will be familiar to long-time competitive Overwatch fans, many teams once synonymous with the scene are nowhere to be seen.</p>



<p>With the open Overwatch esports ecosystem entering a new era, and while the game itself is challenged by a new “rival”, it’s an important year for Blizzard’s iconic hero shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-meet-the-owcs-partner-teams">Meet the OWCS Partner Teams</h2>



<p>Nine teams have been <a href="https://esports.overwatch.com/en-us/news/owcs-2025-stage-1#:~:text=Competition%20Memo.-,OWCS%20Partner%20Teams,-As%20announced%20in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invited</a> to participate in the OWCS partner program for 2025: four from Asia, three from EMEA (Europe and the Middle East), and two from North America. The regional distinction is based on the roster of players, not where the organization is based or headquartered. Partnered teams will receive a portion of proceeds from in-game team-themed items, as well as direct invites to their region’s stage one main event.</p>



<p>The list of partnered teams includes: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gen.G</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Twisted Minds</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Virtus.pro</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Spacestation</strong> (North America)</li>



<li><strong>Team Liquid</strong> (North America)</li>



<li><strong>Crazy Raccoon</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>T1</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>Team Falcons</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>ZETA DIVISION</strong> (Asia)</li>
</ul>



<p>Of the list of nine organizations, only two were active during the Overwatch League days: T1 was the academy team for the Seoul Infernal (formerly Philadelphia Fusion), and Gen.G owned the Seoul Dynasty. Several of the now partnered teams entered Overwatch last year in the first season of the open OWCS ecosystem, following the closure of the Overwatch League at the end of 2023.</p>

<p>Missing from this list are some organizations that were amongst the biggest names of the OWL era. Notably, NRG, the organization that owned and operated two-time OWL champion San Francisco Shock, did not receive a partner program invite. This shocked both <a href="https://x.com/amiller/status/1869534757488644122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NRG staff members</a> and long-time OWL fans, especially after NRG finished 4th in the OWCS 2024 World Finals as the NRG Shock. Fans are also somewhat surprised by there being only two NA slots, considering one is occupied by a Team Liquid organization that last competed in Overwatch in 2017.</p>



<p>There is some renewed excitement in Overwatch esports following the move from the franchised OWL to open OWCS. The 2024 OWCS Finals <a href="https://escharts.com/news/overwatch-champions-series-finals-2024-viewership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a slightly higher viewership peak</a> than the one reached at the 2023 OWL Finals. However the game itself is now facing arguably its greatest competitor ever in the recently released Marvel Rivals from NetEase. While the newer game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very slowly embracing esports</a>, a number of former Overwatch pros have already made the jump.</p>
