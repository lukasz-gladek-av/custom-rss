<p>The VALORANT Esports division of Riot Games announced today that Sony gaming gear brand INZONE will operate as a primary sponsor for the VCT EMEA league through the end of 2026. INZONE branded monitors will be primary display used at the Riot Games Arena in Berlin.</p>



<hr>



<p>Officially, INZONE will act as a “Main Partner and the Official Gaming Display Partner” for the VCT EMEA league. INZONE is no stranger to VALORANT sponsorship: the brand already sponsors the use of its headsets in the VCT. Two prominent organizations in Fnatic and ZETA DIVISION also have pre-existing sponsorship deals with the company. INZONE says Fnatic even helped design the monitor used on stage, which features a unique picture mode optimized for VALORANT.”</p>



<p>As part of the sponsorship deal, INZONE will put INZONE M10S OLED monitors in “coach rooms, practice areas, and co-stream rooms,” per the official announcement. They will also be highlighted at the “1v1 station in the fan zone” during match days. INZONE branding and advertisements have already been featured on the broadcasts, alongside other sponsors PaysafeCard and Red Bull.</p>



<p>While the addition of INZONE as a main sponsor is a welcome addition to VALORANT Esports and Riot Games, many viewers are curious to see if and when gambling sponsors are eventually implemented. This past December, Riot confirmed to Insider Gaming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-policy-change-betting-sponsorships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teams in Americas and EMEA would be allowed to “explore” partnerships with Riot approved betting platforms</a>. At the time, Riot stated that no betting brands would appear on broadcasts or socials: “Riot-owned channels will stay betting-free.” But based on the success of betting partnerships with teams, Riot could easily change the rules. Back in 2021, after barring TSM from using cryptocurrency exchange partner FTX in their name, Riot themselves <a href="https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/sources-lcs-lands-seven-year-ftx-sponsorship-deal-as-first-crypto-exchange-partner-of-any-riot-league" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">landed a seven year sponsorship deal</a> between the LCS and FTX.</p>
