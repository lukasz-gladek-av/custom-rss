<p>One of the strengths of Marvel Rivals as a multiplayer title is that every hero is viable in some capacity. But with 37 playable characters (so far) spread across three different roles, there are some heroes in Marvel Rivals that are just more popular than others.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the most popular heroes in Marvel Rivals, according to their pick rates.</p>



<h2 id="h-highest-hero-pick-rates-in-marvel-rivals-march-2025-season-1-5">Highest Hero Pick Rates in Marvel Rivals (March 2025, Season 1.5)</h2>



<p>For this list, we’re taking into account the pick rates in both competitive and quick play. For competitive, we’re using current data from tracker sites <a href="https://rivalstracker.com/heroes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsTracker</a> and <a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsMeta</a>. For quickplay, we’re using the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero Hot List</a> from the official Marvel Rivals website. Even though the Hero Hot List was last updated February 17th, it’s a better source of quickplay rates than the incomplete data on RivalsTracker and RivalsMeta.</p>



<h3 id="h-strategists">Strategists</h3>



<h4 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger">Cloak &amp; Dagger</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cloak &amp; Dagger is the most popular hero in Marvel Rivals, in both competitive play and quick play. The strategist duo has been picked in <strong>50.44% of competitive games</strong>, and <strong>18.84% in quick play games</strong>, the most of any hero. Cloak &amp; Dagger’s dual ability set provides high healing potential and elite damage at close range. Even after a nerf, the Eternal Bond ultimate ability is still an incredible tool for crowd control and teamfights. She’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloak-dagger-marvel-rivals-most-picked-hero-is-getting-a-major-buff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due for a buff to her primary healing ability</a>.</p>



<h4 id="h-invisible-woman">Invisible Woman</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Second to Cloak &amp; Dagger is another strong strategist in Invisible Woman. She’s the second most picked hero in with a <strong>44.39% pick rate in competitive</strong>, and a <strong>18.12% pick rate in quick play</strong>. Invisible Woman’s ability to push and pull enemy players into her Psyonic Vortex is extremely disruptive. Like Cloak &amp; Dagger, Invisible Woman’s ultimate can instantly alter a teamfight, and she has great team up potential with the rest of the Fantastic 4 members.</p>



<h3 id="h-vanguards">Vanguards</h3>



<h4 id="h-doctor-strange">Doctor Strange</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Doctor Strange is the most popular choice of Vanguard in quickplay. He has a <strong>27.10% pick rate in competitive</strong>, but a <strong>15.50% pick rate in quickplay</strong>, which is third highest overall behind Cloak &amp; Dagger and Invisible Woman. Doctor Strange is the most popular vanguard thanks to his defensive Shield of Seraphim, and he has one of the most devastating ultimates in the Eye of Agamotto.</p>



<h4 id="h-magneto">Magneto</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Magneto has the slightest edge on Doctor Strange in competitive pick rate, but he’s not quite as popular in quick play. He has a <strong>27.80% pick rate in competitive</strong>, but a <strong>12.60% pick rate in quickplay</strong>. Magneto is a shield expert, with a deployable Metallic Curtain that blocks all projectiles, and a Bulwark bubble he can cast on himself or an ally. His left and right-click attacks deal lots of damage to squishy duelists and strategists, and the special attack from the Metallic Fusion team up makes Scarlet Witch a must-have if playing Magneto.</p>



<h3 id="h-duelists">Duelists</h3>



<h4 id="h-winter-soldier">Winter Soldier</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are so many duelists to choose from in Marvel Rivals, but Winter Soldier has emerged as the most popular. Winter Soldier has a <strong>25.20% pick rate in competitive</strong>, the most of any duelist, and an <strong>8.09% pick rate in quickplay</strong>, second only to Moon Knight. Most of his ability kit is built around using his Bionic Arm, and the Ceaseless Charge passive that reloads automatically and grants bonus health is exceptionally powerful. And virtually every Marvel Rivals player has been traumatized by the word ‘again’ and an enemy Winter Soldier that doesn’t end.</p>



<h4 id="h-spider-man">Spider-Man</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Many Marvel Rivals players, including myself, feel like they run into a Spider-Man in every game. He has a <strong>19.77% pick rate in competitive</strong>, second most for a duelist, and a <strong>6.96% pick rate in quickplay</strong>. Spider-Man players live to endlessly annoy the enemy team, using their hyper mobility to swing in, deal damage, and escape. Arguably nothing in Marvel Rivals has produced more broken keyboards then a well-timed ultimate from Spider-Man.</p>



<hr>



<p>An honorable mention goes to Moon Knight, who’s the most picked duelist in quickplay, but falls down to 8th among duelists in competitive. A big dishonorable mention goes to Black Widow, who has the lowest pick rates of any hero: 4.19% in competitive and 2.76% in quick play.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be supported on Steam Deck when the game launches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a new <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1899863156995903687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter), the official Assassin’s Creed account confirmed that Shadows will be playable through the Steam Deck on the day the game releases. Currently, the developers are “awaiting the level of classification from Valve,” and more information about the Steam Deck release, such as performance details, is expected to be revealed soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players are pretty excited about Assassin’s Creed Shadows releasing on the Steam Deck; many have described it as a massive win for the company. Others are concerned about optimisation issues, with a whole <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1j9paif/assassins_creed_shadows_steam_deck_support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit thread</a> discussing whether or not the game will run well. Some have also pointed to a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A</a> from last month, where the game’s Technology Director stated Shadows is not compatible with the Steam Deck as it is below their minimum specs for PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the creative producer of Assassin’s Creed Shadows stated that the DLC will have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-dlc-features-a-spookier-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different and ‘spookier’ vibe</a>.
