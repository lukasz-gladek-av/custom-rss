<p>A new trailer for a Tomb Raider Remake has seemingly leaked online, possibly for The Game Awards later tonight. </p>



<p>Geoff Keighley <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this week that Tomb Raider will be part of The Game Awards show. With many players patiently waiting to hear about the franchise’s future, they might not have expected the developers to announce a remake at the event; however, it seems like that might be the situation. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-remake-trailer-seemingly-surfaces-online">Tomb Raider Remake Trailer Seemingly Surfaces Online</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-new-game-trailer-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, a user called Play4Index has posted a new video on <a href="https://x.com/Play4Index/status/1999132304979955718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that appears to be a new trailer for a Tomb Raider remake. In the 30-second video, we see Lara Croft wearing the same blue and beige outfit, exploring a jungle. It is a cinematic trailer, where we know the character swinging around, climbing surfaces, cartwheeling through flaming booby traps, and firing her pistols. Towards the end, we see her facing a dinosaur, and the video ends abruptly. </p>



<p>What’s more, earlier today, a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-leak-spoilers-potential-box-art-and-some-info-of-tr1-remake-%E2%80%9Cretelling%E2%80%9D-has-leaked.1379143/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ResetEra leak</a> also hinted at a Tomb Raider Remake. This leak consisted of the box art for the title, along with some screens from the leaked trailer. On the box art, the supposed Tomb Raider Remake is titled Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. However, there is no official confirmation from the developers, and players will have to wait for the official announcement later today to know for sure whether this game is coming. </p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-prime-video-amazon-sigourney-weaver-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien star</a> is in talks to feature in Prime Video’s Tomb Raider series.

<p>It’s time to put on nostalgia glasses as Fortnite OG Season 7 brings back classic content from years ago. As usual, the official update’s patch notes outline all changes in Fortnite OG Season 7, and Insider Gaming has the full list.</p>



<p>Epic Games rarely misses with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kim-kardashian-fortnite-guess-what-players-saying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, and the company smashes it with the concept of bringing back entire seasons of older content. While new seasons continue to be littered with new memories and favorite moments, older seasons throughout the years have brought joy.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-season-7-release-date-all-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite OG Season 7</a> turns back the clock to 2018, so check out the patch notes in the new update.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A new, but old chapter. Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s not a surprise to learn that the biggest switch-ups for Fortnite’s Season 7 content include a reworked map, unvaulted and vaulted weapons, returning skins, and much more.</strong></p>



<p>You can play the Season 7 content either in normal or Zero Build modes, and it’s mostly just new, returning content. The biggest visual and performance improvements fix some terrain issues and missing foliage. Outside of that, it’s mostly a welcome back for X-4 Stormwings, Stink Bombs, and other fun content.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-og-season-7-patch-notes">All Fortnite OG Season 7 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Here is the entire collection of Fortnite OG Season 7 Patch Notes that arrived with the December 11 update.</p>



<h3>Unvaults and Vaults</h3>



<p>“<strong>IN: </strong><em>Dual Pistols, Balloon, Stink Bomb, Scoped Assault Rifle</em></p>



<p><strong>OUT:</strong> <em>Clinger, Port-A-Fort, Chiller Grenade, Burst Assault Rifle, Six Shooter</em></p>



<p><strong>Available with Season launch: </strong><em>Suppressed Sniper Rifle, Scoped Revolver, Boom Box, Glider (consumable item)</em></p>



<p>In addition to returning items, the Season 7 map has returned with the Ice King’s glacier colliding with the Island once more! <strong>Polar Peak, Frosty Flights, and Happy Hamlet</strong> POIs and locations have all returned in all their frigid, OG majesty.</p>



<h3 id="h-x-4-stormwings-fly-once-more">X-4 Stormwings Fly Once More!</h3>



<p>Air superiority returns. Whether you’re flying solo or bringing your whole wing squad along for the ride, step into the pilot’s seat and fly combat-ready.</p>



<p>The<strong> X-4 Stormwing</strong> comes equipped with a mounted machine gun, built for intense dogfights but also for pressuring ground targets from above. Stay frosty though – firing for too long will overheat the weapon!</p>



<h3 id="h-improvements-changes-bug-fixes">Improvements, Changes, Bug Fixes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Ascenders and Ziplines have been added and updated in both OG Build and Zero Build, letting you zip, climb and rotate wherever the fight takes you!</li>



<li>Fixed a visual issue with certain items not displaying the grid-like effect when viewed on the ground.</li>



<li>Fixed a visual issue causing inconsistent shading on the Race Track when viewed from above.</li>



<li>Smoothed out sharp terrain edges and added missing foliage at following locations to better match OG: Fatal Fields, Snobby Shores, Salty Springs</li>



<li>Removed misplaced foliage from the cliffside near Junk Junction and multiple spots at Pleasant Park. No more inaccurate bush camping!</li>



<li>Corrected visible seams and terrain texture mismatches near Loot Lake and Dusty Divot so everything looks cleaner.</li>
</ul>



<p>Chill out and revisit the winter wonderland of OG Season 7, and share with us your favorite moments from this blast from the icy past!</p>



<h3 id="h-looking-ahead-infinity-blade-shing-shings-onto-the-og-island-later-in-the-season">Looking Ahead: Infinity Blade shing-shings onto the OG Island later in the Season!</h3>



<p>It’s that time again – the Infinity Blade returns in all its glory. You’ve got some time to <em>sharpen </em>your skills before it drops, bringing mythic leaps, sweeping slashes and flashy swings with it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The ‘World’s First Game Created 100% Through AI’ Has a Playable Demo]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/</link>
            <guid>1379800</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier today, a team developing a game called Codex Mortis circulated PR materials for the first playable demo of this ‘necromantic survival bullet hell’. Those PR materials proudly declared the game ‘the world’s first fully playable game created 100% through AI’, which is an interesting way to promote a title to journalists, but here we go.</p>



<p>In the documentation provided, you can learn how Codex Mortis has been created ‘entirely through AI algorithms and tools’.</p>



<p>This will be a fun one.</p>







<h2 id="h-unapologetically-100-ai">Unapologetically, 100% AI</h2>



<p>The PR materials circulated by one ‘Darek Crunchfest’, confirmed that a playable demo for Codex Mortis can be explored <strong>now </strong>on Steam. The game, assembled by a developer called GROLAF, doesn’t try to paint a pretty picture – this is a 100% AI-driven title, and it’s proud of that fact.</p>



<p>The game’s bio on Steam reflects that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Death is your weapon. Mix five schools of dark magic, unleash devastating spell synergies, and raise undead armies in this necromantic bullet hell. Infinite builds, solo or co-op – embrace the forbidden and dominate. 100% AI-driven development.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4095390/CODEX_MORTIS_Demo/#app_reviews_hash"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Crunchfest noted in the PR email: ‘Oh, and one more thing: it’s probably the&nbsp;<strong>world’s first fully playable game created 100% through AI</strong>.’</p>



<p>It’s easy to see that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4095390/CODEX_MORTIS_Demo/">trailer on Steam is AI</a>. It’s by no means disguised and is probably the most blatant representation of AI imaginable. It even boasts plenty of classic AI tells and artefacts.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Codex Mortis | Official Demo Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5Oxs8lPT8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In Codex Mortis, players must assemble a ‘death squad’ and go toe-to-toe with all kinds of demonic enemies while wielding powerful magical abilities and weapons. The goal is to collect ‘ancient pages’ before an immortal boss hunts the player down and eliminates them, which is a similar concept to Vampire Survivors, with which this game has been aligned.</p>



<p>The email even mentioned that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Vampire Survivors meets Guild Wars-style builds.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’re a fan of Vampire Survivors, you might even say that Codex Mortis doesn’t look that bad, but it depends on how troubled you are about the use of AI to fully create a game. For some, it’s not an argument, as artificial intelligence is enabling small developers to make their games much more efficiently, so that’s another side of the argument.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>Sandfall Interactive has revealed how much it cost to develop and release Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In a new profile piece for the New York Times, the developer of one of 2025’s biggest hits talked about the game’s development, the approach to creating the game, and more.</p>



<p>As part of that talk, Sandfall claims that Clair Obscur was built for less than $10 million.</p>







<p>In order to achieve that goal, the studio chose to not have the game be a true open-world title. They say that they decided to use other classic role-playing game (RPG) design choices such as having battles take place in specific “arenas” rather than out in the overworld and having the map be a “miniature version of the explorable realm”. </p>



<p>Since its launch in April, Clair Obscur has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. It’s also been up for numerous awards, including Game of the Year from shows like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/golden-joystick-awards-2025-all-award-winners/">Golden Joystick Awards</a>—which it won—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>. </p>







<p>What do you think of the budget for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 being less than $10 million? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down below and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Rockstar Games is busy readying everyone for the arrival of GTA 6, but continues to work on GTA Online in the background, going as far as dropping a new gameplay feature to enrich the raucous online game further.</p>



<p>Each day feels longer than the last in the wait for Grand Theft Auto 6. Rockstar Games is busy developing and polishing one of the most anticipated games of all time. This doesn’t mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-players-can-get-free-500000-through-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a> is kicked to the curb, though, and if you look carefully enough, you might see the game has WORKED OUT something new for you.</p>

<p>The ability to work out and visit gyms in GTA Online has been discovered ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-reveal-trailer-is-already-two-years-old/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>‘s full launch.</p>







<p>GTA Online has continued to receive updates and improvements over the years, but this feels like quite a meaningful update so far into the game’s lifecycle.</p>



<p>As shown by <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown"></a><a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTA 6 Countdown</a>, you can work on your Bench Press, stretch out on some yoga mats, do some curls, and other gym-related curricular activities. Always remember: Swole is the goal!</p>

<p>YouTube creator NikTek has gone as far as speculating that this could be Rockstar Games testing out the incorporation of gym features for GTA 6. It’s not like this would be the first time we’ve ever seen these mechanics in a GTA game, as San Andreas famously used life-sim features such as hunger, weight gain, strength, and other biological attributes to influence your gameplay.<a href="https://x.com/NikTek"></a></p>

<p>What do you think Rockstar’s intentions with this addition are? Is it simply a fun new feature for GTA Online, or is it obvious foreshadowing for GTA 6?

<p>The PC Ram pricing problem continues to get worse for consumers. What was once one of the cheaper parts when building a custom PC, buying RAM has gotten to the point where it’s more expensive than buying even a brand-new graphics card for some.</p>



<p>A few weeks back, Insider Gaming reported on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-prices-have-soared-by-up-to-250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fact that RAM prices have risen</a> by up to 250%. Well, fast forward to mid-December, and those prices now look “affordable”. There have been increases in PC RAM prices by, on average, another 25% since November 26. Some have even gone up by another 50% or more if you were looking at picking up a 64GB pack. </p>







<p>That means modern day graphics cards like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series and AMD Radeon RX 9000 series are becoming cheaper in comparison. Need specific examples? A new ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5070 is available for $549.99 while a ASRock Radeon RX 9070 XT can be had for $599.99. Even an RTX 5070 Ti, which costs an average of $749.99, is cheaper than some 64GB packs, like the Corsair Vengeance. </p>



<p>Below you’ll find a comparison of prices from November 1 to November 26 to December 11. All of them have continued to rise, with reports suggesting that it’s not going to slow down. It’s even gotten to the point that traditional budget-friendly brands are being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/micron-shutting-down-its-consumer-crucial-ram-and-ssd-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completely shuttered</a> in order to focus on the needs of the big AI companies that are causing the problems. </p>

<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out to multiple manufacturers to discuss what consumers can do and if they are going to do anything to make sure they still have options when building a PC. As of publishing, however, no company has given answers.</p>
