<p>One of life’s little joys is learning<strong> how many satchels for a sheet metal door</strong> in Rust. It’s a memorable moment, your first-ever raid against your neighbor, and likely to stick with you. In the early game, you likely won’t craft a metric ton of explosive ammo, and C4 is still a few workbenches away, but a satchel is easily accessible and open to most skill levels. Here’s how many it takes to get through your neighbor’s front door!</p>







<figure></figure>



<p>Assuming your raid target upgraded to a sheet metal door, which most Rust players should do immediately after building a base of any size, it will take a few satchels to blow through. In total, you need four satchels for a sheet metal door in Rust. That’s not many, and crafting satchels is not overly expensive. But hey, that’s just door number one!</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Door Type</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Satchels</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wooden Door</td><td data-align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sheet Metal Door</td><td data-align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Garage Door</td><td data-align="center">9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Armored Door</td><td data-align="center">12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A sheet metal door has 250 health points and is more damage-resistant. A single satchel will deal approximately 61 HP damage to the door. As such, it requires a minimum of four satchels, with 6 HP leftover on the door after the fourth explosion, so you could waste a fifth satchel or use explosive ammo to blast the last few HP. Basically, hit it with anything else. Don’t waste a fifth satchel!</p>



<p>If you’re playing in a group, which Rust genuinely promotes, try to farm for C4. It’s a much better tool for raiding in Rust.</p>

<p>Into The Breach, a United Kingdom-based esports organization, is winding down its operations due to its CEO’s embezzling of funds, leaving the organization in an “unsustainable” position. According to one of the organization’s CS2 players, the CEO “scammed” players out of thousands.</p>



<hr>



<p>Per an <a href="https://x.com/ITBesports/status/1883909874561831187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a> from the organization, an investigation into the company began after “recent events…highlighted significant mismanagement.” ITB discovered that “an individual entrusted with all financial and monetary decisions was embezzling funds.”</p>



<p>On X, ITB CS2 player Owen “smooya” Butterfield <a href="https://x.com/smooyacs/status/1883910676902769137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed</a> the finger at CEO Sam “STM” Macedonio, claiming he was the one laundering money and scamming $500,000 from his own players. In his own post on X, Macedonio <a href="https://x.com/SlayTheMinotaur/status/1883911595975233999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted fault</a>, owing the decisions he made to a “destructive, alcoholic narcissist” side of him “hellbent on self-immolation.” Macedonio noted there will be “several legal consequences” that he will accept and face.</p>



<p>In the replies of his post, Macedonio said that Into The Breach made around £5.5 million between 2023 and 2024. He said that he took around £600,000 in “director’s loans,” which he claims he blew on “benders and self-harm action.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In his post, Macedonio made mention of the breakout moment for Into The Breach, when the relatively unknown organization surprised the Counter-Strike world with a playoff run at the BLAST Paris Major in 2023. The success brought on by that run prompted the organization to return to Dota 2 and Rainbow Six, and also enter competitive Halo for the first time.</p>



<p>Both Into The Breach and Macedonio have said that any available funds will be given to players who have lost money. All players across the various ITB esports divisions will now become free agents.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo Games is finally delivering a PC port for the popular open-world action RPG Rise of the Ronin on March 11, 2025. This guide will take you through the minimum and recommended system requirements for Rise of the Ronin.</p>



<p>Rise of the Ronin was released for PS5 in 2024, where players got to experience this open-world action RPG for the first time. The game is set in Japan’s Edo period, where you shape your destiny by interacting with actual historical figures and learning their ideologies. The game’s highlight was its gameplay, with players instantly falling in love with the plethora of combat styles available for the title’s various weapons. Additionally, the world created by Team Ninja is nothing short of beautiful.</p>



<h2 id="h-rise-of-the-ronin-pc-system-requirements">Rise of the Ronin PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>To experience Rise of the Ronin on PC in all its beauty, the developers have provided a set of minimum and recommended system requirements. However, players will need 16 GB of RAM, 180 GB of SSD Storage Space and a broadband internet connection to run the game on either set of requirements. Additional notes state that “poor SSD performance may affect gameplay”, and multi-channel memory architecture is recommended. </p>



<p>Check out Rise of the Ronin PC’s minimum and recommended specifications per the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam listing</a>. </p>



<h3 id="h-minimum">Minimum</h3>



<p>The minimum requirements are not very demanding. Players only need an Intel Core i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (VRAM 8GB) GPU. This minimum set of requirements will allow Rise of the Ronin to run at 1080p/30FPS.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Specifications</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Minimum</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel Core i5-10400 or better, AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or better</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or better, AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (VRAM 8GB) or better</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB of RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">180 GB SSD</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Audio</td><td data-align="center">16-bit stereo with 48KHz playback</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">OS</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10/11 64bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX Version</td><td data-align="center">DirectX 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Network</td><td data-align="center">Broadband Internet Connection </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-recommended">Recommended </h3>



<p>Rise of the Ronin PC’s recommended system requirements allows players to experience the game at 1080p/60FPS under the standard graphics settings (upscaled). The recommended CPU and GPU specifications aren’t very high either, with the player needing an Intel Core i5-10600K/AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Super (VRAM 8GB)/AMD Radeon RX 6700XT (VRAM 12GB), respectively. The recommended requirements will allow players to experience Rise of the Ronin as the developers intended. </p>
