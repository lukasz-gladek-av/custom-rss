<p>Life continues to find a way, with Jurassic World Evolution 3 marking the next stage in the franchise with some major changes, and we’ve got the exact release date and start times for the title.</p>



<p>The third iteration of the franchise, which began back in 2018, Jurassic World Evolution 3 takes a big step forward with the debut of baby dinosaurs and modular building, features that are crucial in sister titles Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster.</p>



<p>If you want to count down the hours until you can build the park of your dreams, or sacrifice guests to a T. Rex, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-jurassic-world-evolution-3-coming-out">When is Jurassic World Evolution 3 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Baby dinos. Image via Frontier Developments</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be released on October 21 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>With no delays to the release date, the game is ready for launch to mark the next era of the franchise for Frontier Developments, following on from two previous iterations of the game.</p>



<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is Frontier’s big release of the year, following on from Planet Coaster 2 in 2024, but the exact time you can dive into the park management sim depends on where you are located in the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-jurassic-world-evolution-3-start-time">Do we Know The Jurassic World Evolution 3 Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Store listings confirm that Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be available to play from 7 AM PT on October 21, with players elsewhere in the world needing to wait until later in the day.</strong></p>



<p>Confirmed by the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP2377-PPSA25153_00-JWEVOLUTION30000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 has a global release and unlocks simultaneously for all players. This isn’t too surprising, as online features are minimal, so there’s no need for a staggered launch to ease stress on the servers.</p>



<p>You will be able to preload Jurassic World Evolution 3 onto your console or PC ahead of launch, reducing the wait time when the doors do finally open, but there’s no way to queue jump the title.</p>



<p>The table below shows the Jurassic World Evolution 3 start times in major time zones across the world.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-long-to-beat-digimon-story-time-stranger-game-length-explained.1319404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger is an action-packed adventure through time and space, with plenty to offer, but as it lands in a period stacked of new releases, questions about the game length are understandable.</p>



<p>With hundreds of Digimon to collect, a gripping story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and plenty of optional content to explore, prepare to sink many hours into Time Stranger.</p>



<p>For a full breakdown of exactly how many hours you can expect to put into Digimon Story: Time Stranger, for both a generic run and a completionist run, you’ll find all the details in our game length guide here.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-digimon-story-time-stranger">How Many Hours to Beat Digimon Story: Time Stranger?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It will take around 40 hours to complete the main story of Digimon Story: Time Stranger, though that time is extended by side quests and difficulty level.</strong></p>



<p>Time Stranger features a host of side-quests to tick off, which add hours to the duration of the game, and it will take even longer if you want to tackle the longer side quests, like defeating all of the opponents in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-paradise-colosseum-great-omni-carnival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradise Colosseum</a>.</p>



<p>The length of the game also depends on the difficulty setting you’re playing on, and whether you can defeat bosses in a single attempt or need to retry several times. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-digimon-story-time-stranger-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Digimon Story: Time Stranger Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>A full completionist run in Digimon Story: Time Stranger will take an additional 100 hours on top of the main story.</strong></p>



<p>This is due to the vast number of tasks that need to be ticked off to boast 100% completion, including obtaining all Digimon, collecting all Digimon Cards, and defeating opponents in the Paradise Colosseum.</p>



<p>There are a whopping 471 Digimon in the game, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-dlc-season-pass-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more to be added in DLC</a>, and 451 cards to collect. Along the way, there’s also a hefty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-achievements-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of achievements and trophies</a> to earn.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, side quests can take a significant amount of time on their own, especially completing the Colosseum. With some battles only unlocking once specific requirements are met, this pumps up the required amount of time to play by a large amount.</p>

<p>FIFA 23, the last FIFA game by EA, will shut down its servers on October 30, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who don’t know, the agreement with Electronic Arts and FIFA came to an end a couple of years ago, with the former <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-officially-unveils-ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-soccer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling</a> EA Sports FC to replace the franchise. The EA FC series began after FIFA 23, making that the last FIFA game that EA created. </p>



<h2 id="h-fifa-23-servers-are-shutting-down-on-october-30">FIFA 23 Servers Are Shutting Down on October 30 </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-sports-fifa-era-is-officially-coming-to-an-end-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ</a>, confirmation that FIFA 23 will shut down its servers was announced on the EA Service Updates <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/legal/service-updates/a-h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a>. If you scroll down to ‘F’, the new update states that online services will no longer be available for Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. Players will still be able to play the game offline; however, no online updates, online co-op, Ultimate Team, Pro Clubs, or any other online features will be available to the player. </p>



<p>The era for new EA FIFA games had already ended when the deal between the two parties ended. However, players now have a few days left to play the last EA FIFA game online, until the next one becomes available. Regarding the next one, 2K Games could potentially be developing the next mainline FIFA video game. EA has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-developers-arent-afraid-of-potential-fifa-2k-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that even if the rumors are true, they welcome the competition and “know how tough it is to make a football game.”</p>



<p>In other news, the first new FIFA game after the breakup with EA has officially been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-new-fifa-game-post-ea-breakup-announced-and-its-not-what-players-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>, and it’s not the game fans likely expected. Additionally, read about Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/">addressing the rumors</a> surrounding a possible partnership between FIFA and 2K Sports.

<p>Excitement levels for the Fortnitemares event in Fortnite continue to rise, and further teasers have been shared by Epic Games showing the big collabs fans can expect.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s annual Halloween event has become a fan-favorite, with previous years including collabs with Saw, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, among others, and Epic Games is going big again.</p>



<p>The event, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-fortnitemares-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to kick off this week</a>, is yet to have full official details shared, but we know have confirmation of three major collabs.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnitemares-collabs-2025">Fortnitemares Collabs 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Peely-good collabs. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Official teasers were <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1975685374996312433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Reddit</a> by the Fortnite team, showcasing promo art featuring Ghostface, Scooby-Doo, and R.E.P.O alongside recognisable Fortnite characters and items.</p>



<p>The Scooby-Doo Mystery Crew are depicted surrounded by thorns, likely a nod towards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doja-cat-is-coming-to-fortnite-as-fortnitemares-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doja Cat’s Mother of Thorns skin</a>, alongside a terrified Loot Llama, while Ghostface was shown with the reflection of a terrified Peely on his knife.</p>



<p>Finally, characters from R.E.P.O were shown with long arms and legs in order to fit the Fortnite style, a terrifying look in itself, running away from a zombie.</p>



<p>The build-up to Fortnitemares has already seen the return of several horror-themed outfits to the Item Shop, including Ash Williams, Leatherface, and there’s still more expected to be revealed in the coming days, including a Terrifier collab.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether any skins will be available for free through the event or if they are merely appearing in the Item Shop for purchase.</p>



<p>Usually, Fortnite makes some cosmetic items available to earn for free during Fortnitemares, although last year’s content did not include any free outfits.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-platforms/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-powerwash-simulator-2-coming-to-switch-1-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-all-platforms-explained.1319311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 is a highly anticipated sequel to a game that is truly relaxing and rewarding to play, but will it be as easily accessible as the original?</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-and-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The game is set to release</a> just a couple of short weeks following a trailer announcing when to expect it, so now is the best time to figure out if you’ll be able to play it.</p>



<p>If you are still stuck on the Nintendo Switch 1, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One, here are all of the platforms that PowerWash Simulator 2 will release on.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-powerwash-simulator-2-coming-to">What Platforms is PowerWash Simulator 2 Coming To?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Futurlab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>PowerWash Simulator 2 is only releasing on Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It will not be available on the original Nintendo Switch 1, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One.</strong></p>



<p>While this may be disappointing to some players, it’s not necessarily the most surprising move. For starters, <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Futurlab</a>, the development team for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-confirmed-for-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>, is an indie studio, and these days, they are self-publishing the game, where the original had Square Enix money backing it. We highly doubt that the team has been focused on developing their new game for the older consoles, instead focusing on making new features work on better hardware.</p>



<p>In 2025, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have been on the market for 12 years, and the Nintendo Switch has already hit eight years. As is the case with the passage of time, these consoles are very outdated these days, though they have lived very extended lives, with some games still being released on them.</p>



<p>Even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-is-sunsetting-some-playstation-4-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony is gearing up to start ending support of PlayStation 4 features</a>, so it’s not surprising that a game like PowerWash Simulator 2 hasn’t been developed with the older hardware in mind, even though it likely could be playable.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-powerwash-simulator-2-ever-come-to-nintendo-switch-1-playstation-4-or-xbox-one">Will PowerWash Simulator 2 Ever Come to Nintendo Switch 1, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no official word as of now about the prospects of PowerWash Simulator 2 ever coming to Nintendo Switch 1, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One, but we would be very surprised if it ever happens.</strong></p>



<p>As stated above, especially in the case of the PS4 and Xbox One, this is older, weaker hardware that not many people want to develop for anymore. This is the kind of thing that happens to every console generation. Sooner or later, it just isn’t feasible to keep releasing games on it, though that isn’t particularly reassuring with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-chair-shots-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how much prices are going up in gaming lately</a>.</p>

<p>Are you still on the older generation of consoles and disappointed about the PowerWash Simulator 2 platforms? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
