<p>Elon Musk recently expressed his intention to ‘make video games great again’ on the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in 2022. It has been just a few weeks since Elon Musk admitted to cheating in games like Path of Exile and Diablo, and despite being a contributor to problematic areas of the industry, he now intends to found an AI-powered dev studio.</p>



<p>In a recent post, the ‘xAI’ profile invited users to email in to chase jobs revolving around ‘designing AI games first principles’.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-potential-is-incredible">‘The Potential is Incredible’</h2>



<p>Elon Musk was aired out a couple of weeks ago for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-cheated-diablo-poe-admit/">cheating by sharing his accounts</a> in Path of Exile and Diablo. He didn’t care about the revelation going public, and now he has decided to single-handedly save the gaming industry, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891396362404565341" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaning on the quip</a> made famous by his new best friend, President Donald Trump:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s got to be done. </p>



<p>Make video games great again!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Trump, Musk lacks originality in the attempted coining of that phrase. The billionaire tech titan made this comment in response to a post suggesting that he’s ‘fed up with woke politics and DEI destroying the games industry’.</p>



<p>And of course, these comments came days after Musk branded games journalism as ‘garbage’. And to think I once branded him one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/">most successful streamers in history</a>!</p>



<p>Musk followed up today with <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1892087111055974879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another bold statement</a> on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Join us to make revolutionary video games using AI. </p>



<p>The potential for a dynamically generated video game using AI is incredible!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many users commented on these posts hoping that the use of AI would be confined to ‘backend processes’ to better automate a human-led development ecosystem, but that’s probably not the case. Elon Musk is no stranger to cleaning house and stripping teams down to the bare bones.</p>



<p>In an ideal world, the space-mad, eccentric billionaire would probably have Grok manufacture entire games at the press of a button. The scary thing is, that he’s surrounded by such capable people that it’s probably not too far from becoming a reality.</p>



<p>What do you think about Elon Musk’s desire to ‘make gaming great again?’ Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft and Xbox have announced a new generative AI technology known as Muse that could help with game preservation. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy blog post</a> going over the new tech, Microsoft says that there is a belief that Muse can change how games are preserved and how players experience classic titles.</p>



<p>“Today, countless classic games tied to aging hardware are no longer playable by most people,” Fatima Kardar, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of gaming AI said. “Thanks to this breakthrough, we are exploring the potential for Muse to take older back catalog games from our studios and optimize them for any device.”</p>



<p>Due to it still being early in hits lifecycle, no examples of how exactly the Muse technology can work with game preservation on Xbox were shared, but it seems like Microsoft is gung ho about the possibilities.</p>



<p>“We believe this could radically change how we preserve and experience classic games in the future and make them accessible to more players,” Kardar said. “To imagine that beloved games lost to time and hardware advancement could one day be played on any screen with Xbox is an exciting possibility for us.”</p>



<p>If you want to read more about the Muse technology, Microsoft has a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full research blog</a> on what went into its development.</p>
