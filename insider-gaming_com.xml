<p>The wait between Resident Evil games is unbearable. In some ways, it’s great that the franchise isn’t an annual release, or it could taint the greatness. However, if you’re like everyone else, and in a Zombie-like state waiting for the ninth main game, this guide has the latest details on Resident Evil Requiem early access and if there’s a demo to play.</p>



<p>Are you excited for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Requiem</a>? Of course you are. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> has sold an estimated 100-150 million copies worldwide and has both hardcore and mainstream appeal—it’s the best of both worlds. </p>



<p>But it’s T-Virus…sorry, T-minus one week and counting until Resident Evil Requiem, and the world is heading for an outbreak unless there’s early access or a demo.</p>

<p><strong>Capcom is breaking hearts by not allowing Resident Evil Requiem to have early access before launch.</strong></p>



<p>There are superior Deluxe and Collector’s Editions to enhance your overall Requiem experience, but you can only get your hands on the content on February 27, like everyone else.</p>

</ul>



<p>No special edition has early access, there’s no cool promotion that gets you in a day early, and definitely, there’s no Resident Evil Requiem early access.</p>



<p>On the other hand, it’s well-known that Requiem’s physical copy street date has been broken by nearly two weeks! </p>



<p>That’s right, while you stare at the clock and mark the days on the calendar, some people will have already finished the game once or twice before you’ve even had a chance to install it! If you see people playing it early, this is why.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-resident-evil-9-have-a-demo">Does Resident Evil 9 Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no Resident Evil Requiem demo in sight, and this could be the first Resi title in a while to offer no downloadable hands-on demo.</strong></p>



<p>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard’s Beginning Hour demo was incredible. It managed to feature no discernible action, but delivered a riveting, claustrophobic-inducing snippet of what was to come, AKA Jack Baker trying to carve your face up.</p>



<p>Village’s demo stepped up the intensity a notch and served as an equally compelling chunk of the upcoming game.</p>

</ul>



<p>As it stands, though, Resident Evil Requiem doesn’t have a demo. There was a belief that after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/state-of-play/" id="1515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026 PlayStation State of Play</a> show, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> would drop a demo before launch. This didn’t happen, and the world felt like a sadder place because of this.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible that Capcom could still do this, and if the company drops a brief road into Requiem before February 27, we can all scream together in delight—and definitely scream at the demo.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s an odd decision by Capcom not to have a demo this time around?

<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta has the worst rating on Metacritic out of all the games from the God of War franchise. </p>



<p>The new 2D Metroidvania God of War title was shadowdropped during the latest PlayStation State of Play event. Since then, we have also seen the series’ original creator share harsh comments about the title. Now that the review numbers have popped up, it doesn’t seem to be performing well compared to the others. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-rating-falls-under-70">God of War: Sons of Sparta Rating Falls Under 70</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/god-of-war/new-god-of-war-game-sons-of-spartas-early-metacritic-score-places-it-as-the-worst-in-the-series-with-even-the-divisive-ascension-over-10-points-higher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, if you head to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/search/god%20of%20war/?page=1&amp;category=13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MetaCritic.com</a> and search for ratings for all God of War games, it is pretty evident that Sons of Sparta is falling short. The 2018 God of War and Ragnarok are at the very top, both with a score of 94. Additionally, all the titles from the Greek Trilogy also score above 90. What’s more, the PSP instalments, Ghost of Sparta and Chains of Olympus, are also considerably higher rated than the recently released game. </p>



<p>The worst-rated God of War game to date was God of War: Ascension, with a score of 80. However, Sons of Sparta falls even further with its score coming in at 69, which has a 69 rating based on critic reviews and a 6.6 score based on user reviews. Insider Gaming has also reviewed Sons of Sparta, giving it a score of 7 and calling it “a pretty good game that will cater more toward God of War fans than Metroidvania enthusiasts seeking the next big thing.
