<p>Microsoft is reportedly making changes to where its hardware is built. According to Nikkei, Microsoft is looking to move manufacturing of its Surface devices out of China as early as 2026.</p>



<p>The report (<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/supply-chain/microsoft-aims-to-make-most-new-products-outside-china-from-2026-sources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywalled</a>) says that Microsoft will look to move data center servers, component production, and device assembly out of the country. They say that Microsoft has asked multiple supppliers to help with preparation for the move.</p>



<p><strong>“The scope is quite wide and covers components, parts and product assembly for new product introductions of both notebook computers and server products,” </strong>a supply chain executive told Nikkei.<strong> “Microsoft hopes all of these can be manufactured entirely outside of China starting from 2026 at the earliest.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as server production, one source told the outlet that Microsoft had already started moving server production out of China. It’s said that Microsoft has requested <strong>“at least 80% of the bill of materials (BOM) for servers come from outside the country.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the Surface production, Nikkei says that Microsoft is “pushing to increase non-China production of the Xbox videogame consoles”. That said, there hasn’t been any sort of requirement made to bring all Xbox manufacturing out of China yet. </p>



<p>This report of Microsoft’s manufacturing plans comes as trade tensions between China and the United States intensify. Donald Trump has threatened to place 100% tariffs on goods from China on November 1st, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/13/trump-meeting-xi-china-tariffs/86672514007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">though a meeting between</a> Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could cool those threats.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>During the latest The Crew Showcase, it was announced that The Crew 2 has received a new update today, October 16, introducing a Hybrid Mode (offline mode).</p>



<p>The Crew 2’s offline mode was announced back in September 2024, and earlier this year, Ubisoft Ivory Tower <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-will-begin-testing-the-crew-2-offline-mode-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that testing for it would begin on April 30. Within just a few months, the new Hybrid Mode will be delivered and was shadow-dropped in an update today. </p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/motorfest/news-updates/44AueZeJRbz9H2BxrCJueZ/what-you-cant-miss-from-the-crew-showcase-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the developers of The Crew 2 announced that their brand-new offline mode is available today. The latest update will allow players to switch between the original online experience and the latest Hybrid mode. The Crew 2 was built on online multiplayer, so some features will not be available, including multiplayer modes, global rankings, and livery sharing, which require an internet connection. </p>



<p>The developers will provide a full breakdown of the differences between the original online mode and The Crew 2’s new offline Hybrid mode in a dedicated article. This article will also include details on how players will access and manage their offline save files in the latest update. The developers also stated that “This update represents a major milestone in our commitment to ensuring long-term access to The Crew 2 for all players.” </p>
