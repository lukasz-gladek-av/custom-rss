<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 dropped twelve years ago, and it’s still one of the best-selling games around. That’s because of GTA Online, the multiplayer component to GTA 5 that has proven to be a live-service cash cow for more than a decade. It’s what keeps the beating heart of GTA still pumping today.</p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed by Rockstar Games that Michael de Santa, played by Ned Luke, is <strong>finally coming back </strong>to GTA via a new update – GTA Online: A Safehouse in the Hills. The timeline has moved forward, though, and he has noticeably aged.</p>



<h2 id="h-michael-is-back-in-gta-online">Michael is Back in GTA Online</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Rockstar Games revealed that Michael de Santa is headed back to GTA Online in the next major update, which gives players the opportunity to purchase a staggering mansion in the hills of Los Santos:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Prime luxury real estate for those who've reached the highest rungs of the criminal ladder arrives on Dec 10 in GTA Online: A Safehouse in the Hills.</p><p>The monumental update also features a new action-packed adventure, new vehicles to collect and much more: <a href="https://t.co/xGottYirhm">https://t.co/xGottYirhm</a> <a href="https://t.co/cCsNpe25AW">pic.twitter.com/cCsNpe25AW</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1996956990141075837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>While other expansions have been backed by other characters, such as Lemar, Lester, or Martin Madrazo, this is the first time that a Michael de Santa has fronted an update. When GTA Online came out, characters like Trevor Philips (Steven Ogg) had smaller roles, and Franklin (with Chop) resurfaced a while ago, but Ned Luke is back in the booth for Michael de Santa for the first time in almost 15 years.</p>



<p>Ned Luke responded to the post with an excited sentiment:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans of Grand Theft Auto were constantly shocked by Rockstar Games’ apparent reluctance to expand GTA 5 with any kind of expansions, even though we know they were in the works, but later cancelled. This is how we get to revisit those characters after all these years, it seems.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Player Makes Shocking Realization About Game’s Ending]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-ending-shocking-realizatio/</link>
            <guid>1374568</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov now has an <strong>ending</strong>. You read that right; there’s now a way to finally escape from Tarkov and deliver on everything promised in the game over the last ten years of development. This is a new element in the game as of November 15, and with the arrival of 1.0, there’s a new campaign that players can ultimately complete to get the hell out of dodge.</p>



<p>It was only earlier this week that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/">first person in the world</a> managed to complete Escape from Tarkov, and since then, others have popped up. In a shocking social realization, some players have found out that Battlestate Games has played a sick and twisted game that has, until now, been kept a complete secret.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-go-with-a-full-team">Don’t Go With a Full Team</h2>



<p>On social media, Axel, a popular Escape from Tarkov creator, posted an image showing what happens when you push through Escape from Tarkov’s final mission with <strong>a full squad</strong>. After you’ve all valiantly fought your way through Terminal, you’re presented with a drastic, horrifying message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Zubr boat cannot take everyone. The evacuation will begin only when there are 3 people left on the pier.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that, if you have four or five players, <strong>someone has to die</strong>. Given that this is Escape from Tarkov, it costs absolutely nothing to turn around and drop the man standing next to you, but who decides who lives and who succumbs right at the very end of the game?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s truly representative of how sadistic Battlestate Games can be with this spearhead extraction shooter title that has often been dubbed the most challenging game ever made.</p>



<p>Fans of Escape from Tarkov commented on Axel’s post, and many of them immediately understood the drill. It’s a kill-or-be-killed world out there, and if you want to get that ultimate achievement for escaping from Tarkov, you’ll need to eliminate one of your buddies, potentially fracturing a friendship.</p>



<p>Have you managed to get to the end of Escape from Tarkov yet? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what ending you managed to get.</p>

            <guid>1374505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been officially announced that Netflix is set to buy Warner Bros. in 2026 as part of a whopping $82.7 billion deal. Not only will Netflix acquire the rights to numerous Warner Bros. IPs, such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and DC Comics, but it’ll also acquire all of Warner Bros. Games studios.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. has been no slacker in the gaming industry, either. Some major studios will be shifting to Netflix’s ownership, though whether the acquisition will affect their development remains to be seen.</p>







<p>This acquisition is certain to send shockwaves across every corner of the entertainment world, and the gaming sector is no exception. Warner Bros. Games oversees eight major studios, all of which are now set to feel the effects of Netflix’s takeover in one way or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-studio-owned-by-warner-bros-games">Every Studio Owned By Warner Bros. Games</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>In total, Warner Bros. Games oversees eight major studios—all of which will now come under Netflix’s ownership.</strong></p>



<p>These teams span a wide range of scale and specialties. From blockbuster franchises like Mortal Kombat to the critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham series, each studio has played a role in shaping some of gaming’s biggest hits. With such a diverse line-up moving to a new parent company, the industry will be watching closely to see how Netflix steers their future.</p>



<p>Here’s a breakdown of every studio currently operating under the Warner Bros. Games banner:</p>



<h3 id="h-avalanche-software">Avalanche Software</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The magical world of Harry Potter. Credit to Avalanche Software.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Avalanche Software have been around since 1995, and they’ve produced a variety of games over the years. Their most recent release was the incredibly popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, though they’d had some success developing some Disney titles throughout the 2010s, such as Disney Infinity and Toy Story 3. </p>



<p>In regard to their upcoming projects, all eyes are on a sequel. There’s long been speculation that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-a-priority-for-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy 2 is in development</a>, with the studio admitting that it’s a priority going forward.</p>







<h3 id="h-netherrealm-studios">NetherRealm Studios</h3>



<p>There’s one major franchise that people think of when NetherRealm Studios is mentioned: Mortal Kombat. The team is widely regarded as royalty in the fighting-game genre, and their other flagship series, Injustice, delivers the same high-impact combat through a DC Comics lens.</p>



<p>While a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-3-film-confirmed-warner-bros/">Morta</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-3-film-confirmed-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">l K</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-3-film-confirmed-warner-bros/">ombat 3 movie</a> is officially in development, the future of the games themselves remains uncertain due to Warner Bros. Games’ acquisition. Speculation has been swirling for years about NetherRealm’s next project, with fans divided between two possibilities—a follow-up to Mortal Kombat 1 or a long-awaited Injustice 3. Whatever their future holds, fans will be hoping the Netflix merger doesn’t impact development.</p>



<h3 id="h-rocksteady-studios">Rocksteady Studios</h3>



<p>The Batman: Arkham series reshaped the landscape of modern superhero games, and Rocksteady Studios is the team that made it happen. Prior to Arkham Asylum, the studio’s only release was Urban Chaos: Riot Response on the PS2 and Xbox—but their work with Batman propelled them into industry stardom.</p>



<p>Their most recent project, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, landed with a mixed reception, yet Rocksteady remains a major force with the potential for a significant comeback. As for what comes next, nothing has been confirmed. Rumours continue to circulate about a return to Gotham with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-working-on-new-batman-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Batman title supposedly in development</a>, but until an official announcement arrives, the studio’s next move remains firmly under wraps.</p>



<h3 id="h-tt-games">TT Games</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Fire up the Bat Signal. Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>TT Games, or Traveller’s Tales, encompasses four major subsidiaries, though they all work together under the same umbrella. These are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Traveller’s Tales</strong>. Primary Division of TT Games.</li>



<li><strong>TT Fusion</strong>. Division focused on porting games to handheld platforms.</li>



<li><strong>TT Games Publishing</strong>. Division focused on handling publishing duties.</li>



<li><strong>TT Odyssey</strong>. Mobile games developer.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re somehow not aware, these guys are responsible for the hugely successful and childhood-defining LEGO games. Its upcoming title, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, is slated for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 release</a> and will probably be the first Warner Bros. game published following the Netflix acquisition announcement.</p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-montreal">WB Games Montreal</h3>



<p>It’s no secret that Warner Bros. Games Montréal has had a mixed run in recent years. The studio supported Rocksteady on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and before that developed Gotham Knights, another Arkham-adjacent project that met with a fairly lukewarm reception.</p>



<p>Despite this, it appears the team isn’t finished with the DC universe just yet. Reports suggest they’re now working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wb-games-montreal-is-working-on-a-aaa-live-service-title-based-on-dc-comics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new AAA live-service title set within the DC Comics world</a>. Exactly what form that will take is still unclear, but fans will be hoping it avoids the pitfalls of previous superhero live-service attempts—particularly the comparisons to Marvel’s Avengers.</p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-boston">WB Games Boston</h3>



<p>Warner Bros. Games Boston is best known for its work on MMO-RPGs, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online and The Lord of the Rings Online.</p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-new-york">WB Games New York</h3>



<p>WB Games New York works with developers to build online features and communities for video games. It’s not directly involved with developing a standalone video game. </p>



<h3 id="h-wb-games-san-francisco">WB Games San Francisco</h3>



<p>A Division of Warner Bros. Games that specifically works on mobile releases and titles, utilising IPs such as Harry Potter and the DC Universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-warner-bros-games-amp-netflix-merger">What Is The Warner Bros. Games &amp; Netflix Merger?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix has officially acquired Warner Bros.</a> and all of its subsidiaries in a blockbuster deal reportedly valued at $82.7 billion—one of the largest entertainment acquisitions in history. The move marks a seismic shift in the media landscape, placing an enormous collection of globally renowned properties under the Netflix banner and signalling the company’s most aggressive expansion into traditional film, TV, and gaming yet.</p>



<p>The deal grants Netflix ownership of an expansive catalogue of IPs, ranging from Harry Potter to the full DC Comics universe. This also encompasses Warner Bros.’ prestigious film and television library, animation houses, HBO programming, and various production entities across the globe.</p>



<p>Crucially, the purchase includes Warner Bros. Games, bringing all eight of its studios—and their respective franchises—into Netflix’s growing gaming portfolio. That means Netflix now owns teams behind major titles such as Mortal Kombat, Batman: Arkham, LEGO games, Middle-earth, and more.</p>
