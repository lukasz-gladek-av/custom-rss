<p>The next entry in the handheld PC market is coming from Lenovo, and it’s aiming to be a more affordable option for players looking to get their first device. And now, ahead of its reveal, the first look at the new Lenovo Legion Go S has appeared online.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/exclusive-first-renders-of-the-budget-friendly-legion-go-s-pc-gaming-handheld-are-here-most-likely-powered-by-the-new-amd-z2-platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> has been sent official renders for the new device that confirms past rumors of a white shell for the device. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As you can tell with the renders, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-best-available-handheld-gaming-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">device looks a lot like</a> the original Legion Go aside from a couple small button placement changes and touchpad removal. It also appears that, unlike the original Legion Go, there are no removable controllers.</p>



<p>According to past leaks, the Legion Go S will utilize AMD Ryzen Z2. This configuration — known as Rembrandt — features Zen3+ cores, which will likely put it less powerful than the Z1 Extreme system with Zen4 cores that the original Legion Go features. More specifically, the Ryzen Z2 series will have 8 CPU cores and could feature RDNA2 graphics.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that none of the specs have been officially confirmed by Lenovo. Until that happens, some of the aforementioned features of the device could change. Lenovo is expected to reveal its new handheld systems at, or around, CES 2025 in January. The new next-generation of handheld PCs should also be revealed around the same time. </p>



<p>What do you think of the look and details of the Lenovo Legion Go S? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>The worlds of Call of Duty and Squid Game are set to collide in an epic Black Ops 6 event for the ages. The shock of the announcement was quickly replaced by hype and thoughts the event could be a banger. Let’s see what’s in store for us all when we become contestants in Activision’s newest game.</p>



<p>I’ve learned not to be surprised by Call of Duty events anymore. This sentiment went out the window when Operation Monarch had me gunning down Godzilla and King Kong in Warzone’s Caldera. I’ve also clashed with the Colossal Titan, and seen soccer GOAT Lionel Messi battle with bullets. Now is the turn of Squid Game in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squid-game-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Squid Game and Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Collab</a> was announced on Dec. 2, 2024, and it could be one of the most memorable in history.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-amp-squid-game-event-release-period">Black Ops 6 &amp; Squid Game Event Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Will you risk it all? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Black Ops 6 and Squid Game event doesn’t have a specific date yet, but we do know it’s currently penciled in to arrive in <strong>January 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty x Squid Game Teaser trailer—released on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty YouTube channel</a>—is only 29 seconds long, but it features some teasing imagery, along with the January 2025 statement.</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-reloaded-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</a> is expected to launch around this period, so stay tuned for lots of incoming content all at once.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-black-ops-6-amp-squid-games-event">What to Expect From Black Ops 6 &amp; Squid Games Event</h2>



<p>Activision has yet to pull the curtain back on any Black Ops 6 &amp; Squid Game event details for now—which is a shame as I’m eager to know what’s coming, but it’s fun to dream.</p>



<p>If you didn’t know Squid Game is one of the most successful TV series, ever—period. It’s critically acclaimed, won countless awards, and surpassed billions in terms of viewership. </p>



<p>Based on Squid Game’s content (and previous CoD events) I would expect to see a raft of <strong>Squid Game Operator Skins</strong>—with Squid Game uniforms likely to sell like hotcakes. I also think a <strong>special limited-time mode</strong> based on the show is a given, and it’s hard not to imagine it not being either Red Light, Green Light, or some sort of multi-stage Gauntlet Mode eliminating players. </p>



<p>Finally, expect a ton of objectives and tasks related to the event, offering an array of bonuses: <strong>Double XP Tokens, Emblems, Sprays</strong>, and the usual CoD goodie bag of cosmetics.</p>



<p>Please keep checking back as we will update this page the second we learn more about the exciting Black Ops 6 event.</p>

<p>Chances are, if you’re reading this, you’ve seen Squid Game. Are you excited for Season 2 of the show? What’s your favorite moment?

<p>Counter-Strike has been the most popular competitive shooter for well over a decade, spawning an esports scene that features several legendary tournaments each calendar year. Even after the switch to Counter-Strike 2, the scene remains as popular as ever thanks to its plethora of tournaments, including the illustrious Majors.</p>



<p>Here are the best Counter-Strike tournaments to look forward to in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-counter-strike-2-tournaments-in-2025">Best Counter-Strike 2 Tournaments in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-iem-katowice">IEM Katowice</h3>



<p>The Intel Extreme Masters series of tournaments have been a staple of Counter-Strike esports for years. Katowice has been the setting for several excellent events for more than a decade, and 2025 will be no different. Winning Katowice also gets a team one step closer to winning the Intel Grand Slam and its separate $1 million prize.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: January 29, 2025 – February 9, 2025</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 24</li>



<li>Prize Pool: $1,000,000 (estimated, based on previous iterations)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-blast-rivals-spring-2025">BLAST Rivals Spring 2025</h3>



<p>BLAST has been a regular feature in the Counter-Strike tournament schedule since 2017, and earned the honor of hosting the last CS:GO Major before the switch to CS2. In 2025, <a href="https://blast.tv/cs/news/BLAST-premier-updated-format" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAST is switching its tournament format</a>, with seasons that culminate in a Rivals tournament that crowns the top team in the world.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: April 28, 2025 – May 4, 2025</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 8</li>



<li>Prize Pool: TBD</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-the-blast-tv-austin-major">The BLAST.tv Austin Major</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via BLAST and Stephanie Lindgren</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Majors are the most prestigious events in the Counter-Strike circuit, and in 2025 the Major returns to North America for the first time since 2018. BLAST will organize just its second Major ever in Austin, Texas, which will also be <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40062/sources-majors-to-expand-to-32-teams-from-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the last Major</a> to utilize the Regional Major Rankings events to determine qualification.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: June 9, 2025 – June 22, 2025</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 24</li>



<li>Prize Pool: $1,250,000</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-the-cs2-winter-major">The CS2 Winter Major</h3>



<p>The second of the two Majors scheduled for 2025 is still a long ways away. StarLadder will <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/articles/sources-cs2-the-second-2025-major-will-be-organized-by-starladder-in-budapest/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reportedly host the Major</a> for the first time since before the COVID-19 pandemic, in Budapest, Hungary, though that information has not yet been confirmed by Valve. This will be the biggest Major yet, with the format expected to grow to include 32 teams.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: December 1, 2025 – December 14, 2025 (reported)</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 32</li>



<li>Prize Pool: $1,250,000</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just the biggest events of the year. The beauty of the Counter-Strike ecosystem lies in how large the scene is as a whole, with hundreds of events each year ranging from top-tier international tournaments to local LANs.</p>
