<p>Following a stunning run in Shanghai that saw Team Spirit eliminate both Liquid and MOUZ, the squad has secured a prestigious place in the tournament’s grand final. The team will be joined by either FaZe Clan or G2 Esports once the remaining semi-final fixture wraps up in just a couple of hours.</p>



<p>It has been a stellar run thus far for Team Spirit, and the squad has contributed to some of the most-viewed matches in the tournament until now.</p>

<p>The Perfect World Shanghai Major has a $500,000 grand prize waiting for the victor, and at this point, it could be Team Spirit, FaZe Clan, or G2 Esports that lifts the trophy. It has been a relatively close-matched event thus far, and some players are appreciative of the challenge.</p>



<p>For instance, FaZe Clan’s <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40552/karrigan-i-want-vitality-g2-and-spirit-why-not-make-it-the-hardest-major-playoff-run-ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Karrigan</a> – one of the most storied competitors in CS history – set out a path ahead of him and his team that many would fear:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I want Vitality. I want G2 in the semis, and I want Spirit in the final. That’s three teams we normally haven’t beaten the whole year, why not make it the hardest Major playoff run ever? I’m down for that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Team Spirit’s qualification into the grand final wasn’t easy going for the squad. MOUZ put up a solid fight, particularly in the opening round on Nuke. This map saw Spirit’s prodigy, donk, secure his second-worst performance of the year, emerging with a rating of just 0.36 and a KD of 6 – 17.</p>



<p>The team regained, of course – and now they sit poised to secure the biggest single prize they’ve ever nabbed in Counter-Strike esports.</p>

<p>In recent days, the Call of Duty League scene has been up in arms about the widely debated sudden ‘dismissal’ of Pred from OpTic Texas. The rumours circulated like wildfire after the Australian pro player was removed from OpTic Texas’ starting roster and Cuyler ‘Huke’ Garland was picked up.</p>



<p>Last night, Huke debuted (again) with OpTic, going face-to-face with Vancouver Surge, his old team, and promptly impressing fans everywhere with how quickly he gelled with the team. In some ways, it was a homecoming for Huke – but some OpTic Texas fans are still displeased with how Pred is being treated in the wake of his removal.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-can-do-whatever-we-want">‘We Can Do Whatever We Want’</h2>



<p>In a post-match interview, OpTic’s Kenny, a two-time world champion, explained why Huke was such a solid pickup following the team’s win over Vancouver Surge:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think Cuyler (Huke) was the perfect player for us.</p>



<p>We can do whatever we want because our pacing is just so fast.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Huke’s dominance was displayed perfectly during the fixture against Vancouver Surge. It wasn’t a close match-up by any means, with OpTic Texas losing the opening Hardpoint and then proceeding to wipe the floor with Surge at every given opportunity, starting with a 6 – 1 scoreline in Search.</p>



<p>Like Shotzzy, Huke has insane movement capabilities, and Black Ops 6’s Omnimovement mechanics have only served to heighten those in-game talents.</p>



<p>Of course, if Vancouver Surge had beaten OpTic Texas following the Huke pickup, fans in the Green Wall would have been singing a very different tune. Regardless of the circumstances, it would have been nothing but slander and accusations against the squad for dropping Pred.</p>



<p>Do you think grabbing Huke was a good move for OpTic Texas? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
