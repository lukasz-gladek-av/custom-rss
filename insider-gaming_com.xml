<p>As 2024 winds down, another game studio has closed its doors for good. Deceive Inc. developer Sweet Bandits Studios has announced that it is shutting down, effectively immediately.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/a-message-from-sweet-bandits.2340721/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">forum post</a> on Tuesday, the Canadian studio announced that it is “no more” after reaching “the breaking point for the studio”.</p>



<p>“After a long and difficult road of trying to get Deceive inc. in a state where it could thrive, we have reached the breaking point for the studio, unable to continue this adventure with you,” the studio said.</p>



<p>“While this is a moment of great sadness for us, we are happy to have been given the chance to create this universe and share it with you all. We were amazed by the passion of this community and this has been a driving force for us all along, pushing us to try and make this project reach the potential it has. We’ve put our heart and soul into this game and nothing makes us happier than seeing it resonate with other people across the world.”</p>



<p>Sweet Bandits launched Deceive Inc. in 2023 to a “very positive” response from players on Steam. According to the studio, they are working with publisher Tripwire Interactive in order to maintain the game and keep it online.</p>



<p>“We will share news with everyone once we have more details,” they said. “In the meantime, servers and game access will continue as they have been.”</p>



<p>While the company didn’t confirm how many people have lost their jobs, the <a href="https://www.sweetbanditsstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s website</a> says that it had 18 employees. It’s unclear, however, if that number was still accurate.</p>

<p>Torn Banner Studios, the developers behind No More Room in Hell 2 and Chivalry 2, have announced layoffs amid a “restructure” at the company. </p>



<p>The news was announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/torn-banner-studios_a-message-from-steve-piggott-torn-banner-activity-7269735996861091841-xf_y/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> by CEO Steve Piggott.</p>



<p>“Today I want to share some unfortunate news for Torn Banner Studios,” Piggott said. We have made the very difficult decision to undergo a restructure and reduce some of our talented workforce.</p>



<p>“As a fully independent, self-funded developer, we’re up against many challenges. Our team is navigating this process with a tremendous amount of care and appreciation for those that are impacted. Torn Banner Studios would not be the place it is today without the dedication, passion, and accomplishments of these great people.”</p>







<p>Piggott continued to say that No More Room in Hell 2’s development will continue on, and that the studio is “fully committed as we move forward with a full 1.0 release in 2025”. The game, he says, is “central to our goals as a studio”.</p>



<p>“We are still actively working on everything we’ve spoken about in our roadmap, and more,” he said. “Torn Banner will continue to work hard to develop the game alongside our community.”</p>



<p>The studio’s other game, Chivalry 2, will have servers remain active after the game received its final update earlier this year.</p>



<p>Those being let go at the company will receive severance packages and are able to keep their work computers.</p>



<p>“We’ll also be working hard to help people find positions at other studios where we can,” Piggott added.</p>



<p>At this time, it’s unclear exactly how many people are being let go from Torn Banner Studios in this round of layoffs. Insider Gaming has reached out for clarification, and will update this article should a response be received.</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a> lost across 170+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000.</p>
