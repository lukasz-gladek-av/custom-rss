<p>The start date and times for the Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta are vital if you want more action. The first beta destroyed all expectations, literally, on its debut, so let’s check out the Week 2 Beta and all-new content included.</p>



<p>Well, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-impressions-battlefield-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> has been worth the wait. EA and Battlefield Studios have put their blood, sweat, and explosions into BF6. The first week of the beta blew up in more ways than one by bringing in over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 players</a>—destroying CoD’s all-time Steam peak.</p>



<p>We’re not done yet, though. The Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta is back and bigger and better than before. This hub has everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-week-2-beta-start-amp-end-dates">Battlefield 6 Week 2 Beta Start &amp; End Dates</h2>

<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 beta starts on August 14 and wraps up on August 17.</strong></p>



<p>You get nearly 100 hours of pure bombastic Battlefield 6 action if you want it. The open beta might be the final chance you get to play <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> before launch.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs can be considered the game’s alpha period. This makes August a definitive beta test. With only a couple of months to go until the official Battlefield 6 release, I’d advise you to make the most of the Week 2 Beta.</p>



<p>See you on the Battlefield—revive me if you see me! </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-week-2-beta-start-times">Battlefield 6 Week 2 Beta Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>It’s confirmed that the Weekend Two Battlefield 6 Beta starts at 08:00 UTC—the same as Week One.</strong></p>



<p>I’ve already extensively covered the nature of Battlefield 6’s Week Two beta and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when you can play it again in a separate guide</a>. It includes more specific regions and time zones to help you out.</p>



<p>But yes, it’s the same start and end times as the first BF6 open beta. This should make your life a lot easier.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta">How to Play Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Beta</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More maps to break. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to have played Battlefield Labs, be an EA Play Pro member, or use the Battlefield 6 website to gain access to the Week 2 Beta.</strong></p>



<p>One of the most commonly asked questions about the BF6 beta is about how you can take part. Many mistakenly believe you need to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-have-to-pre-order-battlefield-6-to-play-the-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order Battlefield 6 to play the open beta</a>. This is simply not the case.</p>



<p>The easiest of these solutions is using the BF6 site. Let me walk you through the instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 website.</a></li>



<li>Click on ‘Download Now’ on the starting screen.</li>



<li>Press ‘Select Platform’</li>



<li>Choose the platform you want to play the beta on.</li>



<li>It will take you to the format’s storefront.</li>



<li>Purchase the free beta.</li>



<li>Download the Battlefield 6 open beta on your console or computer.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-6-weekend-2-new-content">All Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 New Content</h2>



<p><strong>Week 2 introduces the new Empire State map and new game modes, including Rush.</strong></p>



<p>The first thing to note is that all content from Week 1 is back! Siege of Cairo, Liberation Peak, Breakthrough, etc, are all here for you to enjoy. The second week could have left it there, but Battlefield Studios has thrown more toys in the playbox.</p>



<p>Check out each <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new map and mode</a> in Week 2.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Name</th><th data-align="center">Type of Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Closed Weapon Conquest &amp; Breakthrough</td><td data-align="center">New Game Mode</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Empire State</td><td data-align="center">New Map</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rush</td><td data-align="center">New Game Mode</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Squad Deathmatch</td><td data-align="center">New Game Mode</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-roadmap-2025-engine-update-new-missions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-2025-roadmap-reveals-engine-update-and-new-missions-%E2%80%98from-old-and-new-friends%E2%80%99.1269096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl was one of my favorite games of 2024. It was plagued by a pretty rocky launch, disrupted by bugs and performance issues, but I was one of those able to look beyond and see the utter gem of a game underneath. In the (almost) year that has followed the launch of STALKER 2, developer GSC Game World has worked tirelessly to improve it.</p>



<p>Recently, the team at GSC posted a new STALKER 2 2025 roadmap, uncovering everything coming to the irradiated open-world title in the coming months.</p>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-engine-rework-coming">STALKER 2 Engine Rework Coming</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525350789598676383?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GSC Game World revealed</a> that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl will get an engine update soon, porting the game to Unreal Engine 5.5.4 to further improve optimization. This will go hand-in-hand with launching ‘phase two’ of the Zone Kit, allowing for better modding with enhanced audio and narrative tools.</p>



<p>Beyond that, <strong>stacks </strong>of changes are coming to STALKER 2 with the 2025 roadmap:</p>



<ul>
<li>New anomalies</li>



<li><strong>New missions ‘from old and new friends’</strong></li>



<li>New weather scenario</li>



<li><strong>Master difficulty preset</strong></li>



<li>Extended day/night cycle</li>



<li><strong>Stashes loot rework</strong></li>



<li>Stamina and energy drinks rework</li>



<li><strong>Immersive display mode</strong></li>



<li>Player equipment UI update</li>



<li><strong>Local save backup restoration</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Not only that, but a special ‘Discord Holiday Event’ has been teased by the team.</p>







<h2 id="h-stalker-2-ps5-launch-coming-soon">STALKER 2 PS5 Launch Coming Soon</h2>



<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is set to be released on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro this year. The latter launch will bring further upgrades and enhancements to the game, leaning on the computing power of Sony’s enthusiast console.</p>



<p>For now, the game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-announced-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to PlayStation 5</a> in Q4 2025, which is in the coming months. It’ll likely receive a solid release date at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony, given that the game is playable on PlayStation 5 Pro during the event.</p>



<p>GSC capped off the STALKER 2 2025 roadmap by stating: ‘Mission targets may be moved from 2025 to later dates in case of Zone instability.’</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to STALKER 2’s roadmap? Let me know what you’re waiting for on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-doubles-down-former-subnautica-2-executives-abandoned-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-doubles-down-on-claim-that-former-subnautica-2-executives-%E2%80%9Cabandoned%E2%80%9D-the-game.1269030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Krafton isn’t backing down from its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-says-former-subnautica-2-leadership-abandoned-their-responsibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims that former executives</a> at Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds had “abandoned” the game before their dismissal from the studio.</p>



<p>In an official response to the lawsuit filed against it by the studio’s founders, Krafton said that Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire <strong>“abandoned their roles as studio-wide Game Director and Technical Director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown Worlds entirely.”</strong> As far as former CEO Ted Gill, Krafton says that he was <strong>“focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game.”</strong></p>



<p>Krafton’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-subnautica-2-leadership-suing-krafton-after-firing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response continues</a> to allege that in July 2023, staff at Unknown Worlds, specifically Subnautica 2’s development director, had suggested that both Cleveland and McGuire were “checked out” and that they were confused about it. With both studio heads not around, Krafton says that it led to the game’s multiplayer delays from it’s original Q1 2024 release date.</p>



<p>By Spring 2025, the publisher says, the development team received “extensive feedback” from the internal teams which believed that Subnautica 2 wasn’t ready for a release into Early Access. Even Krafton’s CEO reportedly warned the studio heads that a <strong>“premature Early Access release of a highly anticipated sequel like Subnautica could cause irreversible harm to the entire IP franchise—pointing to the sequel to Kerbal Space Program as a prime example.”</strong> </p>



<p>Despite that, they say, the executives attempted to push forward the Early Access release of the game in order <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-wanted-to-delay-subnautica-2-to-avoid-250m-payout-lawsuit-claims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to hit the earnout</a>. That’s even with comments made that at the rate of current development, the game would <strong>“be in development for 30 years”</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>“Krafton, fearing how an underbaked EA Subnautica 2 would be received by both existing fans and the broader market, urged Cleveland and McGuire to return to their posts to generate a market-ready product that would not disappoint fans,” </strong>the document reads. <strong>“Cleveland and McGuire declined. In response to Krafton’s request for the Key Employees to return to lead the development of Subnautica 2, Gill stated that ‘[t]here’s no coming back to a job they didn’t have.'”</strong></p>



<p>It was also said that Cleveland and McGuire claimed they would self-publish Subnautica 2 without the support of the publisher, and began secretly downloading <strong>“massive amounts of confidential information from Unknown Worlds”.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“The Key Employees’ insistence on releasing the game immediately was singularly driven by self-interest in obtaining the earnout,” </strong>Krafton says. <strong>“At every turn during development, the Key Employees were laser focused on avoiding ‘a timeline that doesn’t tank the earnout opportunity’ and scheduling the release to maximize their payments.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Conversations throughout the post-acquisition period make clear the Key Employee’s [sic] focus was on their payday, and not on the game. As early as 2022, an employee who was due to receive a portion of the earnout stated that despite the significant delays in the game, he was confident ‘Ted [Gill] will&nbsp;concoct a scheme to get us that earnout.'”</strong></p>



<p>There’s plenty more in the response, which you can read for <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">yourself via Scribd</a>.</p>

<p>After the cancelation of Football Manager 25, developer Sports Interactive is back, teasing news for the upcoming Football Manager 26.</p>



<p>In a short video released on Wednesday, Sports Interactive gave players a glimpse at the “enhanced Match Day experience” from the game. They call it “just a taste of what you can expect” following the shift of the franchise to the Unity engine. At the end of the trailer, it says that a “Match Day First Look” is “coming soon”.</p>
