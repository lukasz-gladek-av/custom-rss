<p>The 2025 holiday shopping season is in full swing, and Nintendo is dropping a host of discounts to help players secure some last-minute deals and gifts.</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking to pull the trigger on a Nintendo Switch 2, are looking to add to your library of games, or are on the hunt for accessories, Nintendo has plenty of deals to cover all bases.</p>



<p>To help with your shopping spree, Insider Gaming has collected the best Nintendo Black Friday deals for 2025. Make sure to leave a comment if something catches your eye, and join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> to share deals you’ve found with other players to take advantage of.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-do-the-nintendo-black-friday-deals-start">When Do The Nintendo Black Friday Deals Start?</h2>



<p>Nintendo’s holiday gift guide went live well in advance of Black Friday, on November 10, with the main Cyber Deals kicking off on November 20 and running through to December 3 at 11:59 PM PT.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-nintendo-deals-for-black-friday-and-the-2025-holidays">Best Nintendo Deals For Black Friday and the 2025 Holidays</h2>



<h3 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-console-deals">Nintendo Switch 2 Console Deals</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch 2 console has not received any fresh price drops directly from Nintendo for the holiday season, though you can still take advantage of the bundle deals with Mario Kart World &amp; Pokémon Legends: Z-A that save $20-30 compared to purchasing separately. However, retailers may offer additional incentives on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, though this is unlikely to be a price slash, and may instead include extra accessories or bundle deals.</p>







<h3 id="h-nintendo-switch-accessories">Nintendo Switch Accessories</h3>



<p>Similar to the Switch 2 consoles, Nintendo hasn’t issued any direct deals for accessories for the original Switch and Switch 2, so the best course of action for savings on these will likely be heading to other retailers. However, even they are unlikely to drop prices significantly for Switch 2 accessories like Joy-Con controllers and the Camera. </p>

<p>If you’re looking to expand your games library on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 this holiday, the good news is that this is where you will find the majority of savings, particularly during the Cyber Deals event running until December 3. The table below outlines some of the best games and deals.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Marathon Community Playtest Announced, Still No Release Date]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-marathon-community-playtest-announced-still-no-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-marathon-community-playtest-announced-still-no-release-date.1362943/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With Marathon’s most recent Closed Technical Test behind it, a new Community Playtest has been announced. Details are already available on how to sign up, but it brings more focus on the fact that there’s no sign of a Marathon release date.</p>



<p>October’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-marathon-closed-technical-test-dates-platforms-nda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Closed Technical Test</a> is done. Bungie has inevitably learned valuable data about the extraction shooter, and Insider Gaming has reported before that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has confirmed that Marathon will launch by March 2026</a>.</p>







<p>We’re one step closer to another test, but no closer to knowing when before March 2026 the full release will happen.</p>







<figure><figcaption>This feels like a marathon in itself. Credit to Bungie</figcaption></figure>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Marathon/Playtests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon</a> website is now advertising and recruiting for the ‘Marathon December Community Playtest’ taking place in December 2025.</p>







<p>You can try out the latest extraction shooter build for yourself. It’s playable across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam, and Bungie has said this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Marathon December Community Playtest will run from December 12th to the 15th from 2PM PT to 8PM PT each day.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like before, the playtest is under a strict NDA, so you can’t share your footage or experience. It’s only for North America, so if you’re based outside of here, you’ll have to wait for the next one!</p>



<p>It’s true that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-leaks-closed-test-reveal-positivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks from the recent Closed Test were positive</a>. However, Bungie needs to commit to a release date soon and has to make sure it can compete with the dominance of ARC Raiders and Escape From Tarkov.</p>



<p>How is Marathon shaping up? Are you interested in it? Share your thoughts on the shotoer through the Official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios recently spoke about their next title, revealing that it shouldn’t be too far from Helldivers.</p>



<p>We have been hearing a lot about Helldivers 2 recently, with the developers also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-ceo-comments-on-switch-2-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting on a Switch 2 port</a>. However, we have yet to hear new details about the next game that Arrowhead Game Studios has been working on. The latest comments from the devs don’t provide too much information, but should be enough to make Helldivers fans happy. </p>



<h2 id="h-arrowhead-studios-next-game-will-not-be-too-far-from-helldivers">Arrowhead Studios’ Next Game Will Not Be ‘Too Far’ from Helldivers</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowheads-next-game-wont-be-something-thats-too-far-off-from-helldivers-2-creative-lead-says-were-looking-to-continue-the-legacy-of-what-weve-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Arrowhead Game Studios CCO, Johan Pilestedt, spoke a bit about their next title. Pilestedt first revealed that the game is currently in his favorite phase, the part he loves the most. The CCO revealed that he loves getting a new team together, breaking down boundaries among themselves, and getting to the heart of “who we are as people, and what games do we want to make together.”</p>



<p>Talking about what Arrowhead devs want to make, Pilestedt states that the team is “looking to continue the legacy of what we’ve created already.” The CCO added that the next title is “something that’s too far off from Helldivers”, which means that people who are massive Helldivers fans will be able to jump into their next game and “recognise the DNA” they have become familiar with over the years. The devs didn’t provide any more details about the game or explain how Helldivers will inspire it. </p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2’s Xbox port helped increase the sales and engagement for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 and PC versions</a>. Additionally, here’s what the devs said about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-comment-on-installation-size-and-load-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">installation size and load times</a>.
