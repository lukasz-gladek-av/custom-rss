            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sony-gen-ai-fake-podcast-playstation-characters/</link>
            <guid>1423756</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Have you ever sat there and wondered how cool it would be to listen to a fake podcast presented by God of War’s Kratos or Ellie from The Last of Us? No? Well, you’re probably not alone. But for some reason, Sony thinks that’s <strong>exactly </strong>what people want, as a recently discovered patent reveals that the tech titan plans to use generative AI to facilitate such a concept.</p>



<p>In an uncovered filing, the ‘LLM-Based Generative Podcasts for Gamers’ proposal was unearthed, and it would use generative AI to create <strong>personalized podcasts </strong>voiced by some of PlayStation’s most iconic characters.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-wants-to-listen-to-ai-delivered-podcasts">Who Wants To Listen to AI-Delivered Podcasts?</h2>



<p>Sony’s latest patent publication aims to use a gamer’s personal profile to piece together an AI-driven podcast feed hosted by their favorite first-party characters. That means you could have Ghost of Tsushima’s Jin Sakai’s dulcet tones in your ear, moulded by AI, giving you the lowdown on gaming news that might interest you.</p>



<p>The background <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US471594142&amp;_cid=P22-MKTGE2-37885-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of the patent</a>, submitted in 2024 but only just published on the WIPO platform, explains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As recognized herein, video game platforms currently lack the ability to provide unique and targeted content to gamers to update the gamers about things that are happening on the platform. There are currently no adequate solutions to the foregoing computer-related, technological problem.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-podcasts-games-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The lengthy summary of the proposed patent goes on to detail using an LLM (Large Language Model) to identify data associated with your PlayStation profile and then <strong>generate a podcast of news related to that data</strong>.</p>



<p>It would then be reeled off by a video game character of a game <strong>played by the video game player</strong>.</p>



<p>This could then be paired with video footage, trailers, screenshots, and other media.</p>



<p>But it would get pretty personal. The filing revealed how ‘the audio may include a joke at the video game player’s expense.’ Which means you could be roasted by a generative-AI podcast voiced by your favorite characters. Because that’s what we, as gamers, want.</p>



<p>The patent filing came with images that showed how this would fit on your PlayStation dashboard:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another image showed how a video podcast using this same format would work, using ‘desk hosts’ to give players something visual to focus on:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>At no point in the filing does it indicate how the voice actors for these characters would potentially be compensated or represented via this technology. It could be a nightmare for the actors who brought these characters to life, as while it’s their voices that are being used ad infinitum, the <strong>characters </strong>and their personas are owned by PlayStation and the vast number of studios under that banner.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A terrifying new experience lies around the corner with the highly-anticipated release of Reanimal, which is set to make a splash upon its release date.</p>



<p>Coming from the developers of Little Nightmares 2, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/reanimal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reanimal</a> offers a co-op <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horror</a> adventure through a disturbing world, and expectations are high for the Tarsier Studios title.</p>



<p>For all the release date details, the exact start time you can jump in and play, and all the platforms Reanimal is available on, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-reanimal-release-date">What is The Reanimal Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Frightening. Image by Tarsier Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Reanimal’s official release date is Friday, February 13, though the date may change depending on where you are located in the world.</strong></p>



<p>THQ Nordic has adopted a global release structure for Reanimal, meaning the game becomes available to all players around the world simultaneously. In some regions, this means Reanimal will actually be released on February 14.</p>



<h2 id="h-reanimal-start-times">Reanimal Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Reanimal releases at 6 AM PT on February 13, and the global release means simultaneous access for all players across the world.</strong></p>



<p>While this approach is familiar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> players, it may be a different experience for those on console, where many releases adopt a staggered release. When a staggered release is available, it opens the door for some ways to access games early. However, this isn’t the case for Reanimal.</p>



<p>All the start times for Reanimal in major regions across the world are shown in the table below. Confirmation of the start times comes via the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP4389-PPSA23372_00-ANIMALGAMEGLOBAL?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=14799736276&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADtLsqzzhyq21kgs5P_mNxvWxca6g&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA1obMBhAbEiwAsUBbIsN0ZM7rsmkFMEJKbNtVK7mroKhXYUIcolb-aifIAV3nvNu6IwRTpRoCG3wQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2129530/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Reanimal Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Feb. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Feb. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Feb. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Feb. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Feb. 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-reanimal-platforms">All Reanimal Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Reanimal is available across multiple platforms on its launch date, with Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2, allowing all players to jump in.</strong></p>



<p>There is no release on last-gen consoles, however, so those on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox One</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 4</a>, and the original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> will have to miss out.</p>



<p>Physical editions are also available immediately at launch, including a Collector’s Edition, and future DLC content is planned.</p>

<p>Major releases continuen to come thick and fast in 2026, including the release of High on Life 2 this month, providing another foul-mouthed adventure to enjoy.</p>



<p>Squanch Games’ sequel to the initial title of the same name is set to make a mark when it lands, and Insider Gaming has all the important details on the release date, start times, and available platforms.</p>

<p><strong>High on Life 2 releases on Friday, February 13, though this may vary based on where you are located in the world.</strong></p>



<p>The release structure for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> is global, becoming available to all players around the world simultaneously, which means that, for some regions, High on Life 2 will actually be released on February 14.</p>

<p>The global release structure will be familiar to PC players, though many console releases instead adopt a staggered release. However, there’s no such approach on console for High on Life 2; no matter where you are located or the platform you are playing on, High on Life 2 is accessible at the same moment.</p>

<p><strong>High on Life 2 releases on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on February 13, but only digitally.</strong></p>



<p>Physical editions of High on Life 2 are not available until April 20, 2026, with a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game set to launch on the same date.</p>



<p>Unlike the first game in the series, High on Life 2 does not release on last gen consoles, so it’s bad news for players on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, or the original Nintendo Switch console.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Division: Definitive Edition Shadow Dropped For $50 With Zero Improvements]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-definitive-edition-shadow-dropped-for-50-with-zero-improvements/</link>
            <guid>1423693</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rumblings of The Division: Definitive Edition started a few weeks ago. While the wait for The Division 3 goes on, this could have served as the perfect means to tide fans over until then. Unfortunately, the very low-key release seems to be quite low-effort, with The Division: Definitive Edition shadow drop being a rehash of a previous version, with no PS5 or Xbox Series X|S upgrade.</p>



<p>Definitive Editions are usually released with the same content, but alongside a plethora of graphical updates to give a game a completely overhauled look. This is the bare minimum effort needed, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-division/" id="113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Division</a>: Definitive Edition hasn’t even done this.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-division-definitive-edition-has-no-ps5-upgrades">The Division: Definitive Edition Has No PS5 Upgrades</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A letdown. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-definitive-edition-could-be-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Division: Definitive Edition</a> banner surfaced online, and clearly hinted that Ubisoft was working on an upgraded version of the original looter shooter.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Division 3 ‘Shaping up to be a monster,’</a> this is the perfect gateway for new fans into the series, and the chance to warm up the skills of existing players. But alarm bells started ringing when The Division: Definitive Edition was unceremoniously shadow-dropped onto the PlayStation and Xbox Stores on February 3.</p>



<p>Therein lies the reason as to why it hasn’t been promoted: There’s not much to promote.</p>



<p>‘Tom Clancy’s The Division – Definitive Edition’ doesn’t have an upgraded PS5 or XSX version. You can play it on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but the game clearly states that it includes “The base game, all three Season Pass expansions, and multiple cosmetic packs.” No graphical improvements or even gameplay tweaks are mentioned because there are none.</p>



<p>There will be some natural upscaling because of the power of the modern-day consoles, but make no mistake, this is the already-existing The Division Gold Edition, with a few extra outfits and no upgrades, for $50.</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake being canceled</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employee-who-was-suspended-for-criticising-the-company-has-now-been-fired/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft employee who was suspended for criticizing the company being fired</a>, it has not been a good few weeks for Ubisoft.</p>



<p>What do you think about this release? Is it a lazy rerelease? Could Ubisoft face even more flak after recent events?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been a rip-roaring success since its historic June 5, 2025, launch. The sequel to the smash-hit Switch is more powerful and has more system-selling AAA exclusives, and people are gobbling up Switch 2 consoles faster than Yoshi does fruit.</p>



<p>You could argue the generational leap from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> hasn’t been as significant or as huge as in previous years, but this hasn’t stopped it from raking in millions for Nintendo across 2025 and up to FY2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-fy26-financial-results-show-huge-numbers-for-switch-2">Nintendo FY26 Financial Results Show Huge Numbers For Switch 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Money. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The February 3 <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_2e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Financial Earnings Report</a> is out, and it’s hard to escape the Switch 2’s incredible first-year success.</p>







<p>Nintendo’s newest statistics reveal that the Switch 2 has sold 17.37 million units as of December 31, 2025. A cool graphic shows the correlation between the Switch and Switch 2’s respective sales journeys.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 still remains ahead of the original Switch’s sales curve, and this ensures the Nintendo Switch 2 is the “Fastest-selling dedicated video game platform released by Nintendo to date.”</p>



<p>First-party titles have clearly had a huge influence, with Nintendo reporting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mario-kart-world/" id="2527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> has crossed 14 million units, Donkey Kong Bananza has sold 4 million units, and the Switch 2 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is also swiftly approaching 4 million.</p>



<p>With more Nintendo exclusives in the pipeline, from Mario Tennis Fever to Pokémon Pokopia, there are even more reasons to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026. You can bet your bottom dollar that the company is keeping some games a secret, and there’s still plenty of ammunition to keep the Switch 2 sales flowing.</p>



<p>Are you a Nintendo Switch 2 owner? What incentivized you to buy one? Conversely, if you like the brand but haven’t invested in a Switch 2 yet, why is this?
