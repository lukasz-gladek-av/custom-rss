<p>Following a YouTube copyright strike from Take-Two Interactive, a GTA 5 modder has decided to remove his mod that adds GTA 6 into GTA 5.</p>



<p>The video in question was a FiveM mod that added the GTA 6 map into GTA 5, which was based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive hack that Rockstar Games faced</a> a couple of years ago. </p>



<p>Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/take-two-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two Interactive</a> only copyright striking the YouTube video, the modder, Dark Space, said in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U&amp;ab_channel=DarkSpace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a> that he’s also decided to remove the download links to prevent further legal action.</p>



<p>In a Twitter/X tweet, he said, “Take Two interactive has copyright claimed and removed my video on the GTA 6 map I made in GTA 5. I expected something like this could happen. I am surprised they didn’t bother emailing me. I would have taken it down if asked.”</p>



<p>Take-Two Interactive has been notorious in copyright striking and issuing legal action against modders in the past, so the news shouldn’t be too surprising for anyone familiar with their practices. Even more so when the mod in question is based on leaked material that wasn’t indented to see the light of day.</p>



<p>GTA 6 was officially revealed on December 4, 2025, and at the time of writing hasn’t seen a gameplay update since. According to Take-Two Interactive, the game is still due to release in 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of Take-Two Interactive removing the GTA 6 mod? Are you looking forward to seeing a GTA 6 gameplay update from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games</a>?
