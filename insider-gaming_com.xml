<p>Lords of the Fallen debuted in 2023, emerging as a reboot of sorts of the 2014 game of the same name. It was a considerable success, surfacing as a solid entry into the ever-growing lineup of Soulslike games that have dominated the market in recent years.</p>



<p>At Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony, CI Games unveiled Lords of the Fallen II, slated for a 2026 release window. However, the team isn’t <strong>quite finished </strong>with Lords of the Fallen (2023), as a surprise, final update was revealed for the game, featuring stacks of extra content.</p>







<h2 id="h-lords-of-the-fallen-is-still-standing">Lords of the Fallen is Still Standing</h2>



<p>In an unexpected reveal, CI Games uncovered a final update for 2023’s Lords of the Fallen, a world-bending Soulslike title with some incredible combat sequences.</p>



<p>It was back in April 2024 that Lords of the Fallen’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-final-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘final update’</a> was released, dubbed ‘Master of Fate’, and the team thereafter pivoted to work on Lords of the Fallen II, which was then revealed a year and a half later.</p>



<p><strong>But then</strong>, in April 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-update-friend-pass-co-op-improvements-explained/">‘Lords of the Fallen 2.0’</a> went live, with CI Games introducing several game-changing features such as a ‘Friend Pass’ system, new co-op challenges, and better multiplayer mechanics. It seems that, once again, final didn’t mean final, as <strong>yet another </strong>update has been lined up for Lords of the Fallen.</p>



<p>Now, the team at CI Games has confirmed that Lords of the Fallen ‘2.5’ is being released, including all of the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deadlier boss battles</li>



<li>Faster, smarter enemies</li>



<li>All-new Veteran Mode</li>



<li>New boss weapon animations</li>



<li>Veteran of the Veil Armour Set</li>



<li>And more…</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent update, Aspyr has confirmed that the upcoming Deus Ex Remastered has been delayed. Originally scheduled to launch on February 6, 2026, the highly anticipated remaster has now been pushed back indefinitely.</p>



<p>The original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal/">Deus Ex</a>, released in 2000, is widely regarded as an incredibly important title in gaming history. Its blend of action, espionage, and non-linear level design helped define the immersive sim genre—and fans were eager to experience the revamped version. Now, it seems they’ll have to wait a while longer.</p>







<h2 id="h-aspyr-announces-deus-ex-remastered-has-been-delayed">Aspyr Announces Deus Ex Remastered Has Been Delayed</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered. We've listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026. <a href="https://t.co/NhalyPLm8q">pic.twitter.com/NhalyPLm8q</a></p>— Aspyr (@AspyrMedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In the public statement shown above, Aspyr officially confirmed the delay. According to the studio, the decision was made in response to community feedback, with the team wanting additional time to “better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players.”</p>







<p>The announcement didn’t include a revised release date, offering only that the studio will “share more updates when the time comes.” With the original launch only months away, players will be hoping the project isn’t set for an extended setback.</p>



<p>Adding to the uncertainty, though, Aspyr also revealed that all existing preorders will be fully refunded. It’s a move that has left some fans questioning the remaster’s current state, as well as what the long-term future of the project might look like. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-lays-off-eidos-montreal-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deus Ex as a franchise can’t seem to catch a break</a>, and the misery doesn’t seem to be stopping any time soon.</p>
