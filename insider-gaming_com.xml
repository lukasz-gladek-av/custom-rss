<p>The new Fortnite Chapter 6 launch trailer has revealed that Godzilla and bosses will be making their way to the Battle Royale.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Fortnite has yet to officially upload the trailer; however, <a href="https://x.com/Guille_GAG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data miners</a> have been able to find it within the game files.</p>



<p>The new gameplay trailer for Chapter 6 reveals new skins, bosses, and Godzilla, who seemingly walks around the map. It’s currently unclear if Godzilla is a boss or not within Chapter 6.</p>



<p>You can watch the Chapter 6 trailer here:</p>

<p>Following a controversial reveal, Polaris Quest revealed 16 minutes of Light of Motiram gameplay.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram was heavily criticized yesterday following its reveal due to its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/">striking resemblanc</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/"> to the Horizon series</a>. Since the initial reveal though, 16 minutes of new gameplay of the game has been revealed, showing the game in somewhat of a different light.</p>



<p>You can watch the gameplay below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="騰訊曝光《荒野起源》15 分鐘實機展示 未來將與 PlayStation 有更多合作" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsq1xnd0CvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It’s fairly obvious that the developers have been heavily inspired (if not just blatantly ripped off) by the Horizon series, but after watching the gameplay, you also see some inspiration taken from other games like ARK and Souls.</p>



<p>The gameplay has left people conflicted. Some think the game looks impressive, whereas others think it’s just an unoriginal idea that borrows concepts and designs from other games.</p>



<p>“I think you can’t be more unoriginal than this,” said YouTube user Xezene on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqwoP_cTo4I&amp;t=502s&amp;ab_channel=Gematsu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reupload of the gameplay</a>. “This looks fantastic,” said YouTube user MrMultiPlatform.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram has been announced to be released sometime in 2025 on PC.</p>

<p>NDemic Creations, the developer behind the remarkably popular world-ending title, Plague Inc., has released After Inc. This mobile game follows directly on from the 2012 apocalypse-inducing epic, inviting players to build a settlement and reshape society.</p>



<p>It’s a complete flip from the first game, in which your chief goal was to rid the world of humans by creating a disease so powerful that it couldn’t be stopped. Anyone who played it knows how open-ended it was, and they also know that living in Iceland or Madagascar was usually the best way to avoid catching the nasty diseases concocted by players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-can-rebuild">We Can Rebuild</h2>



<p>After Inc. is available now on iOS and Android, and it comes twelve years after the release of the first game. That’s about right in the post-apocalyptic stakes – things have to blow over before you can start rebuilding, right?</p>



<p>Per a post advertising the launch of the game, Ndemic wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After Inc. (is) a unique blend of strategic simulation, survival city builder and ‘mini 4X’. The Necroa Virus has ravaged humanity – build a settlement and shape your post-apocalyptic society.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s coming to Steam in 2025, which follows in the footsteps of Plague Inc., which launched first as a mobile exclusive game before being ported to PC. It’s available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337140/After_Inc_Revival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist now on the platform</a>.</p>



<p>At first blush, After Inc. is much more immersive and involved than Plague Inc. Players are introduced to a more detailed, granular world, and while they’re still able to influence things across a wider area, After Inc. is more focused on rebuilding the world on a localised scale than it is tearing it down on a global one.</p>



<p>To that end, After Inc. is set primarily in the United Kingdom, which is where Ndemic Creations is based.</p>



<p>In After Inc., players are invited to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Explore ruins</li>



<li>Farm resources</li>



<li>Build and expand settlements</li>



<li>Make tough decisions</li>



<li>Extermine zombie infestations</li>



<li>Follow an intense campaign</li>
</ul>



<p>It has been a long time coming, and while most fans of Plague Inc. didn’t expect it to service, it’s a welcome addition to 2024’s gaming lineup.</p>
