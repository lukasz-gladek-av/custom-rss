            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-ceo-addresses-recent-runescape-scandal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, I reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-membership-charge-tiers-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the changes</a> that Jagex is proposing for RuneScape’s paid membership model. In a series of images shared on social media, it was revealed that a survey had been conducted by Jagex, and in that survey, players were asked to rate a series of proposed membership packages, some of which were audacious.</p>



<p>In a new post published on the RuneScape platform, Jagex’s CEO, Mod Pips, has laid bare the reasons why these changes have to happen. It’s a transparent move from the firm that players have welcomed with open arms, but it’s still not perfect.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-a-major-misjudgement">‘It Was a Major Misjudgement’</h2>



<p>In the post on the RuneScape blog, Mod Pips opened by explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This was clumsy and inconsiderate, to say the least. We failed to think this through from your perspective as players. We got caught up in research mode and rushing a project with a research partner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘exploratory survey’ set the community ablaze, with some of the proposed membership tiers paywalling elements like better account security and enhanced player support. In some cases, users could pay for a RuneScape membership and still have to see ads in the game.</p>



<p>Pips went deeper:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was a major misjudgement to include features that suggested we would consider degrading the game experience or impacting gameplay. Even the mere suggestion of ideas like in-game ads, shorter AFK timers, or making improved player support an additional cost undermined your trust in us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Going forward, the Jagex team has pledged:</p>



<ul>
<li>To not include in-game advertisements in any regular paid membership</li>



<li>To ensure that any subscription ‘provides access to the full suite of core game content’</li>



<li>To not make plugins or features on the official client ‘paid options’</li>



<li>To not paywall player support</li>
</ul>



<p>The blog post was ended with a final statement from Mod Pips:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This kind of transparency and collaboration is at the heart of what makes our games so special. The game is shaped by its community, and your voices remain central to every decision we make. While we recognise that mistakes were made here, the fact that we’ve received such strong and clear feedback reinforces how deeply you care about this game.</p>



<p>Old School RuneScape thrives because of its community, and working closely with you keeps us moving forward, even when the discussions are difficult.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the post has satisfied the community somewhat, it’s clear the road ahead is yet to be fully traversed and that changes <strong>are coming</strong>, whether players like it or not.</p>



<p>Do you think the statement from Mod Pips is a good one or has Jagex forever ruined your interpretation of RuneScape? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/treyarch-disabling-crossplay-ranked-console-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a long-awaited update from Treyarch, it has been revealed that when season two arrives in Black Ops 6, it’ll come hand-in-hand with a feature <strong>many </strong>have been asking for. With the season two update, console players will finally be able to switch off crossplay mechanics, locking them into matchmaking against <strong>only </strong>other console players and <strong>not </strong>PC users.</p>



<p>This is a step to prevent console players from running into cheaters, which are <strong>always </strong>more commonplace on PC platforms. The feature is in testing now and will go live ‘during’ season two.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finally">Finally.</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1880381003270848925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on social media and on the Call of Duty blog, Treyarch revealed the impending update:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In Season 02, we are enabling the ability to disable crossplay for console players who to compete only against other console players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This will be deployed for both Warzone and Black Ops 6 Ranked Play, but it <strong>won’t </strong>roll out for general multiplayer playlists, which has been met with disappointment from fans on social media. Treyarch insisted it will ‘be closely monitoring’ and will consider ‘further changes to prioritise the integrity of the ecosystem’ going forward.</p>



<p>Since Ranked Play dropped in Black Ops 6, it has been a shambles of a scene. Even a cursory glance across social media will uncover countless pro players and content creators stressing their frustration about cheaters dominating Ranked Play.</p>



<p>It’s the same thing year after year, but in Black Ops 6, it just seems <strong>worse</strong> than ever before, for some reason.</p>



<p>It’s a similar story in Warzone.</p>



<p>Treyarch also highlighted that ‘Vote to Forfeit’ is coming midway through season two, allowing players to end matches without losing SR or facing any game suspensions. Later, disconnect protection will be added in the form of an ability to rejoin matches when you’ve dropped out.</p>



<p>Do you think this change is a W from Treyarch, or would you rather see it rolled out to cover all multiplayer playlists? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Nine esports organizations have been announced for the Overwatch Champions Series partner program. While a small handful of teams will be familiar to long-time competitive Overwatch fans, many teams once synonymous with the scene are nowhere to be seen.</p>



<p>With the open Overwatch esports ecosystem entering a new era, and while the game itself is challenged by a new “rival”, it’s an important year for Blizzard’s iconic hero shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-meet-the-owcs-partner-teams">Meet the OWCS Partner Teams</h2>



<p>Nine teams have been <a href="https://esports.overwatch.com/en-us/news/owcs-2025-stage-1#:~:text=Competition%20Memo.-,OWCS%20Partner%20Teams,-As%20announced%20in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invited</a> to participate in the OWCS partner program for 2025: four from Asia, three from EMEA (Europe and the Middle East), and two from North America. The regional distinction is based on the roster of players, not where the organization is based or headquartered. Partnered teams will receive a portion of proceeds from in-game team-themed items, as well as direct invites to their region’s stage one main event.</p>



<p>The list of partnered teams includes: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gen.G</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Twisted Minds</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Virtus.pro</strong> (EMEA)</li>



<li><strong>Spacestation</strong> (North America)</li>



<li><strong>Team Liquid</strong> (North America)</li>



<li><strong>Crazy Raccoon</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>T1</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>Team Falcons</strong> (Asia)</li>



<li><strong>ZETA DIVISION</strong> (Asia)</li>
</ul>



<p>Of the list of nine organizations, only two were active during the Overwatch League days: T1 was the academy team for the Seoul Infernal (formerly Philadelphia Fusion), and Gen.G owned the Seoul Dynasty. Several of the now partnered teams entered Overwatch last year in the first season of the open OWCS ecosystem, following the closure of the Overwatch League at the end of 2023.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Missing from this list are some organizations that were amongst the biggest names of the OWL era. Notably, NRG, the organization that owned and operated two-time OWL champion San Francisco Shock, did not receive a partner program invite. This shocked both <a href="https://x.com/amiller/status/1869534757488644122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NRG staff members</a> and long-time OWL fans, especially after NRG finished 4th in the OWCS 2024 World Finals as the NRG Shock. Fans are also somewhat surprised by there being only two NA slots, considering one is occupied by a Team Liquid organization that last competed in Overwatch in 2017.</p>



<p>There is some renewed excitement in Overwatch esports following the move from the franchised OWL to open OWCS. The 2024 OWCS Finals <a href="https://escharts.com/news/overwatch-champions-series-finals-2024-viewership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a slightly higher viewership peak</a> than the one reached at the 2023 OWL Finals. However the game itself is now facing arguably its greatest competitor ever in the recently released Marvel Rivals from NetEase. While the newer game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very slowly embracing esports</a>, a number of former Overwatch pros have already made the jump.</p>
