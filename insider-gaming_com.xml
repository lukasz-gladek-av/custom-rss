<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has only been around for a year as of today (October 30), and to say it’s been a success would be an understatement.</p>



<p>But just how much of a success has it truly been?</p>



<p>According to estimates from data firm <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AppMagic</a>, via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dethrones-pokemon-go-as-it-celebrates-first-anniversary-and-13bn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pocketgamer</a>, the game has earned nearly $1.3 billion in revenue over its first 12 months. That makes it the most profitable Pokémon mobile game ever, surpassing the roughly $1 billion Pokémon Go earned in its first year.</p>



<p>As far as downloads go, AppMagic says it’s been downloaded more than 150 million times so far. That comes after it was downloaded </p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What is Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>Released on October 30, 2024, Pokémon TCG Pocket is a mobile version of the popular trading card game. In the game, players buy and open packs to collect cards. These cards, as expected, can then be used to build full decks and battle against other players in a simplified version of the traditional card game.</p>



<p>In addition to collecting and battling, players can trade cards with friends. There are restrictions, though. Trades can only happen with friends and have to be of the same rarity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Halloween! It’s time for a <strong>spooky edition </strong>of NYT Connections. There are a few words in today’s puzzle synonymous with Halloween, which you’ll find if you scroll down to check out my NYT Connections hints for today. If you’re a fan of classic cartoons or video games, today’s puzzle should be a simple one for you.</p>



<p>In any case, I’ve assembled the top NYT Connections hints and solutions so that you can jump right to the answers and get on with your Halloween!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-31">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 31)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #873:</p>



<ul>
<li>GHOST</li>



<li>PUMPKIN</li>



<li>BOW</li>



<li>BED</li>



<li>ANCHOR</li>



<li>BEAR</li>



<li>MOUSE</li>



<li>CHERRIES</li>



<li>CHAIR</li>



<li>DOTS</li>



<li>SLIPPER</li>



<li>CAP</li>



<li>PIPE</li>



<li>PORRIDGE</li>



<li>SPINACH</li>



<li>MAGIC WAND</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all items or characters Goldilocks encounters in the bears’ home</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each word is tied to Cinderella’s transformation or helpers in her fairy tale journey</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all iconic items associated with the sailor man himself</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are all elements from the classic Ms. Pac-Man game, including her accessories and in-game items</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 31.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-31-873">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 31 (#873)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BACKBONE, COURAGE, HEART, SPIRIT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – MEDIUM, OUTLET, PLATFORM, VENUE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – SACRUM, SEITAN, SEYCHELLES, SÉANCE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ABECEDARIUM, COMPUTER KEYBOARD, OUIJA BOARD, SCRABBLE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Now that Dying Light: The Beast is out, Techland can start focusing again on Dying Light 2: Stay Human. The live-service, open-world zombie title has always enjoyed seasonal updates, and this Halloween, that remains the case. Techland has introduced a new event in Dying Light 2: Stay Human dubbed ‘Halloween Showdown’, and it transforms the game – <strong>for a time</strong>.</p>



<p>In Halloween Showdown, players must fight and kill special infected enemies to secure candies that they can use to unlock exclusive rewards from warring factions. The ‘special infected’ are the game’s normal enemies, but reimagined to suit the spooky Halloween season.</p>



<h2 id="h-halloween-hits-stay-human">Halloween Hits Stay Human</h2>



<p>In a recent release, the team at Techland revealed the arrival of the Dying Light 2 Halloween event, named Halloween Showdown. It’s set to run from today to November 20, giving users a fair window in which to unlock exclusive rewards.</p>



<p>Here’s a segment from that release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>The city of Villedor</strong>&nbsp;is fully decorated for Halloween, with returning themed enemies including Pumpkintiles, Witches, Scaregoons, Virals, and Biters. In Tower Raid, Halloween-themed enemies take over the Tower, with new decorations, layouts, and rooftop battles. Players can also unlock new characters like Cursed Pirate and the permanent Tower Raid character CyberRaider, while the updated reward track offers Toxic and UV weapons and a new scoreboard for competitive play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This new Dying Light 2 event goes hand-in-hand with some featured community maps, themed around Halloween, being pushed by Techland. From November 13, limited bounties will unlock across these experiences, allowing players to grind for more rewards outside of the base game.</p>



<p>As you can also imagine, the special event also brings about some themed Halloween Bundles, which include one with a futuristic rifle that promises to ‘defy gravity’.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Dying Light 2: Stay Human? Let me know if you’re going to participate in the Halloween Showdown on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast continues to be a success more than a month after the game hit the market. Players are still neck-deep in the Call of the Beast challenge path, slaying the undead to their heart’s content. In a recent release, Techland explained what has been added in the new 1.3 patch for Dying Light: The Beast, including new enemy behavior, animations, and improvements.</p>



<p>It’s not an enormous list, but then again, it’s not an enormous game. If you’re interested in checking out the full patch notes for Dying Light: The Beast’s 1.3 update, read on.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-patch-notes-for-dying-light-the-beast-1-3">Full Patch Notes For Dying Light: The Beast 1.3</h2>



<p>One of the best new features added in Dying Light: The Beast’s 1.3 update is a pacifist mechanic of sorts. When you point a firearm at enemies after downloading the 1.3 patch, you’ll notice that they might lay down their weapons and surrender rather than tangle with Kyle Crane.</p>



<p>Techland explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dying Light was always about reactivity and making the world respond naturally to your every move. After hearing your requests, we’ve introduced a new human-enemy behavior – melee-weapon enemies will now recognize when you’re aiming a firearm at them and might decide to surrender rather than losing their life. Depending on your actions then this scenario can unfold in a number of ways, but we’ll leave them to you to discover.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team has also added nine new weapon execution animations, covering every type of melee weapon in the game.</p>



<p>Call of the Beast continues, and the campaign has moved on a notch with fresh challenges. As a collective, the community needs ot land 10 million shots to secure an exclusive car skin, and 20 million to unlock a limited edition rifle. This new challenge runs from today until next Thursday.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <strong>Dying Light: The Beast x PUBG Mobile </strong>crossover event kicks off tomorrow. You need to access the Dying Light Outpost page and activate the quest, which will trigger an event in-game that hands you a new quest. Once you’ve completed this quest line, you’ll have unlocked stacks of PUBG Mobile-themed items.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-bug-fixes-in-dying-light-the-beast">Latest Bug Fixes in Dying Light: The Beast</h2>



<p>Here’s the full list of bug fixes hitting Dying Light: The Beast in the 1.3 patch.</p>

<p>The anticipated The Lord of the Rings MMO from Amazon Games might have been canceled. At least, that’s what a former employee’s post on social media would suggest.</p>



<p>In a now-deleted post on LinkedIn, a former developer confirmed that they had been laid off from Amazon Games and specifically mentioned The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p>



<p><strong>“This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y’all would have loved it),”&nbsp;</strong>the post read. <strong>“It’s always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this — I’ve been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I’ve ever met here.”</strong></p>



<p>While that doesn’t outright confirm the game’s been shelved, the wording used in the post strongly suggests that’s the case. On top of that, sources who spoke to Insider Gaming are also of the belief that the game isn’t going to move forward, with one saying that the game is “likely done.” However, they wouldn’t outright confirm that it’s completely dead due to the IP involved.</p>



<p>Neither Amazon Games nor Embracer has responded to multiple requests for comment on the claims from the former employee along with what sources have said.</p>



<p>If this is the end for the MMO from Amazon, it likely won’t be the end for The Lord of the Rings as a video game franchise. Insider Gaming recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported that a new third-person action game</a> is in development with investment from the Abu Dhabi Investment Office. </p>
