<p>More often than not, the management and simulation genre proves massive and complex. On PC, there are countless hotkeys to consider, and to the everyday player, it can feel overwhelming to remember every key combination necessary to quick-build or remove pathing sections. Hopefully, we can help. Here are a few of the most important hotkeys in Planet Coaster 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-important-planet-coaster-2-hotkeys-to-remember">Important Planet Coaster 2 Hotkeys To Remember</h2>



<p>I spent too long ignoring hotkeys and shortcuts in games in favor of simply clicking, and the day I started using hotkeys, I never returned. They make life easier. You can access nearly any menu or mechanic in the game without moving your hand from the keyboard. Of course, remembering every hotkey and shortcut command is initially challenging, but there’s no shame in keeping a guide like this one up on your phone or a second screen. </p>



<p>Here are a few Planet Coaster 2 hotkeys worth remembering:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>CTRL + Z</strong> — Undo</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + Y</strong> — Redo</li>



<li><strong>L</strong> — Light</li>



<li><strong>ALT</strong> — Radial Menu</li>



<li><strong>Right CTRL + Right SHIFT + G</strong> — Hide UI</li>



<li><strong>Z</strong> — Rotate 90 Degrees</li>



<li><strong>Hold Z</strong> — Rotate</li>



<li><strong>X</strong> — Advanced Move</li>



<li><strong>M</strong> — Move</li>



<li><strong>F</strong> — Snap Object to Wall Center</li>



<li><strong>P</strong> — Toggle Angle Snap</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + D</strong> — Duplicate Object</li>



<li><strong>R</strong> — Edit Building</li>



<li><strong>I</strong> — Multi Select</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are many more hotkeys and shortcuts in Planet Coaster 2, and you can find all of them within the settings menu, but I find you’ll use these more frequently than any other. It’s worth keeping this guide open for quick reference.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Treyarch’s Miles Leslie took a deep dive into the success of Black Ops 6. He was talking about the power of Game Pass and how it has allowed many ‘on-the-fence’ players to find their way into Call of Duty but mentioned that the difficulty will now rest in <strong>keeping those players </strong>on board.</p>



<p>He also mentioned that on PlayStation and Steam, sales of this year’s Call of Duty title beat last year’s by at least 60%.</p>

<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 is a phenomenal success – Activision confirmed it was the biggest release in Call of Duty history just days after the game hit the market. It’s proving to be holding firm as time goes on, too – the energy in anticipation of the game’s first season is electric and palpable, and this year, the roadmap has some real potential.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of Black Ops 6</a>, I said it was the best we’ve had in years.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with the BBC</a>, Miles Leslie, a sixteen-year veteran of Treyarch, mentioned that Steam and PlayStation-based sales of Black Ops 6 have beaten those for Modern Warfare 3 by 60%. We already knew it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-biggest-launch-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a roaring success on Game Pass</a>, as it caused the most new subscriber adds ever for a new game, but it’s encouraging to see it won big figures across the board.</p>



<p>In the run-up to Black Ops 6 being released, Activision’s teams pushed out a marketing campaign like no other, which some believed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rivalled that of a major blockbuster</a>. It seemed that no matter where you turned, the Black Ops 6 branding was visible. </p>



<p>Leslie also said about the title launching on Game Pass:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we’ve seen is it’s allowed people that might have been on the fence, might have had some of that friction, might have been like, ‘I haven’t played in a while’ to actually come back and try the game. </p>



<p>Obviously there’s things that we can improve and we’ve got our finger on the pulse of the community so that we can hear those things and analyse them and really attack and fix them in the right ways.</p>
