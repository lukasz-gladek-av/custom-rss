<p>What makes a single player game truly great? For some, it’s a gripping story filled with unforgettable characters. For others, it’s gameplay so immersive that playing with others doesn’t even cross your mind. No matter your preference, one thing is certain: 2024 delivered an incredible lineup of single player experiences.</p>



<p>Indie gems like Animal Well and Balatro demonstrated that small teams can produce big ideas, offering unique gameplay and memorable design. Meanwhile, Black Myth: Wukong and Stellar Blade reinvigorated popular genres, bringing fresh concepts and creativity to the table.</p>



<p>And then there was Astro Bot — a <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17118/astro-bot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game that seemed to deliver</a> everything players could possibly want. From its expertly crafted levels to its lovable protagonist and gameplay that masterfully balances nostalgia with modern mechanics, Astro Bot stood out in a crowded field. It’s no surprise that the Insider Gaming community voted it as the Best Single Player Game of 2024.</p>



<p>In a poll hosted on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>, Astro Bot captured 61% of the votes, beating out strong contenders like the aforementioned Stellar Blade, Black Myth: Wukong, and Balatro.</p>

<p>But what makes Astro Bot worthy of such high praise as a single player game?</p>



<p>The game takes players on a journey through dozens of levels spread across more than 50 planets and six galaxies. Each planet offers something fresh, whether it’s unique level design, new abilities, or inventive challenges. The gameplay encourages creativity, requiring players to think differently to save the lost bots scattered throughout the universe.</p>



<p>But Astro Bot isn’t just another platformer; it’s a heartfelt love letter to PlayStation’s storied past. Levels like “Free Big Brother” and “Luna Sola” evoke the joy of classic collectathons and rotating levels, while others, such as “Machine Learning” and “Dude Raiding,” pay clever homage to iconic franchises like Horizon and Uncharted.</p>



<p>It’s not all about nostalgia, though. The game introduces innovative mechanics to keep the experience fresh. Abilities like shrinking to mouse size or using a penguin to swim effortlessly add layers of fun and variety, ensuring no two levels feel the same.</p>



<p>At the heart of it all is Astro, the game’s irresistibly charming mascot. With his joyful personality and endearing design, he ties the experience together, leaving players eager for more adventures.</p>



<p>With its imaginative gameplay, delightful world-building, and heartfelt nods to gaming history, Astro Bot isn’t just a standout game — it’s a testament to what the single player genre can achieve.</p>
