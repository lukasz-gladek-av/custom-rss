<p>Ball X Pit is a late contender for various GOTY awards as it’s wowed everyone with its unique take on the block breaker genre. If you want to try it out for yourself, you need to know if Ball X Pit is on Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, as it might save you a buck or two.</p>



<p>From the 80s to Bust-A-Bloc on the PS2, the block breaker game has been around for decades. It’s appeared in all shapes and sizes (usually with a sphere or two), and the genre has finally been turned on its head with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-reaches-a-major-sales-milestone-days-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball X Pit</a>. Kenny Sun has looked to emulate other successful solo developers such as Baltotr’s LocalThunk or Animal Well’s Billy Basso.</p>



<p>Ball X Pit smashed bricks and expectations with its glorious reviews and early backing from hundreds of thousands of players. If you want to add to this growing community, Game Pass or PS Plus might be your gateway.</p>

<p><strong>You can play Ball X Pit for free if you have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership right now.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wave 1 of October 2025’s free Xbox Game Pass Games</a> included Ball X Pit. You can’t really ask for better promotion and publicity for a new indie game than one of the most popular gaming streaming services in the world offering it out for free to all subscribers.</p>



<p>This allows all eyes to be on Ball X Pit, and plenty of those eyes will turn into players.</p>



<p>The Game Pass discourse hasn’t been pretty in late 2025. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-founder-describes-game-pass-price-hikes-as-greed-over-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s founder has described the infamous Game Pass Price hikes as ‘greed over gaming,’</a> and it’s also been suggested that Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-chair-shots-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘can make things worse.’</a></p>



<p>Regardless, for anyone who’s still subscribed, you can play Ball X Pit (among many other titles) for free as part of your subscription.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-ball-x-pit-free-on-playstation-plus">Can You Play Ball X Pit Free On PlayStation Plus?</h2>



<p><strong>Ball X Pit isn’t a fully free and downloadable game on PS Plus like it is on Xbox, but you can play the game for an hour with a free trial via PlayStation Plus Premium to see what you think first.</strong></p>



<p>For the time being, Ball X Pit hasn’t been added to PS Plus Essentials, Extra, or Premium just yet. However, if you want at least some fix on PS5, there’s a free one-hour trial—serving as an extended demo to see if you want to play it for more than an hour. Given the game’s addictiveness, chances are, you will want more.</p>



<p>Should you opt for a full purchase, it will still only set you back $14.99.</p>



<p>If you’ve already played Ball X Pit, via Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, or somewhere else, please let us, and potential buyers, know what you think. Is it worth the investment? Is it the GOTY contender it’s been hyped up to be?

            <title><![CDATA[How Much Does RV There Yet Cost? Free To Play Status & Price Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rv-there-yet-cost-free-to-play-price/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve heard of RV There Yet?, you’re not the only one. The indie title is building a big name for itself, and as an indie title, the matter of its price tag has come up more than once. We’re here to tell you if RV There Yet does cost anything, and if it doesn’t, how much the price tag is that’s been slapped on this badboy.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rv-there-yet-playstation-xbox-nintendo-switch-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RV There Yet?</a> has a simple premise: Drive through and reach the end of Route 65. You must use supplies, eat food, and overcome a marathon of hurdles and deadly obstacles to do so, though. It’s not as easy as it sounds, but then again, if you don’t like the price tag, you might never get to find out.</p>



<p>RV There Yet? could be free-to-play, or it might not, so let’s see what it takes to visit the hilariously named Mabutts Valley.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-rv-there-yet-free-to-play">Is RV There Yet Free To Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Worth it, in our opinion. Credit to Nuggets Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>RV There Yet? is not a free-to-play indie game, and it does have a price tag if you want to play.</strong></p>



<p>The road to Route 65 has a slight monetary hurdle to get over first. But it’s worth it to support independent developers, as games like this always exude more creativity than <em>another </em>churned-out AAA sequel.</p>



<p>You’re also getting a decent amount of features in RV There Yet? too. The co-op title includes proximity chat to communicate your craziness and capers, online co-op, and a deep and detailed map.</p>



<p>Again, the game’s not free, but the good news is that it won’t break the bank, in the same way a moose will break your RV with ease.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-rv-there-yet-cost-on-steam">How Much Does RV There Yet Cost On Steam?</h2>



<p><strong>RV There Yet? has a paltry price tag of $7.99 (or £6.69) on Steam, making the game a very affordable purchase for all parties.</strong></p>



<p>One of the biggest benefits when it comes to indie titles has, and always will be, the alluring price tags. It might not be free, but it’s almost as good as free! This is a fair cost for a co-op title that you can derive many hours of pleasure and pain from.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if you buy RV There Yet? before October 28 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949040/RV_There_Yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, you get the game for a discounted introductory price: $7.19 or £6.02.</p>



<p>The sooner you buy it, the better. So, let us know if you do, what you think of it, and you can share your experience through the comments and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon never likes to make it easy to complete the Pokédex in any game, and the same challenges are presented in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with some requiring trading. We’re here to help, though, with a full list of trade codes.</p>



<p>Trade codes in Pokémon Legends: Z-A are extremely beneficial as they allow you to skip past the long process of using social media platforms to organise trades with strangers, instead putting you straight into the thick of it by pairing you with a player who is looking for exactly the same thing as you.</p>



<p>Gone are the days when you needed to be in close proximity with a link cable; instead, complete your Pokémon Legends: Z-A Pokédex through the wonders of the internet using these trade codes.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Gotta swap ’em all. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 10 Pokémon</strong> <strong>in total that require trading to evolve in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A, though some can be found in their evolved forms in the wild.</strong></p>



<p>The likes of Alakazam, Gengar, Machamp, and Gourgeist are encounterable in the wild in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, though they can be rare, while Steelix can be caught via main story progression. If you want a readily available supply of the Pokémon, however, trading is the quickest means.</p>



<p>Below, you can find all the trade codes for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/AustinJohnPlays/status/1979536288400191535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AustinJohnPlays</a>. Be sure to check the receiving Pokémon before agreeing to a trade so you don’t get trolled!</p>

<p><strong>Trading in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A is not immediately available when you first start the game, as introductory points of the story must be completed before online access opens up.</strong></p>



<p>Once you have unlocked online features in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, including the Mystery Gift and Trading, follow these steps to initiate a trade.</p>



<ol>
<li>Hit X on your Nintendo Switch controller to open the main menu.</li>



<li>Scroll down to the ‘Link Play’ option.</li>



<li>Select ‘Link Trade’.</li>



<li>Choose the ‘Faraway Players’ option.</li>



<li>Wait for your console to connect to the internet.</li>



<li>Enter the designated code from the table above.</li>



<li>Wait for a partner to be found.</li>



<li>Select the Pokémon you wish you trade.</li>



<li>Check that the Pokémon being offered is what you want and has any required items being held.</li>



<li>Accept the trade.</li>
</ol>



<p>Evolutions for Pokémon will trigger once they are received, adding to your Pokédex. If it’s your first time completing a Link Trade, you’ll also earn a stack of reward points towards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-mables-research-rewards-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mable’s Research Tasks</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 2 Movie Will Now Release a Week Earlier]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-2-movie-release-date-change/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-2-movie-will-now-release-a-week-earlier.1331197/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s only been a couple of months since it was officially announced that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-mortal-kombat-2-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 2</a> movie will be missing its 2025 release date and will be pushed back to May 2026; however, a new tidbit of news has once again changed the movie’s release date.</p>



<p>Moving from its pre-planned May 22nd, 2026 release date, Mortal Kombat 2 is not set to launch one week earlier on May 15, 2026.</p>



<p>Presumably, the date change is intended to give the film breathing room in what appears to be shaping up to be a busy month for movies in May. Notably, it avoids a same-day release as The Mandalorian and Grogu movie, which is set to launch on May 22nd.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-mortal-kombat-2-avoiding-gta-6">Is Mortal Kombat 2 Avoiding GTA 6?</h2>



<p>The movie industry usually doesn’t take note of video game releases, but it could be said that the release date move may also have been made to avoid Grand Theft Auto 6’s release date, which is currently scheduled for May 26th.</p>



<p>In the industry’s eyes, GTA 6 could be a once-in-a-lifetime event for the video game industry, causing millions of gamers to hunker down to play the game. Although movies don’t tend to take notice of video games, I think this is such an unprecedented release, that it was a wise decision if they decided to change because of it.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to watching Mortal Kombat 2 on May 15th? Let me know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>&nbsp;if you’re hoping for a resurgence of Scarface: The World is Yours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You need to know how many people and players can play RV There Yet together if you’ve ever wanted to build haggard-looking contraptions to get an RV over obstacles, negotiate tight mountain roads leading to almost-certain death, and smoke stuff with a moose loose on the RV.</p>



<p>That was quite the opening paragraph, yet it encapsulates everything <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rv-there-yet-playstation-xbox-nintendo-switch-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RV There Yet?</a> is about. The Nuggets Entertainment project borrows the odd idea from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PEAK</a>—understandably, given PEAK’s unbelievable success—and adds its own flair.</p>



<p>One familiar gameplay is how many people can play RV There Yet? If you want to know if this is a co-op title with AI, or a fun party co-op game, you’re in the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-players-can-play-rv-there-yet-together">How Many Players Can Play RV There Yet Together?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Nuggets Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>RV There Yet? allows for a maximum of up to four players to work together to get the all-terrain vehicle where it needs to be.</strong></p>



<p>The RV isn’t strictly an all-terrain vehicle, but you certainly need it to be to clear Route 65 in the game. Figuring out how to get past the next inconvenience is all part of the fun in RV There Yet?, and you can do so with at least three other players in your game.</p>



<p>Three of you can kick back and chill in the background, smoking and enjoying your best life, while one of you has the unenviable task of driving the RV and trying not to get it lodged in perilous positions. Exiting Route 65 is tough, but it’s better with friends, although it’s not <em>technically </em>a requirement.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rv-there-yet-solo">Can You Play RV There Yet? Solo?</h2>



<p><strong>Officially, RV There Yet? can be tackled solo, but it’s not recommended, as the game wasn’t designed this way.</strong></p>



<p>RV There Yet? is easily at its best when there are a few of you coming together. Would Among Us, Lethal Company, Content Warning, or any similar multiplayer game be as fun if you played them by yourself?</p>



<p>Plus, there’s the fact that a dev doesn’t recommend it: “[The] game is 2-4 players (technically can play solo but wasn’t made for that),” says jace on the official RV There Yet? <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1422517981216374818/1427593942232207481/1429856409188700292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a>.</p>



<p>For now, we recommend following these instructions and finding one to three buddies to team up with.</p>



<p>If you do play RV There Yet? on your own, let us know how it goes and if it’s even possible to complete the game. For anything else, head on over to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Discord</a> to discuss the breakout hit or anything else gaming-related.</p>

<p>The age of climbing games continues with RV There Yet? Another manic title with enough comedic juice to fill a swimming pool. PC players are currently lapping up the bizarre action in it, but as an indie title, it means RV There Yet? on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch consoles is unclear.</p>



<p>RV There Yet? is just as bonkers as it looks in the trailers. You navigate a classic RV through basic forests and woodland areas to the most perilous of scenarios and impossible-looking climbs. What could go wrong! It follows in the footsteps (and footholds) of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PEAK</a> and other climbing games.</p>



<p>Whether you love the genre or you want to get yourself into some chaotic mishaps, we have information on the game’s console status.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rv-there-yet-on-playstation-consoles">Can You Play RV There Yet? On PlayStation Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sure. Credit to Nuggets Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You currently can’t play RV There Yet? on PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 consoles.</strong></p>



<p>That’s two down, unfortunately. RV There Yet can’t be played on current-gen or last-gen PlayStation hardware. It’s not a matter of whether the consoles can support the game—as we know they’re more than powerful enough—but it comes down to coding an indie PC game for a different platform, money, and other factors.</p>



<p>It could be a while until we see it on PlayStation, if ever.</p>

<p><strong>Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S players also have to miss out on RV There Yet? as it’s also not on Microsoft consoles for now.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not going great. RV There Yet? also can’t make any stops for Xbox users. It’s a similar situation for the Xbox as it is for PlayStation, and until a wider console launch is announced, Xbox owners don’t get to experience RV There Yet either.</p>

<p><strong>It’s a clean sweep as RV There Yet? isn’t available on either the Nintendo Switch or the Switch 2 successor.</strong></p>



<p>The original Switch had a habit of not incorporating wider third-party AAA titles, but would be home to indie titles—some of which Nintendo got first before PlayStation and Xbox, such as Hades.</p>



<p>However, there’s no such luck with RV There yet? Not even the more powerful and superior Switch 2 has a port lined up yet.</p>

<p><strong>The game’s developer “isn’t sure” if RV There Yet will ever see the light of day on consoles.</strong></p>



<p>RV There Yet’s Discord server is quite active, and one user <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1422517981216374818/1427593942232207481/1429855678939398296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">asked</a>: “Will the game release on console alongside Steam? (If it will have a console release at all?)</p>



<p>jace—a dev and community manager for the game’s Discord—<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1422517981216374818/1427593942232207481/1429856287688102030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said this</a> concerning a console launch:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“No console release planned at this stage. And unfortunately I’m not great with hardware so I’m not sure.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not ruled out altogether. As with other breakout indie games, it will likely depend on the game’s long-term profitability, sustainability, and interest in a wider launch. We’ll let you know if the day comes when RV There Yet drives down to PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo demanding a console release.</p>



<p>Have you managed to get on RV There Yet? early, before the game goes viral? How do you think it compares to its contemporaries?
