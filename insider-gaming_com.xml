<p>The shelf life for ARC Raiders is going to be a long one. That means a lengthy trophy list is almost a given, and Embark Studios has gone ahead and delivered many trophies and achievements for you to strive for.</p>



<p>The extraction shooter market is a better place with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-launch-time-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> in it. Embark Studios has been working on ARC Raiders for a while, and chances are you’ve already sampled it before launch. Several betas and playtests later, the full game finally launched on October 30.</p>



<p>Aplty enough, you’re going to ‘Embark’ on a heck of an adventure if you hope to complete the ARC Raiders trophy list.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Now that Dying Light: The Beast is out, Techland can start focusing again on Dying Light 2: Stay Human. The live-service, open-world zombie title has always enjoyed seasonal updates, and this Halloween, that remains the case. Techland has introduced a new event in Dying Light 2: Stay Human dubbed ‘Halloween Showdown’, and it transforms the game – <strong>for a time</strong>.</p>



<p>In Halloween Showdown, players must fight and kill special infected enemies to secure candies that they can use to unlock exclusive rewards from warring factions. The ‘special infected’ are the game’s normal enemies, but reimagined to suit the spooky Halloween season.</p>



<h2 id="h-halloween-hits-stay-human">Halloween Hits Stay Human</h2>



<p>In a recent release, the team at Techland revealed the arrival of the Dying Light 2 Halloween event, named Halloween Showdown. It’s set to run from today to November 20, giving users a fair window in which to unlock exclusive rewards.</p>



<p>Here’s a segment from that release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>The city of Villedor</strong>&nbsp;is fully decorated for Halloween, with returning themed enemies including Pumpkintiles, Witches, Scaregoons, Virals, and Biters. In Tower Raid, Halloween-themed enemies take over the Tower, with new decorations, layouts, and rooftop battles. Players can also unlock new characters like Cursed Pirate and the permanent Tower Raid character CyberRaider, while the updated reward track offers Toxic and UV weapons and a new scoreboard for competitive play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This new Dying Light 2 event goes hand-in-hand with some featured community maps, themed around Halloween, being pushed by Techland. From November 13, limited bounties will unlock across these experiences, allowing players to grind for more rewards outside of the base game.</p>



<p>As you can also imagine, the special event also brings about some themed Halloween Bundles, which include one with a futuristic rifle that promises to ‘defy gravity’.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast continues to be a success more than a month after the game hit the market. Players are still neck-deep in the Call of the Beast challenge path, slaying the undead to their heart’s content. In a recent release, Techland explained what has been added in the new 1.3 patch for Dying Light: The Beast, including new enemy behavior, animations, and improvements.</p>



<p>It’s not an enormous list, but then again, it’s not an enormous game. If you’re interested in checking out the full patch notes for Dying Light: The Beast’s 1.3 update, read on.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-patch-notes-for-dying-light-the-beast-1-3">Full Patch Notes For Dying Light: The Beast 1.3</h2>



<p>One of the best new features added in Dying Light: The Beast’s 1.3 update is a pacifist mechanic of sorts. When you point a firearm at enemies after downloading the 1.3 patch, you’ll notice that they might lay down their weapons and surrender rather than tangle with Kyle Crane.</p>



<p>Techland explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dying Light was always about reactivity and making the world respond naturally to your every move. After hearing your requests, we’ve introduced a new human-enemy behavior – melee-weapon enemies will now recognize when you’re aiming a firearm at them and might decide to surrender rather than losing their life. Depending on your actions then this scenario can unfold in a number of ways, but we’ll leave them to you to discover.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team has also added nine new weapon execution animations, covering every type of melee weapon in the game.</p>



<p>Call of the Beast continues, and the campaign has moved on a notch with fresh challenges. As a collective, the community needs ot land 10 million shots to secure an exclusive car skin, and 20 million to unlock a limited edition rifle. This new challenge runs from today until next Thursday.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <strong>Dying Light: The Beast x PUBG Mobile </strong>crossover event kicks off tomorrow. You need to access the Dying Light Outpost page and activate the quest, which will trigger an event in-game that hands you a new quest. Once you’ve completed this quest line, you’ll have unlocked stacks of PUBG Mobile-themed items.</p>

<p>The anticipated The Lord of the Rings MMO from Amazon Games might have been canceled. At least, that’s what a former employee’s post on social media would suggest.</p>



<p>In a now-deleted post on LinkedIn, a former developer confirmed that they had been laid off from Amazon Games and specifically mentioned The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p>



<p><strong>“This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y’all would have loved it),”&nbsp;</strong>the post read. <strong>“It’s always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this — I’ve been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I’ve ever met here.”</strong></p>



<p>While that doesn’t outright confirm the game’s been shelved, the wording used in the post strongly suggests that’s the case. On top of that, sources who spoke to Insider Gaming are also of the belief that the game isn’t going to move forward, with one saying that the game is “likely done.” However, they wouldn’t outright confirm that it’s completely dead due to the IP involved.</p>



<p>Neither Amazon Games nor Embracer has responded to multiple requests for comment on the claims from the former employee along with what sources have said.</p>



<p>If this is the end for the MMO from Amazon, it likely won’t be the end for The Lord of the Rings as a video game franchise. Insider Gaming recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported that a new third-person action game</a> is in development with investment from the Abu Dhabi Investment Office. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite has confirmed the long-rumored companion feature is returning to the game, with Epic Games announcing new ‘Sidekicks’ will be included in the Battle Pass for Chapter 6’s The Simpsons-themed mini-season.</p>



<p>Long-standing leaks have teased the return of pets, which first began to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pets-are-reportedly-being-reworked-to-be-a-bit-more-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emerge in May</a>, and there have been several teases since. </p>



<p>Now, though, the news is official and, rather than waiting for Chapter 7 in December to relaunch the new feature, sidekicks are coming this weekend.</p>



<h2 id="h-sidekicks-coming-this-weekend">Sidekicks Coming This Weekend</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As the days continue to tick down towards the start of the final stage of Chapter 6, with a mini-season themed around The Simpsons, <a href="https://t.co/Iv2lOOSXhP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games has confirmed</a> the first Sidekick in the upcoming Battle Pass—which is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription</a>.</p>



<p>The first Sidekick to launch, Peels, is a banana-styled dog that matches the fan-favorite Peely character, which will be available to earn in the Battle Pass. At this stage, however, it’s unclear whether it will be a free reward or part of the Premium Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Additional Sidekicks will become available in the Item Shop from November 7, including Bonesy, Spike, and Lil’ Raptor, while images show Sidekicks for Fishstick and a pug in a hoodie will also come at some point.</p>



<p>Sidekicks will come alongside earnable Sidekick Points (SP) that can be spent on cosmetics to customize your Sidekick, with teases so far showing various colors, items, and apparel that can be unlocked.</p>



<p>The return of the Sidekick feature opens lots of doors for Fortnite’s collabs in the future, potentially bringing fan-favorite characters into the game in a different form.</p>



<p>Expect Sidekicks to have an even bigger role from Chapter 7 onwards, which will kick-off in December to mark the start of another year of content in the game.</p>
