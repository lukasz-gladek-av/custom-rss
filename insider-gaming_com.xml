<p>Hades 2 fans desperate for the game’s full launch can only pick it up on Nintendo Switch 2 at release. It’s currently locked in as a Switch 2 console exclusive for the time being, with a PlayStation and Xbox launch coming later.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-nintendo-switch-2-release-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 exclusives</a> keep coming. We’re still reeling from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct where the bombshell dropped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fromsoftwares-new-game-a-bloodborne-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoftware’s next game</a>—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-will-feature-8-player-pvpve-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>—is a Switch 2 exclusive. Now, Supergiant Games has revealed Hades 2’s full release is closing in, and its first port of call on console is the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Again, it’s a timed exclusive, but this is still big for Hades 2 and Switch fans.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo of America X channel</a> posted a video on April 8 about Hades 2 and its journey. The media clip is an interesting developer walkthrough, and an insight into the much-hyped sequel and its progress.</p>



<p>What you don’t expect is a message toward the end of the video saying: “<strong>Hades 2 Launching first for consoles on Nintendo Switch 2. More information coming later this year.</strong>“</p>







<p>Hades 2 has been in Early Access on PC since 2024. Supergiant Games has been honing the roguelike sequel, tightening up the mechanics, and making sure it lives up to the expectations of its Game-of-the-Year-winning predecessor. </p>



<p>You’re going to have to wait a bit longer to see how powerful Melinoe is if you’re on PlayStation or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>It seems like things are getting closer to a re-release of the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 for a new generation. Ratings for a “cross-gen edition” for both “MW2” and “MW3” have appeared online thanks to the Australian Classification Board.</p>



<p>As expected, both were given MA 15+ ratings by the board.</p>



<p>Both were given the classification on April 3 with a production date of 2025. For Modern Warfare 2, <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/mw2-ps5-cross-gen-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game rated</a> is a “PS5 Cross-Gen Edition”. Modern Warfare 3’s <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/mw3-cross-gen-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rating doesn’t mention</a> PS5 rather just it being cross-gen as well.</p>



<p>No other details about the games are given on the website aside from them being from Activision Blizzard. And while it wasn’t confirmed that its the original Modern Warfare 2 and 3, the styling of using Arabic Numerals as opposed to Roman Numerals leads to the belief it’s the games from 2009 and 2011.</p>



<p>Back in February it was reported that 2009’s Modern Warfare 2 was set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come to Xbox Game Pass</a> sometime in March or April. With April already here and ratings starting to show up, it would appear as though an announcement is around the corner.</p>



<p>Would you play the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 again on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>A new datamine reveals details about Class Specialisations in Battlefield Labs.</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-labs-lists-class-specializations-which-has-4-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1ST</a>, Battlefield Labs will feature four levels of Class Specialisations. Class Specialisations are different types of support players will be able to offer their team. There are 5 Classes: Fire Support, Engineer Anti-Vehicle, Mechanic, Recon and Pathfinder. The new Class Specialisations are similar to the Field Upgrades we saw in Battlefield 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also states that the information about Class Specialisations in Battlefield Labs was procured through datamine details from the 1|BF Telegram group. As it is not the game’s final build, these features are subject to change or even removal prior to release, so players should keep that in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-labs-features-different-levels-of-class-specialisations">Battlefield Labs Features Different Levels of Class Specialisations</h2>



<h3 id="h-fire-support">Fire Support</h3>



<ul>
<li>L1 will feature faster movement when resupplying ammo, transitioning from prone, aiming and moving while aiming using LMGs.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 2 is called Ammo Interact Plus, where teammates will have an increased radius to grab ammo from the player.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 3 introduces Improved Weapon Mounting, which will “improve the effects of mounting your weapon”.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 4 is called Active Resupply, where players can press L1 + R1 to drop a crate that will instantly resupply the team.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-engineer-anti-vehicle">Engineer Anti-Vehicle</h3>



<ul>
<li>Level 1 is called the Anti-armor tree, which helps slow heavily damaged vehicles, provides players with extra rockets, and highlights damaged vehicles.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 2 is called Dogpile, and it helps you reload Rocket Launchers fasters.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 3 is Mark Target, which allows players to lock on faster to vehicles they have already damaged or aimed at.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 4 is a Thermite Drone, which deploys a drop that disrupts vehicles; it can be activated by pressing L1 + R1.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-mechanic">Mechanic</h3>



<ul>
<li>Level 1 is Mechanic Tree, which will slow overheating for vehicle secondary weapons and repair tools. The Class Specialisation will also reduce the lock-on time for vehicles that players occupy and highlight mines close to you.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 2 will recharge your vehicle gadgets faster.</li>



<li>Level 3, called Vehicle Health Plus, removes the auto-repair limit restriction for vehicles you have used.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 4 is called Active Repair, and pressing L1 + R1 instantly repairs the vehicle you are using.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recon">Recon</h3>



<ul>
<li>Level 1 is Sniper Tree, which will spot while aiming, reduce weapon sway, and decrease detection when spotted.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 2 is called Despicable, and it will spot the enemies that have been “hit in the chest with bolt-action rifles” and slow down healing.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 3, called Killshot, removes the revive ability for any enemy “killed with a headshot by bolt-action rifles.”&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 4 is Mortar Support, and it launches a mortar strike at your aiming position when pressing L1 + R1.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-pathfinder">Pathfinder</h3>



<ul>
<li>Level 1 makes the player invisible to motion sensors when not sprinting, will hide their death markers from enemies on the mini-map and will reveal which enemies are targeting you.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 2 is called Damage Spot, which will spot the enemies you have damaged.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 3 is Silent Movement, reducing the sound you create while moving.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Level 4, called UAV Call-In, activates a UAV when pressing L1 + R1.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Schedule 1’s hot start was met with an investigation by Drug Dealer Simulator publisher Movie Games. Despite talk of infringement and copyright, the company is not looking to sue developer TVGS, but this hasn’t stopped users from review bombing DDS.</p>



<p>I’m not even sure where to begin with the latest development in this fascinating saga. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> took 2025 by storm and is raking in nearly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a million players at its peak</a>—several weeks after launch. Players were happily figuring out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-drops-items-in-schedule-1-discard-items-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to drop items</a> and make the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best weed</a>.</p>



<p>But news broke of an ongoing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation by rival title Drug Dealer Simulator</a> into “similarities” between the franchises. Fervid fans jumped to Schedule 1’s defense by review bombing the DDS games on Steam. However, Drug Dealer Simulator publisher Movie Games has addressed the ongoing controversy.</p>

<p>In a statement on April 8, <a href="https://x.com/MovieGamesSA/status/1909573722219888913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Movie Games posted to its official X channel</a>. The wording read: “We’d like to address the Schedule 1 / Drug Dealer Simulator situation and share some facts.”</p>



<p>The company made it abundantly clear, “<strong>There is no lawsuit</strong>,” and it’s not the company’s intention to “<strong>Prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game</strong> [Schedule 1].” The statement goes on to say the investigation is being conducted because of the similarities, and “Movie Games, being a publicly traded company, <strong>could face severe litigation for negligence.</strong>“</p>



<p>Simply, shareholders and parties with a vested interest in Movie Games could take exception to the company’s inability to defend its game against perceived copyright infringement. Movie Games believes this led to the media incorrectly labeling the situation “as a lawsuit.”</p>



<p>Movie Games states, “There is no ill will toward TVGS,” and they “<strong>Emailed them best wishes shortly before the release.</strong>“</p>



<p>So, it doesn’t matter how the public interprets Schedule 1’s content concerning the Drug Dealer Simulator games, a legal precedent has automatically forced Movie Games’ hand.</p>

<p>We don’t have an exact timeline on this, but there’s a good chance the statement came out following the relentless review bombing of Drug Dealer Simulator on Steam. Recent reviews for both DDS 1 and DDS 2 are “<strong>Overwhelmingly Negative</strong>” with criticisms mostly aimed toward the lawsuit controversy, rather than the games’ content.</p>



<p>The investigation obligation reveal might go some way to righting these wrongs. What we know for sure is this isn’t over, and forthcoming litigation could be inbound if the similarities are deemed <em>too </em>similar.</p>
