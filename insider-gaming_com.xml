<p>Announced in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, Into the Unjust in Helldivers 2 pushes players into a fresh battle against the Terminids into unknown territory, seemingly with a challenge that won’t allow you to call in Stratagems.</p>



<p>The teaser blog details disappearing “into the fog” to “discover new dangers”. It’s explained that “because of the nature of the caves, your Super Destroyer won’t be able to give you full support.” As a result, it’s your squad facing up against the Terminids alone.</p>



<p>New enemy types are also detailed, with “a new subterranean species of Terminid Warriors, Bile Spewers, and Chargers,” along with the Dragonroach, and “more terrifying creatures lying in wait on Hive Worlds.”</p>



<p>New challenges include escorting a mobile oil rig, locating and destroying the Hive Lung, along with new optional and sub-objectives too.</p>



<p>As is customary in Helldivers 2, the new drop of content also comes alongside a new Premium Warbond, called Dust Devils, which will “ensure survival in the harshest conditions these worlds can throw your way.”</p>



<p>The Warbond includes a primary weapon, a new throwable, and three unique stratagems, all of which launch on September 4.</p>
