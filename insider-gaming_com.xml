<p>Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of 2025 in the United States. The news was broken on January 22 by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczdusovdk2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana’s Mat Piscatella</a>. </p>







<p>DICE’s latest shooter might have slipped from the top spot back in November, but it managed to top the yearly charts instead. That means that in just under three months, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> had outsold every other title on the list.</p>



<p>NBA 2K26 remained firm at second place, whilst Borderlands 4 and Monster Hunter: Wilds switched positions to third and fourth respectively. Rounding out the top five was Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>Sports titles remain ever-popular in the US, with Madden NFL 26, EA Sports College Football 26, <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports FC 26</a>, MLB: The Show 25 and WWE 2K25 all featuring in the top 20. Interestingly, some titles on the list weren’t even released in 2025, with the likes of Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto 5 proving to remain top-sellers. </p>

<p>You might have to clap clap for YAPYAP when all is said and done in 2026. It has the potential to be one of the year’s big multiplayer titles, and you’ll be kicking yourself if you weren’t on board with YAPYAP’s release date sooner.</p>



<p>Joining a hype train halfway through is fun, but it’s better when you’re seated from the start. YAPYAP could be <em>that</em> game, and follow in the footsteps of memorable 2025 indie multiplayer hits like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/repo-collaboration-fortnite-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> and Peak.</p>

<p><strong>February 3 is the confirmed release date for YAPYAP, and it follows the success of the demo.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, YAPYAP has been in existence for a while, and many have already tried out its co-op carnage via a free Steam demo. The testing and trialing are over now, as it’s time for YAPYAP’s full release date.</p>



<p>The official announcement arrived on January 19, when Maison Bap had a message for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3834090/view/217994805837303225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Hey everyone! We’re happy to announce that&nbsp;YAPYAP officially launches on February 3rd&nbsp;Thank you to everyone who took the time to play the demo. The feedback we received was invaluable and allowed us to make significant improvements across the entire game, refining systems, fixing rough edges, and expanding on what worked best.”</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-what-is-yapyap">What Is YAPYAP?</h2>



<p><strong>Maison Bap’s YAPYAP is a multiplayer game that blends teamwork, horror, and all-around silliness to create another entry in the popular online co-op genre.</strong></p>



<p>Now, you can play YAPYAP by yourself, but these games are always better with someone else to shout at or BE shouted at by—we’re all friends here. Among Us and Lethal Company really popularized this genre of people working together online, invading a location, grabbing resources, or recording footage, and trying to get them out while avoiding monsters.</p>



<p>YAPYAP is just that, only this time, you can all cast spells by actually saying them out loud into your microphone. You can create projectiles, turn your friends into tiny people, use Crystal Balls to guide your way, and literally fly around the castle.</p>



<p>Think of Harry Potter, only Harry, Hermione, and Ron remain unruly children forever and intend to cause as much mayhem as possible.</p>
