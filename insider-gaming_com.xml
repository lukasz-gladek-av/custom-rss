            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-faze-gta-6-rp-crypto-server/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Grand Theft Auto’s RP scene is what has kept GTA 5 so popular for all these years. If you venture onto Twitch, you’ll often see that Grand Theft Auto 5 sits at the top of the charts at any given time, and that’s because of the success of ‘GTA RP’. These servers offer a more immersive experience, allowing players to have jobs, join gangs, and generally live out virtual lives on modded servers.</p>



<p>Big streamers have enjoyed the amount of viewers they’ve accrued while exploring the GTA RP world. Now, one of the most prolific creators of them all, Adin Ross, has joined forces with FaZe Banks, and the pair plan to create a GTA 6 RP server backed by cryptocurrency, which players will be able to ‘earn’ as they play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-probably-not">But Probably Not</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, Adin Ross and FaZe Banks outlined their GTA 6 RP vision, expressing their desire to create a server linked with a token or two that you can use to earn money while you play GTA 6 online.</p>



<p>Adin Ross explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When GTA 6 drops, me and Rick here are going to make the biggest server together. We’re going to do the best s*** ever and I promise you, it’s going to be completely crypto — everything pro-crypto about it.</p>



<p>It’s going to change the game because GTA 6 – I promise you guys – they already bought FiveM, it’s going to be all RP.</p>



<p>I’ll have the best and biggest server, I promise you I will.</p>



<p>We’re going to put a lot of money into it.</p>



<p>This is my passion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, Rockstar Games supports the modding and RP communities that exist at the heart of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. However, the gaming titan <strong>does not </strong>allow cryptocurrencies to be integrated in any way with the slew of GTA RP servers out there. This will be a huge sticking point for Adin Ross and FaZe Banks’ plans.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Adin ross announces GTA 6 news</span></p></article></div>







<p>Historically, ventures linking games with the blockchain, NFTs, or cryptocurrencies have fallen flat on their faces. Ubisoft tried to set up an NFT marketplace tied to Ghost Recon, and it didn’t work at all. Recently, Midnight Society, the developer behind the NFT-backed DEADROP, announced a studio shutdown.</p>



<p>The most dedicated GTA RP players live out virtual lives on the platform. They’ll hold down a job, earn in-game cash, buy and customise houses, meet up with their friends, and even accept punishment from the police when they commit crimes. All of this is done in a world populated by other players.</p>



<p>It’ll be a big seller when GTA 6 is released, but if the track record represents anything, it’s that a solid RP ecosystem won’t exist until a few years after GTA 6 has hit the open market.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-is-canker%E2%80%99s-camp-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-answered.1100580/</guid>

<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll eventually come across a quest named ‘Canker’. It’s a side quest given to you by Gules in Semine, and it requires you to head to the camp of a former associate of Gules and ‘get rid of’ the band occupying it. However, all you’re given by way of a location is a large, open area on the map.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll help you find Canker’s camp in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and teach you what to do with it when you get there.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-canker-s-camp-in-kingdom-come">How to Find Canker’s Camp in Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>Canker’s Camp is located north of Nebakov, in the lower half of the game world. It’s in a densely wooded area, set back under a rocky outcrop alongside a stream.</p>



<p>Here’s the map location for the camp:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Canker’s Camp location in Kingdom Come</figcaption></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-to-deal-with-canker-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How to Deal with Canker in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</h2>



<p>Once you’ve tracked down the camp, you’ll want to take it slow and silent, especially if you plan on killing all the camp’s occupants.</p>



<p>The easiest way to deal with Canker is to approach the camp in the dead of night with a dagger. There will be one guard roaming the nearby area with a torch, making him easy to identify. Try to lead him away from the main camp, taking him out swiftly before he can raise the alarm.</p>



<p>Every other member of Canker’s camp – including Canker himself – will be asleep on the beds scattered around the camp, making it easy to stealth kill them with the dagger.</p>



<p><strong>Note: You MUST have a dagger to perform a stealth kill</strong>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve killed every bandit in the camp, you can secure Canker’s mace, which is the core goal of this quest. Then, loot the area and leave when you’re satisfied with the quest completion, heading back to Semine in your own time.</p>



<p>If you like Canker’s mace, you’ll have the option to keep it after the quest. Just ask Gules if you can hang onto it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/find-nikvard-kingdom-come-deliverance-quest/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-is-nikvard-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-%E2%80%93-magnum-opus-quest.1100559/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/find-nikvard-kingdom-come-deliverance-quest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll pick up a quest relatively early on called ‘Magnum Opus’, but it’s a lengthy one that’ll sit in your quest log for quite some time. It could be many hours until you finish it, and there are quite a few steps along the way to resolving it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I’ve put together a Magnum Opus quest guide, designed to help you conquer the most troublesome objective – finding Nikvard in Kingdom Come Deliverance. He’s a slippery character, but in this guide, you’ll learn Nikvard’s location in just a few steps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finding-nikvard-in-kingdom-come">Finding Nikvard in Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>Magnum Opus will be handed to you by the Lower Semine Miller if you follow his quest line.</p>



<p>It requires Henry of Skalitz to find his way into Trosky Castle and liberate a book that’s hidden somewhere within, but details are sparse. As the quest pieces itself together, Henry concocts a plan to get himself inside, but things quickly turn awry.</p>



<p>Once you’ve made your way into Trosky Castle (against your will), you’ll find yourself facing the objective with almost nothing to guide you on your quest. Talking to the Scribe and some of the castle’s occupants doesn’t reveal much, and ultimately, you learn that Nikvard has the book, <strong>but nobody knows where he is</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-where-to-find-nikvard-for-magnum-opus">Where to Find Nikvard for Magnum Opus</h3>



<p>Nikvard has the book – that much is obvious.</p>



<p>If you want to go through the various speech checks and minor actions to advance the quest and level up some skills, feel free to follow the quest as it was designed. If you’d rather skip that and head straight to Nikvard’s location to force the completion of the quest, then you’ll need to go here:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Look for the red flag!</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The red and yellow flag marker is where you’ll find Nikvard in KCD2</strong>.</p>



<p>The location of the Magnum Opus in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is actually <strong>outside </strong>the castle grounds. It seems that Nikvard had a spot of bother with his digestive health and the book ended up falling down a latrine, passing through the sewer pipe and landing on the floor outside the castle.</p>



<p>It’s sitting immediately alongside Nikvard’s dead body, which is a shame. He seemed like he would have been a nice guy.</p>



<p>Don’t worry, the guard standing nearby commenting on the dead body won’t mind you taking the book – but the Miller will comment on how badly it smells when you take it back to him.</p>

<p>There’s yet another rumor suggesting that the next PlayStation State of Play is coming this month. This one, however, has a date tied to the claim.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxgL5aFU6I7_BMaJmsuX3xaYVbkLo9cv_Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PH Brazil</a>, PlayStation is set to host its next State of Play on Friday, February 14. His claims back up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prior ones from Nate the Hate</a> of an event happening in February.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s last State of Play took place in September 2024. That event included games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a>, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Palworld, and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-revealed-at-state-of-play-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. In total, they held four in 2024, with the first happening on January 31. </p>



<p>As far as what this State of Play would include, that wasn’t hinted at. There are plans for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more Xbox games</a> to make their way to the PlayStation 5, so it could be the time for some announcements on that front. Halo and Gears of War are two of the bigger names making the rounds online, though there is nothing to confirm those being the next games to come.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for comment on these growing rumors. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-working-major-apex-legends-update-after-battlefield/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-working-on-major-apex-legends-update-that-will-come-after-battlefield.1100406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-working-major-apex-legends-update-after-battlefield/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A major overhaul of Apex Legends appears to be on the horizon from EA. During its earnings call on Thursday, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said that the studio is working on an update to the “broad game experience” for Apex Legends.</p>



<p>The trajectory of the business of that franchise has not been heading in the direction that we have wanted for some time,” Wilson admitted. “We do believe there will be a time where we need to do a more meaningful update of Apex as a broad game experience and the team is diligently working on that.”</p>



<p>Wilson <a href="https://ir.ea.com/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Q3-2025-Earnings-Conference-Call/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says that the update</a> likely won’t come anywhere during the buildup or around the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the next Battlefield game</a>. Instead, players should expect something on that “post Battlefield”.</p>



<p>He then added that, even further down the line, there will need to be a larger update than what’s planned for this next major update.</p>



<p>“Our expectation is that Apex will be one of those franchises [that keep growing for years] and that some time, on a longer term time horizon, there will be an even bigger, more meaningful update to that broader game experience, an Apex 2.0, if you will,” he said. “This will not be the final incarnation of Apex. The team remains incredibly committed.”</p>



<p>Wilson’s comments on the future of Apex Legends and an eventual Apex 2.0 come after he made note during October’s earnings call that an Apex 2 wasn’t in the company’s plans.</p>



<p>“[W]hat I would say is that typically, what we have seen — again in the context of live service driven games at scale is the Version 2 thing has almost never been as successful as the Version 1 thing,” Wilson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-2-not-in-eas-plans-company-to-continue-innovating-current-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said at the time</a>. </p>



<p>What are you hoping to see from Apex Legends with this next major update? &nbsp;Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>For Whom The Bell Tolls is one of the trickiest missions in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. If you’ve gotten around 10 – 12 hours into the game (depending on your playstyle), you might be stuck on this quest. Fear not – I’m here to provide a full For Whom The Bell Tolls guide, showing you the fastest way to get it done.</p>



<p><strong>Be warned – there are major story spoilers ahead. If you’ve not attended the wedding in Semine, do not read any further.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-for-whom-the-bell-tolls-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How To Complete For Whom The Bell Tolls in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</h2>



<p>For Whom The Bell Tolls starts with Henry down on his luck in Trosky Castle, tasked with becoming a forced worker of sorts as a repentance for his misdeeds at the wedding in Semine. Immediately, players are plunged into a dire set of circumstances, having all their items stripped from them – including clothing, food items, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-make-saviour-schnapps-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">precious Saviour Schnapps potions</a>.</p>



<p>You’re also against the clock in this mission, and you’re in a location that’s riddled with guards, trespass zones, and other dangers.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible to complete the mission, though – this is my full For Whom The Bell Tolls guide, step-by-step. It’s the fastest and safest way to complete the quest.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-start-at-the-gate">1. Start at the gate</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is where you’ll be tasked with hefting sacks of coal, but if you dismiss that job straight away, you can get to work. It’s worthwhile completing some of the side missions and extra tasks littered around the castle for skill point gains, but you don’t <strong>need </strong>to.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-go-to-the-second-gate">2. Go to the second gate</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Head inside the courtyard and make for the second gate, heading deeper into the castle grounds.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-get-the-lockpick">3. Get the lockpick</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>On the opposite side of the courtyard to where you enter, you’ll see this blacksmith area – there will be a box on this shelf with a lockpick inside. You’ll need this for later.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-go-through-the-archway-on-the-left-of-the-courtyard-and-through-the-right-hand-door">4. Go through the archway on the left of the courtyard and through the right-hand door</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s time to get sneaky. Head through this archway and along the path until you come to two doors – take the one on the right.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-go-up-the-stairs-and-through-the-green-door">5. Go up the stairs and through the green door</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>From this point, you’ll want to start sneaking.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-go-through-the-next-room-and-up-the-stairs-but-beware">6. Go through the next room and up the stairs – but beware</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>He’s not here in the image above, but this is exactly where you’ll see a guard as you come up the stairs. You <strong>need </strong>to go this way, so crouch and throw a rock against the window to distract him away from the staircase before proceeding up.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-go-up-into-the-roof-and-up-the-tallest-tower">7. Go up into the roof and up the tallest tower</h3>



<p>There are no restrictions here and you should be free to run up the many steps to the top of the tower. It’s here that you’ll meet Captain Thomas again. He can help you with your all-important task – but he has fallen ill and you’re tasked with securing a potion to help him out.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I can help you figure out how to do that.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-go-back-the-way-you-came-distracting-the-same-guard-away-from-the-staircase">8. Go back the way you came, distracting the same guard away from the staircase</h3>



<p>Once you’ve pushed past that guard, it’s almost plain sailing back into the courtyard.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-go-back-outside-and-past-the-courtyard">9. Go back outside and past the courtyard</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>You’ll now want to head up this staircase on the opposite side of the courtyard. Again, this section will require active stealth.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-keep-going-until-you-reach-the-stone-cave-room">10. Keep going until you reach the ‘stone cave’ room</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once you reach this room, you’ll want to keep heading up, up, up. </p>



<h3 id="h-11-enter-the-brown-door">11. Enter the brown door</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Go through this door – you shouldn’t encounter any guards here.</p>



<h3 id="h-12-go-to-the-room-on-the-right-and-deal-with-katherine">12. Go to the room on the right and deal with Katherine</h3>



<p>Katherine is back again, but aside from a light conversation, she offers almost nothing. You’ll need to solve this task by yourself.</p>



<h3 id="h-13-get-the-physician-s-book">13. Get the Physician’s Book</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>On the shelf here sits a Physician’s Book, which you’ll need to learn about the Fever Tonic, the thing you need to complete For Whom The Bell Tolls in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-14-lockpick-the-chest-very-easy-and-acquire-all-the-items-inside">14. Lockpick the chest (Very Easy) and acquire all the items inside</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This chest holds everything you need to make Fever Tonic in For Whom The Bell Tolls. If you’ve never performed any Alchemy before, it’s not all that tough. The game will walk you through it, so don’t fear.</p>



<p>While you’re here, don’t forget to check other Alchemy guides, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-belladonna-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-guide/">where to find Belladonna in KCD2</a>.</p>

<p>The Valve Regional Standings, also known commonly as Valve rankings or VRS, are the primary factor that determines which CS2 teams go <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-counter-strike-major-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the illustrious Majors</a>. In previous years, Major participants were determined by the results of prior Majors and/or RMR qualifier events. But under the new system as of 2025, it’s VRS over anything else.</p>



<p>Checking out pro CS2 for the first time or returning after a while? Here’s a full breakdown of the Valve Regional Standings used in Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-valve-regional-standings">What are the Valve Regional Standings?</h2>



<p>The Valve Regional Standings are four sets of rankings for CS2 teams: one global standings, and three regional standings. Each of the regional standings ranks the teams from the three primary CS2 regions: Europe, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific.</p>



<p>The standings themselves rank teams based on their performances in ranked tournaments and matches. Each match played features several different factors that determine how a match affects a team’s standing. The primary factors are the result of the match, strength of opponent, weight (importance) of an event, and recency. These rankings are updated weekly, usually on Mondays.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-are-the-valve-regional-standings-used">How are the Valve Regional Standings used?</h2>



<p>Valve Regional Standings are used to determine invites to tournaments and tournament qualifiers. For the more prestigious events, organizers will use the global standings to determine who’s invited to the event. Tournament organizers will also use the regional standings to invite teams to regional closed qualifiers.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-confirms-cs2-major-expansion-and-rankings-based-invitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Valve Regional Standings influence which teams are invited to the Major</a>. Specifically, the Major uses the regional rankings and the regional results of the previous Major to decide how many teams from each region are invited and what stage they start in. </p>



<p>For example, at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming BLAST.tv Austin Major</a>, the top six European teams according to the VRS will be invited directly to Stage 3, alongside the number one ranked teams from Americas and Asia-Pacific. The regional rankings will also determine which teams from each region are invited to Stage 2, and which ones that will be invited to the closed regional qualifiers.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-are-the-valve-regional-standings">Where are the Valve Regional Standings?</h2>



<p>The Valve Regional Standings are <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_regional_standings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted on a GitHub page</a> operated by Valve. From the main page, click on either the invitation or live folder, go to the current year, and select the regional standings page with the most current date. Sites like HLTV and BLAST also host the global and regional rankings, and update them each week.</p>

<p>Since Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018), Henry of Skalitz has sat atop Pebbles, his trusty nag. While Pebbles isn’t the most attractive or capable horse at first blush, she’s a familiar sight in the series and has sentimental value. With that in mind, should you replace Pebbles in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 when you’re given the opportunity?</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to get your first horse in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and whether you should replace Pebbles once you’ve tracked her down.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-is-pebbles">Where is Pebbles?</h2>



<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, players start the game alongside Pebbles, but a dire set of circumstances unfold, leaving Henry horse-less.</p>



<p>Not for long, though.</p>



<p>Once you’ve completed the opening sequences, you’ll want to make a beeline for Semine. When you’ve been released from the stocks in Troskowitz, you can speak to Bara (the red-clothed woman) and she’ll give you a tip on where to find a horse, recommending that you head to the Semine stables.</p>



<p>If you make your way there, you’ll be greeted with an idyllic location complete with a stables, and upon examining the horses, you’ll notice something strange – <strong>one of them is Pebbles</strong>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve identified Pebbles, you can speak to Groom Ballatay, attempting to buy Pebbles <strong>or </strong>convincing him to give Pebbles back for free. That’ll require passing a speech check or two, and you’ll have to convince him to ‘be reasonable’ to get Pebbles back.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-replace-pebbles">Should You Replace Pebbles?</h2>



<p>If you’re asking yourself, ‘Should I replace Pebbles,’ then I’m ashamed of you. This beautiful horse has been through the wringer and the first thing you want to do is replace her!</p>



<p>Here is the <strong>major reason why </strong>you don’t want to replace Pebbles in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eventually, you’ll unlock the ‘Good Old Pebbles’ perk, which boosts Pebbles’ skills immeasurably after a few hours of relying on her to get around. This makes her better than almost any horse you can buy.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you don’t like how Pebbles looks, you can customise her at a tailor or a saddler by selecting from a range of coats, covers, bridles, and saddles.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got Pebbles, make sure you’re firing from horseback with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/find-best-crossbow-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">best ranged weapon in the game</a>.</p>
