<p>In my review of Black Ops 6, I said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From a long and entertaining campaign to a stacked and solid multiplayer platform that feels refreshingly modern and well-built, to the round-based Zombies offering and the promise of a decent roadmap, there’s nothing about Black Ops 6 that turns me off. If I had to put a number against this Black Ops 6 review, it would be a 9 out of 10.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been more than a week since Black Ops 6 was released, and it has proven to be the most successful Call of Duty launch in history. Have you played it yet? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
