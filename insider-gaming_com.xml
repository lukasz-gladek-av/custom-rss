<p>Ubisoft has published the H1 FY26 report that was delayed a few days back, revealing that the company is in a pretty good place after ‘better than expected’ results over the last few months. In the data, growth was recorded year-over-year in every category, from ‘player investment’ to back catalog sales.</p>



<p>The results detailed an exceeding of expectations, which isn’t what critics were holding out for following the recent closing down of trading around the time that the financial update was postponed.</p>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-is-actually-doing-really-well">Ubisoft is Actually Doing Really Well</h2>



<p>The financial report was pretty glowing for Ubisoft, and it was laced with positivity.</p>



<p>Year-over-year, Ubisoft’s net bookings in H1 FY increased 20%, soaring to €772 million. Digital revenues made up a huge chunk of that, with the vertical also seeing a +30% increase. The shining gem was ‘player recurring investment’, which soared by +52% in H1 FY26.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a statement, Ubisoft confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Outperformance driven by stronger-than-expected partnerships, demonstrating the power and attractiveness of the Group’s portfolio as well as meaningful contribution from live TV and animated series.</p>



<p>Excluding partnerships, back-catalog was robust and in line with expectations, but marked by contrasted dynamics.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was noted that Assassin’s Creed ‘overperformed’ this year, confirming ‘positive momentum’. This was likely because Assassin’s Creed Shadows was one of the best AC games the company had produced in a good few years, not counting Assassin’s Creed: Mirage.</p>



<p>Ubisoft also maintained 34 million Monthly Active Users across the portfolio, and in H1, 88 million Unique Active Users were logged.</p>



<p>There were nice things to be said about Tencent’s recent investment in Vantage Studios, and it was noted that ‘all conditions precedent have been satisfied’, which means nothing is stopping the closure of that deal ‘in the coming days.’</p>



<p>Is this level of positivity what you expected from Ubisoft’s financial update? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake is one of the most talked-about games within the Ubisoft machine, but until now, it hasn’t been formally acknowledged by the company. However, Insider Gaming has covered the game extensively over the past 18 months and has now learned that it’s set to launch <strong>before March 31, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>This exclusive news comes as Ubisoft publishes the delayed financial update deck that was pushed back and went hand-in-hand with a halt on trading, fuelling speculation about the company’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-flag-remake-coming-very-soon">Black Flag Remake Coming Very Soon</h2>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the yet-unannounced Assassin’s Creed Remake is set to launch before March 31st, 2026.</p>



<p>The first official sign of the announcement came during today’s delayed Ubisoft earnings, where one ‘unannounced game’ is set to be released before the end of the company’s fiscal year, which ends March 31st. It’s the only game on the slate <strong>not </strong>uncovered and is flanked by the likes of Rainbow Six Mobile, The Division: Resurgence, and Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Insider Gaming understands that this blanked-out game is the yet-to-be announced Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake, which is scheduled to release the week of March 23rd. </p>



<p>There’s plenty of hype surrounding the Black Flag remake, which is often considered one of the best Assassin’s Creed games ever made.</p>



<p>As of yet, Ubisoft has yet to officially announce the Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag Remake, but Insider Gaming has covered the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release-date/">with a few exclusive reports</a> over the last year and a half. In the most recent Black Flag news, one leaker claimed that the Black Flag remake would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-new-details-claim/">more ‘RPG heavy</a>‘.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-wasnt-acquired-says-accounting-issue-was-cause-of-earnings-delay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-wasn%E2%80%99t-acquired-says-accounting-issue-was-cause-of-earnings-delay.1360423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s latest earnings report is live, revealing that the company wasn’t acquired and that an accounting issue caused the earnings delay.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-on-hold-financial-report-published/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Ubisoft’s H1 FY 2025-26&nbsp;earnings report has been put on hold, and it will be published before trading opens on Friday, November 21. Now, that day has arrived, and we have received some exciting details from the report, including what OT really is. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-earnings-report-reveals-details-on-tencent-deal">Ubisoft Earnings Report Reveals Details on Tencent Deal</h2>



<p>The new earnings <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/33qBiRpCj1Z9Ib5bbfbg5r/0c7fff607779c63e137037bc5c95a000/Ubisoft_H1_FY26_Slideshow_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> deal reveals that Tencent’s €1.16 investment in Vantage Studios should close in the coming days as all conditions precedent have been satisfied. The transaction will deleverage the group and accelerate Vantage Studios’ IP. Moreover, a cash position of €668m and the €1.16bn will significantly deleverage the group and enable it to make early repayments of the €286m Term Loan and Schuldschein loans.</p>



<p>Moreover, the company revealed that it has “reviewed its analysis relating to the IFRS 15 revenue recognition of a partnership in FY2024-25,” leading it to restate its FY2024-25 accounts under IAS 8. The Ubisoft report reveals that this position, applied by the group, led to a partnership signed in Q2 FY2025-26 not being recognized as IFRS 15 revenue, resulting in the company “not complying with its leverage covenant ratio under certain existing financing agreements at September 30, 2025.”</p>



<p>However, this will be addressed through the previously mentioned “early repayment of the Term Loan and Schuldschein<br>loans which have an outstanding principal amount of c.€286m.” Additionally, the restatement didn’t impact the group’s non-IFRS indicators. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the Chief Financial Officer at Ubisoft, Frederick Duguet, had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cfo-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">informed</a> staff that they were pausing Ubisoft’s stock “to limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility.” Ubisoft had requested that Euronext halt trading of its shares and bonds until the “publication of its first-half 2025-26 results.” Now that the report is finally live, players should expect trading in Ubisoft stocks to resume. </p>







<p> In other news, Ubisoft has stated that people are “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-people-playing-fewer-games-struggling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing fewer games</a>,” which makes it harder for new games to stand out. Additionally, Mark Rubin has revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mark-rubin-splinter-cell-ubisoft-xdefiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splinter Cell was not cancelled to make XDefiant</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has become the staging ground for a digital gang war backed by some of the biggest content creators in the world. The feud, which has been dubbed the ‘ARC Raiders War’ or ‘The Battle of the Bunguraiders’ has taken over the social circles surrounding ARC Raiders, with creators far and wide joining forces and urging their followers to show their support by dressing a certain way.</p>



<p>It’s a hilarious example of how engaged the community is inside ARC Raiders, the all-new and electric extraction shooter from Embark Studios. Let’s dive into the ARC Raiders War and figure out what it all means.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-arc-raiders-war">When is the ARC Raiders War?</h2>



<p>The ARC Raiders War is set to come to a head this Saturday, November 22. An immense group of streamers, featuring the likes of Myth, The Burnt Peanut, xQc, HutchMF, and Ninja, will all go live simultaneously to broadcast ‘The Final Showdown’. It will be the culmination of days of social media hype, and it’s set to take place on Spaceport.</p>



<p>If you want to watch the ARC Raiders War, you’ll need to be around and tuning into your favorite streamers at:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 pm PT</li>



<li>7 pm CT</li>



<li>8 pm ET</li>



<li>1 am GMT</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-did-the-arc-raiders-bungulators-war-begin">How Did The ARC Raiders Bungulators War Begin?</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, HutchMF was brutally downed and executed (read: <em>knocked out</em>) in ARC Raiders. He was pleading for mercy and went down screaming, vying for war against The Burnt Peanut after being taunted with the phrase ‘For the Bungulators’. </p>



<p>Hutch declared war on social media, and The Burnt Peanut quickly reciprocated. Before long, all manner of streamers were pulled into the fight, forming some sizeable teams:</p>



<p><strong>Team Burnt Peanut (The Bungulators):</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Myth</li>



<li>Summit1g</li>



<li>Cloakzy</li>



<li>RNGingy</li>



<li>Shroud</li>



<li>Ninja</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Team HutchMF:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>TimTheTatman</li>



<li>Nadeshot</li>



<li>Symfuhny</li>



<li>NICKMERCS</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s quite possibly one of the most loaded community-backed roleplaying events in recent years, and it’s only growing. Even xQc has joined the story, but he’s remaining impartial and hasn’t signed up to fight for either side.</p>

TheBurntPeanut, xQc, TimtheTatman, Hutch &amp; More (ARC Raiders Faction War)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SCP2W49TyCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-to-join-the-arc-raiders-war">How to Join the ARC Raiders War</h2>



<p>If you want to represent your chosen faction in the ARC Raiders war, you can do so by equipping the following gear:</p>



<p><strong>The Bungulators:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Striker Skin: Red</li>



<li>Bag: On</li>



<li>Gas Mask: On</li>



<li>Helmet: On</li>



<li>Padding: On</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The FMF (Hutch):</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Torpedo Skin: Red</li>



<li>Helmet: Off</li>



<li>Goggles: On</li>



<li>Mask: Off</li>



<li>Sleeves: Off</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to join xQc’s neutral faction, it’s just the Origin skin in <strong>blue</strong>.</p>



<p>Hutch has ‘control of the South’ of the map, while The Burnt Peanut has staked the North of the map.</p>



<p>This is one of the primary reasons why ARC Raiders continues to perform well, almost a month after its release. It’s a game that streamers can’t put down, pulling their audiences onto the platform.</p>



<p>Speranza is about to become a battlefield. Are you ready to serve in the ARC Raiders War? Let everyone know what side you’re taking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After many leaks, Silent Hill 2 Remake is finally confirmed for Xbox Series X|S. Furthermore, it’s already out to play and at half price.</p>







<p>Released in 2024, Silent Hill 2 Remake was a collaboration between Konami and Bloober Team to bring the 2001 horror classic to new consoles. Following James Sutherland, you’ll enter the fog-riddled town of Silent Hill to find your once-thought-dead wife. The psychologically twisted narrative was a hit then and even more so now, winning multiple awards and receiving praise from fans and newcomers alike. However, the game only came out for PlayStation 5 and Steam. Rumors and even a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">storefront leak</a> hinted that the remake would come to Xbox and, now, we can confirm it’s on its way and sooner than you’d think.</p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-2-remake-is-now-available-on-xbox-series-x-s">Silent Hill 2 Remake is Now Available on Xbox Series X|S</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Xbox Store has <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/silent-hill-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV/0010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">officially listed Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, confirming that it is on Xbox Series X|S. No trailer or anything has come out yet, making this a pretty huge shadow drop. Even more so, it’s appears that the game is out in full and can be bought right now. It’s Standard Edition is priced at $69.99, but is actually half off at $34.99. The game <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/silent-hill-2-silent-hill-f-standard-dual-pack/9MZQ9BGNL7VK/0010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can also be bundled</a> with Silent Hill f for $79.99.</p>



<p>As for DLC, we still don’t have a confirmation for Born from a Wish. Fans have been asking for it for quite a while, but no luck so far. Hopefully, with the game on Xbox, Bloober Team may revisit Silent Hill 2 and give Maria the content she deserves. The team is already working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-silent-hill-remake-development-bloober-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 1 remake</a>, so perhaps it would bide players over until we return to that foggy town. </p>

<p>A celebratory illustration for the Tales series’ 30th anniversary may have spoiled the next remaster. Even more so, it’s a title many fans have been vocal about since the Remaster project was announced.</p>







<p>Since 1995, the Tales series (also known as Tales of Series) has been charming players with vibrant adventures and grand action RPG combat. While not as mainstream as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-be-close-to-100gb-on-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy</a> or Persona, the Bandai Namco franchise has had a few successes in the West with Tales of Symphonia and Vesperia. Since 2021, with Tales of Arise, the series has been remastering past games like Xillia and, announced this week, Berseria. The full lineup hasn’t been revealed, but a new illustration from Ufotable may have let the cat out of the bag early.</p>



<h2 id="h-tales-of-the-abyss-remastered-possibly-in-development-hints-anniversary-illustration">Tales of the Abyss Remastered Possibly in Development, Hints Anniversary Illustration</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">◤ Step back into the story ◢<br>The 30th Anniversary Key Visual by ufotable is now revealed ✨<br>Characters from titles celebrating their anniversaries in 2025–2026, along with characters from remastered titles, invite you into the heart of the story. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tales30thAnniversary?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Tales30thAnniversary</a> <a href="https://t.co/BNcY6IfIJI">pic.twitter.com/BNcY6IfIJI</a></p>— Tales of Series (@TalesofSeries) <a href="https://twitter.com/TalesofSeries/status/1991703111467958370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In the post, <a href="https://x.com/TalesofSeries/status/1991703111467958370?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seen above</a>, the Tales series commemorates its 30th anniversary. The illustration, done by Ufotable (Demon Slayer), showcases all the recent Tales titles like Arise, Xillia Remastered, Graces f Remastered, and Berseria Remastered. However, one character there is from a game that isn’t a remaster, let alone announced: Luke from Tales of the Abyss. Given that the game came out in 2005, it being there is a bit interesting.</p>



<p>Tales of the Abyss was a PlayStation 2 exclusive and the eighth main title in the series. Following Luke fon Fabre, he’ll venture into the unknown to figure out his birth and escape a dangerous prophecy. Fans have been asking to see the game brought back to life for a while. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the next remaster after Berseria is Abyss, though Xillia 2 was confirmed earlier this year. Still, while it isn’t confirmation, it does give a small glimmer of hope that the PS2 title may be reborn.</p>
