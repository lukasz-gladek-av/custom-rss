<p>Activision has confirmed that Verdansk is officially returning to Call of Duty: Warzone as part of Season 3. The announcement came via social media posts on Monday morning.</p>



<p>“As we celebrate Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5 Year Anniversary, it’s time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories,” the game’s official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1899083215802904607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media account</a> said.</p>

<p>Verdansk will be returning alongside the start of Season 3 on April 3. In addition to the announcement, Activision released a new trailer to get players ready for what’s to come.</p>



<p>As far was what else fans can expect in Season 3 of Call of Duty: Black Ops  6, that information will be fully revealed when the launch gets closer. Season 3 was originally planned for a release later this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but was delayed</a> so the developers can “[take] time to deliver a great experience” for players.</p>



<p>The announcement of Verdansk’s return is likely just the first for what fans hope is a big new season for the game.</p>

<p>Battlefield’s Factions determine which regions fight each other in matches. The concept has been around for decades, and Battlefield 6, which may release in 2025, will again feature waging Factions.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> could be pivotal for both EA and the storied shooter franchise. Recent Battlefield games haven’t fared too well. Battlefield 1 was solid, whereas Battlefield 5 focused too much on what fans didn’t ask for. On the other hand, Battlefield 2042 was the series’ comparison to jumping the shark.</p>



<p>2025 aims to bring Battlefield 6 and make it one of the best. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> Factions have been the topic of conversation, so let’s dig into the latest details.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-factions-confirmed-so-far">Battlefield 6 Factions Confirmed so far</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you fight? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6’s 2025 pre-Alpha footage has shown NATO and what looks to be a PMC outfit called Pax Armata</strong> <strong>as the main opposing Factions.</strong></p>



<p>There are a few things to consider with Battlefield 6’s Factions so far. Firstly, this is a pre-Alpha, and it’s <strong>likely EA is using a ton of placeholders and unofficial names</strong> for now. The focus is on the gameplay, network connectivity, and overall game stability.</p>



<p>Given recent criticism of the franchise, it’s understandable if the multiple developers aren’t as bothered about the names of the game’s Factions for now. Secondly, don’t be surprised if EA does end up sticking with more generic Factions such as NATO and either an unnamed PMC (Private Military Company), or the generic use of “PMC” instead.</p>



<p>Real-life global tensions mean these decisions can’t be taken lightly. Battlefield 2042 did use “Russian Army,” “United States Marine Corps,” and “British Army,” but times change. So don’t be surprised to see Battlefield 6 adopt safe Faction names.</p>



<p>Even if Battlefield runs with NATO, you likely won’t be stuck with the same few default selections. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j6wy6t/thats_a_union_flag_right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Reddit post</a> has identified a Union Flag on a soldier’s uniform using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 leaks</a>. This means there’s potential wiggle room for customization options. The OP for the post said: “I’m hoping Dice is brave and gives us some clear depictions of Russian, Chinese &amp; Iranian uniforms for the opfor Faction.”</p>



<p>Again, real-world scenarios and events have a bearing on how Battlefield 6’s final content looks. We’ll have to see how close EA and DICE push the boundaries.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re still not 100% sure when Battlefield 6 is set to launch, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA has claimed it will be before April 2026</a>. We’re still not ruling out a 2025 launch either. </p>



<p>What do you think of Battlefield Labs so far? Does the game look promising? Are we finally due a brilliant Battlefield game?</p>
