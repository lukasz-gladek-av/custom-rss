<p>Recently, a clip surfaced online showcasing an AI-driven version of Aloy from the Horizon series. The real-time AI bot was shown having a conversation with a human, responding to questions while standing in an in-game environment. The clip was subsequently taken down, but not before it reached Aloy’s actor, Ashly Burch, who raised key concerns.</p>



<p>She was advised by Guerrilla Games that the AI bot didn’t reflect anything in development, nor did it use her motion capture or vocal talents, but it’s still enough to set a worrying precedent about the character – and all other characters voiced by such iconic performers.</p>



<p>We’ve been here before – a while ago, I interviewed Doug Cockle (Geralt, <em>The Witcher</em>) about AI voice replication, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doug-cockle-ai-voice-replication/">he labelled it ‘theft’</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-feel-worried-about-this-art-form">‘I Feel Worried About This Art Form’</h2>



<p>In a clip <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734">uploaded to TikTok</a>, Ashly Burch addressed the current SAG-AFTRA strike, which is taking place <strong>because </strong>AI technology exists. She stressed that voice actors are asking for ‘protections’ against AI replication, which is arguably the biggest concern troubling actors – and it has been for the last year or two.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I feel worried, not because the technology exists, not even because game companies want to use it, because of course they do, they always want to use technological advancements, I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it.</p>



<p>That does have someone’s voice, or face, or movement, and the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back, and that possibility, it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart, it scares me.</p>



<p>I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ashly Burch has long fought for the betterment of the VA vertical. Almost a decade ago, she was unable to reprise her role as Chloe Price in <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</em> because she was striking with hundreds of other actors on the grounds of compensation rates and pay scales in the industry.</p>



<p>We’ve seen many actors fight back against AI replication. On social media, Roger Clark (Arthur Morgan, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>) and Ned Luke (Michael de Santa, <em>GTA 5</em>) have been outspoken against videos using AI versions of themselves – even if those videos are silly parodies or memes. </p>



<p>In September 2024, Jennifer Hale <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jennifer-hale-ai-voice-acting/">went on record as saying</a>, ‘AI is coming for all of us.’</p>



<p>Do you think voice actors are right to be concerned about the sharp rise of AI replication? Let me know your thoughts in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-files-defamation-suit-media-outlets/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard, has filed a suit in Delaware against G/O Media, naming Kotaku and Gizmodo specifically. The suit complains that both outlets attempted to smear Kotick by ‘going out of their way’ to besmirch his name by mentioning false, withdrawn allegations of discrimination and workplace harassment.</p>



<p>It was claimed by Kotick that articles were penned with the ‘malicious purposes of causing further harm’ to his name, which was at the time already considerably tarnished.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-seeking-damages">Seeking Damages</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://courtconnect.courts.delaware.gov/cc/cconnect/ck_public_qry_doct.cp_dktrpt_frames?backto=P&amp;case_id=N25C-03-157&amp;begin_date=&amp;end_date=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delaware suit</a> filed by Bobby Kotick is pretty basic on the surface, but details of the complaint were obtained and published <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/former-activision-blizzard-ceo-sues-over-news-articles-accusing-him-of-workplace-harassment-discriminatio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Courthouse News Service</a> on March 13.</p>



<p>The complaint from Kotick reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Neither article had anything to do with Activision. </p>



<p>Both were about rumors that Kotick was interested in buying TikTok. Yet, Kotaku and Gizmodo went out of their way to include withdrawn, false allegations relating to workplace issues which G/O Media knew had been conclusively disproven by numerous investigations … purely for the malicious purposes of causing further harm to Kotick.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The articles in question were reports published by Kotaku and Gizmodo about the claim that Bobby Kotick was part of a cabal looking to acquire TikTok in the United States. For reference, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">I also covered those claims</a>, but I neglected to insult the man or bring up his troubled past at Activision Blizzard, aside from mentioning what employees were saying about him on social media.</p>



<p>But that’s probably why I’m not being sued.</p>



<p>Courthouse News Service noted that Kotaku and Gizmodo updated their articles to remove more negative terminology, but Kotick insists that, as a general rule, they’re still ‘mischaracterising’ him, and he’s seeking damages. </p>



<p>Stay tuned to see how this unfolds.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 keeps breaking the all-time high record for peak concurrent players on Steam. It seems as though a new record is being set every week at this point, and the latest figure is a <strong>doozy</strong>. Hours ago, the game hit 1.82 million peak players, which represents solid growth since the last time the record was broken with 1.74 million peak players.</p>



<p>As I write this, 1.5 million people around the world are playing Counter-Strike 2. The next top title on Steam is PUBG, the free-to-play battle royale game, which has 659,000 people playing.</p>



<p>Nothing comes close to Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-we-are-again">Here We Are Again</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 has secured another peak player record, and at this point, it’s becoming <strong>at least </strong>a monthly affair. More people are playing Counter-Strike than ever before, and it never leaves the top spot on Steam unless something remarkable hits the market, like Palworld.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It doesn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 is also the most popular game on Twitch by a mile, boasting 381,000 concurrent viewers at the time of writing. In second place is Just Chatting, with 316,000 viewers – the next top <strong>game </strong>on Twitch is Dota 2, with 183,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It helps that Counter-Strike 2 has a phenomenally popular esports scene, and that’s where much of the viewership and player count records come from. Most of the top channels on Twitch broadcasting Counter-Strike 2 are co-streaming the ESL Pro League, which is unfolding as you read this.</p>



<p>Whenever a top-tier esports tournament unravels in the Counter-Strike 2 space, it makes people flood the game, all eager to replicate what they’ve seen the best Counter-Strike players do on stream.</p>



<p>When did you last play Counter-Strike 2? Perhaps you’re playing it right now, loading into a match as you read this. Let me know in the comments.</p>
