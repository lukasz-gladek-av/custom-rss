<p>A new Born In Chaos Battle Pass accompanies the arrival of South Park to Fortnite. As with all passes, it comes loaded with customizable items and conditions that need to be met. This guide looks at the South Park and Fortnite Battle Pass’ end date, and more.</p>



<p>Everyone is goin’ down to South Park to have themself a time. If you didn’t know, it’s full of friendly faces everywhere, humble folks without temptation. Non-South Park fans might struggle to get the joke, but rest assured, many of you will. The cartoon series has left an indelible imprint on society and culture.</p>



<p>It’s still incredible to think that a child-friendly game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> has crossed over with South Park, but it’s better for it. The new Born In Chaos Battle Pass is at the heart of the collab’s progress.</p>

<p><strong>All Fortnite players have until February 5 to wrap up every challenge and complete all the content in the South Park Born In Chaos Battle Pass that was brought in alongside the mini-season update.</strong></p>



<p>If you go to the Born In Chaos pass screen and look in the top-left corner, you’ll see a live timer that says ‘Event Ends In.’ This is a constant reminder of how long you have to enjoy the South Park drop.</p>



<p>Eventually, it will hit zero, and it will be on February 5. After this, the AWESOM-O content and pass will be gone.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-the-fortnite-amp-south-park-battle-pass-cost">How Much Does The Fortnite &amp; South Park Battle Pass Cost?</h2>

<p>You don’t need to acquire V-Bucks or spend your current V-Bucks to obtain the South Park pass. It’s a free addition, and all rewards from it can be earned as normal.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-devs-fired-over-leaks-sent-to-influencers-rockstar-says/</link>
            <guid>1401511</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar has stated that GTA 6 employees were fired in 2023 and 2025 after leaking confidential information to third parties, who were reportedly influencers. </p>



<p>Rockstar, the developer of GTA 6, is under investigation for alleged union-busting. However, the company firmly denies these claims, stating that the recent firing of 34 employees was due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-game-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaking of features</a>. This situation has prompted the community to speculate about the nature of these leaks.</p>











<p>A Rockstar spokesperson has shared additional details about the recent firings in a statement to <a href="https://in.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-vi/250412/news/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, remaining firm that leaking was the only reason for the decision. The statement comes in response to IWGB’s claims, which state that Rockstar “broke the law” when it fired these employees, who were “organising for better conditions.” </p>



<p>The GTA 6 developers state that they took action against employees from the UK and Canada for sharing “highly confidential information”, including revealing game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an “insecure and public social channel.” This action was considered “a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies.”</p>



<p>Rockstar adds that the channel that these employees were using consisted of “25 non-Rockstar employees”, including devs from competitor teams, a video game journalist, and other unidentified members. Employees who posted “union-supportive messages” and didn’t breach their policies weren’t fired. </p>



<p>It was revealed that a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK, was fired in April 2025 for sharing information with a third party, who then posted it to social media. Additionally, an employee was fired in November 2023 in the US and in November 2025 in India for two more acts of leaking GTA 6 information. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Rockstar has pointed to its well-established zero tolerance approach to leaks, highlighting that it dismissed a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK in April 2025, who it alleged disclosed confidential information about GTA 6 to a third party who published the information to social…</p>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/2009055571190653411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-community-speculates-leaks-from-2023-and-gameroll-could-be-true">GTA 6 Community Speculates Leaks From 2023 and Gameroll Could Be True</h2>



<p>Since the November 2023 firing was revealed, a Reddit post from the same year has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q775cn/potential_gta_6_plot_leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">come into the limelight</a>, with players speculating that it could be the information that led to the employees’ firing. The leak itself talks about the plot and some new game mechanics. Players are also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1q6xoma/gamerolls_leak_basically_confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suspecting</a> that the leaks from Gameroll, who accurately predicted Jason and Lucia’s last names, could be true as well. </p>



<p>However, players should note that this is just speculation, and there is no official confirmation that these were the GTA 6 leaks that led to the employees being fired. </p>







<p>In other news, GTA 6 might not be content complete, and it is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-might-not-be-content-complete-hard-to-say-if-it-will-be-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard to say</a>” whether the game will be delayed again. Additionally, we almost received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-tokyo-almost-happened-says-former-rockstar-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Tokyo</a> title.

<p>Use these active Roblox Fireworks Playground monthly redeem codes to get your hands on free rewards like coins and more.</p>



<p>Fireworks Playground is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-walk-or-die-codes/">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a vibrant world of pyrotechnics and explosive celebrations. Players can immediately begin lighting various fireworks upon launch, and from there, progress through the game to unlock the best pyrotechnic displays available. With over 2,163 different fireworks to collect and launch, ranging from simple firecrackers to elaborate multi-shot aerial displays, pyrotechnic enthusiasts will have a fantastic time playing Fireworks Playground.</p>



<p>Having been released in beta during 2023, Fireworks Playground has gradually gained traction over the course of the following years and now boasts a dedicated player base with over 360,000 members. The game, developed by Pseudo Studio (specifically by creators PseudoDaemon and YuckMaster), offers a unique experience where players can enjoy realistic firework sounds and visuals year-round without annoying their neighbors.</p>







<p>Although simply lighting fireworks is enough for players to earn coins to unlock more spectacular displays, using redeem codes to get some extra rewards is never a bad idea.</p>

<p>Redeeming Fireworks Playground codes is a fairly straightforward matter, and they have made sure that even newer players to the game can navigate to the codes section and claim their rewards without too much fuss. Here’s how:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Fireworks Playground in Roblox</li>



<li>Click on the menu at the bottom-left corner of the screen</li>



<li>Scroll through the menu and click on ‘Code’</li>



<li>Paste or type the code into the textbox</li>



<li>Click on confirm and enjoy the freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-fireworks-playground-codes">Where to get more Fireworks Playground Codes</h2>



<p>Fireworks Playground codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Pseudo Studio Discord server, which has a dedicated codes channel where all new codes are posted first, and the developer’s social media accounts (specifically the PseudosStudios X page) where they announce updates and milestones for this popular pyrotechnic-inspired game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

<p>The cartoon crossovers keep coming in Fortnite. The wackiness of Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s South Park world has entered the holy grounds of Fortnite, and there’s a bunch of hilarious skins to unlock and use in the shooter.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> eventually has to run out of collaboration ideas, right? The Simpsons was a monumental achievement for Epic Games, and having Harry Potter content is always a blessing. But now South Park has entered the game, bringing skins sure to put a smile on the faces of long-time fans.</p>



<p>Epic knows how to pull off a collab, and the South Park skins prove this.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-south-park-skins-in-fortnite-crossover">How Many South Park Skins In Fortnite Crossover?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a collaboration. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five fun South Park skins to choose from in the January 2026 Fortnite crossover.</strong></p>



<p>You’ve definitely got a decision to make with the South Park skins. Each of the series’ main characters—and another fan-favorite—has been given the honor of a Fortnite skin.</p>



<p>Cartman’s is instantly recognizable, but it may come down to who’s your favorite character.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-south-park-skin-in-fortnite-collab">Every South Park Skin In Fortnite Collab</h2>



<p><strong>There are Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick, Kyle Broflovski, Stan Marsh, and Butters Stotch South Park skins to choose from in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>The four main heroes who’ve graced TV and movie screens for nearly 30 years were always going to be first in line for skins. Then you’ve got Butters, who quickly morphed into another of the main characters, and could be considered the ‘fifth’ member of the friends’ gang.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-south-park-skin-in-fortnite-cost-explained">How To Get Every South Park Skin In Fortnite, Cost Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cough up the V-Bucks. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are no special quests tied to skins; you simply need to pay a fixed fee of V-Bucks to acquire any of the South Park skins found in the Fortnite collab.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of each skin and the cost.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">South Park Skin Name</th><th data-align="center">Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eric Cartman</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kenny McCormick</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kyle Broflovski</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stan Marsh</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Butters Stotch</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Each skin (if purchased separately) comes with the base skin, a couple of customizable styles, and a Back Bling item particular to the character.</p>



<p>You can also buy them as a fixed group with the ‘Gonna Have Myself A Time’ bundle, which will set you back <strong>4,000 V-Bucks</strong> at present.</p>



<p>How A.W.E.S.O.M.-O are these skins, seriously? But, with over 20 seasons’ worth of material, the time has come to let IG know which ones you’re sad didn’t make the cut, and what future South Park content the game needs.

<p>This year, The Division celebrates its tenth anniversary, having emerged way back in 2016 as a solid post-apocalyptic MMO of sorts. It plunged players into a devastated New York City, torn apart by a viral pandemic and taken over by factions hellbent on twisting the city into their crime-fuelled playground.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft gave us an encouraging update regarding the future of the franchise, specifically targeting The Division 3, which is officially in production. Julian Gerighty, the game’s executive producer, said the game is ‘shaping up to be a monster.’</p>







<h2 id="h-the-division-3-could-be-the-biggest-game-in-the-series">The Division 3 Could Be The Biggest Game in the Series</h2>



<p>In a recent appearance on the New Game+ showcase, Ubisoft’s Julian Gerighty spoke about the past, present, and future of The Division. Last year, it was revealed that The Division 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/">was almost shuttered</a> until a dynamic team of five developers stepped up to ‘resurrect’ the game.</p>



<p>Now, the series is booming, and that includes the production of The Division 3, which is yet to be formally revealed by Ubisoft.</p>



<p>However, Gerighty had bold promises for the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it’s been announced. It’s <strong>shaping up to be a monster</strong>.</p>



<p>Within these walls at Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will have <strong>as big an impact as Division 1</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>From beautiful, cinematic trailers to a solid and original premise, the first Division game was released to a very positive reception almost a decade ago. It became a key pillar in Ubisoft’s portfolio and was expanded in 2019 with The Division 2, an evolution of sorts.</p>



<p>Fans of the franchise have long been calling out for an update regarding The Division 3, and while it’s only a small one, they finally have something to mull over.</p>

<p>Season One Reloaded has kicked off in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, bringing a new Fallout collab that includes a stacked Event Pass of rewards, though some are locked behind an additional purchase.</p>



<p>The Fallout collab in Black Ops 7 is widespread, with limited-time game modes, unique challenges, and items available to purchase in the shop, showing that the collab is not just about cosmetic items.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence about splashing out on the Fallout Event Pass, Insider Gaming has all the details on the price, the rewards available, and a verdict on whether it’s worth grabbing.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">How Much is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to earn. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Upgrade Track for the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is priced at 1,100 CoD Points, which works out at around $10 for the extra content.</strong></p>



<p>Splashing out on the Upgrade Track provides 10 additional rewards alongside the 10 free rewards in the Event Pass, most of which are cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">All Rewards in The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<p><strong>The Fallout Event Pass in Black Ops 7 comes with 20 rewards, 10 of which are available for free, with the other half limited to those who purchase the Upgrade Track.</strong></p>



<p>Free rewards in the Event Pass include two Operator Skins, a loading screen, XP Tokens, and a new base weapon, while the Upgrade Track includes a new Operator, alongside an additional Operator Skin, a finishing move, weapon blueprint, Emote, and more.</p>



<p>A full breakdown of the rewards available in the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is shown in the table below.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass-worth-it">Is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>If you’re a fan of the Fallout TV Series, the Blacks Ops 7 Event Pass is worth the cost as it provides the best content from the major collab.</strong></p>



<p>Unlocking the Upgrade Track is the only way to obtain the Power Armor and The Ghoul Operator Skins, two iconic looks from the famed series, along with other eye-catching additions, including the Torch Blade Weapon Blueprint and Minigun Teardown Finishing Move.</p>



<p>The Free Track, meanwhile, features much smaller collab items, with the two Operator Skins not being characters from the TV series, and the other cosmetic items being much less eye-catching.</p>

<p>Quantic Dream has just announced that Detroit: Become Human has surpassed 15 million units sold in 2026. </p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human was released back in 2018 and quickly gained popularity in the community thanks to its cinematic storytelling and decision-based gameplay. We were recently informed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/detroit-become-human-sold-one-million-copies-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 1 million copies in two weeks</a>, thanks to a massive Steam discount that was instrumental in reaching a new milestone. </p>







<h2 id="h-detroit-become-human-reaches-massive-sales-milestone-in-2026">Detroit: Become Human Reaches Massive Sales Milestone in 2026</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466707/detroit-become-human-sales-top-15-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>, a <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2026/01/08/detroit-become-human-surpasses-15-million-units-sold-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Quantic Dream reveals that Detroit: Become Human has sold 15 million units worldwide across PlayStation 4 and PC. The report shows that the game has been steadily hitting new milestones since 2020, with 5 million units in that year, reaching 11 million units in the next 5 years. 2025 was an excellent year for the game, as it sold 4 million more units, bringing total sales to 15 million by January 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-about-detroit-become-human">About Detroit: Become Human</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human takes place in 2038, where technology has advanced so much that human-like androids can be found worldwide. Players get to play as three of these androids, each of which has different moral dilemmas and obstacles to overcome. The game places a significant focus on player decisions, where your choices not only shape your characters’ journey but also impact the entire city of Detroit. The game features “thousands of choices and dozens of possible endings,” so no playthrough is exactly the same, as the most minute decisions can have a significant impact on how the story plays out. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Season 2 Expected Release Date & Content]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Season 2 of Battlefield 6 is on the horizon, and fans are beginning to get excited for what 2026 has in store for the popular shooter. From new maps and game modes to guns and gadgets, there’s a lot that could be introduced to the title, and based on Season 1, the bar is set fairly high.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first Season of Battlefield 6</a> laid the groundwork and saw a host of new content added across multiple dates. Across three release windows, DICE dropped two maps, two game modes, and five new weapons, but the question is whether Season 2 can keep up the momentum.</p>



<p>This guide has everything you need to know about Season 2 of Battlefield 6. From release windows to new content, it’s all covered right here. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-battlefield-6-season-2-start-release-date-explained">When Does Battlefield 6 Season 2 Start? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All eyes on the release window. Image by EA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Whilst there hasn’t been an official confirmation, you can expect Season 2 of Battlefield 6 to begin between January 20 and January 27, based on previous information.</strong></p>



<p>Seasons in Battlefield 6 were confirmed to last three months each, and with Season 1 having launched on October 28, that time frame would make perfect sense for Season 2’s release window.</p>



<p>As for the monthly drops, that’s where speculation really kicks in. With Season 1, new content seemed to drop roughly every three weeks. With that in mind, it’s reasonable to assume that Season 2 will continue this strategy, giving us these three dates:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>January 27</strong>: Season 2 Content Drop 1.</li>



<li><strong>February 17</strong>: Season 2 Content Drop 2.</li>



<li><strong>March 10</strong>: Season 2 Content Drop 3.</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s all well and good figuring out when we can expect new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-million-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> content, but the real fun is discovering what DICE has in store for Season 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-expected-content">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Expected Content</h2>



<p><strong>As things stand, no content has been confirmed for Battlefield 6 Season 2, but you can expect new maps, weapons, game modes, and more.</strong></p>



<p>If Season 1 was anything to go by, then Season 2 will offer plenty of new content. Insider Gaming previously reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-9-new-gamemodes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11 game modes</a> were hidden within the Battlefield 6 game files. DICE has already released two of them, Strikepoint and Sabotage, but that still leaves nine game modes yet to be released. Can we expect some of them in Season 2?</p>



<p>As for what other content you can expect in Season 2, <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1991100821216584154?t=soTDfqcscK604xcg2kW6uw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">prominent leaker Temporyal</a> might have some details. Back in November, he shared a list of weapons, gadgets, and vehicles that were in the works for Battlefield 6. He confirms that there’s no guarantee these features will make it into the final game, but he does highlight the MG5 and AH-6 Little Bird Helicopter as Season 2 releases.</p>



<p>Until DICE is ready to share more, all you can do is speculate, but Insider Gaming will update the article as soon as new information regarding Season 2 of Battlefield 6 drops.</p>
