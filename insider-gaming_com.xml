<p>The year may be coming to a close sooner than we’d all like, but there’s still plenty of big releases on the horizon, including Where Winds Meet, and we’ve got all the details on early access availability.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 and PC</a>, with expectations for the title high as over seven million pre-registrations have been filed for the game.</p>



<p>With such a high amount of interest, it’s only natural to wonder if early access is available for Where Winds Meet, and we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-where-winds-meet-early-access">Can You Play Where Winds Meet Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Patience. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access to Where Winds Meet, meaning that, even if you do splash out on the pre-order edition, you won’t be able to jump into the game early.</strong></p>



<p>Where Winds Meet is not offering any early access incentives for players, and everyone will be able to jump in at exactly the same moment when the global servers are released. Naturally, given that there could be thousands of players looking to enter the game at the same time, you may encounter some server issues—but they should be resolved quickly.</p>



<p>The bonus is that nobody will receive a head start in the PvP elements of the game, with everyone starting on the same foot, but it also means patience is required.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-where-winds-meet-early">Is There Any Way To Play Where Winds Meet Early?</h2>



<p><strong>No, there is no way to play Where Winds Meet early, as the servers for the game will not be opened until the launch takes place.</strong></p>



<p>While there was a closed beta earlier this year, offering players the opportunity to try the game out early and provide crucial feedback, those doors have long closed. Additionally, any progress made in the beta will not transfer over to the full release, and players will have to start again from scratch.</p>



<p>On top of that, Where Winds Meet has a global launch, with doors opening to players around the world simultaneously. Therefore, there’s no way to jump the queue by adopting the popular New Zealand trick that is utilized by many players for other releases.</p>



<p>If you really were desperate to play Where Winds Meet early, you could head to China, where the game has been released since December 2024, but the easiest approach is just to wait it out.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-players-turn-off-crossplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-players-are-editing-game-files-to-turn-off-matchmaking-against-%E2%80%98overpowered%E2%80%99-aim-assist.1344283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 players on PC have found a way to edit the game files to disable crossplay and prevent them from being matchmade with players using a controller, which is said to have ‘overpowered’ aim assist.</p>



<p>It’s a tale as old as time, where keyboard-and-mouse players feel at a disadvantage against controller players because of the aim assist developers add for controller players. In reality, aim assist is traditionally added for controller players in first-person shooters because keyboard and mouse offer more precise aiming. However, in recent years, keyboard and mouse players have felt that developers have incorporated aim assist too much, resulting in controller players now having a far greater advantage than those playing with keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p>The theory has led one player to discover that you can actually remove crossplay with controller players from the game files on PC For those who currently don’t have Battlefield 6 on PC, you can <a target="_blank" title="Battlefield 6 - Loaded (PC)" href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-pc/" data-shortcode="true">buy it here for the cheapest price</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-disable-crossplay-with-battlefield-6-controller-players">How to Disable Crossplay with Battlefield 6 Controller Players</h2>



<p>First posted online by the X account <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1985715884455817538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ottr</a>, players can go into the game files at documents/battlefield 6/settings/steam/PROFSAVE and add GstGameplay.CrossPlayEnable 0</p>



<p>The change will ensure you are no longer matched against players using a controller, but there is one problem with doing this… Players have found that despite the game reportedly already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 10 million copies</a>, the overwhelming majority use a controller, and at this moment in time, you’ll likely be playing against bots.</p>



<p>Ottr’s theory here is that the more people add the code to their files, the more mouse-and-keyboard players there’ll be, and as such, the lobbies will fill up faster with no bots.</p>



<p>It is worth pointing out, though, that editing your game files at this moment in time <strong>might not be worth it</strong>, as a future patch will be nerfing aim assist by around 25%. So if you are on PC, maybe hold off for now. Or if you don’t yet have the game and are deciding which platform to buy it on, it is <a target="_blank" title="Battlefield 6 - Loaded (Xbox Series X|S)" href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-xbox-series-xs/" data-shortcode="true">currently discounted by 17%</a> on the Xbox Series S|X. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Where Winds Meet is one of the most anticipated releases remaining this year, with millions of players pre-registering for launch, and we’ve got all the details on the title’s free-to-play status.</p>



<p>Launching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a> as a PlayStation console exclusive and also on PC, Where Winds Meet has seen over seven million pre-registrations ahead of its global launch, having achieved vast success in China, where it was released in December 2024.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering how much you will need to splash out to play Where Winds Meet or whether it is free to play, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-where-winds-meet-free-to-play">Is Where Winds Meet Free to Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to do. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet is completely free to play, with optional monetization coming in the form of cosmetics for your character and in-game currencies.</strong></p>



<p>While there are bonuses that can be purchased ahead of launch, including PlayStation’s $14.99 pre-order edition that includes an outfit set, Player Name Card, in-game common currency, and two in-game draw items, that approach is entirely optional. It does not provide any major gameplay boosts.</p>



<p>Additionally, cosmetics and in-game currency can also be purchased separately inside the game, though, again, it’s entirely optional and won’t lock you out of any major content if you decide not to splash out.</p>



<p>Instead, you can enjoy Where Winds Meet without spending a single dollar, as the game is available in its entirety for free.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-where-winds-meet-for-free">How to Play Where Winds Meet For Free</h2>



<p><strong>There are two big steps to playing Where Winds Meet for free, as it requires downloading the game and creating an account.</strong></p>



<p>While Where Winds Meet can be played entirely in single player, a constant internet connection is required, and you also need a dedicated account with the game in order to play. The bonus of this is regular benefits, including pre-registration rewards, being distributed into your account.</p>



<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to jump into Where Winds Meet without spending a single dollar.</p>



<ol>
<li>Sign in to your Steam or PlayStation account.</li>



<li>Search for ‘Where Winds Meet’.</li>



<li>Download the title.</li>



<li>Launch the game.</li>



<li>Create an account.</li>



<li>Sign in to the game.</li>



<li>Have fun!</li>
