<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of 2025’s most anticipated games. It’s a direct continuation of the 2018 title that introduced Warhorse Studios’ open-world RPG universe to the wider gaming community. Like many games these days, many players are asking one question about this impending release: ‘Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 coming to Game Pass?’</p>



<p>Let’s dive into that topic and find out if this game will be released on Xbox or PC Game Pass – or both.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-kingdom-come-be-on-game-pass">Will Kingdom Come Be On Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will not be on Game Pass at launch</strong>, but it could be added to the service further down the line. In 2019, the first Kingdom Come title was added to Game Pass – but it has since been removed.</p>



<p>Those seeking to enjoy Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on Xbox and PC will need to do so after paying full price for the game.</p>



<p>When Kingdom Come Deliverance was added to Game Pass all those years ago, it was still a relatively unknown, assuming title – little more than an indie release at that point. This time around, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a highly anticipated, epic title backed by a big publisher and years of development. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-being-added-to-ps-plus">Is Kingdom Come Being Added to PS Plus?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s no indication that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be added to PS Plus</strong> – it’s the same situation as the Game Pass question.</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2022, Kingdom Come Deliverance appeared on PS Plus. It was removed a few months later at the start of 2023, just a short while before the follow-up title was announced.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on February 4, 2025. Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you intend to buy the game when it’s out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty is a series that boasts one of the most diverse multiplayer-based gaming ecosystems in the industry. From a popular battle royale game to a thriving mobile platform, Call of Duty is known and loved by hundreds of millions of gamers around the world. However, the game almost <strong>requiring </strong>an internet connection to work means that players will often run into issues. </p>



<p>In this guide, I’m going to help answer one core question: ‘Is Call of Duty down?’ If it <strong>is</strong>, we’ll let you know how to get back online as soon as possible.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-server-status-guide">COD Server Status Guide</h2>



<p>It’s relatively simple to find out if Call of Duty is offline, whether that’s Black Ops 6, Warzone, or Call of Duty Mobile. If you’re finding that Call of Duty is down for you, you can access the following link and check out COD’s server status:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.activision.com/onlineservices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision Support Server Status Page</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s typically updated in real-time, but what if Call of Duty is down for you even if that status page reflects that everything is fine from a technical standpoint?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-call-of-duty-down-here-s-what-you-can-do">Is Call of Duty Down? Here’s What You Can Do</h2>



<p>Let’s say you’re enjoying a Call of Duty session and suddenly you find that Black Ops 6 is offline for no real reason. What do you do in that situation?</p>



<p>Firstly, you can check the status page as referenced above. It’s also a good idea to check out Down Detector, a service that allows users to report issues with games, applications, and websites. Failing that, consider jumping onto social media and running a search with a term like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Is Black Ops 6 down’</li>



<li>‘Is Call of Duty down’</li>



<li>‘Is Warzone down’</li>



<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re racking your brain for an answer, consider reaching out to <a href="https://twitter.com/ATVIAssist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Activision Support team</a> on Twitter (X). </p>



<p>There are a few generic networking tips you can take advantage of if you’re still not finding an answer. For instance, you can try rebooting your device (a hard reset if possible), using a wired or alternate connection, rebooting your router, or taking the last-ditch action to simply wait, play something else, and come back later.</p>



<p>If Call of Duty is down at that moment, it might not be in an hour or two.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It appears that Konami is set to release Metal Gear Solid Delta on the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 this year. This according to the leaker Nate the Hate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who’s been in the news</a> for his other Switch 2 reports.</p>



<p>The news comes from his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest podcast</a> which also says that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-revealed-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo will reveal</a> its Switch 2 console this week.</p>



<p>“[Other] third party games I have heard include Metal Gear Solid Delta, which is coming out in 2025,” Nate the Hate said. “Right now, it lacks a release date for all platforms, and I’m hopeful that maybe it’s a day and date release when it does come to Switch 2, because if that game, let’s say comes out in the summer of 2025, there’s no reason it shouldn’t be day and date.”</p>



<p>In addition to Metal Gear Solid Delta, Nate the Hate says that Ubisoft will be releasing a number of games on the new system. Those games reportedly include Assassins Creed Shadows, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Division, and even Rainbow Six Siege. </p>



<p>As always none of the above information has been confirmed. Until it is—or Insider Gaming can independently verify—please take it all with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>What do you think of Metal Gear Solid Delta coming to Switch 2? Does the idea of third-party games have you more or less excited about the upcoming system?

<p>Ahead of the February 27 release date for Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom is hosting an open beta, allowing anyone to access and test the gameplay features in early February before launch. You don’t have to sign up and hope for a chance to gain access; everyone can download the beta client and play upon its release. Here’s everything you need to know about the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta 2, including how to join, the dates, and more!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-access-the-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta">How to Access the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta</h2>



<p>If you want to test out Monster Hunter Wilds a few weeks early, download the open beta file from Steam, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S via each system’s storefront. It’s completely free, though you should expect a sizable download.</p>



<p>The open beta file is not yet available to download as of this writing. It will become available to everyone closer to the start date, as listed below, for the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta period.</p>







<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-dates">Monster Hunter Wilds Beta Dates</h2>



<p>This next open beta period is broken into two phases:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1</strong>: February 6 – February 9
<ul>
<li><strong>Start</strong>: 7 pm PT / 6 pm CT / 10 pm ET</li>



<li><strong>End</strong>: 6:59 pm PT / 8:59 pm CT / 9:59 pm ET</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: February 13 – February 16
<ul>
<li><strong>Start</strong>: 7 pm PT / 6 pm CT / 10 pm ET</li>



<li><strong>End</strong>: 6:59 pm PT / 8:59 pm CT / 9:59 pm ET</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-include">What Does the Monster Hunter Wilds Beta Include?</h2>



<p>If you participated in the game’s first open beta test in November, you should know precisely what to expect from this testing phase, as it’s the same. February’s open beta includes Character Creation, Story Trial, and a few monster hunts, including the all-new Gypceros Hunt.</p>



<p>And yes, any character you create during the character creation process in the open beta does transfer to the main game upon release at the end of February. However, progress does not carry over, so don’t get too attached to any weapons, armor, or abilities you unlock during the testing phase. They won’t stick around.</p>

<p>The latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has completely broken matchmaking, with players reporting they cannot get into the game.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Activision has yet to offer an update or patch notes for both Black Ops 6 and Warzone, but currently, no one is seemingly able to play the game.</p>



<p>But don’t worry; the Call of Duty store works fine if you’re planning to spend some of your hard-earned cash.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://mobile.x.com/CODUpdates/status/1878856625920065848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Updates</a> X account, the current issues are a result of the update being distributed to everyone. </p>



<p>The latest patch update is Call of Duty Black Ops 6’s and Warzone’s first update since the Call of Duty development teams took leave for the holidays. As for what exactly the patch entailed, it remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Call of Duty has been under fire in recent weeks due to the game’s massive number of bugs, inaccurate bans, and hackers, which has seen the game lose players on mass over the holiday period. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game lost 38.9 of its Steam player base in December, the highest percentage lost during this period in the past few years.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, SteamDB shows a further 20.8% loss during the past 30 days. Today’s news for Call of Duty keeps on getting worse, as earlier in the day, one leaker reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-is-reportedly-returning-to-warzone-in-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk will be returning during Season 3</a> rather than Season 2.</p>



<p>Waht do you think of Call of Duty’s latest blunders? Let us know down in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>According to new information revealed by a known leaker, Nintendo Switch 2 could be revealed this week with a new trailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i0fwdx/natethehate_nintendo_switch_2_will_be_revealed_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Nate the Hate has released a new video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> titled “Nintendo 2025 Predictions”. In it, he discusses when the Switch 2 will be revealed, what kind of support it will get, and other details. In the video, Nate states, “The Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed in the coming week.” He has been told that the Switch 2 announcement trailer will arrive on Thursday, January 16.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nate added that the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal will “focus almost exclusively on the console itself”. The reveal will not have any games present unless a game is shown “running on the screen”, depending on how the trailer comes out. He has explicitly stated that “software is not going to be a focus”, so players shouldn’t be “too surprised” if no games are revealed for the Nintendo Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nate elaborated that this week’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer might only showcase the system, its functionality, the new logo, and maybe some packaging. He’s heard that a separate software showcase for Switch 2 games will be scheduled for late February or early March, where we might see new Nintendo games and third-party titles.&nbsp;</p>
