<p>NetEase has cracked the live-service element with Marvel Rivals. We’re already looking ahead to Season 2 as everything the developer puts out is a win, so let’s see the early details to see what the developer is cooking up for the second season.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 2 is unlikely to be as big and as impactful as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>. The first season was the proper debut, we were still in the early days, and player counts usually tend to fall off as time goes on—no matter how good the game. Still, NetEase has Hulk-smashed it, and January 2025 saw its peak <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player count smash the 650,000</a> mark.</p>



<p>That being said, we need to look ahead to the future. The developer needs to keep its foot on the pedal and prioritize retention.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-2-expected-release-period">Marvel Rivals Season 2 Expected Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The saga continues. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NetEase hasn’t outlined an exact start date, but game director Guangyun Chen’s comments suggest Season 2 could start on April 4.</strong></p>



<p>Guangyun Chen said in an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a> that Season One is a “<strong>three-month-long journey</strong>.” Season 1 launched on Friday, January 10, so if we fast-forward three months (12 weeks), we land on <strong>Friday, April 4</strong>.</p>



<p>There are several factors to consider here though. Firstly, three months can mean January to April, so it’s not necessarily 12 weeks. It could be 13 or 14, so it’s logical conjecture for now. Furthermore, it’s quite common for projected dates to change by a week or two due to delays or rethinks.</p>



<p>I’ve seen countless live-service games delay seasons down the years, and Marvel Rivals is liable to suffer the same fate. Fingers crossed it doesn’t, but we will update you on the latest changes and developments.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-2-new-hero-leaks-amp-early-details">Marvel Rivals Season 2 New Hero Leaks &amp; Early Details</h2>



<p><strong>A ton of different leaks suggest Marvel Rivals Season 2 is getting two new heroes from a large selection of potential characters including various X-Men heroes and more.</strong></p>



<p>We know Marvel Rivals is guaranteed to get at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new heroes every three months</a>. Many names have been outed with leakers such as <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@X0X_LEAK</a> posting <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1872451730652422378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">messages on X</a> concerning heroes in the game’s files.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-x-men-characters-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X-Men characters have leaked</a>—thanks to datamining—and suggestions are that more high-profile names such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-claims-deadpool-and-more-are-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool</a> are Marvel Rivals-bound. On the other hand, more reports have come out saying NetEase is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-fake-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hiding fake heroes in game files to catch leakers</a>.”</p>



<p>It’s hard to say for sure if NetEase is doing this, but if they are, it’s an interesting move. For now, here’s every leaked name, and we’ll see if any of them appear in Marvel Rivals Season Two:</p>



<ul>
<li>Angela</li>



<li>Beast</li>



<li>Captain Marvel&nbsp;</li>



<li>Colossus</li>



<li>Deadpool</li>



<li>Emma Frost</li>



<li>Gambit</li>



<li>Hit-Monkey</li>



<li>Jia Jing</li>



<li>Jubilee</li>



<li>Locus</li>



<li>Modok</li>



<li>Nightcrawler</li>



<li>Paste Pot Pete</li>



<li>Phoenix/Jean Grey&nbsp;</li>



<li>Professor X</li>



<li>Rogue</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-marvel-rivals-season-2">What To Expect From Marvel Rivals Season 2</h2>



<p>We’re still weeks away from a Marvel Rivals Season 2 content roadmap or NetEase announcements, but it’s safe to assume we’ll get typical live-service content additions: <strong>New maps, heroes, game modes, and Events</strong>.</p>



<p>This is the kind of information we get more of—including leaks—closer to the time. But, it’s fun to speculate, and it’s easy to make educated guesses based on previous content and seasons.</p>



<p>New heroes are assured, as we covered above, but don’t expect the volume of characters we got in Season 1 as this is considered a one-off. New maps are about the most locked-in type of content for any new hero shooter season too.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-spring-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1’s Spring Festival and Clash of Dancing Lions</a> is an example of the type of events and content Rivals is adding in the future. With Seasons lasting three months, another event or two for Season 2 is a given. We’ll be filling in the blanks as we go on all of this and see if we can borrow Doctor Strange’s powers to see into the future.</p>



<hr>



<p>Details for Marvel Rivals Season 2 are vague right, granted. But it won’t always be the case, and we’ll update you as developments happen. But what do you want to see from the new season? What’s NetEase not getting right in the F2P shooter?</p>

<p>The Need for Speed franchise isn’t dead, it’s just dormant for a while. </p>



<p>EA has confirmed that  it has plans for Criterion Software—developers of 2022’s Need for Speed Unbound and other past racing titles—to return to the franchise in the future. For now, however, the sole focus at Criterion is the next Battlefield game as part of EA’s “Battlefield Studios” team.</p>







<p>“The Need for Speed&nbsp;team at Criterion are joining their colleagues working on Battlefield,” EA’s Vince Zampella&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told Eurogamer</a>. “As a company, it was important to us to take the last year to listen to our Need for Speed community and use their feedback to create content for Unbound.</p>



<p>“With an increased understanding of what our players want in a Need for Speed experience, we plan to bring the franchise back in new and interesting ways.”</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Confirms Battlefield Labs Community Testing Platform</a></h6>



<p>Based on the statement, it seems clear that there is no new Need for Speed in development in any way at the studio. That means, if and when it returns, fans are looking at years down the line for its release.</p>



<p>When do you think Criterion will return to developing Need For Speed? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-caster-rages-at-liquid-players-inexcusable-misplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A color caster for Counter-Strike 2 found himself screaming at a pro player’s mistake, and had to walk away from the desk to cool off. The play and the caster’s reaction occurred at IEM Katowice, one of the biggest tournaments in the yearly CS2 circuit.</p>



<p>What ended up being a terrible series for the player was highlighted by this one unimaginably poor play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-you-doing">‘WHAT ARE YOU DOING?’</h2>



<p>During a match between Team Liquid and The MongolZ, a poor decision from Liquid player Roland “ultimate” Tomkowiak drew the ire of former player and long-time CS2 caster Chad “SPUNJ” Burchill. While defending the B site of Mirage in the pistol round, ultimate waited too long to pull the trigger, allowing a teammate of his to die before he himself got taken out. Both SPUNJ and his casting partner Alex “Machine” Richardson were quite frustrated, but SPUNJ let the full anger out.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250203_AcceptableTriangularAirGuitarThisIsSparta-j-dfX8zpT8v4JKDA_source.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>What ultimate was trying to do was to stay hidden until multiple enemies passed him, so that he could take them all down in quick succession. However, he waited too long to act, and the first player he let by ended up killing his teammate. By the time ultimate lined up the second enemy, the first one noticed him and quickly dispatched him.</p>



<p>Ultimate’s performance in the map prior was clearly a factor in SPUNJ’s outburst, as the Polish player had a <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/matches/mapstatsid/191534/the-mongolz-vs-liquid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0.5 K/D</a> in the first map of the series. Following the mishap, SPUNJ remarked that the play was “inexcusable,” especially considering that Liquid had a man advantage. The CS2 caster chose to walk away from the desk and out of the casting room for the second round. Both SPUNJ and Machine got back on track by the end of the third round though.</p>



<p>To make matters worse for ultimate, Liquid lost despite winning map one, and he ended with one of his worst stat lines ever. On a positive note, ultimate played better the next day versus MOUZ, and Liquid is still alive in Katowice.</p>



<p>Was ultimate’s play warrant that big of a reaction from the caster? Let us know what you think down below or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Sonic 3 recently surpassed Detective Pikachu to become the second-highest-grossing video game movie ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://screenrant.com/sonic-3-second-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-box-office-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a>, a report by <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Sonic-the-Hedgehog-3-(2024)#tab=summary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Numbers</a> reveals that Sonic 3 earned $462.5 million globally, with domestic and international box office earnings almost at par. Sonic 3’s latest numbers beat Detective Pikachu’s $450 million, which held the title of second-highest-grossing video game movie of all time until today. However, Sonic 3 is miles away from The Super Mario Bros. Movie’s earnings, which managed to bring in $1.36 billion globally, retaining the title of the highest-earning video game movie ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sonic 3 sees Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails join forces to confront one of their most formidable opponents yet: Shadow. Shadow is a fan-favourite character from the video game series, and excitement for the movie skyrocketed when Keanu Reeves was announced to portray the enigmatic character. The enhanced visuals and Jim Carrey’s outstanding performance as Dr. Eggman have also contributed to the film’s success.</p>



<p>With Sonic 3 becoming the second-highest-grossing video game movie of all time, players will expect more movie adaptations to be released in the near future. Just recently, a popular video game got greenlit for a movie adaptation, and fans are waiting in anticipation for its arrival. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-movie-confirmed-story-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sleeping Dogs movie</a> is now confirmed to be in production, with Story Kitchen, Square Enix, and Simu Liu bringing it to life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 has been confirmed, with the movie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-confirmed-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poised to release in 2027.</a> Also, a post-credits scene may have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked the new characters</a> arriving for Sonic 4.

<p>EA has given players a small tease of what appears to be gameplay from the upcoming Battlefield 6 (name not confirmed). As part of their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Battlefield Labs</a>, EA released a short clip of gameplay from the popular shooter.</p>



<p>The gameplay comes from a Pre-Alpha version of the next game. You can check it out for yourself, courtesy of EA, below.</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BF6Screen.jpg" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BF6Gameplay.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>With Battlefield Labs, select players will be able to have a direct line of communication with developers as they build the next game in the Battlefield franchise. </p>



<p>“We’re going to test all the new features that we’re putting out, and we’re going to test hardware like weapons, vehicles, and gadgets,” Creative Director Thomas Andersson said. </p>



<p>“That feedback is crucial in helping us know what’s prioritized, what needs improvement, and what feels like a true Battlefield experience.”</p>



<p>The next Battlefield game is currently in development at what EA is calling “Battlefield Studios”. These studios are made up of four EA subsidiaries—DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect—working on different aspects of the new title. More information on the next game in the franchise will come later on. </p>

<p>As I watched the credits roll over an impeccable soundtrack, I found myself reflecting on my journey through Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. This beautiful, unforgettable game captured my full attention (no easy feat) for more than 70 hours, and I felt a strange concoction of emotions running through me.</p>



<p>It was a sense of relief at how the story had wrapped up, and a comedown from the adrenaline-fuelled high that accompanied the final sequences of this wonderful game. I revelled in victory and mourned those I’d lost along the way, and of course, I looked to whatever would come next, as for all the hours I’d invested, my path through KCD2 <strong>wasn’t yet finished</strong>.</p>



<p>This is everything I ever wanted in a sequel – and so much more. In this comprehensive Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, I hope you’ll come with me as I look back at one of the best games I’ve ever played.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pure-cinema">Pure Cinema</h2>



<p>From the very opening sequences of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, you’re made aware that Warhorse Studios wants to transcend delivering ‘a game’ and instead has chosen to offer players worldwide the ultimate cinematic experience. The soundtrack is bold and lifting, the visuals stunning, and the acting right off the bat is nothing short of sumptuous.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 doesn’t mess around with a light-hearted introduction. Within the first hour of the game, you’ve seen slaughter and decimation at the hands of bandits, you’ve been left for dead, and your situation is looking dire. It’s quite a callback to the first game, which was released in 2018 and opened much in the same way.</p>



<p>As the game unfolds, you’ll be treated to a twisting, winding story packed with choices and consequences, which is exactly what I was hoping for. The paths you pick will shape the world around you, and from the relationships you embrace to the decisions you make midway through a conversation, <strong>everything means something.</strong></p>



<p>This isn’t just a medieval RPG – it goes far beyond that.</p>



<p>In Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, you’ll be forced to meander through an intense story with intrepid abandon, ready and willing to change the course of history and the lives of those close to you. How you dress, fight, act, kill, and succeed (or <strong>fail</strong>) will mould your story and your version of Henry of Skalitz, the game’s bold protagonist.</p>



<h2 id="h-small-becomes-mighty">Small Becomes Mighty</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The pacing shifts in such a nice way between wanton violence and jubilant revelry</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s not just about the gorgeous landscapes, the towering castles, or the ambitious mission sequences in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. One of the things I love most about this game is the attention to even the smallest details. This is a world that lives and breathes around you, and at no point in my 70-hour campaign run did I feel as though I <strong>wasn’t </strong>immersed in something.</p>



<p>The best way I can explain this concept is to highlight how <strong>crime </strong>works in this Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review.</p>



<p>If you steal a set of keys from a character, you might return to their home later to find they’ve changed the locks. When you commit a crime against nobility, you’ll be more harshly pursued and punished than if you’d robbed a peasant. When you drop something on the floor, an NPC might steal it – but only if it suits their character or their desires.</p>



<p>On the topic of NPCs, the game’s ‘named characters’ aren’t just existing, they’re living their lives and working through a schedule. They might wake up in their designated home, go to work, revel in the tavern in the evening, and then head home for some food before going to sleep again.</p>



<p>In one sequence, I saw a gaggle of women huddled outside the local pub having a chat, and when it started to rain, they moved under a shelter to get out of the bad weather and continue their conversation. In another, I walked into a town covered in dirt and was berated by an innkeeper – until I washed in a nearby trough, prompting him to praise me for a job well done.</p>



<p>These interactions feel almost unscripted, and they’re more common than you’d think.</p>



<p><strong>Time </strong>also plays a detailed role in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. If you accept a side quest but take too long to do something, you might miss some kind of deadline and you’ll fail that task. People aren’t waiting on you forever – life doesn’t last that long in 15th-century Bohemia.</p>



<h2 id="h-and-scale-it-up">And Scale It Up</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll be mindblown by the scale of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</figcaption></figure>







<p>From the grandeur of the story and the depth of the smaller details to the scope and scale of the wider world.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-back-to-trosky-kcd2-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">split between two large maps</a> – Trosky and Kuttenberg. The first is more of a starter realm, while the second is a gargantuan, open-ended environment with more than a dozen towns and villages to explore. Both are rich, varied, and stunning, and you’ll never want for something to do while you’re out digging through the forests and fields.</p>



<p>As your story unravels, you’ll go from small-scale skirmishes to immensely brutal fortress sieges, such is the natural progression of the incredible story of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. It’s not done quickly, though – the events that lead from the opening hours to the grandest battles in the game are plentiful and relatively heavy.</p>



<p>The meat on the bone is, in a word, staggering. One of the things that kept slowing down my playthrough was the plethora of content up for grabs, the spontaneity of random events and side quests, and the ability to just <strong>look</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m being literal when I say that.</p>



<p>On more than one occasion, I found myself sitting down in a glade or the middle of a village somewhere, soaking up the sunlight and the atmosphere around me, listening to the wind in the trees and the birds tweeting above me. In the distance, a cart rolled by, prompting a guard dog to bark loudly, and down the road, I could see two farmers sharing a joke as they passed each other by.</p>



<p>The small details might be remarkable in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but it’s the enormity of the game and the consistency of the world-building and environment around you that blows your mind.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-honest-experience">The Honest Experience</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a cutthroat world out there, but he’ll find my chain hard to slash</figcaption></figure>







<p>For 70 hours, I played a pre-release version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but I’m pleased to report that I had no performance issues (on PC), nor did I have any game-breaking bugs. I experienced some minor issues with shaders, misbehaving AI, and some glitching ragdoll physics, but that was about it.</p>



<p>My biggest concerns were eliminated by the game’s day one patch, which I received ahead of launch.</p>



<p>As I explored the game to piece together my Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, I thought after a while that the title’s forced stealth sequences would ruin my impression of the game altogether. There are plenty of them and they’re a little cumbersome at times, but once you learn your routes and understand the core mechanics of how to be stealthy, they’re not <strong>terrible</strong>.</p>



<p>I’ll also stress quite openly that this game is <strong>challenging</strong>. The combat and some mechanics <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like lockpicking</a> are notorious, and since the first game, they’ve evolved but remain quite tough in general. Even at a higher level with a stack of advantageous perks and killer equipment, I found myself getting my head stoved in during the many fights you get involved in.</p>



<p>Practice makes perfect, and you can often run away to fight another day, of course.</p>



<p>Also, I’ll address the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-banned-saudi-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KCD2 controversies</a>‘ here. Before launch, it slipped out that Henry of Skalitz, the game’s protagonist, could engage in a homosexual sequence with another male character. That prompted people to launch into a tirade against the game, but I’m here to set the story straight.</p>



<p>It’s entirely <strong>optional</strong>, it’s the result of a few choices you’re <strong>offered</strong> throughout the game, and it’s beautifully portrayed by Warhorse Studios. It’s not graphic, and it’s not gratuitous – it <strong>makes sense</strong>, given the circumstances and story. In a similar vein, I was able to romance a female love interest and frequented the city baths for favours – so ignore the chatter of anyone deluded enough to judge without first experiencing what’s on offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-beautiful-palette">The Beautiful Palette</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How will you get out of this one?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect. It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection. It features my favourite trope, with all the game’s heroes (and villains) coming together for a grand, full-scale, spectacular battle at the end of the adventure.</p>



<p>It’s not a bridge too far to suggest that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 <strong>taught me </strong>something, too. From the codex packed full of historical information to the <strong>real people, places, and events</strong>, there’s a lot to break down from this title that’ll have you feeling like a genuine historian, rubbing shoulders with old kings, lords, and ladies.</p>



<p>I implore you to buy and finish Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 – the final cinematic cutscene made me yearn for this game to generate a sequel and perhaps a few spin-off television shows and movies. I can’t stress enough how much of a fantastic time I had playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and I am forever grateful to everyone at Warhorse, and to Tom McKay (Henry of Skalitz) and Luke Dale (Hans Capon) for their stellar work and performances.</p>



<p>This monumental medieval adventure will have you living a double life – but in this one, you’re a brave adventurer exploring the most faithful recreation of a real place I’ve ever seen. From ethereal sequences packed with tearjerker scenes to a phenomenal weather engine, and from genuinely interesting side activities to a neat little photo mode, I cannot find one major fault with this game.</p>



<p>It has been hard to find the words to accurately represent how phenomenal this game is. If I could sum up Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in just one, it would be this: <strong>masterpiece</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going back to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. I’ve got a lot left to do, and this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three expansions</a> are set to be released, which means I’ve got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many hours of gameplay</a> left to unpack.</p>
