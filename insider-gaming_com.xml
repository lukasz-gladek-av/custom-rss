<p>Pokemon Go developer Niantic has confirmed that Monopoly Go maker Scopely has acquired its games business for $3.5 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Confirming <span>last month’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-niantic-close-to-selling-games-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, Scopely has acquired Niant</span>ic’s game business, which includes titles like Pokemon GO, Pikmin Bloom and Monster Hunter Now. Their companion apps and services, including Niantic Campfire and Wayfarer, will also fall under Scopely’s umbrella after the $3.5 billion deal. Scopely has confirmed that “All Niantic game-making team members, along with tenured leaders Kei Kawai and Ed Wu”, will continue to develop and operate their beloved experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ed Wu, the Pokemon GO lead, has <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/moving-to-a-new-home-2025?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> the acquisition and believes it “will be a positive step” for the community and the game’s future. Ed Wu also assured players that the entire Pokemon GO team would stay together through this partnership, and with Scopely ’s “commitment, experience and resources,” they would make Pokemon GO the best it can be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scopely’s <a href="https://www.scopely.com/en/news/scopely-to-acquire-niantic-games-business-which-includes-pokemon-go-one-of-the-most-successful-mobile-games-of-all-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement post</a> also provides statistics about Niantic’s game business, including numbers for Pokemon GO, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now. Pokemon GO has over 20 million weekly active players and has been in the top 10 since its launch. Its trainers have explored more than 30 billion miles together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pikmin Bloom players completed 3.94 trillion steps in 2024 and hit its highest active player count last year. Monster Hunter Now launched with surpassed 15 million downloads in 7 months, and over 50% of the audience played the game every day of the week.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-repo-cost-is-it-free-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>You and a squad can channel your inner repo man in 2025’s hit horror spectacle. REPO encourages groups of players to form, forage, and flee, and if it’s free and costs nothing, it would be all the more sweet. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> started strongly, instantly gaining a few thousand players daily thanks to its advertised brand of silliness and scares. Within days, its community had exploded, achieving over a hundred thousand players and counting. You can’t help but laugh at REPO—before you inevitably shriek—and the addictive gameplay loop means replayability and longevity aren’t an issue.</p>



<p>More and more players are keen to get involved, and a low-cost entry point (potentially free) could be massive for its long-term success.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-repo-on-steam">How Much is REPO on Steam?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One more piece of loot. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>REPO costs $9.99 or £8.50 on Steam—the horror title isn’t free to play.</strong></p>



<p>Low-budget indie titles from growing studios are unlikely to make a project free-to-play. The company needs to make money, especially if it isn’t reliant on a microtransaction-driven economy. A $9.99 or £8.50 price tag is great value for what you get with REPO.</p>



<p>We’ve highlighted Steam as REPO is only available on PC for now. A future port can’t be ruled out, but there’s currently no talk of it coming to consoles. Never say never, and if it blows up enough, a future port can’t be ruled out.</p>



<p>There’s already a stellar amount of content in the game. What’s more is developer semiwork is blown away by the game’s success and is not content to sit around and leave players to grow tired of the existing features.</p>



<h2 id="h-future-repo-content-roadmap">Future REPO Content Roadmap</h2>



<p><strong>New enemies, levels, general content, and bug fixes are on the way in REPO.</strong></p>



<p>“Hey everyone, thank you so much for playing R.E.P.O. we are completely shocked and overjoyed with the response! Here’s a video with an update on what we are up to! We plan to release a video every week to make sure you guys are all up to date with our plans!” said the developer on a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3241660/view/515203741912138911?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">March 7 Steam post</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you have paid for REPO, or you’re planning on it, this is a great time to invest in the hit indie title.</p>



<hr>



<p>Many indie titles enjoy a hot start, and the hype and excitement dip. But Among Us shows that a squirrel finds a nut (or a gun) from time to time. It’ll be fascinating to see if REPO can stand the test of time in 2025—do you hope it can sustain its success?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-enhanced-worst-rated-steam-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-5-enhanced-is-now-the-worst-rated-grand-theft-auto-title-on-steam.1132005/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-enhanced-worst-rated-steam-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been a few days since Rockstar Games released GTA 5 Enhanced on PC, bringing a slew of changes and upgrades to the title and allowing players to migrate from the ‘standard’ version of Grand Theft Auto 5. However, things haven’t gone swimmingly, with the game’s overall review score on Steam bombing to an all-time low.</p>



<p>It’s now the worst-rated GTA title on the platform, with almost 10,000 reviews bearing a negative sentiment. It has garnered mixed feedback that’s <strong>mostly </strong>positive, but only just, with 53% of reviews saying something good about the release.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-what-we-wanted">Not What We Wanted</h2>



<p>The biggest gripe players have with GTA 5 Enhanced on Steam is that the account migration feature is hit and miss. Many have reported in their reviews that they’ve been unsuccessful in migrating their accounts, which some have poured thousands of hours (and dollars) into over the years.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240220/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Enhanced/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">One review in particular</a> shines at echoing this sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The GTA Online profile associated with this Rockstar Games account is not eligible for migration at this time.” If you think i’m throwing away nearly 700 hours of gameplay on one character so that you can make a few more bucks off me, then you can lick my anal orifice clean. – MrMorganfarts</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eloquently put.</p>



<p>Another user explained that Rockstar has removed online chat, which has made lobbies and missions feel <strong>dead</strong>, while many more have said that GTA 5 Enhanced should have been an update applied to the base game and not an entirely new version.</p>



<p>The positive reviews, which were still in the close majority at the time of writing, say nice things about the upgraded visuals, the quality-of-life improvements, and the reduction in stuttering and frame rate issues.</p>



<p>That hasn’t stopped GTA 5 from being the worst-rated Grand Theft Auto title on Steam, though. It’s not close, either – it’s leading in that position by a good 10%. </p>



<p>Have you ‘upgraded’ to GTA 5 Enhanced and experienced issues? Let me know what you’re struggling with in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A Popular Fortnite leaker has stated that the game could receive a new emote inspired by Kendrick Lamar’s song.</p>



<p>Fortnite leaker HYPEX’s new post on <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1899497216546410966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> talks about the upcoming Fortnite x Kendrick Lamar collaboration. The partnership will seemingly introduce a “Sit Down, Be Humble” bundle with an emote and song. The song will most likely be “Humble,” the Grammy-winning song by the American Rapper, which was released in 2017. The tweet also states that the “Emote might be from the girl in “Not Like Us. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players will be excited to see Kendrick Lamar-inspired emotes arriving in the game. Some have also started speculating that the hip-hop artist could be a part of the next Fortnite Festival season. Others also wonder why Fortnite is going with a 2017 song when Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Not Like Us’ blew out of the stratosphere after his Super Bowl performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, previous leaks have already provided an idea about who Fortnite Festival’s next headliner will be, and it doesn’t seem like it is Kendrick Lamar. According to the leaks that arrived in January this year, the next artist could be none other than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-sabrina-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a>. The ‘Espresso’ singer is speculated to be the next Fortnite Festival Icon, which will bring new cosmetics and jam tracks inspired by the American artist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is expected to introduce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-a-new-lara-croft-skin-this-update-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Lara Croft skin</a> in this update. Also, cheaters with lifetime bans will receive a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cheaters-with-lifetime-bans-will-receive-a-second-chance-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second chance</a>’ soon. What are your thoughts on Fortnite getting a Kendrick Lamar emote?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Take-Two, the parent company behind Rockstar Games, has sued PlayerAuctions, a side that allegedly facilitates the sale of hacked and boosted GTA Online accounts and illegitimate in-game currency. The recent lawsuit was filed in California, with Take-Two claiming that the Chinese-owned PlayerAuctions platform was ‘reaping millions in revenue’ based on these sales.</p>



<p>The filing from the U.S. Central District Court of California insists that PlayerAuctions is being run with the ‘full knowledge that its sellers are engaged in rampant infringement and other unauthorised conduct.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-first">Not The First</h2>



<p>It was revealed in February 2025 that the Roblox Corporation was also suing PlayerAuctions for a similar streak of allegations. As these cases ramp up, more developers and publishers may enter the fight, as PlayerAuctions supports the sale of digital goods and services from a staggering assortment of titles.</p>



<p>Everything from RuneScape and Fortnite to World of Warcraft and Call of Duty is featured on PlayerAuctions.</p>



<p>The Take-Two case, which was originally spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/536315/take-two-gta-5-online-black-market-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, offers an in-depth perspective on how PlayerAuctions operates and how it’s walking a fine legal line when it comes to digital goods in GTA Online.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836607989/Take-Two-PlayerAuctions-lawsuit-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">California court filing</a> reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>PlayerAuctions goes to great lengths to lull its users into buying illegitimate GTA V content from its sellers, including by offering ‘after-sale protection’ – i.e. refunds – if the hacked accounts they purchase are detected and banned by Take-Two’s anti-cheat systems.</p>



<p>PlayerAuctions offers this ‘protection’ because it knows the hacked player account listings on its marketplace are infringing and unauthorised under Take-Two’s terms of service.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed in the filing that Take-Two has sent several notices to PlayerAuctions along with evidence of these claims, but the platform’s operators have refused to relent. Per the statutory claims of the case, Take-Two would be entitled to $150,000 for each copyright infringed, but PlayerAuctions’ sales figures haven’t yet been made public.</p>



<p>It could be a monster case in terms of damages if Take-Two is successful.</p>
