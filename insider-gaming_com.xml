<p>Marvel Rivals is the definition of great power coming with great responsibility: It is a blockbuster shooter with a lot of star power but also requires enough firepower to sustain itself. This is where the Marvel Rivals System Requirements need to rise to the occasion, so let’s see if you meet the criteria.</p>



<p>Throughout the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> alpha and beta tests, it became apparent the hero shooter is a good-looking game. Its cel-shaded visuals pop and every attack pulsates with a rich palette of colors and effects. Marvel Rivals is easy on the eyes, but players wonder if it’s as forgiving on hardware.</p>



<p>NetEase Games wants as many people playing Marvel Rivals as possible, and having higher system requirements can be costly.</p>

<p>The minimum requirements for Marvel Rivals are designed to be as inclusive as possible. While a low-end rig is probably not going to cut it, I’ve definitely seen worse figures where minimum requirements are concerned. I experienced some issues during the alpha test with a good system, but this is probably a thing of the past now.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals should play just fine if you have decent RAM and a solid processor. It’s also recommended you install the game on an SSD drive for an improved experience.</p>



<p>Check out the full minimum specifications for PC below.</p>

<p>If you want your gameplay to look heroic and ripped straight from an MCU scene, the best Marvel Rivals graphical settings go a long way to accomplishing this. The recommended PC specs satisfy the higher-end requirements, and make the shooter look its best.</p>



<p>Your setup needs to have a better CPU and graphics card, this goes without saying. A lot of the settings are the same though, as is the advice to install Rivals on an SSD drive.</p>



<p>Here are the recommended Marvel Rivals PC specs to maximize the title’s content.</p>

<p><strong>The full swords dimensions are:</strong></p>



<p>Full Length: 990mm<br>Blade Length: 800mm<br>Grip Length: 120mm<br>Guard Width: 230mm<br>Blade Width: 42mm<br>Blade Thickness: 4mm<br>Weight: 1.1KG<br>Materials: Stainless steel, steel alloy fittings<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p>



<p>You can read the official press release below:</p>



<div><p>Skipton, WY, UK – 29/11/2024 – Assassin’s Creed has had some truly unique Swords over the years, but arguably the most iconic is the Sword of Altaïr from the original Assassin’s Creed. Now you can own this truly legendary piece of gaming history for yourself, with the official release coming today, Black Friday!</p><p>This beautifully sculpted sword was meticulously crafted using over 200 references and hundreds of hours of gameplay from the original Assassin’s Creed released in 2007. Having to reverse-engineer this sword from nothing but low-res polygons and pixels to create this stunning 1:1 scale replica, Raven Forge also drew heavily on their own sword fighting background to not only know how this sword should look, but also the size and more importantly, how it should feel.</p><p>This is an arming sword, a knightly sword, the sword that is drawn in emergencies when subtlety has failed and armed combat is the only option. Heavy enough to parry a guard’s blade, light enough to be moved with ease. The swooping eagle quillons or cross guards have been made aggressive and angular, simulating a hunting bird of prey. The signature reversed “V” on the blade below the triple fullers is meticulously hand-ground on each sword that passes through our doors. When you hold this sword, you’ll know you’re holding the legendary sword of Altaïr.</p><p>With a beautiful wall plaque in the shape of the Assassin’s Creed logo and painted in the colours of the brotherhood accompanying the polished stainless steel and spiral black leather of the replica sword, and a stunning double-sided certificate of authenticity, as well as a hidden easter egg for the true fans, this is the ultimate addition to any Assassin’s Creed, prop replica weapon, or indeed any pop culture collection anywhere.</p><p>With the partnership between Ubisoft and Raven Forge now well established, we can expect to see some more highly collectable legendary weapons and products coming out soon that will excite the Assassin’s Creed fanbase as much as the Sword of Altaïr has!</p><p>With this being the first of a highly anticipated collection of legendary items from iconic games, TV and Films, Raven Forge continues to push forward into the world of high-end collectables, with more very close on the horizon.</p><p>Raven Forge is a small company from the UK, based in rainy Skipton in the Yorkshire Dales, that was founded and is run by two brothers, Sam and Tom Ive. Sam and Tom grew up on fantasy, sci-fi, and computer games, with a deep love of everything from Star Trek to Lord of the Rings, Terry Pratchett, Final Fantasy, Dungeons and Dragons, and everything in between. Now, they run one of the largest stockists of fantasy and historical memorabilia and collectibles in the UK.</p></div>

<p>The NFL is heading to the virtual gridiron in a new special broadcast in December. NBC Sports, EA, and the NFL have announced the first-ever “Madden Cast” broadcast for the Saturday, December 21st matchup between the Houston Texans and Kansas City Chiefs.</p>



<p>This new broadcast type will air exclusively on the Peacock streaming platform. It will feature it’s own broadcast team, feature Madden NFL 25 graphics, route trees similar to what’s in the game, play selection cards, player rating showcases, and more.</p>



<p>Calling the game will be Paul Burmeister on play-by-play with former NFL quarterback Kurt Benkhart and legendary Cincinnati Bengals receiver Chad Ochocinco providing commentary.</p>







<p>“The&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL Cast</em>&nbsp;will transform football strategy, information and IQ for viewers, enabled by the NFL’s Next Gen Stats and&nbsp;GeniusIQ<em>,&nbsp;</em>Genius Sports’&nbsp;next generation data and AI platform,” an announcement on the broadcast read.&nbsp;“GeniusIQ&nbsp;combines real-time data insights with fully branded animations, delivering an immersive viewing experience.”</p>



<p>“By merging the excitement of live NFL action with the immersive possibilities of augmented reality, we’re redefining how fans experience football,” GM and SVP of Publishing at EA Sports Andrea Hopelain said.</p>



<p>It’s not the first special broadcast for the NFL as they’ve done crossovers with Toy Story and, coming December 9, The Simpsons. Still, it’s the first one to truly crossover into video games.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that the broadcast will be weather dependent as the game is in Kansas City, Missouri. </p>
