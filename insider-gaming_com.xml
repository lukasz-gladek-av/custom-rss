<p>Lenovo has announced the Lenovo Legion Go S, the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-steamos-is-available-for-third-party-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party handheld</a> gaming PC to come with SteamOS installed instead of Windows. The announcement was made on Tuesday at CES 2025.</p>



<p>Launching in May, Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS will cost $499. The <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">handheld features</a> an eight-inch 16:10 touch display at 120Hz. Internal specs include a Lenovo-exclusive AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor,16GB of memory, 512GB of storage, and a 55.5Whr battery. </p>



<p>Other features include Wi-Fi 6e support, two USB 4 ports, and a MicroSD slot for expanded storage. Regarding battery life, Lenovo says that the Legion Go S should have 2.5-3 hours on a full charge, depending on the gaming being done.</p>

<p>As far as what’s gone from the original Legion Go, the new device no longer features a kickstand or detachable controllers akin to the Nintendo Switch. By removing these features and making the device slightly smaller, it brings the weight of the Legion Go S down to 1.61lbs.</p>



<p>The Lenovo Legion Go S will also launch with a version that comes with Windows preinstalled for those that prefer Microsoft’s operating system. The Windows version of the device will release this month for $729.99 and include 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. As with all Windows devices, Steam can be installed as a standalone application.</p>



<p>The Windows version comes in white while the SteamOS version comes in black.</p>
