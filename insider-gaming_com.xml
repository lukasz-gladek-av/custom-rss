<p>Masters of Albion, the new game from long-time developer Peter Molyneux has a release date. On Monday, developer 22cans announced that the game is set to launch on April 22.</p>



<p>The game will be available exclusively on PC via Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-masters-of-albion-is-a-reimagining">Masters of Albion Is A “Reimagining”</h2>



<p>First revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peter-molyneux-masters-of-albion-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a>, Masters of Albion is a <strong>“bold reimagining of the God Game genre.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Mixing strategy with simulation, town management and tower defence, the game takes you into the rich narrative world of Albion,</strong>” the game’s description says. <strong>“Starting in the undeveloped village of Oakridge, players will step into the body of a god, controlling the town and its citizens, building a small business and completing orders for various customers.”</strong></p>







<p>As mentioned, the game comes from Peter Molyneaux, the man credited with creating the Fable franchise, The Movies, Populous, and many more. Back when it was announced, the 66-year-old Molyneux mentioned that Masters of Albion was likely to be his last game because of his age.</p>



<p>In a release announcing the release date, Molyneux said that the new game owes a lot to his prior titles.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>“Masters of Albion is the culmination of my life’s work, a game that owes so much to titles like Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and Fable,”</strong> he said. <strong>“It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map.”</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Paramount Sues Warner Bros. Over Netflix Deal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-sues-warner-bros-over-netflix-deal/</link>
            <guid>1403743</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Paramount continues to put up a fight over the pending sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix. On Wednesday, the company announced it was suing Warner Bros. in a continuation of its attempt at a hostile takeover of the company.</p>



<p>The lawsuit comes just days after Paramount’s latest bid was rejected, again, by Warner Bros. Discover.</p>







<p>According to the lawsuit, Paramount claims that the Warner Bros. Discovery board misled shareholders and concealed financial analysis. In a <a href="https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-provides-update-warner-bros-discovery-shareholders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">letter to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders</a> announcing the suit, Paramount CEO David Ellison said that the company has <strong>“failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its “risk adjustment” of our&nbsp;$30 per share all-cash offer.”</strong></p>



<p>He continued, saying that shareholders need that information to <strong>“make an informed investment decision on our offer.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-why-paramount-is-fighting-for-warner-bros">Why Paramount Is Fighting For Warner Bros?</h2>



<p>On December 5, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was announced that Netflix and Warner Bros. Discover</a> were in an agreement to sell the Warner Bros. side of the company to the streaming giant as part of an $82.7 billion deal. The sale would include only the company’s streaming and studios assets, including all of Warner Bros. Games. </p>



<p>Netflix’s offer of $27.75 per share doesn’t include the cable channels. Paramount’s offer of $30 would be for ethe entirety of the company. That would put the value of the cable networks at just $2.25 per share if the value of the streaming and studio assets remained the same as the Netflix deal. </p>



<p>Since the agreement was announced, Paramount has continued to try and force a sale to them. Leading up to and after the announcement of the Netflix deal, Warner Bros. Discovery has rejected at least eight Paramount offers. </p>







<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery board has said that Paramount would need to offer more cash and less debt for it to be reconsidered.</p>



<p>As far as why Paramount would want Warner Bros., it’s a pretty obvious. Video Games aside, which even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-downplays-value-wb-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix called “minor”</a> in terms of the deal, includes rights to a number of brands and IPs such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“Our objective from the moment we approached WBD was for a collaborative negotiation and a successful transaction that would be a win for both companies, both shareholder groups and all stakeholders,”</strong> Ellison wrote. <strong>“We remain perplexed that WBD never responded to our&nbsp;December 4th&nbsp;offer, never attempted to clarify or negotiate any of the terms in that proposal, nor traded markups of contracts with us.&nbsp; </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Even as we read WBD’s own narrative of its process, we are struck that there were few actual board meetings in the period leading up to the decision to accept an inferior transaction with Netflix. And we are surprised by the lack of transparency on WBD’s part regarding basic financial matters. It just doesn’t add up – much like the math on how WBD continues to favor taking less than our&nbsp;$30 per share all-cash offer for its shareholders.”</strong></p>



<p>Both Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery have declined to comment on the lawsuit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re a fan of first-person shooters and FPS games in general, you’re in for a treat in 2026. From epic multiplayer games to core single-player campaigns, there’s something for everyone.</p>



<p>Some genres and trends have come and gone over the years. First-person shooters will be here until the end of time, thanks to the fine, fun foundations laid down by the likes of Wolfenstein, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-bethesda-must-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-after-doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a>, Call of Duty, Duke Nukem, Battlefield, and many other Hall of Fame-worthy franchises.</p>



<p>2026 already looks like a rootin’, tootin’, shootin’ good time.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-first-person-shooters-launching-in-2026">Biggest First-Person Shooters Launching In 2026</h2>



<p>One important thing to note about this list of big-time shooters coming in 2206 is that <strong>everything is subject to change</strong>. The video game industry can be great at times, but delays and unexpected events can alter plans in a heartbeat. Some games are one GTA 6 delay or date change away from a drastic U-turn. So bear this in mind with the attached release dates.</p>



<h3 id="h-highguard">Highguard</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Everyone needs to be on guard for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a>. It quickly became one of gaming’s biggest enigmas after its The Game Awards 2025 reveal. The game effectively closed the show, and the reception wasn’t good. Official Highguard social media pages also weren’t active in the weeks following. There’s still a feeling that it could do <em>something</em>. </p>



<p>It’s made by former Respawn Entertainment devs, which means it should be as mechanically efficient and effervescent as it can be. Whether the interest in another free-to-play shooter is there remains to be seen, but it might have been written off prematurely.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: January 26</strong></p>







<h3 id="h-high-on-life-2">High On Life 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>It turns out critics weren’t as high on High On Life as Squanch Games may have expected. However, this didn’t stop everyone from gulping down a helping of Fleeb juice, throwing back some Schleems, and seeing what the Rick and Morty-inspired shooter on Xbox Game Pass. The interest was there, and it was enough to push through a sequel. If you enjoyed the first game, High On Life 2 should be worth checking out, and if you decided to give the first game a pass, you should maybe consider shouting “Show me what you got” at the follow-up.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 13</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-toxic-commando">Toxic Commando</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Saber Interactive is on a bit of a heater at the moment. Not content with the nightmare-inducing Hellraiser debut or the studio’s brilliant work on Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 (and the upcoming sequel), the team has concocted Toxic Commando. It can be enjoyed in either single-player or multiplayer, but there’s a real emphasis on fun and freakish terror when played with more people. You need to battle through eight missions of hideous creatures with your backbreaking arsenal of weapons and implements, and it looks like an old-school FPS delight!</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 12</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-mouse-p-i-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. For Hire</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Fumi Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Insider Gaming team is very excited about Mouse: P.I. For Hire. The rubberhose animation immediately makes it an endearing and unique-looking game, bringing back fond (and frustrating) memories of StudioMDHR’s Cuphead. Instead of cutesy-looking bosses, Mouse: P.I For Hire is a clever FPS making excellent use of its theme and style. It’s an FPS game at its cartoonish core, but you only have to watch a trailer to realise there’s an unmistakable air of bold brutality about it. Mouse: P.I. For Hire could be one of 2026’s sleeper hits.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 19</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-marathon">Marathon</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Bungie</figcaption></figure>



<p>After months of testing and trying to work out the kinks to ensure Marathon is not DOA on release, like many are already condemning the extraction shooter to, Bungie is gearing up for the game’s March 2026 release. The game has literally been on a marathon in the last 12 months: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/artist-accuses-bungie-of-plagiarizing-work-for-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plagiarism</a> claims, low internal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/morale-at-bungie-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-over-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">morale</a>, and the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Art Director leaving Bungie prior to the game’s release</a>. The shooter has endured it all, and even now, the game’s future feels like it could go either way. It could still end up as one of 2026’s biggest shooters, and try not to become another Concord.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Halo Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to see Halo: Campaign Evolved being anything but a win. There’s a quiet acceptance that its PS5 release signals the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-2025-is-the-year-the-console-wars-ended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end of the console wars</a> and is the beginning of the series’ PlayStation arc. Still, the OG Halo campaign stands head and shoulders above most contemporaries and modern-day shooters that can only offer pale imitations of a legendary story. No multiplayer is a disappointment, but if you want to experience some of the purest and smoothest shooting mechanics in any video game ever, Halo: Campaign Evolved has the goods.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-hell-let-loose-vietnam">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Expression Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Vietnam conflict is still remembered as one of the most brutal wars, one that lasted for two decades. Hell Let Loose is the pinnacle of realism in military shooters, and the new Vietnam setting is a purist’s paradise for those wanting to indulge in a dark period of human history. Insider Gaming experienced a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, with Tom Henderson saying: “Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.”</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-2026-modern-warfare-4">Call of Duty 2026 (Modern Warfare 4)</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty will always happen, and whatever does happen with each release, <em>another </em>one will be waiting just around the corner. It’s the best-selling FPS franchise by all metrics (including Guinness World Records), and Black Ops 7 will be consigned to history come the end of 2026. Why? It will be time for Call of Duty 2026—rumored to be Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-campaign-reportedly-set-in-north-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly set in North &amp; South Korea</a>, and a BIG effort and push will be needed after the coldly-received Black Ops 7. Even if there’s not, everyone will still buy it anyway.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: Late 2026 (Oct/Nov)</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Back in December, Micron announced that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/micron-shutting-down-its-consumer-crucial-ram-and-ssd-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down its consumer memory</a> and storage brand Crucial. At the time, the company said it was due to the “AI-driven growth” within the industry. Now, just over a month later, Micron is addressing the decision to shutter the budget-friendly brand in favor of powering data centers and large AI companies.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WCCFTech</a>, Micron’s VP of Marketing, Mobile, and Client Business Unit, Christopher Moore, was asked about the decision and the consumer backlash that followed. </p>







<p>Moore says that the “perception may not be exactly correct” from his point of view. The perception being that the company turned its back on consumers to favor large companies and the continued expansion of data centers. He says that the decisions being made are done to “help consumers around the world.”</p>



<h2 id="h-micron-is-still-involved-in-the-consumer-market">Micron Is Still Involved In The Consumer Market</h2>



<p><strong>“So, I would never want to tell someone what to think or that they’re wrong, but our viewpoint is that we are trying to help consumers around the world,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re just doing it through different channels. We still have a very sizable business in the client and mobile markets. We are also, of course, servicing our data center customers.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“And what’s going on right now is that the TAM and data center is growing just absolutely tremendously. And we want to make sure that, as a company, we help fulfill that TAM as well.”</strong></p>







<p>Moore said that it’s still suppling LPDDR5 to companies like ASUS and Dell, which he uses to defend is point on helping consumers. He said that the company is <strong>“in contact with every single PC brand out there to supply memory modules”</strong> and holds a <strong>“large portion of the consumer supply chain through the OEM model.”</strong></p>



<p>That said, Micron <strong>“cannot ignore the demand coming from AI right now.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding the continued shortage of memory and storage, Moore believes that things might not get better until 2028. At least, on Micron’s side. They are working on building new facilities, including a new facility in Idaho scheduled to open in mid-2027 as well as facility in New York. But, Moore says that everything won’t be up and running until 2028.</p>



<p>In the meantime, consumers might have to stick with their older machines a while longer as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices continue to soar</a> throughout the market. </p>
