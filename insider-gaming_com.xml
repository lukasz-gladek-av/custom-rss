<p>Atlanta FaZe just pulled off a remarkable reverse sweep at the Call of Duty League Major in Madrid. After a fairly dominant opener that saw LAT blitz FaZe, Atlanta switched things up during the mid-series Control and never slowed down. It boiled down to a round eleven showdown during map five that was quickly mopped up by FaZe.</p>



<p>The LA Thieves will now fall into the final fixture of the elimination bracket, going head-to-head (again) with the Miami Heretics. Earlier in the tournament, the LA Thieves booted Miami into the lower bracket after a 3-0 sweep.</p>



<p>Talking on stage after the match, Drazah had some choice words for the LA Thieves.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rivalry-renewed">Rivalry Renewed</h2>



<p>The LA Thieves and Atlanta FaZe represent two of the biggest dogs in the CDL fight. They’re fronted by some of the sharpest talent in the Call of Duty League, and they have the most valuable rosters to boot.</p>



<p>This face-off series was never going to go any other way than to the wire – which is exactly what happened. With it coming down to single-digit kill counts, Atlanta FaZe prevailed, earning the first ticket to the grand final series of the Madrid Major.</p>



<p>On stage in the post-match interview, Drazah fired shots at LA Thieves:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m feeling great – those guys are <strong>frauds</strong>. It’s Sunday, we’re on LAN, reverse-sweep, this shit is easy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the last few weeks, the LA Thieves roster has been wrestling with the title of ‘Super Team’, which was branded upon the squad when it was assembled last year. For many, LAT hasn’t yet lived up to those lofty expectations, which is a sticking point for sure.</p>



<p>LA Thieves will now contend with the Miami Heretics for the sole remaining spot in the grand final. There’s a $150,000 prize awaiting the winner of Major I – who will secure it? Find out in just a couple of hours.</p>

<p>DICE and EA have announced that the first details on the next Battlefield’s community test program will be revealed tomorrow.</p>



<p>The announcement was posted on the official X (formerly Twitter) account, where it was said, “Tune in tomorrow at 5PM CET / 8AM PDT for more on the upcoming <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/Battlefield?src=hashtag_click">#Battlefield</a> community testing program.”</p>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-playtests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported that Battlefield playtests</a> were once again ramping up to test the multiplayer and Battle Royale experiences of the game. </p>



<p>While details on what will be announced tomorrow are incredibly slim, several sources have suggested that we’ll get our first look at pre-alpha gameplay of the game (abliet, only a few seconds).</p>



<p>Insider Gaming also understands that playtests for the next Battlefield title have been a weekly occurrence for months, with DICE and the other Battlefield studios relentlessly gaining player feedback; something they didn’t do for Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>From small feedback sessions to large-scale player tests, Battlefield is now taking the much-needed “player first” approach to ensure that the next Battlefield game is a success, with the teams leaning from its mistakes of the series’ past couple of installments. </p>

<p>Recently, Simu Liu took to social media to suggest he was working on a live-action representation of Sleeping Dogs, the 2012 open-world game. When Sleeping Dogs was released over a decade ago, it was to critical acclaim, boasting an intense story, masterful combat mechanics, and a star-studded cast. For the longest time, fans of the one-and-done game have been holding out hope for a sequel, but it has never surfaced.</p>



<p>Now, we have confirmation that the Sleeping Dogs movie <strong>is in production</strong>. It’s being pieced together by Story Kitchen, in collaboration with Square Enix, and Simu Liu, of MCU fame, is poised to star as the game’s protagonist, Wei Shen.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-took-you-long-enough">It Took You Long Enough</h2>



<p>Sleeping Dogs was one heck of a game when it was released in 2012. This gritty, crime-fuelled title put players in control of Wei Shen, an undercover police officer infiltrating the seedy, gang-driven underbelly of Hong Kong. It was seen as a solid GTA competitor, even if it was ultimately overshadowed by the release of Grand Theft Auto 5 just a year later.</p>



<p>Following a string of successful expansions, Sleeping Dogs was effectively laid to rest, and any hope of a sequel was extinguished as the years wore on. For almost a decade, fans have been toying with rumours and suggestions of a Sleeping Dogs movie surfacing, and <strong>now</strong>, we can say for certain that it is happening.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sleeping-dogs-movie-is-in-development-and-were-hearing-shang-chi-star-simu-liu-is-set-to-play-wei-shen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by IGN</a>, it was revealed that Story Kitchen (Sonic the Hedgehog, Tomb Raider, Streets of Rage) is collaborating with Square Enix to produce a Sleeping Dogs movie. The production is set to star Simu Liu as the lead character, Wei Shen. That revelation hasn’t been met with much jubilation from fans worldwide, though.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-adaptation-and-sequel-mentioned-by-simu-liu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simu Liu mentioned</a> a ‘sequel game’ for Sleeping Dogs. In 2013, a proposed follow-up game was cancelled, with the original title’s developer going bust a couple of years later.</p>



<p>Do you plan on checking out the Sleeping Dogs movie when it’s released, or is Simu Liu’s involvement presenting an issue for you? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Atlanta FaZe just secured a 3 – 0 victory over Toronto Ultra to push one step forward at the CDL Madrid Major. The massive victory forced Ultra into the elimination bracket to square off against the Royal Ravens – their last chance at staying in the running.</p>



<p>Following the sweep of a match, I sat down with Atlanta FaZe’s Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris and McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel to talk about their nine-game win streak, playing more aggressively this season, and how they bounced back from a rough start.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-was-underperforming">‘I Was Underperforming’</h2>



<p>Atlanta FaZe didn’t have the cleanest start to the 2025 CDL season. The squad suffered a 0 – 3 loss in a qualifying stage for the first time since May 2023. That decisive defeat was handed down by the Carolina Royal Ravens, a team that has been on fire so far in 2025.</p>



<p>From there, FaZe lost three matches back-to-back-to-back before taking a break and turning things around. Presently, the team is on a near-historic nine-match win streak, almost refusing to drop a map in any series.</p>



<p>I caught up with Cellium and aBeZy to chat about the change-up:</p>



<p><em><strong>Cellium: </strong>For me personally, I was underperforming really badly. There were a lot of internal team talks about how we play the game and how we think about everything, and I think it definitely helped us improve over the break. Everyone is on the same page now and we trust each other.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>aBeZy: </strong>We had a team talk after the break, leading after the Falcons match that we won. We put everything on the table and after that, we’ve just been firing on all cylinders. Like he said, we just trust each other in every situation that we’re in and we’re just frying.</em></p>



<p>The talk turned to a recent comment made by Drazah, who wasn’t present for the chat. He’d previously said that ATL would take on ‘anyone, anytime’, suggesting the strategy had now turned to aggression. I asked aBeZy and Cellium if that was the case:</p>



<p><em><strong>aBeZy: </strong>Yeah, 100%. I don’t think it matters who we play. I feel like if we’re playing at our best, I feel like no one can beat us.</em></p>



<p>Cellium mirrored that sentiment, echoing with the claim: <em>‘I just think we’re the best team right now, by a mile.’</em></p>



<p>For the third time in two days, I asked the Call of Duty League pros what they thought about the crowds supporting the tournament here in Madrid. Thus far, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/">OpTic Texas</a> and LA Thieves have agreed that the EU crowds are on another level compared to NA, and that was supported by the Atlanta FaZe guys:</p>



<p><em><strong>aBeZy</strong>: I think EU crowds are insane … Even this crowd is <strong>crazy</strong>.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Cellium: </strong>Both times I’ve went to Europe so far, it has been amazing. I would use the EU crowd is insane.</em></p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe now pushes into the winner’s final against the LA Thieves, which is set to take place tomorrow evening. The loser of that match will be pushed down into the elimination bracket for a final chance to go forward, and they’ll be taking on either Toronto, Carolina, Miami, or Minnesota.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/interview-lat-scrap-and-ghosty-on-being-the-cdl%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98godlike%E2%80%99-super-team.1097907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The LA Thieves just destroyed the Miami Heretics on (sort of) home turf, pushing them down into the elimination bracket following a complete sweep. The 3 – 0 scoreline was probably easy enough to predict, but it came a little closer than some would have expected, with the Heretics putting up a considerable fight.</p>



<p>In the aftermath of the win, which pushed LA Thieves further towards the grand final, I caught up with Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe and Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst to learn how they were handling the expectations of being the CDL’s ‘Super Team’ this season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shouldering-it">Shouldering It</h2>



<p>For the opener, I asked Scrap and Ghosty whether they felt extra pressure trying to live up to these lofty expectations and whether they believed they <strong>had</strong>. In the run-up to the CDL kicking off, the LA Thieves’ squad was billed as being a Super Team, with Nadeshot making it very public (even if in jest) just how much securing the talented roster had cost the organisation.</p>



<p>Here’s what they had to say:</p>



<p><em><strong>Ghosty: </strong>I feel like there’s always a sense of pressure as a competitor to be the best version you can be. There’s definitely more external pressure from other teams, fans, whatever – but it still doesn’t amount to the personal pressure you put on yourself as a competitor.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Scrap: </strong>For myself, from how much shit I talk, there’s just pressure from the whole community on me, no matter what team I play for. People can call us a Super Team, yeah, I’ll call myself a Super Team because <strong>my team is godlike</strong>. You know, we have pressure on us, but we go into every match taking no-one lightly.</em></p>



<p>Following that, Scrap walked me through his growth in the CDL since entering the League as a rookie during the MWII season. He was painted as (and loved being) the villain, going on a notorious arc that set his profile ablaze.</p>



<p><em><strong>Scrap: </strong>I don’t think I’ll ever change. Honestly, I’m just being myself up on that stage, to be honest. If it comes out, it comes out. I feel like over the past couple of years in the League I’ve grown into more of a leadership role of a sort, not like the kid that just flies around. Now that I’m on a younger team that has a lot of young players and I’m just trying to work as best around them.</em></p>



<p>Like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/">OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy</a>, the pair agreed that the crowd in Madrid is one of the most energetic they’ve ever seen, and they are ‘down for some more’ EU tournaments.</p>
