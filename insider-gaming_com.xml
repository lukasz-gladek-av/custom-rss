<p>Marvel Rivals competitive players have been embracing the triple-strategist meta, but the devs are not letting it dominate the higher ranks thanks to some upcoming nerfs. The new <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1891880359345950886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes</a>, which will go in effect at the start of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cancels-mid-season-rank-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 second half</a>, shouldn’t kill the triple-strategist meta, but will make it less “oppressive.”</p>



<h2 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger-loki-other-strategists-to-receive-ultimate-nerfs">Cloak &amp; Dagger, Loki, Other Strategists to Receive Ultimate Nerfs</h2>



<p>The triple-strategist meta has become very popular in competitive Marvel Rivals play. With three characters providing healing and support, vanguards (tanks) can absorb far more damage, making it hard to slow down attacking teams during convoy games. However, the devs have noted concerns that characters like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki can charge their ultimate abilities really quickly. Because of this, teams running triple-initiator always seem to have an ultimate ready to counter one from an opposing duelist or vanguard.</p>



<p>In the Season 1 mid-season update, the energy costs for “frequent ultimates” like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki’s will be increased. Certain ultimates will also receive targeted nerfs, and the devs have explicitly stated that Cloak &amp; Dagger will be one of the recipients. Further more, some vanguards and duelists such as Venom and Magik will also get a lower energy cost to their ultimates, allowing them to be used more frequently.</p>



<p>These changes will go hand-in-hand with some more announced hero balance changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced survivability of Doctor Strange and Magneto</li>



<li>Buffs to movement-based vanguards (likely Captain America and Venom)</li>



<li>Nerfs to Storm and Moon Knight (reducing buffs from start of Season 1)</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>The game’s lead combat designer said the goal is not to get rid of playstyles like the triple-strategist meta, but only to encourage other playstyles and provide an appropriate amount of counterplay opportunities. These changes will officially go into effect when the second half of Season 1 begins on February 21.</p>

<p>When Shuhei Yoshida stepped down as president of SIE Worldwide Studios to lead indie games in 2019, it wasn’t something he outright chose to do. In fact, Yoshida only had two options: go lead a the new initiative with indies or leave PlayStation altogether.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Yoshida said that despite only having the one option, it was something he was still excited to do.</p>



<p>“Moving from first-party to indies? Well, I had no choice,” Yoshida said. “When Jim [Ryan] asked me to do the indie job, the choice was to do that or leave the company. </p>



<p>“But I felt very strongly about the state of PlayStation and indies. I really wanted to do this. I believed I could do something unique for that purpose.”</p>



<p>Yoshida said that moving from first-party games  to indies was a bigger challenge for him than ultimately leaving the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year after 31 years</a>. He said that he feels lucky that the indie community felt like he could help their growth on PlayStation.</p>



<p>“I became an adviser for some of these companies,” he said. “I’m continuing to work with some of the indie publishers and developers I respect. The transition out of Sony to becoming an independent adviser is less of a change than moving out of first-party.”</p>



<p>Following up on that statement, Yoshida said that will continue to work with indies despite no longer being with PlayStation. He says that he loves working with younger, talented developers who “come up with amazing games every year.”</p>



<p>“Every year when you come to one of these events, a couple of the nominees for game of the year are indies,” he said. “They’re bringing something exciting to the industry. It’s a lot of fun. That’s my dream job, to be able to help them.”</p>



<p>What do you think of Yoshida saying he either took the indie leadership position or left PlayStation in 2019?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/devonta-smith-from-winning-the-super-bowl-to-facing-warzone-cheating-claims.1112319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/devonta-smith-cheating-claims-warzone-super-bowl/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On February 9, DeVonta Smith won the Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles in front of 127 million viewers. One week later, the superstar wide receiver was staring down accusations that labelled him a malicious cheater in Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>While streaming Warzone in the last few days, Smith came under fire from a slew of allegations across social media, being lambasted by folks hellbent on branding the athlete a lousy cheater. In clips that surfaced online, some suspicious sequences unravelled, but what’s the truth of it?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-devonta-smith-cheat-on-call-of-duty">Does DeVonta Smith Cheat on Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>The most talked-about clip of DeVonta Smith’s gameplay appeared on MLFootball on X. It was only a minute-long segment, and it was uploaded to showcase Smith’s humourous comms while streaming Warzone, but it was enough for Call of Duty sleuths to identify some strange goings-on.</p>



<p>Here’s the post with the full clip:</p>



<div><article><p><span>TRENDING: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eagles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Eagles</a><span> star receiver  DeVonta Smith live streaming playing Call of Duty has gone viral for how funny he is.

😭😭😭

Smitty 💀
</span><span></span></p></article></div>







<p>In the video, you can see Smith – who streams under the guise <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/smityyytv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘smityyyTV’</a> – gunning down the opposition on Rebirth Island. It’s plain as day that his accuracy and locks are scarily good, and even targets flying through the air or those appearing suddenly at long range are no challenge for the Eagles star.</p>



<p>The community is torn. If you take a look at the wider picture and check out his VOD content, it becomes less suspicious, and he starts to look like more of a well-rounded player than someone using a little extracurricular software to dominate lobbies.</p>



<p>Smith took advantage of the publicity to promote his content, inviting users to check him out in future streams:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Since yall think im cheating on COD just join the stream tonight 🤷🏽‍♂️🤣</span></p></article></div>







<p>In an effort to vouch for the Super Bowl-winning athlete, Paradox Customs, a PC company, declared on social media that ‘He’s not cheating’. The vouch went hand-in-hand with a revelation that Paradox had built DeVonta’s last two PCs, but gamers were quick to jump on the post and explain how ridiculous a retort that is.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, allegations like this rarely go away. Take Nadia, for example. She became a prolific Warzone streamer off the back of ‘hackusations’ that surfaced a good few years ago <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nadia-delta-force-event-cheater-investigation/">that have followed her around</a> like a bad stink ever since.</p>

<p>Fantasy turn-based strategy game Songs of Conquest has an official mobile release date. Publisher Coffee Stain and developer Lavapotion have announced that Songs of Conquest will release on iOS and Android on March 13.</p>



<p>The game will be available for a one-time purchase of $11.99/£11.99.</p>



<p>Despite it being released on mobile, Coffee Stain says that it will be a full port of Songs of Conquest’s PC version. </p>



<p>“The teams at Coffee Stain and Lavapotion have worked hard to make sure that the experience of playing Songs of Conquest on mobile is seamless and immersive,” Christian Knutsson, Art Director at Lavapotion, said back when the mobile version <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/strategy-game-songs-of-conquest-coming-to-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first announced</a> in September.</p>



<p>Songs of Conquest first release in Early Access in May 2022. The game’s 1.0 launch on PC took place in May 2024, and has since released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Lavapotion also has multiple expansions and DLC plans in development for the game, the latest being the <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/swipe-right/pressreleases/songs-of-conquest-branches-out-with-roots-upcoming-new-dlc-3370453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently revealed Roots faction</a> for this summer.</p>
