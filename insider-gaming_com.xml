<p>Updates have been announced for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6 </a>in version 1.1.3.6</p>



<p>The Battlefield Communications team shared news of major updates that not only address regular quality-of-life improvements but also address reliability issues and gameplay flow.</p>



<p>The update, scheduled to go live on February 3, addresses issues in REDSEC Battle Royale related to parachute behavior, insertions, and other redeploy UI elements.</p>



<p>Another major update listed is a fix to player movement issues, including excessive Sprint jumps and unintended movements. It is emphasized that this will not affect movement on a large scale but will address the specific issues reported by players.</p>







<h2 id="h-map-and-mode-fixes-coming-to-battlefield-6-in-new-updates">Map and Mode Fixes Coming to Battlefield 6 in New Updates</h2>



<p>Map and mode issues are also addressed. Three issues related to Eastwood have been fixed. First, the issue of drawing a building near the A flag, which caused unintended green and purple visual effects, has been addressed. Also, the issue where destroying the B flag could potentially cause a blackout has been fixed.</p>



<p>Additionally, the update addresses a PlayStation 5 issue where ownership validation failed during system events, causing connectivity problems. Plus, the update has resolved an out-of-memory crash on Xbox Series S when loading Daily and Weekly Challenges.</p>







<p>Other issues related to the Battle Royale mode and other areas have been addressed. Players can check out the full statement <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2017266697183412713">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-early-access/</link>
            <guid>1421185</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been a few years since the last Nioh game. Team Ninja has been sharpening its blades and skills with other projects, but it’s time for the company’s main Soulslike to return. The latest information on Nioh 3’s early access is interesting.</p>



<p>The question of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nioh3.jpg" id="147929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh</a> being the best non-<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/fromsoftware/" id="87617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoftware</a> series rages on. The Nioh franchise is dripping in Yokai-infested excellence, and each game is more refined than the last. Nioh 3 has gone bigger and bolder with its open-world approach, and it’s no wonder that so many of you want it now.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-there-nioh-3-early-access">Is There Nioh 3 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strike your anger down. Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Ninja is not offering early access as an incentive for Nioh 3 early adopters.</strong></p>



<p>Why should people who pay a bit more get to see those game-over screens sooner? This is the motto for Nioh 3, as even though the game has multiple editions, none of them feature an early access bonus.</p>



<p>There <em>are </em>cool perks, such as a Season Pass and exclusive gear, but you get to use them on Nioh 3’s launch day—like everyone else.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-nioh-3-have-a-demo">Does Nioh 3 Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>If you simply need to play Nioh 3 before release, there is a lengthy demo you can download for free on all applicable gaming platforms.</strong></p>



<p>There’s no Xbox version of Nioh 3, sadly, but if you are on PC or PS5, you can download a free demo to give you a fairly hefty look at the game, how it plays, and if it’s for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-download-nioh-3-demo">How To Download Nioh 3 Demo</h2>



<p><strong>Go to the PlayStation Store or Steam, search for Nioh 3, and you can buy and download the free Nioh 3 demo.</strong></p>



<p>Thousands of players have already left glowing reviews for the Nioh 3 demo. If you want to try it yourself, follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Decide if you’re playing on PlayStation 5 or PC.</li>



<li>Go to the PlayStation Store on PS5 or Steam for PC.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>Nioh 3 Demo</strong>.</li>



<li>Add it to your library on either format.</li>



<li>Once it’s finished downloading, you can get stuck in!</li>
</ol>



<p>Here’s even more good news for you: Your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-demo-progress-carry-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3 demo progress will carry over to the full game</a>. It’s the equivalent of starting the full game and making a dent in potential progress.</p>



<p>Will the Nioh 3 demo keep you going until February 6? Or are you going to replay an older Nioh or wait patiently for the third game in the meantime?

<p>Fortnite is teasing a new collaboration with Mihoyo’s Honkai Star Rail.</p>



<p>Collaborations in Fortnite are always a big topic in the community, with players always looking at leaks and rumours for the next big crossover. At the moment, we are already seeing names like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-x-fortnite-collaboration-dropping-in-months-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a> coming to the battle royale title. Now, it seems another popular game is on its way. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-s-next-collaboration-is-with-honkai-star-rail">Fortnite’s Next Collaboration is With Honkai Star Rail</h2>



<p>Epic Games Store has posted a new image on <a href="https://x.com/EpicGames/status/2017251729411342790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) featuring two swords and the caption, “Who’s trailblazing their way to Fortnite.” Excited fans in the comments have already started making their guesses in the comments, with most of them shouting Fortnite x Honkai Star Rail. Moreover, a reliable Fortnite leaks source, <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/2017253289742471217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, has confirmed that the collaboration is indeed with Mihoyo’s free-to-play gacha adventure. </p>



<p>Eagle-eyed fans in the comments have also deciphered who these swords belong to in the game. The gold and black sword seemingly belongs to Blade, and the katana with the red blade appears to belong to Kafka. Due to these two swords being showcased, fans are speculating that it could be these two characters that make it to Fortnite in the next collab. However, this hasn’t been officially confirmed by the devs. </p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>
