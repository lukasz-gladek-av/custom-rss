<p>In a recent study published by modl.ai, it was revealed that a whopping 77% of developers polled felt like they didn’t conduct enough QA for their studio’s most recent releases. Additionally, 50% of developers surveyed felt that QA budgets aren’t ‘growing fast enough’ to keep up with the ‘increasing complexity of modern games’.</p>



<p>The study was pieced together to take stock of the quality control ecosystem in the world of gaming development. It was focused primarily on gauging the adoption and anticipation of artificial intelligence in QA processes and procedures.</p>

<h2 id="h-not-ready-but-released">Not Ready But Released</h2>



<p>In recent years, we’ve seen some big-budget games released in a woeful state. More than a few titles have hit the open market in a paltry condition, boasting bugs across the board and performance issues left and right.</p>



<p>Last year, STALKER 2 was released to an eager reception but it was hampered by a stack of bugs – particularly on console platforms. In 2020, Cyberpunk 2077 was released in such a bad state that it faced legal concerns from investors.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insights.modl.ai/state-of-games-qa-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published by modl.ai</a>, it was revealed that 94% of developers (extrapolated) believe that AI will ‘play an important role in the future of game QA’. But with that being said, it comes as a surprise that just 18% of developers feel they’re ‘fully prepared to implement AI in all QA processes’.</p>



<p>They recognise that it’s the future of QA and testing, but they’re not ready to adopt it just yet.</p>



<p>In the numbers, 70.3% of survey respondents said they’d never launched a bug-free game.</p>



<p>In a statement on the data, Dajana Dimovska, the CEO of Indium Play, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re never going to catch every bug, but AI can get you closer. It can take on early testing responsibilities, reducing the need for large QA teams throughout the production phase.</p>



<p>As the game reaches a more playable and polished state, manual QA testers step in — working alongside AI to identify and address quality issues. This collaboration between experienced testers and AI ensures a better final product.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many are ready to place stock in the implementation of AI-based QA. In one slide in the report from modl.ai, it was revealed that 21% of developers feel that AI testing is much more effective than traditional methods.</p>



<p>Presently, the blockers preventing industry-wide adoption include the complexity of setting up and operating AI-based systems, the costs of doing so, and the resistance to change – and fear of facing redundancy.</p>

<p>Later in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll be tasked with getting a treasury key before a big raid can take place. It’s one of the most important steps in the run-up to one of the game’s most major missions, so it cannot be avoided. It’s simple – <strong>you need that key</strong>.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to trying to find Vavak’s key, you’ll most likely have a hard time given the size of the search area and the lack of direction towards where it might be. In this guide, I’ll tell you where and how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores, the all-important mission in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-vavak-s-key">How to Find Vavak’s Key</h2>



<p>Despite chatting with Christian in the guarded building in Kuttenberg, you’ll likely be searching the place for ages trying to find Vavak’s key. He doesn’t know where it is, either – it’s up to you to track it down.</p>



<p>Now, you could spend the next few minutes probing the building and the search area in a desperate attempt to find the critical key, or you could follow this guide and find it in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>Firstly, you’ll need to get past the guards at the front of the building. If you have a high enough charisma level (and other skills are assigned), you can pass a skill check and you’ll simply be granted access to the site. It’ll surprise Christian, who is already inside, but if you did his earlier missions and aligned amicably with him, it won’t be a concern.</p>



<p>Otherwise, expect trouble – and more speech checks.</p>



<p>Now that you’re in the building, you’ll learn that Vavak has fled, but there’s a chance that the key might have been left behind. However, this building has several floors and rooms, along with plenty of chests and hidden nooks and crannies – it’ll take <strong>forever</strong> to search everything – and not everyone knows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">how to pick locks</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t</strong> do that.</p>



<p>Instead, head to the ground floor and out the back door, making a beeline for the toilet that sits in the rear courtyard of the building. Inside the toilet (yes, <strong>inside</strong>) you’ll find a key sticking out of a pile of waste. That’s where Vavak’s key is in Oratores – simple.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got the key, you’ll need to wash up in a trough, otherwise people will notice your stink. But that’s it – that’s how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores. Have fun!</p>

<p>In December, MachineGames and Bethesda released Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a critically acclaimed epic featuring the titular adventurer front and centre. For this spin around the whip, Indiana Jones was played by Troy Baker, one of the most instantly recognisable names in gaming.</p>



<p>Harrison Ford has made it clear that he’s more than happy to pass the torch to Baker, and in the past, he has praised the actor for his replication of the character. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, the legendary actor once again showered Baker with adoration for his portrayal of Indiana Jones.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nothing-but-good-things">Nothing But Good Things</h2>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle received positive reviews across the board when it was released on December 9. It looks great, plays better, and features the iconic tropes of the Indiana Jones series that are intensely familiar to fans of the franchise.</p>



<p>In an interview that took place before the game was released, Bethesda Game Studios’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-troy-baker-indiana-jones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Howard revealed</a> that he <strong>didn’t want Troy Baker </strong>to play Indiana Jones. He explained that the team cast a wide net when fielding auditions, but time and again, those vetting the ‘blind taste tests’ picked Troy Baker.</p>



<p>Recently, Harrison Ford sat down to speak to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/harrison-ford-shrinking-1923-captain-america-7b1f9b3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Wall Street Journal</a> about his acting career – which is still going strong despite the performer being 82 years of age.</p>



<p>Amid a deep conversation about the Indy franchise and Ford’s most recent work, including the upcoming Captain America: Brave New World, the topic turned to Baker’s performance of Indiana Jones in the December release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul. You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent.</p>



<p>He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With the mention of AI, Harrison Ford was talking about using ‘synthetic versions of famous actors’ to apply them to roles after they’ve passed on. This is something that, quite understandably, actors are wary of pursuing.</p>
