<p>New claims have hit the internet that the Marvel Rivals developers are adding fake heroes within its game files to confuse and catch leakers, or are they?</p>



<p>The discussion first appeared on the Marvel Rivals Leak discord channel, where data miner and leaker Keone posted that NetEase is likely adding fake heroes to the game in order to confuse data miners.</p>



<p>‚ÄúHello everyone, it has come to our attention that the devs have set up characters to catch leakers, not only the ones in the code ‚Äì but potentially insider sources, too. Kang will probably explain this more as we go on, but here is the current list as far as we can figure out,‚Äù Keone explained. He then posted a picture of the characters which he believes will not be coming to the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-fake-heroes-being-planted-in-marvel-rivals">Are There Fake Heroes Being Planted in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>But the story doesn‚Äôt quite end there, as X0X Leaking Team member&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zvis_ceral</a>, who is also a dataminer stepped in to elaborate. </p>



<p>‚ÄúThis is not a 100% confirmation that they are all coming or when they will come. This is just to show off that these actually exist,‚Äù he said. He continued with a thread of heroes and code:</p>



<div><article><p><span>This is not a 100% confirmations that they are all coming or when they will come. 
This is just to show off that these actually exist. üßµ

All Hero tags can be found in: Marvel/Content/Marvel/Data/DataTable/MarvelHeroTable

Ability Tables are to long to fit the screenshot, will‚Ä¶ </span></p></article></div>



<p>While it would be uncommon but plausible for developers to add fake code to their games to catch leakers intentionally, it doesn‚Äôt quite make sense as to why they would. After all, the ‚Äúreal‚Äù heroes that are making their way to the game would still have to be in the code and would be leaked before their official announcement anyway.</p>



<p>While I don‚Äôt consider myself a tech guru when it comes to datamining, to me, it seems like this is all just code related to game development and not necessarily some huge plan from the developers to screw over leakers. All the game code tells us (and is the case for all game leaks that come via game code) is that certain things were in development and planned at one point or another. Whether they release or not is unclear unless the code specifically says.</p>

<p>So, are Marvel Rivals planting fake heroes? I don‚Äôt think so. Personally, I think people have misinterpreted the game code and what it means in some way.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Marvel Rivals leaks? Do you think some have been fake-planted? </p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the most highly-anticipated games of 2025. It‚Äôs an open-world RPG with epic proportions, giving players a massive story to explore in one of the most immersive environments ever concocted by a developer. It sounds great at first blush, but is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on PlayStation 5, or are PS players locked out of the experience?</p>



<p>Let‚Äôs find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-kingdom-come-2-be-on-ps5">Will Kingdom Come 2 Be on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on PS5 </strong>when it goes live worldwide on February 4, 2024.</p>



<p>It‚Äôll also be available on PC and Xbox Series X|S consoles ‚Äì but it‚Äôs <strong>not </strong>being released on Game Pass ‚Äì yet.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018) was available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, so Warhorse Studios has followed suit in releasing the follow-up title across the same spread. In March 2024, the first game in the series was also released on Nintendo Switch, which was nothing short of an engineering marvel.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-much-will-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-cost-on-ps5">How much will Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Cost on PS5?</h3>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a full-priced, premium release. This expansive game has a gargantuan map (or two) to explore, as well as a story and side content that‚Äôll easily require a 100-hour investment to capture everything. </p>



<p>With that being said, <strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will cost $69.99 for the standard edition of the game</strong>. If you want more content, you can buy Kingdom Come 2 on PS5 for $89.99, securing the ‚ÄòGold Edition‚Äô.</p>



<h3 id="h-will-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-be-on-ps-plus">Will Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Be on PS Plus?</h3>



<p>It‚Äôs impossible to say if Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will surface on PS Plus. The first game had a stint on the subscription service, but that was a few years after it hit the open market. It arrived much earlier on Game Pass, and who‚Äôs to say that it won‚Äôt happen again with KCD2?</p>



<p>I‚Äôd recommend that you don‚Äôt wait to see if it‚Äôll appear on PlayStation Plus, as you run the risk of having a marvellous game spoiled by those streaming it and talking about it online. This game has a masterful story that must be experienced first-hand, so it‚Äôs worth the initial investment.</p>
