<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 has been revealed at Gamescom in an epic new trailer that shows off multiple factions from the 40K universe. </p>



<p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is no time for peace, but there is time for fun as Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War 4 has been revealed at Gamescom with a bombastic new trailer that sees Space Marines battling Necrons and much more. </p>



<p>Like the previous three games, Dawn of War 4 will be a real-time strategy game rather than a third-person shooter like Space Marine 2. Players control the Blood Ravens chapter of Space Marines, but will also be able to play as three other factions, including the Adeptus Mechanicus, Orks, and the Necrons. </p>

<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has been revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live, and fans of the caped crusader are going to be thrilled about this one.</p>



<p>LEGO has recently been announcing a variety of new games. Most notably, they revealed LEGO Party, which is set to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-announced-for-september-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in September</a>&nbsp;and could compete with Mario Party. Additionally, a LEGO Voyagers game is expected to launch soon. Interestingly, the LEGO Batman game announced today confirms <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier leaks</a> that it will receive treatment similar to that of LEGO Star Wars: Skywalker Saga.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-will-feature-a-number-of-classic-characters">LEGO Batman will feature a number of classic characters</h2>



<p><strong>“LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is a brand-new open world action adventure videogame that invites players to embark on Bruce Wayne’s epic journey to become the hero of Gotham City, inspired by decades of Batman films, television, comic books, and games, and jam-packed with Batman nostalgia, DC lore, and TT Games’ signature brand of fun-filled LEGO humor,”</strong> the trailer’s description reads.</p>



<p>Check out the LEGO Batman trailer below. The game is set to launch in 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

<p>The upcoming LEGO Batman game is being developed by TT Games, just like the Skywalker Saga and the previous Batman titles. The last LEGO Batman game released was “Batman 3: Beyond Gotham” in 2014. Unlike earlier games that drew inspiration from comic books, this new installment focuses exclusively on content from live-action films. Players will not only be able to meet and interact with the characters they saw in the movies, but also play as many of them.</p>
