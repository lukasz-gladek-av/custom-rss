<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has just released a game for the Switch called Overdungeon while their patent infringement battle with Nintendo continues.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-releases-overdungeon-on-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Pocketpair released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7SXW2eXG2E&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> today announcing the arrival of Overdungeon on Nintendo Switch. The roguelike tower defence card game was first released in early access for PC via Steam in 2018, and the full release arrived in 2019. It is the first game ever developed by the Palworld Creator.</p>



<p>To celebrate its launch on the Switch, Overdungeon is available on Nintendo eShop at a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/overdungeon-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">50% discount</a>, costing $7.49 instead of $14.99. The offer is only available until January 24, 2025.&nbsp;Check out the official description for the title below.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Overdungeon is a real-time action card game that combines roguelike, tower defense, and card games! It’s easy to play with simple controls, is very replayable and a high degree of freedom! Conquer dungeons by combining cards selected from hundreds of cards! Is your trump card an alpaca? Or a dog or a cat? Or maybe a chicken? Build the strongest deck and challenge the dungeon!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On the topic of Pocketpair and Nintendo, the latter, along with The Pokémon Company, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is actively seeking 10 Million Yen</a> (around USD $66,000) in damages over alleged patent infringement. Pocketpair responded, stating they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings”. The Palworld developer also changed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-has-changed-how-pal-spheres-work-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Pal spheres worked</a> in the game while battling this lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players already knew about the skins arriving with this battle pass as <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAssembled/status/1876765775555354662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RivalsAssembled</a> on X (formerly Twitter) leaked all of the Marvel Rivals Darkhold Cosmetics for Season 1 early.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s the official description for the Darkhold battle pass:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Darkhold contains two powerful spells that have aroused interest in opposing forces: The Vampiric Verses can create creatures of the night, while the Montesi Formula can eliminate them. When Eternal Night descended upon New York, the Darkhold’s pages were scattered across Manhattan. Now, the race is on to prevent its dark power from falling into the wrong hands. Join us in the battle in Marvel Rivals and help recover the lost pages!</p>
