<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be in our hands and on our consoles and other assorted platforms in little more than a month. It was over a year ago that Bethesda Game Studios lifted the lid on Indy’s next adventure – and subsequently revealed that the iconic adventurer would be played by none other than Troy Baker.</p>



<p>However, in the months leading up to the production of the game, Bethesda’s Todd Howard was against signing the superstar actor for the lead role.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-people-chose-you-every-time">‘People Chose You Every Time’</h2>



<p>Troy Baker is one of the most storied voice actors in the industry. From BioShock to Shadow of Mordor, and from The Last of Us to inFamous, he has been around the block more than a few times.</p>



<p>I was fortunate enough to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-troy-baker-james-cox-grand-theft-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chat with Troy Baker</a> recently about a new cyberpunk-themed project he worked on.</p>



<p>It seemed like an obvious choice to pair Baker with Jones, as almost anything the actor touches turns to gold. But Todd Howard, one of Bethesda Game Studios’ most senior heads, originally rejected the idea of hiring Baker.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/indiana-jones-todd-howard-bethesda-troy-baker-1235146294/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Rolling Stone</a>, Todd Howard and Troy Baker were captured offering their thoughts on the same page. It was revealed that the pair hadn’t properly met before they touched base regarding the role of Indiana Jones. It was stated that Howard outrightly told Troy over a video call that he ‘wasn’t what they wanted’.</p>



<p>This was despite audiences reacting positively to Baker’s performances:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>‘We felt for this project and the time period it was set in, we cast a pretty wide net,’ </em>Howard says. <em>‘I’ll have you know, we did a blind taste test, and people chose you every time.’</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ultimately, the team – and Todd Howard – opted to bring in Troy Baker to perform the role of the legendary treasure hunter. </p>



<p>Do you think they made the right decision? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Maximum Football heads to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691280/Maximum_Football/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Early Access on Steam</a> on November 7, and the game’s director is happy where the gameplay stands as it gets set to launch.</p>



<p>In an exclusive upcoming interview with Insider Gaming, Maximum Games Game Director Micah Brown says that the gameplay is even further along than what he expected at this point.</p>



<p>“I’m feeling really good,” Brown said about the state of things as the game heads to early access. “The gameplay is where we want it to be. It’s further along than I thought it would be.</p>



<p>“Honestly, it plays very, very well. It’s very, very smooth.”</p>



<p>Brown did say that there are still some animations that are being smoothed out, with some coming after launch. However, as a whole, the game is playing exactly how they want it to be at this point in development.</p>



<p>“The multiplayer we’ve been testing is working well,” he continued. “The customization is absolutely amazing and the gameplay is running very well. So I’m really excited. I can’t wait till we launch and see what everybody says.</p>



<p>“It’s going to be wild.”</p>



<p>Brown’s comments on gameplay come as part of a nearly 30-minute sit down talking Maximum Football. Other topics in the upcoming interview include the game’s pricing structure, plans surrounding future updates, encouraging players to try the game, and much more.</p>



<p>When it releases in early access, the base game of Maximum Football will be free for all players. Those who wish access to more modes and options can upgrade to either the Dynasty Edition for $19.99 or the Legend Edition for $39.99.</p>
