<p>NetEase has announced that the Advanced Suit 2.0 is coming to Marvel Rivals to celebrate the PC launch of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. The company posted a reveal on Twitter earlier today, stating that the suit will be available for Spider-Man from January 30.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-friendly-neighbourhood-spider-man">Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter (X), NetEase wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Take the first look at Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (2023) in Marvel Rivals, the Advanced Suit 2.0 blends Otto Octavius’s science with Peter Parker’s genius. Crafted for the toughest battles, it symbolizes Spider-Man’s true grit as a hero.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the reveal image used to showcase the Advanced Suit 2.0 in Marvel Rivals:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Spider-Man 2 was released in 2023 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and while Insomniac neglected to follow up with any major expansions, the game has remained popular since. On January 30, the web-slinging hero title will land on PC via Steam.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has been a boon for NetEase since being released in December 2024. It has pulled in tens of millions of players and has become one of the best hero shooters to emerge in recent years. It’s challenging Overwatch in the genre and will be a thorn in the side of Valve’s Deadlock.</p>



<p>In Marvel Rivals, Spider-Man is one of the most challenging Duelists. He has a five-star difficulty rating and relies on unparalleled acrobatic abilities to dominate the playing field.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of Spider-Man 2, you’ll want to snag the Advanced Suit 2.0 when it appears in Marvel Rivals on January 30.</p>

<p>In a recent update posted on Steam, it was revealed that Fortune’s Run, a retro sci-fi indie shooter, will have all development activity put on hold for three years. This is because the sole developer, ‘Dizzie’, will be serving a 36-month prison sentence, which was handed down as a result of the dev living ‘a very different life’ before they started working on Fortune’s Run.</p>



<p>As of today, Fortune’s Run boasts a ‘Very Positive’ rating on Steam, where it has existed since September 2023.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-unclear-what-will-happen">‘It’s Unclear What Will Happen’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on Valve’s PC platform, Steam, the sole developer of Fortune’s Run explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been sentenced to prison for the next 3 years. It’s a long story, but I’ve lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn’t living very well. My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I’ve been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I’m going away next month. </p>



<p>It’s a shame, but it’s the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn’t going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The post went on to explain that Fortune’s Run ‘sold okay’ and that once Dizzie is released from prison, they’ll hopefully be back on their feet and will return to the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I’m never going to stop making games. I’d like to finish this one, but I don’t know what will happen. I’m going to do my best, because I love this game and I want to finish it. Seriously, I just want to finish it. Finish it already, Dizzie!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This news was followed up by a couple more posts explaining some updates and tweaks being made to the game – which will likely be the final changes Fortune’s Run will see for quite some time.</p>



<p>If you want to ‘explore a decaying industrial world left behind in humanity’s never-ending race to conquer the stars’, then consider giving <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1692240/Fortunes_Run/">Fortune’s Run a try on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Activision has revealed its new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies map that will launch at the start of Season 2. The new map is called The Tomb, and will release for all Zombies players on January 28.</p>



<p>“After surviving the horrific events at Citadelle des Morts, Weaver, Grey, Carver, and Maya follow Gabriel Krafft’s final words to a nearby excavation site to secure the Sentinel Artifact,” the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-115-day-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post reads</a>. “Built on the remains of ancient burial grounds with suspected origins dating back to 2500 B.C.E., these catacombs went undisturbed for centuries until the early 1900s… and what lies beneath may run deeper than anyone ever imagined.”</p>



<p>Developer Treyarch says that The Tomb was designed to give players an experience similar to that of Liberty Falls. The map has “tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability”. There will also be Easter Eggs scattered throughout the map along with a “reimagined Wonder Weapon” that is inspired by the past.</p>



<p>“As a reminder, every Zombies map in&nbsp;Black Ops 6&nbsp;is an original location built from the ground-up for the mode… but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy a wink and a nod here and there,” they said. “On that note, we’re going for something a little more evocative with our Pack-a-Punch camos this time around – and what if we told you one of the most iconic SMGs in Zombies history was coming along for the ride?”</p>



<p>In addition to the new map, Zombies will be getting a number of updates with the launch of Season 2. Those updates include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Challenge Tracking &amp; Near Completion</li>



<li>Co-op Pausing</li>



<li>AFK Kick Loadout Recovery</li>



<li>Separate HUD presets for Zombies and Multiplayer.</li>
</ul>



<p>More details on The Tomb and what else is coming to Zombies will be revealed in the upcoming Season 2 reveal blog.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard hasn’t helped it grow Xbox Game Pass or the gaming business in general. According to a new report from The Information, the growth from the acquisition has yet to hit what Microsoft was hoping for when it made the $69 billion purchase.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Information claims</a> that Microsoft was hoping that the purchase would help convince more players to sign up to the service as well as push more studios to releasing their games on the subscription-based platform. Instead, their sources say say that “several leading game studios have resisted Microsoft’s pitch that they should put their titles on Game Pass in exchange for fees that Microsoft offers to pay to the gaming studios.”</p>



<p>Denny Fish, a portfolio manager who oversees funds including a reported $800 million of Microsoft stock, told the outlet, “[Activision] has been disappointing.”</p>



<p>Microsoft had targeted reaching 100 million subscribers by 2030. As of February 2024, there were 34 million subscribers, including those who became subscribers after Microsoft converted Xbox Live to Xbox Game Pass Core. Microsoft has failed to hit Game Pass growth targets in each of the last two years. That led to Game Pass’s growth being dropped as a metric that determined CEO Satya Nadella’s pay at Microsoft.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised its prices</a> while introducing a new tier—Game Pass Standard—that took away Day One releases from console subscribers unless they upgrade to Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<p>In addition, Microsoft expected more studios and publishers to rent Azure cloud servers for their games. It’s said that Activision is still using Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for its server rentals along with “primarily relying on its own servers for development”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft regarding the report. Should a response of any kind be received, it will be added to this story. Microsoft is scheduled to announce its Q2 earnings for FY2025 on January 29.</p>
