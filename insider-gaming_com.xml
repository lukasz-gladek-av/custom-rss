            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-ceo-could-be-the-next-top-boss-at-disney.1034388/</guid>

<p>In a recent report, it was claimed that Electronic Arts’ CEO, Andrew Wilson, is being considered for the role of CEO at Disney and could replace Bob Iger, who has been in the role (on and off) since 2005. In 2026, the figurehead’s contract will expire and Disney is looking for a suitable replacement – and Andrew Wilson is leading the pack.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-ea-to-disney">From EA To Disney</h2>



<p>Per a report from the Wall Street Journal, the head honcho at Electronic Arts is being sized up for the CEO position at Disney. It was claimed that several people are being considered for the role:</p>



<ul>
<li>Andrew Wilson, CEO at EA</li>



<li>Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN Chairman</li>



<li>Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, Disney Entertainment co-chairs</li>



<li>Josh D’Amaro, Disney Experiences Chairman</li>
</ul>



<p>Andrew Wilson has been climbing the ranks at Electronic Arts for almost a quarter of a century, having joined way back in 2000. He has been the CEO of the firm since 2013, through many of the company’s highest highs and lowest lows.</p>



<p>In recent years, Disney has been making bold pushes into the world of gaming. In February, the company bought <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/disney-buys-1-5-billion-stake-in-epic-games-will-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games</a>, and a couple of years ago, the firm stressed that it wanted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-every-6-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Star Wars game</a> on the market every six months. </p>



<p>In 2023, Bob Iger was advised to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2023/10/11/disney-execs-want-to-buy-ea-and-become-a-gaming-giant-19645298/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">invest heavily in gaming</a> and acquire a leading publisher or development office, and Electronic Arts was at the front of that discussion. For a while, there was a goal for Disney to become ‘a gaming giant’, but Iger wasn’t agreeable to the mission.</p>



<p>With Andrew Wilson at the helm, could we see Disney become an indomitable gaming powerhouse?</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 is one of the best-selling games ever made, and over the last decade, it has built an indelible impression on the gaming world. More than ten years later, the game’s cast still represents the brand to no end, appearing on stream and in-person at events that celebrate the franchise and the success of GTA 5.</p>



<p>Recently, Shawn Fonteno, the actor behind Franklin Clinton, one of GTA 5’s lead characters, appeared on-stream with Kai Cenat, and he divulged a few home truths about the development of Grand Theft Auto 5. In one segment, the actor revealed that he was inches away from quitting the role mid-production.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-was-facing-two-cases">‘I Was Facing Two Cases’</h2>



<p>On Kai Cenat’s recent stream, Shawn Fonteno revealed that his portrayal of Franklin Clinton in GTA 5 rang <strong>very </strong>close to home. Before he landed the role with Rockstar Games, he was gangbanging, had been shot several times, and was facing ‘serious time’ before Rockstar scooped him up and offered him the job as Franklin Clinton.</p>



<p>It wasn’t all smooth sailing though.</p>



<p>Fonteno revealed that early on in the game’s development, he tried to storm out of the production as nobody knew they were working on Grand Theft Auto. At one point, the game’s director had to pull him aside and instruct him to trust the process – but <a href="https://x.com/StreamersEra/status/1856511627404681461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it almost went a different way entirely</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They fought with me. I quit. I said, ‘I don’t want to do this shit, take this shit off of me’. They sat me down and the director said, ‘Just trust me’. They didn’t tell us it was Grand Theft Auto 5, they told us it was another game when we went there called Paradise, because they’re secretive.</p>



<p>We didn’t know we were working on GTA 5 until a whole year later.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He revealed that his character’s name, to maintain the cover, was ‘DaShawn.’</p>



<p>As the stream with Kai Cenat unravelled, <a href="https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1856496398583099841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shawn Fonteno called his cousin</a>, Young Maylay, the voice of San Andreas’ Carl Johnson, and requested he do some of his most iconic lines. It was a peak point for GTA fans, as Maylay is notoriously averse to interviews and performing anything related to San Andreas as he feels that over the last 20 years, the game has been covered to death.</p>

<p>After its release back in 2017, Free Fire has still kept its stance as one of the biggest mobile Battle Royale games out there. The game also has a unique and big ranking system. Here are all the ranks in Free Fire.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-free-fire-ranks">All Free Fire Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in Free Fire:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Heroic</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grandmaster</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Bronze through Diamond ranks consist of tiers, which are listed below.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze </strong>(I, II, III)</li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong> (I, II, III)</li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong> (I, II, III, and IV)</li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (I, II, III, and IV)</li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong> (I, II, III, and IV)</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s final rank, Grandmaster, is only given to the top 300 on the leaderboard. This means that anyone who falls behind this number will lose the rank.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-earn-ranked-points-in-free-fire">How to Earn Ranked Points in Free Fire</h2>



<p>Free Fire uses Ranked Points to progress through the ranks in the game. To earn these points, players must play the Battle Royale’s Ranked mode and get kills and placement points.</p>



<p>Like every other Battle Royale game, trying to be the last one standing is the goal during each game. The longer you last in the game, the more Ranked Points you achieve. </p>



<p>Free Fire also has an additional mode called Clash Squad, which is a 4v4 game mode. When playing Clash Squad, players have to win four out of seven matches. The game’s Ranked mode is completely different from the regular Battle Royale, as players gain Stars instead of climbing ranks.</p>



<p>Both modes are unique in their own ways, but the regular Free Fire Battle Royale has the more traditional ranking system.</p>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Grandmaster in Free Fire?</p>

<p>With PUBG holding its ground within the realm of Battle Royales, many players have been choosing to explore the Ranked system within the game. Here is a list of all the PUBG: Battlegrounds ranks and how you can hit the final rank, Master.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-pubg-battlegrounds-ranks">All PUBG: Battlegrounds Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all PUBG ranks:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Each rank is split into five tiers, starting with V and ending with I. However, each season marks a new rank for players, meaning everyone starts out as Unranked.</p>



<p>PUBG ranks differ from PUBG Mobile, however, as the mobile Battle Royale has extra ranks and a bit different point system.</p>



<p>So, how do players rank up in PUBG?</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-pubg-and-hit-master">How to Rank Up in PUBG and Hit Master</h2>



<p>The goal of all competitive PUBG players is to hit Master, the final rank in the game. To complete this challenge, however, players will have to spend quite a bit of time in the game. </p>



<p>To rank up in PUBG, players will have to place in Ranked matches. Placement points and kills are the two best ways to climb the ladder when playing the Battle Royale, so attempting to get first in each match is the best way to move up in the ranks.</p>



<p>There is also a rank higher than Master called Grandmaster, which is given to the top 500 players on the Ranked leaderboard.</p>



<p>PUBG’s Ranked system also has Ranked Decay, which is a feature that slowly deteriorates one’s rank if they begin to not play the game. Rank Decay starts taking action after seven days of someone not playing Ranked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-points-needed-for-each-rank">Points Needed for Each Rank</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the points needed to progress through the ranks in PUBG:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze:</strong> 0 – 1500</li>



<li><strong>Silver:</strong> 1500 – 1900</li>



<li><strong>Gold:</strong> 2000 – 2500</li>



<li><strong>Platinum:</strong> 2500 – 2999</li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong> 3000 – 3499</li>



<li><strong>Master:</strong> 3500+</li>
</ul>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Master in PUBG? </p>

<p>When it comes to finding the right camera for streaming on Twitch, YouTube and other platforms, people often find themselves with more options than less. The truth is, there are quite a few options out there to choose from. What would be considered the best camera for streaming, though?</p>



<h2 id="h-streaming-cameras-which-one-is-the-best">Streaming Cameras: Which one is the best?</h2>



<p>When searching for a camera to go live with, you must first figure out a budget. Unfortunately, there are not any cameras that will give you HD-studio quality imagery for under $150. However, if you do not mind the quality being a little lower than normal, then there are plenty of options for you.</p>



<p>But if you want to get a high-end camera that really makes you pop while streaming, then this article will provide the correct resources for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-streaming-camera">The Best Streaming Camera</h2>



<ul>
<li>Sony Alpha a6400 Mirrorless Camera</li>
</ul>



<p>The Sony Alpha a6400 Mirrorless Camera is by far the best camera for streaming. With an infinite battery inside the body, the Sony Alpa a6400 will run for as long as you want it to.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The camera can shoot up to 4k and has 24.2 megapixels. However, all of the look is not in the camera, but also in the lens. </p>



<p>The Sony Alpha a6400 Mirrorless Camera is currently $749.99 USD on <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-alpha-a6400-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/6324856.p?skuId=6324856&amp;extStoreId=211&amp;utm_source=feed&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=18182031001&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAlsy5BhDeARIsABRc6Zvat_zqkIfLUjsyKkENIqv8J1cxmDr1U7JgSYPQ_v0cA4sBfog9bpoaAhlMEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Best Buy.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-best-camera-lens-for-streaming">Best Camera Lens for Streaming</h2>



<p>Camera lenses do not come cheap, but if you are willing to spend a buck or two, the Sony E 15mm F1.4 G APS-C lens is by far one of the best lenses to use when live streaming.</p>



<p>With an F1.4, this lens will give you the best depth of field compared to any other lens. Its auto-focus is pristine and will stay focused on you for the entirety of your stream.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>To top it off, the lens is also a 15mm lens, meaning it will be able to capture a large amount of your streaming room, showcasing your setup.</p>



<p>The Sony E 15mm F1.4 G APS-C lens is currently $649.99 USD at <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-e-15mm-f1-4-g-aps-c-large-aperture-wide-angle-g-lens-black/6509497.p?skuId=6509497">Best Buy.</a></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-budget-friendly-streaming-camera">Best Budget-Friendly Streaming Camera</h2>



<p>Want a good camera, but are on a bit tighter budget? Luckily, Logitech has quite a few options for you.</p>



<p>The Logitech StreamCam has dominated the streaming world as one of the best Webcams for live streaming. With 1080p resolution at 60fps, this camera is perfect for those wanting to make their stream look great but do not want to spend upwards of $1,000 to do so.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Logitech StreamCam is currently only $129.99 USD on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Streamcam-Streaming-Webcam-YouTube/dp/B07TYWPM67/ref=asc_df_B07TYWPM67?mcid=4659779bd56a3e6e8e430dad7edb682f&amp;hvocijid=11117331681224633862-B07TYWPM67-&amp;hvexpln=73&amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=692875362841&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=11117331681224633862&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9028715&amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435180498&amp;th=1">Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>It has been confirmed that Black Ops 6 will appear at the Esports World Cup in 2025. This is the first game to be locked in for the multi-million-dollar event, which is set to run between July and August 2025. This year’s Esports World Cup was the first iteration of the event, and it was a roaring success, by all account ts.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-locked-in">Locked In</h2>



<p>This year’s Esports World Cup saw everything represented, from League of Legends to Counter-Strike 2, and from Rainbow Six Siege to Rocket League. While Call of Duty (multiplayer, not battle royale) was a late addition to the monumental tournament, Activision has more than made up for that delay this year by making Black Ops 6 <strong>the first confirmed game </strong>for the Esports World Cup 2025.</p>



<p>In August, Atlanta FaZe stormed the stage and secured the $600,000 prize pool, beating an unlikely 100 Thieves team in an intense grand final in Riyadh. The tournament didn’t pull in as strong a viewership as the Call of Duty League, but it made for a nice change of pace in the off-season, and it allowed for a much more diverse roster of teams to compete</p>



<p>It’ll likely be the same format this year, with Challengers-grade teams mixing up with CDL squads in a Pro-Am setting. </p>



<p>As the months move by, we’ll see many more games surface in the line-up for the 2025 Esports World Cup. If the inaugural event was a showstopper, the event’s organisers will be pulling out all the stops to make sure that the second year is even bigger.</p>

<p>HBO has confirmed a release window for season 2 of The Last Of Us. According to the network itself, the current target is Spring 2025 for second season of the popular show.</p>



<p>In addition to the confirmation of a release window, a new short teaser was released for the show. You can watch that at the end of the story.</p>



<p>The Last of Us Season 2 will follow the events of the second game in the franchise. That said, there will be some additions to the show in the form of backstory. In September, series creator and head of Naughty Dog Neil Druckmann said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-backstory-important/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the show will dive further</a> into areas that they couldn’t do for the game.</p>



<p>“And there’s stuff in this season that I’m really excited about — stuff that we hinted at — one scene in particular comes to mind that I think fans of the game will eat up, because it really kind of tells you a lot of backstory of this important character that there wasn’t really a way for us to even do that in the game,” he said. </p>



<p>It was also has been said that the story of the second game will likely be told over multiple seasons meaning that the show should at least get a third season.</p>



<p>“We don’t think that we’re going to be able to tell the story even within two [more] seasons because we’re taking our time and [going] down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in season one too,” Showrunner Crag Mazin told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-showrunner-season-two-casting-abby-1235560553/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. </p>



<p>“We feel like it’s almost assuredly going to be the case that – as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television – season three will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require season four.”</p>

<p>During the Q3 2024 <a href="https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=300823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings report</a> (via Inven), Shift Up revealed that a PC release for Stellar Blade is being considered for 2025. The developers stated, “Considering recent trends such as Steam’s expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of Black Myth Wukong, we expect the performance on PC to exceed consoles.”</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is an action-adventure title developed by South Korean developer Shift Up. It was released in April 2024 and has been exclusive to the PS5 since then. However, after the latest developments, players can finally play Stellar Blade on PC in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stellar Blade follows the journey of 7th Airborne Squad member EVE, who arrives on a desolate, abandoned Earth to save Humankind from the Naytiba. However, while battling these evil forces, Eve also puts together the mysteries of human civilisation, which makes her realise that her mission isn’t as simple as it seems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game features intense and fast-paced third-person combat, where players use basic attacks, Beta skills, ranged attacks, and Burst skills to take down the Naytiba. You also get to explore a unique, post-apocalyptic world that consists of crumbling buildings, vast wastelands, deserts, and more.&nbsp;</p>
