<p>Following a YouTube copyright strike from Take-Two Interactive, a GTA 5 modder has decided to remove his mod that adds GTA 6 into GTA 5.</p>



<p>The video in question was a FiveM mod that added the GTA 6 map into GTA 5, which was based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive hack that Rockstar Games faced</a> a couple of years ago. </p>



<p>Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/take-two-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two Interactive</a> only copyright striking the YouTube video, the modder, Dark Space, said in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U&amp;ab_channel=DarkSpace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a> that he’s also decided to remove the download links to prevent further legal action.</p>



<p>In a Twitter/X tweet, he said, “Take Two interactive has copyright claimed and removed my video on the GTA 6 map I made in GTA 5. I expected something like this could happen. I am surprised they didn’t bother emailing me. I would have taken it down if asked.”</p>



<p>Take-Two Interactive has been notorious in copyright striking and issuing legal action against modders in the past, so the news shouldn’t be too surprising for anyone familiar with their practices. Even more so when the mod in question is based on leaked material that wasn’t indented to see the light of day.</p>



<p>GTA 6 was officially revealed on December 4, 2025, and at the time of writing hasn’t seen a gameplay update since. According to Take-Two Interactive, the game is still due to release in 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of Take-Two Interactive removing the GTA 6 mod? Are you looking forward to seeing a GTA 6 gameplay update from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games</a>?

<p>According to a new leak, Pokémon Legends Z-A will feature 27 new Mega Evolutions.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Reliable Pokémon leaks source CentroLeak’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1904096996190728268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> talks about the 27 Mega Evolutions arriving for Pokémon Legends Z-A. In the comments section, the leaker revealed that Gen 5 and Gen 6 Mega Evolutions will be included in the game, and they have heard that Gen 6’s Zygrade is one of the Megas that can be expected in the upcoming instalment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mega Evolutions were a significant part of the series for a long time. However, the developers decided to remove this mechanic along with Z-moves in their upcoming instalments. Mega Evolutions are finally set to return to the series with the upcoming title, and if the rumours are true, we might be getting a whole lot of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from the new mega evolutions, Pokémon Legends Z-A is about to introduce a bunch of new content and features for the players. For the first time in series history, the developers are swapping the iconic turn-based battle system for real-time battle. Trainers and Pokémon will enter the Arena together, and the Pokémon will move around in real time and use moves when the trainer commands them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new real-time battle system will introduce fresh gameplay mechanics, and players must build their tactics around them. Players need to consider several things now, such as when they need to swap their Pokémon, the size of the Arena, the duration of their moves, and other details.&nbsp;</p>
