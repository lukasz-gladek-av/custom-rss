<p>WWE 2K25 is going all out again to deliver a spectacle like nothing else. It’s the latest release in 2K’s vision of professional wrestling, and Xbox Game Pass Subscribers wonder if they can get a piece of the action.</p>



<p>Every new WWE 2K release feels like Wrestlemania. You have months of build-up and anticipation leading to a special payoff. Once a new game is out, attention naturally diverts toward DLC and updates, but behind the scenes, 2K is busy readying for their Wrestlemania next year. When WWE 2K24 was released, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> presumably became the focus.</p>



<p>It’s nearly time for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> to walk the aisle. But if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, let’s see if you can score a front-row ticket for cheap.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t look like WWE 2K25 is a day-one Xbox Game Pass option for subscribers as no advertising or marketing suggests this.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox is proud of games coming to Game Pass and advertises them at all costs. Announcement trailers usually have the Game Pass logo stamp on them. It’s also mentioned in press releases and news articles.</p>



<p>WWE 2K25 has had countless trailers and press releases to this point. However, there’s no indication of WWE 2K25 being on Game Pass. Another tried and tested insight into a game’s Game Pass status is Microsoft’s Xbox Store.</p>



<p>If you go to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/wwe-2k25-standard-edition/9P6NQMP5LXD6/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25</a> game page, you’ll find <strong>no mention of playing the title through Game Pass</strong>. Instead, it’s a case of paying full price digitally or physically or finding yourself a tasty bargain.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-wwe-2k25-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will WWE 2K25 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>The chances of WWE 2K25 coming to Xbox Game Pass are very low—borderline not happening.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-pga-tour-2k25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is another 2K sports title released within a month of WWE 2K25. That’s also not coming to Game Pass, and 2K sports titles generally don’t. They don’t even come to Game Pass a year or two after release.</p>



<p>If you’re desperate to step into the squared circle and engage in graps, you must buy WWE 2K25 outright.</p>



<hr>



<p>Should 2K and Microsoft tighten up their partnership stronger than a sleeper hold and deliver 2K sports titles on Game Pass? Or are you not bothered and are committed to buying each new WWE 2K title anyway? </p>

<p>A series of articles that were seemingly posted too early have revealed a new studio founded by former Metro developers from 4A Games. The studio, dubbed ‘Reburn’, is developing a futuristic sci-fi shooter that looks as though it could be straight out of the Killzone series. It’s named ‘La Quimera’, and an announcement trailer for the game was <strong>almost </strong>grabbed by eagle-eyed users.</p>



<p>Instead, we have a series of screencaps to go on. These images showcase an attractive, intense first-person shooter, the origins of which are hard to pinpoint. One screenshot shows the player character fighting with soldiers who have bright orange eyes on their helmets, which utterly smacks of Killzone, the long-abandoned PlayStation FPS series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-out-of-nowhere">From Out of Nowhere</h2>



<p>La Quimera translates directly from Spanish to English as ‘The Chimera’. That’s a mythological monster created by combining elements from multiple creatures, which immediately gives La Quimera a kind of ‘experiment gone wrong’ vibe. The game’s story has reportedly been penned by Nicolas Winding Refn (<em>Drive</em>, <em>The Neon Demon</em>).</p>



<p>One Spanish-speaking publication revealed several details about the game. First, it’s set ‘in a Latin American megalopolis’, </p>



<p>The screenshots that were captured and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-metro-series-devs-form-new-game-studio-reburn-reveal-new-sc-fi-shooter-la-quimera-trailer.1118565/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared on ResetEra</a> showcase a futuristic first-person shooter that could be Killzone 4 if you weren’t privy to this news.</p>



<p>In the post on ResetEra, users shared several screenshots that reveal what looks like a remarkable game at first blush. From hulking, animalistic robot enemies to dramatic showdowns between what looks like a resistance group and heavily armoured soldiers, a lot of lore is already being established for La Quimera.</p>



<p>In some scenes, we get a look at a world that appears to be somewhat devastated and overgrown, suggesting some post-apocalyptic vibes might be present. That theme fits perfectly into the wheelhouse of these developers, given that they worked on Metro.</p>



<p>There’s also a title splash that reveals the player character, an armoured individual reminiscent of a Halo Spartan or ‘Prophet’ from the Crysis series. This title splash suggests the game is only coming to PC platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-imminent-reveal">Imminent Reveal</h2>



<p>It has been claimed that La Quimera is an ‘ambitious’ game that fuses ‘exoticism and Latin folklore’ with ‘weapons and technology of the future’. The ‘Metro touch’ is front and centre from the 110 developers working on the project, many of whom have acquired experience from years of working at 4A Games.</p>



<p>It has been mentioned that it’s set to be a narrative-driven adventure playable either solo or in a group of up to four players.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known when Reburn plans to fully reveal La Quimera, but given that at least three outlets have their hands on a trailer and screenshots, it could be any day now. Studios and publishers will rarely share content like this too long before an announcement is made, for <strong>this very reason that we’re discussing</strong>.</p>



<p>Remember – <strong>it’s not confirmed until it’s confirmed, and this content is all subject to change.</strong></p>
