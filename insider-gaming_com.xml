<p>Microsoft is going to enter the handheld gaming market. It’s just a matter of when, not if, and it’s something that Xbox head Phil Spencer is excited about.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvYRQxIaJ-k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iJustine</a>, Spencer was asked about the Xbox’s plans for handheld gaming. While Spencer didn’t fully commit to anything specific, he did drop another tease about what’s to come.</p>



<p>“[We’ve] teased and talked about handhelds and I’m very excited because we both travel, and sometimes you can’t always take your console or your whole gaming desktop with you,” Spencer said when asked specifically if there was anything “exciting” coming from Xbox in 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Spencer didn’t confirm it, Microsoft is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-seemingly-teases-project-kennan-xbox-handheld-ahead-of-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expected to release</a> an Xbox-branded handheld PC in partnership with ASUS. The handheld, while not a full Xbox mobile system, is expected to have a heavy Xbox presence , including an Xbox guide button and “more prominent grips”. The system, however, will be a mobile PC that doesn’t run Xbox games natively. </p>



<p>Regarding an official Xbox handheld, that’s not rumored to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come until 2027</a>.</p>

<p>Sabrina Carpenter is surfacing in Fortnite tomorrow, and her skins have been revealed on social media. She’s appearing as the Fortnite Festival ‘icon’ for Season 8, and fans are fawning over her sparkly outfits. On April 4, Epic Games started teasing the arrival of Carpenter in the popular battle royale game, and tomorrow, they’re delivering on the promise.</p>



<p>You can check out Sabrina Carpenter’s Fortnite skins below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-style-over-substance">Style over Substance</h2>



<p>Die-hard Fortnite fans have questioned why Sabrina Carpenter has found her way into the Fortnite ecosystem, but we’re far beyond questioning that. Fortnite has long had a strong relationship with musicians and has hosted many live events and performances in the game – Sabrina Carpenter is the latest addition to that industry-wide collaboration.</p>



<p>On social media, images of the Sabrina Carpenter skin set and a touch of bling were revealed:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Season 8 update goes like at 6 AM ET (3 AM PT) tomorrow, April 8. It’s then that you can unlock the Sabrina Carpenter skins in Fortnite. The whole pack was revealed recently in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/sabrina-carpenter-hearts-fortnite-festival-in-season-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite blog post</a>.</p>



<p>Along with the skins, Sabrina enters the world of Fortnite with two instantly recognisable Jam Tracks – Nonsense and Juno. When you purchase the Sweet Little Bundle from the Fortnite Store, you’ll also unlock Please Please Please as another Jam Track.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-sabrina-carpenter-in-fortnite">How to Unlock Sabrina Carpenter in Fortnite</h2>



<p>To get the Sabrina Carpenter outfit in Fortnite, you need to purchase the Season 8 Music Pass. This will automatically unlock a base skin for Carpenter, as well as a LEGO style. The first outfit you get for Sabrina will be her Victoria’s Secret babydoll dress.</p>



<p>As you progress through the Music Pass, you’ll get the SC Electric Guitar and a second outfit – the embellished bodysuit.</p>



<p>There’s a third and final outfit for Sabrina, though – and you’ll need to buy this one.</p>



<p>It’s called the <strong>Tour-Ready Sabrina Carpenter </strong>outfit, and it will be available in the Fortnite Store throughout Season 8, along with:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>SC Heart Purse Back Bling</strong></li>



<li><strong>Taste Emote</strong></li>



<li><strong>Please Please Please Emote</strong></li>



<li><strong>Cute Cutout Contrail</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sabrina’s Mic</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 won’t have achievements. That, according to Nintendo of America’s Vice President of Player and Product Experience Bill Trinen.</p>



<p>In talking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Trinen was asked straight up if the Nintendo Switch 2 would be the first Nintendo system to include the feature for its games. Trinen’s response was a pretty firm one-word answer.</p>



<p>“Nope,” he said.</p>



<p>Hope for achievements on the new system took hold when it was revealed that both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom would have them. Of course, they would be tracked on the Nintendo Switch app as opposed to the system itself, but they’re there.</p>

<p>Despite Nintendo not implementing the feature on its new system, that doesn’t mean no games on the console won’t have them Third-party developers could implement them through their own systems such as EA having achievements for Madden 26 or EA Sports FC tied through the EA Account. It just won’t be something Switch 2 players will be able to show off to others via the console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is scheduled to launch on June 5, 2025. Pre-orders for the system are set to open on April 8/9 throughout the world. That is, of course, unless you live in the United States where recently implemented tariffs by the government have led to Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying pre-orders in the country</a>.</p>
