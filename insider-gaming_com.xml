<p>It wouldn’t be a VALORANT offseason for Cloud9 without just a little bit of drama. For the second season in a row, the team made more than one late roster move that caught fans off guard. Now though, the team looks to capitalize on the sophomore season of one of last year’s breakout stars in Francis “OXY” Hoang.</p>



<p>At VCT Americas’ Media Day, C9 coach Ian “Immi” Harding spoke to Insider Gaming about OXY’s year two expectations and the new additions to the roster. He also spoke about the necessary culture shift that C9 needs to reach the next level.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</em></p>



<p><strong>IG: A breakout season for OXY last year. What are you hoping to see him do more of in 2025?</strong></p>



<p>This year we’ve been working on a lot of his teamplay, his comms, him actually saying what he wants to do in a round. He has a really good read on the game, but last year he was still getting used to using his own voice. Discipline as well; when we have those two-man advantages, we don’t want him throwing his life away because he wants to get the clip.</p>



<p>We’ve been working around him a lot, and he’s playing an overall better game right now.</p>

<p><strong>IG: Another new addition is v1c, who had a stellar campaign with Shopify. What about his game did you see that you think will impress on the tier one level?</strong></p>



<p>One of the things I feel we lacked last year was firepower and good attitudes. With him he has a great attitude, and great comms which I didn’t expect when trialing. He mid-rounds, he has great ideas, he always wants to help out the coaching staff, he watches VODs back.</p>



<p>But he can shoot. He can really shoot. Now we have shooters on this team. That was the big thing. For smokes players, it was [between] him and Zander, but we didn’t even get a chance to try out Zander. I think all the players that have come in are helping the coaching staff, whereas last year it wasn’t quite like that; we would bring some ideas and they would just get shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>IG: Were there specific players that weren’t receptive to ideas and weren’t providing enough firepower?</strong></p>



<p>I don’t want to name names, but the team’s the team now. I just think our culture last year, which I can be to blame too as well for, wasn’t the best. And this year this is something we’ve really worked on; myself, Guglielmo “GUGLi” Carraro, and especially Mitchell “mitch” Semago coming in. The culture of the team is much, much stronger and in a better position.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Immi backstage during the 2024 season. Photo by Tina Jo/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>[With mitch], it’s still early days, and we’re still learning a lot about each other, but it’s very good. He’s a similar caller to vanity; he can read the game really well. But the things he brings outside the game: he always wants to work on stuff, he wants to work on fundamentals, he wants to make sure we’re not losing ecos. We’re very in sync with that now. He’s bringing out the best of me and I hope I’m bringing out the good in him too.</p>



<p><strong>IG: It took more than a few dramatic steps to get to this roster you have now. Now that it’s together though, what makes it stand out compared to previous rosters?</strong></p>



<p>Everyone’s on the same page. We’re having practice days where we’re getting up at 9 am and we’re not finished until 7 pm just because we talk about everything and we’re making sure we’ve got everything right. Obviously a big factor is that we don’t have that much time, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-tejo-in-valorant-tips-and-tricks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now [a new] agent is coming in</a>.</p>



<p>They just want to win and they’re all young and they’re hungry. And going into the offseason that’s what I wanted: young, hungry players that wanted to win and a leader who would help me set the culture to the way it should be.</p>

<p>Rebel Wolves, which is represented by former CD Projekt Red talent, has revealed The Blood of Dawnwalker with a lengthy cinematic trailer and a short gameplay teaser. The trailer was released today, introducing this ‘brand-new role-playing saga’ that begins with this open-world single-player RPG.</p>



<p>The studio is led by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the creative mind who directed The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, which was released back in 2015. In some of the visual and audio elements of the trailer for The Blood of Dawnwalker, some Witcher-themed inspiration can be detected.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-treading-the-line">Treading the Line</h2>



<p>In the blurb that accompanied the new trailer, Rebel Wolves wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night. Use your skills and combine vampiric strength with human resolve as you take on a quest to save the ones you love. Face your foes – be they human, monster, or the ticking clock itself. </p>



<p>But remember – the real evil may bask in the sun’s light, and the most loyal of allies could lurk under the cover of night.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The trailer showcases brutal combat, with enemies being torn to pieces and even exploded by a gaggle of bloodthirsty and powerful vampires. There’s plenty of emotional, fountains of blood, and a glimpse at a wide, open world with impressive potential.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The team neglected to provide any kind of a release window for the game, but a full gameplay reveal is schedule to take place this summer – potentially at Summer Games Fest.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-beginners-guide-tips-and-tricks-for-new-players/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2-beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-%E2%80%93-tips-and-tricks-for-new-players.1081320/</guid>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 can seem awfully daunting towards beginners and new players, but the iconic tactical shooter from Valve is easy to learn. Unlike in other popular multiplayer titles where there is a constantly shifting meta, CS2 mostly stays the same, apart from the occasional map pool change, a new gun, or a small gameplay tweak.</p>



<p>If you’re a new player jumping into CS2 for the first time ever, here are some tips for beginners to use.<em> </em></p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-learn-the-maps-and-callouts">Learn the Maps and Callouts</h2>



<p>CS2’s primary competitive mode, Premier, uses an active duty map pool that consists of seven bomb defusal maps. Getting used to the map layouts is important to CS2 beginners, but so too is learning the callouts, i.e. the names of specific locations. Knowing the callouts is key to relaying information between teammates.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have a second monitor, display the map with callouts on your second screen. Over time, you’ll learn the callout locations and will be able to call them without needing the map. There are also community-made aim courses in the Steam Workshop that will help you learn common angles an hiding spots on each map. Speaking of aim courses…</p>



<h2 id="h-practice-makes-perfect">Practice Makes Perfect</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-practice-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Practicing is the only way to get better when you’re a new player to CS2</a>. Arms Race is a great mode for getting used to how all the weapons work and then you can use aim courses, warmup servers, and deathmatches to prioritize the crucial weapons. Once you feel capable with the main weapons, you can jump into Casual games first to get a better sense of the game.</p>



<p>Whether it’s weapon recoil or the round-to-round economy, the only way to get properly familiarized with all the systems in CS2 is to practice.</p>



<h2 id="h-communicate-clearly">Communicate Clearly</h2>



<p>Regardless if you’re a beginner or a veteran player with 1000+ hours, communication is key to winning in CS2. Communication in CS2 is crucial to coordinating everything: T-side rounds, retakes, buys, and crossfires. If you end up getting killed but you relay no information to your teammates, that round loss is on you.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re interested in playing competitive CS2, then it should be a requirement that you have a mic that you use. In a game like CS2, if you’re playing competitive, text chat and pings just are not good enough. And remember that a key part of communication is positivity. If you’re only using your mic to flame your teammates, you’re part of the problem.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2’s lead developers have revealed that a hacker was able to compromise 66 player accounts recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.404media.co/hacker-broke-into-path-of-exile-2-admin-account-hijacked-wave-of-characters-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">404Media</a>, Path of Exile 2’s lead developers, Jonathan and Mark, recently appeared on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjxzTAcJqAM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">podcast</a> with Ghazzy TV and Darth Microtransaction. During this interview, the duo was asked whether there had been a data breach at the studio. Mark responded that there had been a situation where a Steam account got hacked, which gave the hacker access to an admin account on Path of Exile 2’s website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers revealed that they are now aware of how the hacker took over the admin account, but they do not understand the “full scope” of what occurred then. Mark explained that one of their admin accounts was linked to a Steam account, and the user of this account wasn’t aware of that. The Path of Exile 2 hacker compromised this account through Steam support, and as the user was not using the account, the malicious activity wasn’t noticed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another reason the Path of Exile 2 hacker went unnoticed was a bug in the system. Mark elaborated that whenever an admin account makes changes, the events are logged into an audit log, which can be checked later. However, due to a bug in the system, the password changes were not recorded as events but as notes instead. The hacker was able to delete these notes, which is why the team at GGG could not tell what was wrong when they looked through the accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark confirmed that 66 notes were deleted, which means that the Path of Exile 2 hacker was able to compromise 66 accounts. However, their log history only extends for 30 days, and the hack began 5 days before that, so the full extent is unknown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark stated they would release a report with all the information they could gather in a day or two. They feared GGG’s data would be breached, and the hacker might gain access to the servers, but that wasn’t the case. The development team also added a bunch of more “security stuff,” which Mark admits should have already been in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark also confirmed that the moment the team realised what was going on, they immediately reset the passwords for all admin accounts and deleted all sessions to ensure their safety. Since then, the Path of Exile 2 hacker has not compromised any other accounts.&nbsp;</p>
