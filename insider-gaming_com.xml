<p>Details of the recent Discord data hack continue to paint a darker picture for the company and its users. According to Discord news source Discord Previews, the group taking responsibility for the compromise claims to have an enormous amount of user data, specifically millions of user photos.</p>



<p>In a post on social media <a href="https://x.com/DiscordPreviews/status/1975909634293854364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord Previews</a> said that <strong>‚Äúthe perpetrators of this attack claim to have obtained 1.5 TB of age-verification photos totalling 2,185,151 images.‚Äù</strong> It was added that the stolen data is being used, as with most instances like this, to ‚Äúextort Discord‚Äù.</p>



<p>On October 3, Discord publicly announced that an ‚Äúunauthorized party compromised one of Discord‚Äôs third-party customer service providers.‚Äù This incident, which happened in late September, had the following data impacted:</p>



<ul>
<li>Name, Discord username, email, and other contact details if provided to Discord customer support</li>



<li>Limited billing information, such as payment type, the last four digits of your credit card, and purchase history, if associated with your account</li>



<li>IP addresses</li>



<li>Messages with our customer service agents&nbsp;</li>



<li>Limited corporate data (training materials, internal presentations)</li>
</ul>



<p>Information such as full credit card and CCV numbers, private messages, passwords, and other authentication data wasn‚Äôt involved.</p>



<p>According to Discord‚Äôs own policies, ID submissions are supposed to be deleted after age verification is complete. </p>



<p><strong>‚ÄúDiscord and k-ID do not permanently store personal identity documents or your video selfies,‚Äù </strong>they say. <strong>‚ÄúThe image of your identity document and the ID face match selfie are deleted directly after&nbsp;your age group is confirmed, and the video selfie used for facial age estimation never leaves your device.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Discord for comment on how the company is looking to move forward and why so many age-verification photos were still within the company‚Äôs database. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Bethesda is preparing the world for another epic day. Fallout Day 2025 has been announced, and there are broadcast date details, along with information on its start time, and a sneak peek at what the company could have in store for you all on the S.P.E.C.I.A.L day.</p>



<p>Some people love Christmas Day, others look forward to Thanksgiving. But for long-time Bethesda fans, it probably doesn‚Äôt get better than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-day-broadcast-dates-and-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Day</a>. The 2025 edition is upon us, and last year‚Äôs showcase provided huge updates on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-release-notes-pts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76</a> and new content and DLC.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-day-2025-date-amp-time-announced">Fallout Day 2025 Date &amp; Time Announced</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More content for Fallout 76? We‚Äôll have to see. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bethesda and Fallout fans can look forward to Fallout Day 2025 starting at 1 PM ET on October 23!</p>



<p>News of this comes directly from <a href="https://x.com/Fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout</a>‚Äòs social media: ‚ÄúSave the date! Our annual FalloutDay Broadcast will be streaming live on October 23 at 1 PM ET, with the FalloutforHope post-show immediately following.‚Äù</p>



<p>If you didn‚Äôt know, FalloutforHope is a charity organized by Fallout content creator Kenneth Vigue and aims to ‚Äúoffer hope and relief for children and their families at a time of year when loss is felt and help keenly needed.‚Äù</p>



<p>This is amazing publicity for a good cause, which should round off what is usually a solid show.</p>



<p>While Bethesda hasn‚Äôt explicitly revealed anything in particular that will be shown off or announced during Fallout Day 2025, the company has said the broadcast will feature ‚Äúnews about existing Fallout games‚Äù and news on upcoming Fallout fan events.</p>



<p>Could there be a surprise announcement regarding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-fallout-3-remastered-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 3 Remaster</a> lying in wait? I guess we‚Äôll all have to tune in and find out.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>üìÖ Save the date! Our annual <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FalloutDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FalloutDay</a> Broadcast will be streaming live on October 23 at 1pm ET, with the FalloutforHope post-show immediately following.</p><p>Tune in for the latest news about our existing Fallout games, community celebrations, and upcoming fan events! <a href="https://t.co/hOSbioXena">pic.twitter.com/hOSbioXena</a></p></div>‚Äî Fallout (@Fallout) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1975926711339409781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-xbox-game-pass/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Jurassic World Evolution is roaring onto the scene and, if you fancy yourself as being better at managing prehistoric dinosaurs than John Hammond, it‚Äôs the perfect game for you‚Äîand we‚Äôve got the details on the Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 21</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 makes it a trilogy for Frontier Developments, with major additions being the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-baby-dinosaurs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">baby dinosaurs</a> and modular building‚Äîtwo features that have starred in sister titles Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo.</p>



<p>With the title landing in a packed release schedule for games, it‚Äôs understandable to wonder if a Game Pass subscription can save you some cash, and we‚Äôve got all the details on whether it‚Äôs being added to the service.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-jurassic-world-evolution-3-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Jurassic World Evolution 3 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Soaring onto the scene. Image via Frontier Developments</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Jurassic World Evolution 3 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when the title releases on October 21.</strong></p>



<p>Although we‚Äôre yet to see a full reveal of the titles coming to Game Pass in October, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first wave of releases not covering the entire month</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not expected to be among the other additions coming later this month.</p>



<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not a first-party Xbox title, which would have resulted in automatic inclusion in the service, so any announcement of the title featuring in the catalog would have come well in advance.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-jurassic-world-evolution-3-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Jurassic World Evolution 3 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no news about Jurassic World Evolution 3 coming to Xbox Game Pass in the future, although history suggests it‚Äôs likely to occur at some point.</strong></p>



<p>Jurassic World Evolution 2 is <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass/games#all_all_ultimate_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently available on the service</a>, having featured several times in the past, while the original game has also had extended spells in the subscription service.</p>



<p>Other Frontier Development titles, including Planet Coaster, have also appeared on the service in the past. However, Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster 2 are yet to appear on the service, and it‚Äôs likely they would make an appearance first before Jurassic World Evolution 3‚Äîalthough that‚Äôs not guaranteed.</p>



<p>If we are to see Jurassic World Evolution 3 join the playlist, it will likely be a fairly decent period of time in the future.</p>
