            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on LinkedIn, the current creative director for Rainbow Six Siege, Alex Karpazis, revealed he’s stepping down from the role after the Six Invitational wraps later this month. He indicated that Josh Mills, a ten-year veteran of Ubisoft, will be filling his shoes as creative director going forward.</p>



<p>Last year, Karpazis dished on the future of Rainbow Six Siege as ‘Siege X’, the next generation of the popular tactical shooter, arrived. In 2024, he theorized that the game had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-director-siege-last-forever/">the potential to ‘last forever.’</a></p>







<h2 id="h-big-changes-at-rainbow-six-siege">Big Changes at Rainbow Six Siege</h2>



<p>Ubisoft has put a lot of stock in Rainbow Six Siege over the last few years. It’s one of the company’s flagship shooters, and it has enjoyed a ten-year stint in the sun, growing as Ubisoft’s most important esports title and one of the most valuable games in the industry.</p>



<p>Last year, it underwent an overhaul, taking on the form of ‘Siege X’ and staring down the barrel at some immense evolutions.</p>



<p>Now, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424497469817790464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on LinkedIn</a>, Alex Karpazis has revealed he’s pulling away from the series, stepping down from his role of creative director:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Siege is about to embark on Year 11 after celebrating a historic milestone with the 10th anniversary. I am excited to share with you what the team has been working on at the 2026 Six Invitationals this February and I also want to share with you that this Invitational will be my last as the Creative Director of Siege.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then named his replacement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is with great excitement to announce that Joshua Mills will be taking over as the new Creative Director on Siege! Joshua and I have worked together for many years. Not only is he a great friend, but he has proven himself to be a strong leader and a champion of Siege values. We have been working on this transition of responsibilities for over a year, and I am confident he will lead this game to even greater heights.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Karpazis didn’t indicate what he’s going to do next, and it’s not known yet if he’s leaving Ubisoft entirely.</p>



<p>Joshua Mills is a solid replacement for Karpazis. Last year, during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-y10s1-reveal-prep-phase/">reveal of Y10S1</a> of Rainbow Six Siege, Mills presented the future of the franchise on stage, alongside Karpazis, and got visibly emotional about all the team had accomplished with the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Union Reps Call For CEO Yves Guillemot’s Resignation]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-union-ceo-yves-guillemot-resignation/</link>
            <guid>1424326</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two union representatives are calling for the resignation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> CEO Yves Guillemot.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling share prices</a> to game cancellations to a complete restructuring of the company, Ubisoft has found itself in a precarious situation when it comes to its future. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-union-representatives-call-for-resignation-of-ceo-yves-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Marc Rutschlé and Chakib Mataoui spoke about Ubisoft’s struggles and where the company can go from here.</p>







<p>In short, it starts at the top where a change has to be made.</p>



<p><strong>“It’s his company, at the end of the day,”</strong> Rutschlé said while adding that Guillemot has surrounded himself with “yes men”. <strong>“That was also the issue during the sexual [harassment] scandal in 2020.”</strong></p>



<p>Mataoui then spoke about about Guillemot <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-and-tencent-co-ceos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making his son, Charlie,</a> co-CEO of Vantage Studios. Mataoui believes that the lack of any diversity at the top is what’s keeping the company from making successful games.</p>



<p><strong>“If you just put your white male friends in [those jobs], then you don’t promote any diversity or get any new opinions or ideas,”</strong> Mataoui said. <strong>“We are in a creative job. We need new ideas to come in to [help us] make great new games. But we don’t have that. We don’t have this mindset for creativity.”&nbsp;</strong></p>







<p>Mataoui says it’s a matter of trust within the company. Right now, he says, they don’t trust those in charge to right the ship.</p>



<p>A lot of that, according to the pair, stems from how the company handled the allegations against it in 2020 and beyond. They say that they created <strong>“a workplace where abusers could thrive.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“I think Guillemot should move away at this point,”</strong> Rutschlé said. <strong>“I think the level of hate people have for him [means] he should move on. Then, we could build some sort of trust again.”</strong></p>



<p>Employees at Ubisoft have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-vote-to-strike-against-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already voted to strike</a> against the proposed layoffs at the company. From February 10-12, the France-based unions along with their international counterparts plan to strike.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Fallout 3 Remastered Out Now? Shadowdrop Rumors Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-3-remastered-out-now-shadowdrop-rumors-explained/</link>
            <guid>1424323</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 3 Remastered is one of the most talked-about topics in the gaming space, and it has been ever since it first surfaced as a rumored release <strong>years ago</strong>. Bethesda Game Studios has kept a tight lid on things, and despite some insider claims and circulating whispers, <strong>almost nothing concrete </strong>has ever been confirmed about the game.</p>



<p>But several topics have emerged recently in the space that have us pondering when will Fallout 3 Remastered be released. It feels like it’s on the horizon, and as the release date of the <strong>final episode </strong>of Fallout’s second season drops, fans everywhere are anticipating a Fallout 3 Remastered shadowdrop.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-3-remastered-coming-out">When is Fallout 3 Remastered Coming Out?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, Fallout 3 Remastered <strong>did not </strong>have a release date, but one of the biggest points of debate regarding its seemingly inevitable arrival was drawing to a close.</p>



<p>On the Prime Video website, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-3-remake-not-linked-to-mysterious-countdown/">a countdown has been running</a> for weeks, and while it seems to point to the <strong>end </strong>of the second season of the popular post-apocalyptic television series, many have theorized that it’s actually counting down to the <strong>Fallout 3 Remastered shadowdrop</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s mostly conjecture, but then out came VIRTUOS, a studio that specializes in remasters, to stir the pot:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Welcome back to the Wasteland, vault dwellers! The finale of the second season of Fallout has arrived on Prime Video – catch it today, 3 February 2026 at 6pm PT/ 9pm ET.</p><p>Our team worked on environment art, creating photorealistic landscapes that viewers will encounter throughout… <a href="https://t.co/FHQW4Jxkhr">pic.twitter.com/FHQW4Jxkhr</a></p></div>— Virtuos (@virtuosgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/virtuosgames/status/2018683026184806813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>VIRTUOS worked on the Fallout show in some capacity, but the team is also known for the delivery of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which dropped early in 2025 and received global praise.</p>



<p>For now, it’s another arrow in the quiver of those claiming the Fallout 3 Remastered release is drawing extremely close.</p>



<p>Watch this space, because when that countdown expires, we’ll have more to share… Hopefully.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Epic Games team has published a deep dive into the last year of operations for the <strong>Epic Game Store</strong>. The numbers revealed were pretty staggering, uncovering huge growth for the PC storefront that has swollen to accommodate more than 317 <strong>million </strong>users, including 78 <strong>million </strong>monthly active users (MAUs).</p>



<p>Many know the Epic Games Store because of the slew of free games it gives away on a regular rotation, asking <strong>for nothing </strong>in return from users. In 2025, the team offered 100 free games, resulting in more than <strong>662 million </strong>downloads for an average of $2,316 in ‘redeemed value’ per player.</p>







<h2 id="h-epic-games-epic-numbers">Epic Games, Epic Numbers</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2025-year-in-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games revealed</a> that, in 2025, users on the platform spent a whopping 6.6 billion hours playing games, and that 2.7 billion of that was spent in <strong>third-party </strong>games hosted on the Epic Games Store. In 2025, those dipping into the store to splash some cash spent more than $1.16 billion, representing 6% growth compared to 2024.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that PC gaming is on the up (and has been for years), but numbers like this are a testament to that fact.</p>



<p>From January to December, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> offered 100 free games in the store, and the massive user base claimed them more than 662 million times. What’s even more incredible is that 77% of the free games offered skyrocketed to all-time peak CCU records, and 40% went on to experience a <strong>Steam </strong>CCU lift.</p>



<p>That’s the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-install-epic-games-store-a-step-by-step-guide/">Epic Games Store</a>‘s chief competitor, by the way.</p>



<p>Almost <strong>one billion people </strong>now have an Epic Games account, and the vast majority of those have found their way into the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>According to a graphic released by Epic Games, the top five games on the platform in 2025 by player spend and engagement were:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Wuthering Waves</li>



<li>StarRail</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Genshin Impact</li>
</ul>



<p>The likes of FC 26, GTA 5, Hogwarts Legacy, Borderlands 4, and ARC Raiders came in just behind those top titles.</p>



<p>As the report wrapped, the Epic Games team offered a message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In short: we’re building a fairer, more open marketplace for players and developers. As we move into 2026, we remain committed to empowering developers and delivering the best possible experience for players, wherever they play.</p>

<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 and Divinity devs believe that Morrowind Remaster would perform well if released today, despite former devs’ comments.</p>

He stated that going and playing a 20-year-old game would make players cringe, and the title “would not stand the test of time according to his opinion.

Cromwelp states that he believes there is “a very technically qualified developer out there that would happily remake Morrowind with a modern combat system, and it would sell like f***ing hot cakes.”</p>



<p>The players in the comments seem to agree with Cromwelp’s views, with the overall sentiment that the Morrowind Remaster will be appreciated. However, some have agreed with updating the combat system, while others have disagreed, stating that it was part of the charm.</p>



<p>In the previous interview, Bruce Nesmith also highlighted the fact that Morrowind is so old that he doesn’t know whether the original source code exists anymore, and even if it exists, there is no telling whether the devs will be able to compile it and put it into a new engine like the Oblivion remaster.</p>



<p>Another way to go about it would be to completely remake the title and rebuild it from the ground up. That would make this a project with a four-year development cycle, which poses the question: Why not go and make something new? They could also approach it in a way where they revisit the lands of Morrowind and do a new story.</p>







<p>During the same interview, Nesmith stated that ”&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-skyrim-lead-elder-scrolls-tv-show-not-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a live-action adaptation of The Elder Scrolls&nbsp;probably wouldn’t work</a>.” Additionally, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-is-being-released-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released again late last year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re in the middle of the week (for some), but it’s not time to slack off! If you’re maintaining an NYT Connections streak, guess what you need to do today? That’s right! You need to <strong>just keep going</strong>. With that being said, I’ve got the best NYT Connections hints and tips for you below, including the solutions for today’s NYT Connections puzzle.</p>



<p>Read on to smash this puzzle as quickly as possible today!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-4">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 4)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #969:</p>



<ul>
<li>FRICTION</li>



<li>MAGICAL</li>



<li>HEATED</li>



<li>RIVALRY</li>



<li>BOUT</li>



<li>CONFLICT</li>



<li>LIKE</li>



<li>WAR</li>



<li>NETSCAPE</li>



<li>BINGO</li>



<li>BULLSEYE</li>



<li>DISCORD</li>



<li>LOTTERY</li>



<li>ROUND</li>



<li>APPROX</li>



<li>CRAPS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– When people just can’t get along</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Try your luck</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Inexact estimates</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words that begin with pro basketball squads</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 4:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>

<p>Apex Legends is still rolling out new Seasonal content, with Season 28 celebrating the game’s seventh anniversary. It’s launching on February 10, 2026, and it marks a serious shift in the game’s meta.</p>



<p>Major Legend updates, new destructible environments, and huge changes to Ranked are just the tip of the iceberg for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-ending-support-for-nintendo-switch-1-in-august/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-ending-support-for-nintendo-switch-1-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a> Season. It’s building up to be a game-changing update for the battle royale, and the Early Patch Notes have all the details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Take cover! Image by Respawn Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Plenty of changes are coming to Apex Legends in Season 28, but the headlines are bound to follow the new Hardlight Mesh, as well as Fuze’s reworks.</strong></p>



<p>Hardlight Mesh is a new, destructible window that will be present across existing structures. It provides renewed cover, but it can be destroyed, taking increased damage from certain weapon classes and weapon abilities. Controller class Legends can even rebuild them, adding another tactical layer to navigating the shrinking zone.</p>



<p>Fuze is the legend that takes center stage in Breach, as he’s seen a complete rework to his kit. However, Bloodhound and Catalyst have also seen some buffs, with further details coming on February 6. </p>



<p>For Ranked players out there, you’ll be glad to hear that the Dropship is returning. Respawn wanted to bring the mode into closer parity with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/algs-year-6-roadmap-revealed-by-electronic-arts/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/algs-year-6-roadmap-revealed-by-electronic-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ALGS</a>, but after some experimentation in prior Seasons, felt it was best to bring it back. </p>



<p>Additionally, Bot Royale lobbies are being reworked, some new advanced audio options are becoming available, and Apex will celebrate its seven-year anniversary with a free anniversary rewards track. </p>
