<p>Marvel Rivals players will finally be able to exchange their leftover Chrono Tokens from the battle pass into something more useful. After having to let those extra tokens go to waste earlier, players that complete the Season 1 pass can get rewarded for their extra efforts.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-adds-new-chrono-token-exchange-system">Marvel Rivals Adds New Chrono Token Exchange System</h2>



<p>In the developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> for the upcoming Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 update, the team at NetEase confirmed the new Chrono Token redemption system. Players that own the Luxury battle pass and redeem all the rewards can convert leftover Chrono Tokens into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Units used in the store</a>. “Luxury” just refers to the paid pass itself: you did not need to buy the more expensive version that came with extra Chrono Tokens to be eligible for the new redemption system. Any player who buys the pass and redeems all its awards will be able to convert excess Chrono Tokens into Units.</p>



<p>This issue was a major community talking point during Season 0. The shortened season features a much smaller battle pass that could be completed rather quickly, but players were still completing daily and weekly challenges and earning Chrono Tokens that completely went to waste. With the new system, it should encourage players to continue playing and completing challenges even if they’ve completed the pass.</p>



<p>Potentially, this change could result in a little bit less spending of Lattice at the store. However, that all depends on what the ratio of Chrono Tokens to Units will be, which NetEase hasn’t revealed yet. Marvel Rivals fans should temper their expectations now, as it’s very unlikely that it will even be close to a 1:1 ratio. Season 1.5 officially goes live on February 21.</p>



<p>Inspired to complete the seasonal battle pass now? Let us know down below in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals competitive players have been embracing the triple-strategist meta, but the devs are not letting it dominate the higher ranks thanks to some upcoming nerfs. The new <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1891880359345950886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes</a>, which will go in effect at the start of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cancels-mid-season-rank-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 second half</a>, shouldn’t kill the triple-strategist meta, but will make it less “oppressive.”</p>



<h2 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger-loki-other-strategists-to-receive-ultimate-nerfs">Cloak &amp; Dagger, Loki, Other Strategists to Receive Ultimate Nerfs</h2>



<p>The triple-strategist meta has become very popular in competitive Marvel Rivals play. With three characters providing healing and support, vanguards (tanks) can absorb far more damage, making it hard to slow down attacking teams during convoy games. However, the devs have noted concerns that characters like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki can charge their ultimate abilities really quickly. Because of this, teams running triple-initiator always seem to have an ultimate ready to counter one from an opposing duelist or vanguard.</p>



<p>In the Season 1 mid-season update, the energy costs for “frequent ultimates” like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki’s will be increased. Certain ultimates will also receive targeted nerfs, and the devs have explicitly stated that Cloak &amp; Dagger will be one of the recipients. Further more, some vanguards and duelists such as Venom and Magik will also get a lower energy cost to their ultimates, allowing them to be used more frequently.</p>



<p>These changes will go hand-in-hand with some more announced hero balance changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced survivability of Doctor Strange and Magneto</li>



<li>Buffs to movement-based vanguards (likely Captain America and Venom)</li>



<li>Nerfs to Storm and Moon Knight (reducing buffs from start of Season 1)</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>The game’s lead combat designer said the goal is not to get rid of playstyles like the triple-strategist meta, but only to encourage other playstyles and provide an appropriate amount of counterplay opportunities. These changes will officially go into effect when the second half of Season 1 begins on February 21.</p>

<p>When Shuhei Yoshida stepped down as president of SIE Worldwide Studios to lead indie games in 2019, it wasn’t something he outright chose to do. In fact, Yoshida only had two options: go lead a the new initiative with indies or leave PlayStation altogether.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Yoshida said that despite only having the one option, it was something he was still excited to do.</p>



<p>“Moving from first-party to indies? Well, I had no choice,” Yoshida said. “When Jim [Ryan] asked me to do the indie job, the choice was to do that or leave the company. </p>



<p>“But I felt very strongly about the state of PlayStation and indies. I really wanted to do this. I believed I could do something unique for that purpose.”</p>



<p>Yoshida said that moving from first-party games  to indies was a bigger challenge for him than ultimately leaving the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year after 31 years</a>. He said that he feels lucky that the indie community felt like he could help their growth on PlayStation.</p>



<p>“I became an adviser for some of these companies,” he said. “I’m continuing to work with some of the indie publishers and developers I respect. The transition out of Sony to becoming an independent adviser is less of a change than moving out of first-party.”</p>



<p>Following up on that statement, Yoshida said that will continue to work with indies despite no longer being with PlayStation. He says that he loves working with younger, talented developers who “come up with amazing games every year.”</p>



<p>“Every year when you come to one of these events, a couple of the nominees for game of the year are indies,” he said. “They’re bringing something exciting to the industry. It’s a lot of fun. That’s my dream job, to be able to help them.”</p>



<p>What do you think of Yoshida saying he either took the indie leadership position or left PlayStation in 2019?

<p>The layoffs within the VR space continue to happen. Australian studio Toast Interactive has announced the closure of its office and layoff of the “majority” of its staff.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/toast_int/status/1891644623203754063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the studio’s founders—Toni and Richard Eastes—called the decision “heartbreaking”.</p>



<p>“To everyone in the VR community: we are closing the Toast Interactive office,” they said. “It’s a heartbreaking decision that we never wanted to make. The majority of our talented staff have suffered redundancies, and we will assist where we can with their next journey.”</p>

<p>They added that they are “incredibly grateful and proud of everything the team has accomplished.”</p>



<p>The statement wrapped saying that the company will “continue to improve Richie’s Plank Experience and Max Mustard with a leaner approach.”</p>



<p>A reason for the layoffs and studio closure wasn’t revealed. Nor did they say how many people were part of the layoffs at the company.</p>



<p>Founded in 2016, Toast Interactive has released two VR games: 2016’s Richie’s Plank Experience and 2024’s Max Mustard.</p>
