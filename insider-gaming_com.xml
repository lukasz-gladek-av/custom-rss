High Frame Rate mode will have an unlocked frame rate on monitors with variable refresh rates. The Favour Performance mode from the base PS5 receives a boost on the Pro. Lastly, a PSSR upscale option is available in addition to Temporal Anti-Aliasing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-reduced-puzzle-hints-in-ragnarok-nbsp">Reduced Puzzle Hints in Ragnarok&nbsp;</h2>

<p>In a blog post highlighting everything coming to Warzone and Black Ops 6 in season one, it was revealed that the battle royale platform will have <strong>177 weapons </strong>for players to choose from. The funny thing is that they’re almost entirely useless as a collective, and players will split their time between just a handful of them.</p>



<p>That collection includes a whopping 33 assault rifles and 30 SMGs.</p>



<p>When is enough enough?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-too-many-weps">Too Many Weps</h2>



<p>Warzone needs something of a reset. Over the years, games have fused with the Warzone ecosystem and had their weapons pulled into the fray, but as time has gone on, it has become increasingly ridiculous. Now, with the delivery of season one, Warzone will have 177 weapons to choose from.</p>



<p>That breakdown looks something like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Assault Rifles – 33</li>



<li>Battle Rifles – 10</li>



<li>SMGs – 30</li>



<li>Shotguns – 13</li>



<li>LMGs – 16</li>



<li>Marksman Rifles – 17</li>



<li>Sniper Rifles – 16</li>



<li>Pistols – 17</li>



<li>Launchers – 9</li>



<li>Melee – 15</li>
</ul>



<p>The split includes 60 weapons from Modern Warfare III, 77 from MW II, and 40 from Black Ops 6. At some point, something has to give, because surely keeping up the balancing and maintenance on all 177 weapons is getting a bit tiresome for Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>On November 14, Warzone will also get a new Resurgence map named Area 99, a small-form map inspired by Nuketown. It’s set in the Nevada desert and replicates a top-secret weapons testing facility that was built in the 1950s. It’s almost post-apocalyptic in how it looks, and it should play pretty nicely as well.</p>



<p>Also in the season one update, Urzkistan and Rebirth Island will be returning to the Warzone ecosystem.</p>



<p>Next year, we should have our first return to Verdansk since 2021, which will be a monumental moment for Warzone fans worldwide.</p>



<p>What weapons do you use in Warzone? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>It has been five months since Gears of War: E-Day was revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase, and not much else has been said about the project. Today, The Coalition revealed that both John DiMaggio (Marcus Fenix) and Carlos Ferro (Dom Santiago) will be returning to reprise their characters in E-Day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-glory-days">The Glory Days</h2>



<p>Gears of War surfaced in 2006, and since it dropped, it has spawned several follow-up titles, widely becoming known as one of the best Xbox-exclusive franchises ever created. It has been five years since the last major release in the series, and it could still be a while yet until the next one drops, given that Gears of War: E-Day doesn’t have a release window.</p>



<p>In June, the next game in the Gears of War series was revealed:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC20gLfUHeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a post on social media, the team at The Coalition revealed that both John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their iconic roles in E-Day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On today’s 18th anniversary of Gears of War, we’re proud to share that John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro are reprising their roles as the iconic voices of Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago in Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It wouldn’t have been right to have anyone else voice them – especially Marcus Fenix. That gravelly, foreboding tone has been instantly recognisable for almost twenty years.</p>



<p>E-Day will be a prequel of sorts, taking players back to the beginning of the storyline that saw the Locust rise up and lay siege to the world of Sera. The first Gears of War game was the closest we got to that part of the timeline, but now we’re going even further back.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Gears of War E-Day? Let us know your expectations in the comments.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the Mass Effect franchise is receiving a TV adaptation at Amazon MGM Studios. Daniel Casey from F9: The Fast Saga will write and executive produce the series. Karim Zreik, Ari Arad, and Michael Gamble from EA will join as executive producers. At the moment, the plot details haven’t been revealed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mass Effect TV’s Karim Zreik has experience with Marvel TV shows like Daredevil, The Punisher, and more. Ari Arad has worked on other game adaptations, such as Borderlands, Uncharted and more, along with Marvel Movies like Iron Man.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mass Effect is a third-person shooter franchise set in a distant future, where humans and aliens have colonised the Milky Way. Microsoft Game Studios previously published the game series, which EA later acquired.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main series features four titles: Mass Effect (2007), Mass Effect 2 (2010), Mass Effect 3 (2012) and Mass Effect: Andromeda (2017). The original trilogy follows the journey of Commander Shepard as the character tries to save the galaxy from the hands of the Reapers. Andromeda was unrelated to the trilogy and featured a new setting and fresh characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Mass Effect 5 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-5-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently being developed by trilogy veterans</a>. Also, Mass Effect fans should have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-fans-should-have-low-expectations-for-n7-day-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low expectations for N7 Day 2024</a>.

<p>Black Ops 6 is getting a stacked roadmap for season one. It all starts on November 14, and Treyarch has well and truly outdone itself in preparing a sumptuous content drop. There are seven new weapons and new attachments coming to Black Ops 6 from November 14, with some dropping midway through the season just to stagger things a little.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here is every new weapon coming in Black Ops 6 season one.</p>

<h2 id="h-guns-guns-guns">Guns, Guns, Guns</h2>



<p>There are seven major weapons being added to Black Ops 6 in season one, but they won’t all be easy to obtain. Some will only be available to unlock during special events, while others will be battle pass rewards – so you’ll need to grind a little to get to them.</p>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown of new weapons in Black Ops 6 with a note on how to unlock them:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Krig C </strong>(AR) – Battle Pass unlock</li>



<li><strong>SAUG</strong> (SMG) – Battle Pass unlock</li>



<li><strong>SIRIN 9MM </strong>(SMG) – Event unlock</li>



<li><strong>Power Drill </strong>(Melee) – Event unlock</li>



<li><strong>Maelstrom </strong>(Shotgun) – Event unlock</li>



<li><strong>Cleaver </strong>(Melee) – Mid-season unlock</li>



<li><strong>AMR MOD 4 </strong>(Sniper Rifle) – Mid-season unlock</li>
</ul>



<p>And here are the two new attachments coming to the game:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Buffer Weight Stock</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon’s Breath</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s right, Treyarch is adding <strong>Dragon’s Breath </strong>to Black Ops 6. In case you’ve never heard of that, it’s the incendiary shotgun attachment that turns each shot into a blast of pure heat, lighting your enemies up in a ball of fire.</p>



<p>There are also two new conversion kits coming: XM4 and Kompakt 92 Burst Fire.</p>



<p>Treyarch has promised that there’s more to come as the season unfolds, so this might not be it.</p>

<p>Competitive fans are celebrating as Treyarch announces the impending arrival of Ranked Play in Black Ops 6. It’s bizarre that it’s surfacing before the Call of Duty League’s 2025 season has been formally announced but never mind.</p>



<p>From November 14, Ranked Play will be live in Black Ops 6, giving the more talented players a place to flex their abilities. Let’s just hope it doesn’t end up like Modern Warfare III and have the Top 250 ranks overflowing with cheaters, right?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-will-you-rank">Where Will You Rank?</h2>



<p>Treyarch revealed the roadmap for season one of Black Ops 6 and Warzone, all of which kicks off on November 14.</p>



<p>There’s a stacked content drop coming, including new maps, a fresh Resurgence experience, new modes (including Prop Hunt), and a massive host of new weapons. It’s an exciting time to be a Call of Duty fan, and hopefully, you’ve finished your Dark Matter grind in time to pick up everything that season one has to offer.</p>



<p>It’ll be as typical a competitive system as you could hope for.</p>



<p>It’s good to see that Activision has learned from past mistakes. In previous games, Ranked Play didn’t arrive for several months. Last year’s Call of Duty – Modern Warfare III – was released in October, but Ranked Play didn’t arrive until February. That was an insane gap that left ambitious fans hungry for a bigger challenge, and it harmed the game’s ecosystem to no end.</p>



<p>Will you be diving into Ranked Play when it arrives? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Prop Hunt is a fan favourite mode that offers a change of pace from storming around online and sweating to grind camos. However, it hasn’t been seen in a Call of Duty game since 2020’s Black Ops Cold War.</p>



<p>That’s set to change, though. Treyarch has just revealed that on November 14, when Black Ops 6’s first season goes live, it’ll bring with it a new iteration of Prop Hunt.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-proper-fun">Proper Fun</h2>



<p>Prop Hunt has been in a few Call of Duty games, but it’s by no means a common game mode. In recent years, it appeared in Black Ops 4, Cold War, Modern Warfare, and COD Mobile, but it has been almost four years since it was in a Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>On November 14, Treyarch and Raven Software will deploy the first season of Black Ops 6 and Warzone, and along with that comes Prop Hunt.</p>



<p>In case you’re not familiar, Prop Hunt sees one team assume the role of prop hunters, while the other team becomes a series of ‘props’. That means that they become barrels, crates, lamps, vending machines – anything around a given map that makes sense. They’ll then need to ‘hide’ as a prop while the hunters try to weed them out.</p>



<p>It’s great fun and it’s nothing competitive at all. It’s one of the most casual modes in the Call of Duty ecosystem, and that’s why gamers appreciate it. It makes a nice break from the cacophony of traditional multiplayer modes.</p>



<p>In season one, alongside Prop Hunt, Black Ops 6 players will also get access to ‘Ransack’ and Ranked Play, which is sure to ignite a vibrant competitive ecosystem that’ll last until the next Call of Duty game comes around.</p>

<p>We thought it would happen, and Treyarch is delivering. From November 14, The Replacer will surface in Black Ops 6 as a playable operator, being added to the game in a tracer pack named for the character himself. In the weeks leading up to the launch of Black Ops 6, The Replacer was<strong> everywhere</strong>, and it was the most successful part of Activision’s marketing campaign for the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-replace-your-operators">Replace Your Operators</h2>



<p>On November 14, Black Ops 6’s season one update will go live, introducing new maps, modes, weapons, events, and <strong>much </strong>more. One of the most exciting things about the season one patch is the arrival of The Replacer in playable form.</p>



<p>Given his involvement in the marketing campaign before Black OPs 6 hit the market and his long-time connection to the Black Ops series, he’ll likely be a fan-favourite tracer pack purchase as soon as the first season drops.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that he’s being added within a tracer pack bundle, so he won’t be a unique operator. Instead, he’ll <strong>replace </strong>an existing one as a playable skin. So, he’s technically an operator, but kind of isn’t. Similarly, midway through the season, a bizarre, neon-fuelled character named Brightmare will be added, also to replace an existing operator.</p>



<p>The only new operators this season will be Sev (Tier 100) and Goliath (Blackcell).</p>



<p>Black Ops 6’s season one update introduces a huge amount of content, from the new Area 99 resurgence map in Warzone to Prop Hunt in multiplayer. It’s a stacked roadmap for sure.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the first season of Black Ops 6?</p>
