<p>MultiVersus is coming to an end. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-season-5-end-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors began to circulate</a> on Thursday that the game could wrap up after Season 5, it’s been announced that MultiVersus is shutting down.</p>



<p>In a post on social media and <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, Warner Bros. Games and Player First Games announced that Season 5 “will serve as the final update for MultiVersus”. The season will run from February 4-May 30. After that day, the game will be taken offline with the game only playable in an offline state.</p>



<p>“At that point, there will be an option to play&nbsp;MultiVersus offline via the local gameplay mode, either solo against A.I. opponents or with up to three friends,” the blog post reads. “To do this, you’ll need to install/download the latest version of the game and log in during Season 5, any time between February 4 at 9 a.m. PST and May 30 at 9 a.m. PST. </p>



<p>“After logging in, a local save file will be automatically created connected to your PlayStation Network, Microsoft Store, Steam, or Epic Games Store account, allowing you to enjoy the game offline with all earned and purchased content moving forward.​”</p>



<p>Starting today (January 31) real-money transactions will no longer be available in the game. Everything, including the two new characters—Aquaman and Lola Bunny—will be unlockable by playing the game. Lastly, once Season 5 ends on May 30, the game will no longer be able to be downloaded from any marketplace.</p>



<p>As far as the future of developer Player First Games is concerned, that’s currently unknown. Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the studio</a> in July 2024.</p>



<p>“This decision was not made lightly,” the developers said. “All of us on the Player First Games and&nbsp;Warner Bros&nbsp;Games teams have put our heart and soul into MultiVersus, creating a unique social and cooperative experience from the ground up that brings together a variety of popular characters and worlds.</p>



<p>“We are very proud of the game we have built and are incredibly thankful for the support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey. Your passion and enthusiasm have been unmatched.”</p>

<p>One of the worst-kept secrets is out in the open—Forza Horizon 5 is coming to the PS5. We know its release period, and the developer has already discussed the game’s release time details and brand-new content on the way.</p>



<p>The Xbox and PlayStation partnership continues to blow minds in 2025. The two companies have waged war for two decades across numerous generations of Xbox and PlayStation consoles. But the tides have turned in the last few years. We’re seeing more Xbox exclusives and Microsoft-owned titles come to the PS5.</p>



<p>Halo is rumored to be coming to PlayStation, as are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War and Hellblade</a>. One title we can tick off though is Forza Horizon 5. The Horizon series (and Forza Motorsport) have battled against PlayStation’s Gran Turismo for years, but now the racer has turned a corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-forza-horizon-5-coming-to-ps5">Is Forza Horizon 5 Coming to PS5?</h2>

<p><strong>Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PlayStation 5 and it marks the first time a Forza title has ever been released on a PlayStation console.</strong></p>



<p>We thought the official announcement was coming in 2024, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5 PS5 Release was apparently delayed</a>. The news finally arrived on January 30 to say <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5 is on its way to PS5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-release-period">Forza Horizon 5 Release Period</h2>



<p><strong>Spring 2025 is the release period for Forza Horizon on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>The season of Spring is considered <strong>March, April, and May</strong>, meaning Forza Horizon 5 isn’t far away. I can hear the tires screeching in the distance it’s that close. As the weeks fly by faster than a Lamborghini, we’re sure to get a more accurate release date for you to write down in your diary.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we learn the latest on Forza Horizon 5’s release date. </p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-forza-horizon-5-s-release-times">Do we Know Forza Horizon 5’s Release Times?</h2>



<p>Official release times haven’t been released yet, but developer Playground Games has said to “<strong>Wishlist Forza Horizon 5 on the PlayStation Store&nbsp;today to stay informed about updates and release times.</strong>“</p>



<p>This is significant because it makes me believe we may be getting different release times everywhere. Again, stay tuned for updates on Forza Horizon 5’s release time for PS5.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-horizon-realms-content">Forza Horizon 5 Horizon Realms Content</h2>



<p><strong>Horizon Realms is a completely new piece of content for Forza Horizon 5, and it’s “a curated collection of some of the community’s favorite previously released Evolving Worlds.”</strong></p>



<p>That’s not all though as the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer is also promising</a> “<strong>other surprises</strong>” too. The content is releasing alongside all “the same content as the Xbox and PC releases of the game.” PlayStation 5 players have a lot of gameplay to look forward to and a lot of rubber to burn!</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve primarily been a PlayStation and occasional Nintendo fan in my life, making Forza Horizon 5 my first foray into Forza. How about you? Is this going to be a debut drive? Or have you already racked up a ton of mileage?</p>



<p>We have even more rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-playstation-exclusives-are-coming-to-xbox-next-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox games coming to PlayStation</a>, and we already know other Xbox and Bethesda games are PS5-bound: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-be-on-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones</a>.</p>
