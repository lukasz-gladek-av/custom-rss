<p>According to a <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> report, news that the first script for the Split Fiction movie has reached the game’s director comes from an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTw4CbhDZZT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram post</a> by Moviezine. The post features a video in which Josef Fares states that he has received the “first version of the script.” However, he added that he will believe it when he sees it, due to “so much talk in Hollywood”. Fares also said that he had a conversation with the Euphoria star, and “she seems pretty chill” and “hyped for the movie”. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Split Fiction is a co-op title from the creators of It Takes Two, Hazelight Studios. It features the tale of two writers who are trapped in the adventures of each other’s stories. One of the writers specialises in fantasy stories and the other in sci-fi, and they have been hooked into a machine that steals their ideas.
