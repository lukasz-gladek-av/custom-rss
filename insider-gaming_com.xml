<p>ARC Raiders players everywhere have been asking for a function to reset their skill trees since the game came out. Mostly, it was because they were working towards Security Breach before Embark Studios nerfed the ability, leaving them with stacks of skill points in a path they might not have otherwise picked.</p>



<p>Following the recent rollout of the Cold Snap update, Embark Studios has finally implemented a function that allows users to reset the skill points, but it comes with a fairly hefty cost.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-reset-your-skills-in-arc-raiders">How to Reset Your Skills in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you navigate to your Raider menu and check out your skills screen, you’ll see that there’s now a function to reset the paths you’ve chosen. With the press of a button, you can pull back all your assignments and restructure your build as you see fit, all without carrying out an Expedition.</p>



<p>This change comes with a sizeable cost.</p>



<p>You’ll need to pay 2,000 credits <strong>per skill</strong> to withdraw your entire build. Given that you can assign a maximum of 75 skill points in ARC Raiders, it’ll cost you 150,000 credits to respec your entire character.</p>



<p>At this point, that’s a drop in the water for some players. But for the more casual players or those who perhaps don’t loot as well as the average ARC Raiders fan, it’s a sizeable stack of coin.</p>



<p>But it now means that you can wipe your entire skill selection and build something entirely new, which is great news for anyone chasing the now-nerfed Security Breach perk. Once upon a time, it was the most broken perk in the game, but following a change weeks ago, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-nerf-security-breach-perk/">made much weaker</a> by Embark Studios in a move to balance the skill tree.</p>







<p>Let us know on the Insider Gaming Discord server if you <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">plan to wipe your skills in ARC Raiders</a>.</p>

<p>A Call of Duty leaker is making some big claims about the future of the franchise, specifically the 2027 version of the annual franchise.</p>



<p>According to TheGhostOfHope, developer Sledgehammer Games is planning some bigger changes for the game. Mainly in terms of what possible will be removed.</p>







<p><a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2000945365055394031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope claims</a> that Zombies is <strong>“currently still not planned to return”</strong> in the game. They also say that <strong>“omnimovement with no tac sprint is currently planned for the game.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding removing Zombies, TheGhostOfHope speculated about the possible reason.</p>



<p><strong>“I think the idea is that they don’t want to burn out Treyarch who is gonna come off [two] back-to-back games and they don’t want to have too much zombies content overall so that way 2028 is more hype,”</strong> they said while adding that they believe the omnimovement will be the Black Ops 6 version without the tactical spring and wall jump.</p>



<p>As far as what could be returning, it was said that Get High is coming back and that Pick 10 being brought back is <strong>“a big discussion happening.”</strong></p>



<p>As with any rumor or claim, please take the information with a grain of salt until it is either verified by Insider Gaming or confirmed by Activision or Sledgehammer Games. It’s also worth noting that TheGhostOfHope’s last claim regarding next year’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/infinity-ward-debunk-recent-modern-warfare-4-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared to be debunked</a> developer Infinity Ward. Of course, until the game is announced next year, everything is purely speculative.</p>

<p>Reanimal is officially ready for launch. Publisher THQ Nordic has announced that the upcoming horror game has gone gold two months ahead of its February release.</p>



<p>The announcement came via a media release and social media post on Tuesday.</p>







<p><strong>“Co-op horror adventure Reanimal from Tarsier Studios, the creators of Little Nightmares I and II, has officially gone gold,” </strong>the publisher said. <strong>“THQ Nordic has confirmed that the game is now complete and on track for a cross-platform launch on Nintendo Switch 2™, PC, PlayStation®5, and Xbox Series X|S on Friday, February 13th, 2026!”</strong></p>



<p>Reanimal going gold signals that, aside from anything major happening, the game won’t be delayed past it’s launch date. Obviously, anything can happen so it’s not a 0% chance, but it’s a bet worth making.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, Reanimal will be <a href="https://reanimal.thqnordic.com/#order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available on current gen consoles and PC</a>. The <strong>standard edition of the game retails for $39.99</strong>. If you want a bit more, you can pick up the <strong>Digital Deluxe version for $59.99</strong>, which comes with a copy of the game, its season pass for all three chapters of DLC, and exclusive Foxhead and Muttonhead masks. </p>







<p>Want even more, the <strong>$199.99 Collector’s Edition</strong> comes with everything in the Digital Deluxe edition of the game along with the pre-order DLC, a PVC Pig Statue, metal key ring, a map poster, an 80-page hardcover artbook, three sticker sheets and a “high-quality collector’s box”.</p>



<p>If you aren’t sure if Reanimal is a game for you, there is a demo available now to download.</p>
