<p>Warhorse Studios has just announced that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will be released one week earlier than planned. It’ll now be launching worldwide on February 4, 2025. This news follows a delay that pushed the game back into 2025.</p>



<p>On social media, the news was announced by the team in conjunction with a promise that ‘more exciting news’ is coming in the following days. This all kicks off with a new story trailer that’s being released tomorrow.</p>

<h2 id="h-audentes-fortuna-iuvat">Audentes Fortuna Iuvat</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be one hell of an RPG. It’s riddled with historical accuracy and it’s one of the most faithful representations of the setting I’ve ever seen. I got hands-on with the game during Gamescom and loved every second I played.</p>



<p>It helps that I’m a massive fan of the first game, which recently hit a new milestone after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/">selling eight million copies</a> since launching in 2018.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, I was fortunate enough to catch up with Tom McKay, who plays the series’ protagonist, Henry of Skalitz:</p>

<p>BioWare has announced that the Character Creator for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is getting a standalone release. The announcement was <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/da-day-2024?utm_campaign=datv_pub_ww_ic_soco_ltre_character-creator-blog&amp;utm_source=linktree&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=82705&amp;ts=1733330768641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">part of the company’s</a> Dragon Age Day 2024 message to players.</p>



<p>Coming to all platforms, the Character Creator will be completely free, and allow players to build characters before ever buying or loading the game up for the first time. The app allows players to create and then transfer their character over to the game as long as it’s on the same platform. That means you can’t create a character on PC and expect to bring them over to PS5 or Xbox Series.</p>



<p>“There’s no time limit on the Character Creator; we know crafting the perfect protagonist can take hours,” BioWare said.</p>



<p>In addition to the Character Creator, BioWare announced that players can get the get the armor, body paint, and nose blood smear of Hawke, the protagonist of Dragon Age II.</p>



<p>“These cosmetics will be permanently available and can be found in the Lighthouse after downloading Patch 4 and completing the mission ‘The Singing Blade’,” the studio said.</p>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is currently available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. The Character Creator is available now, as well. </p>

<p>Ubisoft has spent a long time working on XDefiant, and now it’s reportedly shutting down—according to reports. The 2024 shooter is seen as a big rival to Call of Duty, so let’s find out everything we know about XDefiant’s future, and if you need to play for big changes.</p>



<p>The online first-person shooter landscape is primarily dominated by the same faces. When you narrow it down to military shooters though, the pool shortens more so. Battlefield 2042 notoriously launched to negative reception, and many contemporaries are either hero shooters or third-person titles. XDefiant was supposed to be just that, a defiant stance catering to shooter fans tired of the annual Call of Duty release.</p>



<p>XDefiant’s beta performed well, Ubisoft responded to player feedback as they said they would, and the worldwide launch was hotter than a dinner part with The Cleaners faction. Let’s see if things have gone south since, and what it could mean.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-xdefiant-shutting-down">Is XDefiant Shutting Down?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Now I have to turn my back on you. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>XDefiant is officially shutting down in June 2025, and the shooter is set to receive hugely reduced content updates moving forward.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming first broke the news on Dec. 3, that XDefiant is shutting down for good. The major details revealed, that “a skeleton crew [is] maintaining the title until June 2025,” and that once Season 3 launches, this signals the end of XDefiant’s regular content schedule, instead, the occasional update is expected to follow based on already-made assets and parts. This is in stark contrast to recent reports that XDefiant wouldn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-executive-producer-denies-claim-the-game-will-shut-down-after-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down after Season 4</a>.</p>



<p>Worse still, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot issued a company-wide memo</a> to “pay tribute to the tremendous work done by the XDefiant’s teams,” but discussed downsizing by way of “<strong>The closure of the San Francisco and Osaka studios</strong>, and the <strong>ramp down of the Sydney production site</strong>.”</p>



<p>It’s understood Ubisoft is refunding players for any cosmetic purchases and Founder’s Packs. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-xdefiant-shutting-down">Why is XDefiant Shutting Down?</h2>



<p>According to sources close to the situation, “<strong>Poor player numbers and a lack of player spending</strong>” are the reasons for XDefiant shutting down in 2025.</p>



<p>XDefiant is a free-to-play, live-service title, and as such, it means the shooter’s revenue comes from the voluntary purchases of players. Battle Passes, Skins, and specialist currency are all part of the XDefiant e-commerce system. It appears XDefiant players were not spending enough money on optional cosmetics, leading the shooter to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-fallen-behind-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fall behind expectations.</a>“</p>



<p>It seems bizarre in hindsight, as XDefiant’s debut registered a whopping <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million unique players in under three hours</a>. The numbers skyrocketed to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-8-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight million unique players by the end of its first full week</a>. It wasn’t to be though, as player numbers began to tail off, and XDefiant’s downfall slowly unfolded during the next few months.</p>

<p>Are you sad to see XDefiant hang up its holsters already? Could Ubisoft have done anything differently with the FPS title? Let us know down below.
