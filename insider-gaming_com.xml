<p>Ubisoft is no longer delaying its games. Now it’s delaying earnings reports.</p>



<p>Just minutes before it was scheduled to release it was scheduled to announce its first half earnings for fiscal year 2025-26 (FY26), the company announced that it was postponing its call. </p>







<div><p>In addition to the postponement of the results, Ubisoft announced that it had requested Euronext to halt trading of company shares.</p><p><strong>“Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares and its bonds from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days,”</strong> the company <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2A1sQVfdyeqe6FVBzu564u/1210887eef5e1047803696e934f993f0/Ubisoft_press_release_13_11_2025_EN_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a statement</a>. </p></div>



<p><strong>“Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for more clarification on the delay and trade halting. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-nerf-security-breach-perk/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embark-studios-just-nerfed-arc-raiders%E2%80%99-most-op-perk.1352806/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios rolled out the 1.2.0 update for ARC Raiders today, introducing a new community-wide event, the dawn of a new map, and new ARC enemies to contend with. The team also issued several quality-of-life improvements, tweaks, and bug fixes. They also pushed out a<strong> silent adjustment </strong>to the Security Breach perk, nerfing the heck out of it.</p>



<p>In a move that some fans have questioned, the most OP perk in ARC Raiders has been dialled back. If you were pushing for Security Breach, you might want to now focus your attention elsewhere, as the perk isn’t as good as it was over the last two weeks.</p>







<h2 id="h-security-breach-nerf-explained">Security Breach Nerf Explained</h2>



<p>In a post on the ARC Raiders Discord server, the game’s community lead, Ossen, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We adjusted the security lockers because they were over-providing valuable items</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comment earned a string of emoji-based responses, the most popular of which was the <strong>clown </strong>emoji… Make of that what you will.</p>



<p>For most, this is a good move from Embark Studios, as it helps to tone down the overpowered perk that ‘chads’ were abusing to stack their stashes to the rafters with good equipment. It was also diluting the game’s experience, as the meta was to do night runs on maps like Buried City, soaking up loot routes and cracking open endless security lockers.</p>



<p>This change came in addition to some more positive ones, like the fact that desync has now been addressed, and you shouldn’t feel like you’ve been hit even though you dove behind cover. It also means that fighting ARC enemies will feel more accurate and reliable, not strangely disconnected and laggy.</p>







<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-1-2-0-update-full-patch-notes/">1.2.0 update</a> in ARC Raiders is live now on all platforms, and if you want to get access to the new map, you’ll need to work as a collective and provide enough resources to fuel the project.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re enjoying ARC Raiders.</p>
