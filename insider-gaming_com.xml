<p>Team Vitality are the champions of IEM Katowice 2025, after upsetting top-ranked Team Spirit in a surprising 3-0 fashion in the grand final. Vitality claims their first big trophy since IEM Cologne 2024, and their first since signing former FaZe star Robin “ropz” Kool.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-spirit-fails-to-defend-katowice-title">Spirit Fails to Defend Katowice Title</h2>



<p>Vitality came out firing, stealing away Spirit’s first map pick of Dust2. Robin “ropz” Kool had easily his best map since joining the team, notching 26 kills against only 9 deaths, and dominating on the T-side in the second half. On Nuke, it was the legend Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut who stepped up, delivering 26 kills against only 6 deaths, while rarely using the AWP he was once synonymous with.</p>



<p>On Mirage, Vitality went into half-time with the lead for a third straight map. Spirit lost their sixth pistol round to kick off the second half, having failed to win a single pistol round all series. Trailing 11-4 and with their backs against the wall, Spirit finally showed some life in the second half, stringing together 7 straight rounds to tie it. Vitality finally got to 12 thanks to Shahar “flameZ” Shushan, and he opened the kills again in the pivotal final round of regulation to secure the map, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/matches/2378917/vitality-vs-spirit-iem-katowice-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the series</a>, and the trophy.</p>



<p>For Vitality, this represents the first time that the organization has lifted the trophy in Katowice in more than half a dozen tries. The team’s leader Dan “apEX” Madesclaire had never won in Katowice in the tournament’s 11 year history until today. ZywOo also ties the legendary Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev for most tournament MVP awards with 21.</p>



<p>Is Vitality the new favorite to lift the trophy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the next Major</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-should-battlefield-6-take-from-battlefield-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In February 2025, Electronic Arts divulged the future of the Battlefield franchise alongside a reveal of ‘Battlefield Labs’. This all-new testing initiative promised to invite fans into the fold to have them trial Battlefield products long before they are released to the open market.</p>



<p>It was also when we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-learned-from-the-new-battlefield-game-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our first look at Battlefield 6</a> – or whatever it’ll end up being named. It got me thinking about the games that came before, more particularly <strong>Battlefield 5, </strong>which I often consider to be the last <strong>good </strong>Battlefield game. </p>



<p>Don’t hate me.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s what I think Battlefield <strong>6 </strong>should take from Battlefield <strong>5</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-battlefield-6-need-to-have">What Does Battlefield 6 Need To Have?</h2>



<p>There are many features and mechanics unique to Battlefield 5 (or defined by Battlefield 5) that I feel would be right at home in Battlefield 6 – not that the title or numbering has been confirmed, of course.</p>



<p>Here they are.</p>



<h3 id="h-battle-royale">Battle Royale</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Let’s get that controversial one out of the way right off the bat. I think Firestorm was a fantastic addition to Battlefield 5 but it was underappreciated and poorly utilised. It dropped in May 2019, just months after Respawn Entertainment released Apex Legends and around a year before Call of Duty Warzone hit the market.</p>



<p>It was a tough time for the competition in the battle royale space, but Firestorm had potential – and guess who developed it? Criterion Games, in conjunction with EA’s DICE. Both of these studios are working on the next Battlefield game, and the rumours are that Battlefield 6 <strong>will feature </strong>a battle royale.</p>







<h3 id="h-destruction-mechanics">Destruction Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 5’s destruction mechanics were monumental, and through artillery, missiles, bombs, tanks, planes, and everything else in between, users could raze the entire map to the ground. Entire villages would fall under the weight of devastating explosions, tanks could crawl through buildings, and even now, the sound of a V2 bomb buzzing over fills me with impending dread.</p>



<p>There was a huge backstep in Battlefield 2042 that stripped almost every ounce of destruction from the game. It was a defining feature of the Battlefield franchise, and it was last done best in Battlefield 5. From what we saw in the first pre-alpha trailer for Battlefield 6, the game <strong>will feature </strong>intense destruction mechanics.</p>



<h3 id="h-con-struction-mechanics"><em>Con</em>struction Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s a fantastic ability written almost into the background of Battlefield 5, and it allows players to whip out a toolbox and start building defences around their objectives. It’s a neat little feature that adds extra immersion to an already immersive title, and it allows players to get a little more strategic when defending a flag or a building.</p>



<p>It’s a basic thing – players can click or hold a button to lay down sandbags, dig trenches, reinforce windows, set up tank traps, or roll out walls of razor wire. It can turn a simple farmhouse into a well-defended objective in just a few minutes, and I believe that if expanded upon, it could be a fantastic returning feature in Battlefield 6.</p>







<h3 id="h-multi-dimensional-campaign">Multi-Dimensional Campaign</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 5 was the last game in the series to have a core campaign, which was built around the typical model – various theatres of war around the world during a major conflict. Battlefield 5’s campaign was cinematic and emotional, and it revealed some of the more ‘secret stories’ of the Second World War, much like Battlefield 1 exposed subtones present in World War I. </p>



<p>When Battlefield 2042 debuted without a campaign, many millions of players believed the game was nursing a gigantic hole front and centre. It has been promised that Battlefield 6 will have a solid campaign like the one of days gone by, but the proof will be in the pudding.</p>







<h3 id="h-another-realistic-theatre-of-war">Another Realistic Theatre of War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It wasn’t just the campaign that was gritty and raw – it was the entire war itself. From map to map, players experienced the brutality and totality of the Second World War, travelling from Africa to France and from Norway to Japan. In Battlefield 2042, the lack of ‘realism’ was an issue, as up until that point, Battlefield had more or less become synonymous with the realistic portrayal of war.</p>



<p>With the introduction of robot dogs, fantastical wing suits, instant zip-lines, and all manner of futuristic technology, Battlefield 2042 – for a while – didn’t feel like Battlefield at all. If Battlefield 6 is going to succeed, I’d like to suggest that it’ll be because it’s rooted in realism, whether that be modern combat or another revisiting of an older conflict.</p>



<p>The early trailer released to showcase pre-alpha gameplay of Battlefield 6 led us to believe that it’ll be set in a present-day theatre of war, which is good.</p>







<h3 id="h-squads-soldiers-and-platoons">Squads, Soldiers, and Platoons</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Battlefield 5 was much better for the player who <strong>loved </strong>Battlefield. It allowed them to form ‘Platoons’, it encouraged better squad-based play and saw players fill leadership roles, and it didn’t need to rely on Specialists (all with unique abilities, like a ‘hero shooter’) to fill out the ranks.</p>



<p>Many of these elements didn’t port over to Battlefield 2042, and it felt for a while like EA had stripped the community aspects from the series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I Wish Games Still Had Interesting Companion Apps]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wish-games-still-had-companion-apps/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-wish-games-still-had-interesting-companion-apps.1104405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wish-games-still-had-companion-apps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I had a burst of nostalgia the other day. I was playing Dying Light to celebrate the game’s 10th anniversary and my mind flicked back to when the game was fresh on the market. One of my fondest memories of Dying Light is the game’s super helpful <strong>companion app</strong>, which allowed users to send scouts on virtual missions, which they’d claim rewards for later when they played the base game.</p>



<p>It had a few more features besides that, and it was a neat way to stay connected, still experience Dying Light’s universe on the go, and earn rewards without touching the game itself. It was discontinued a couple of years ago, but playing Dying Light got me thinking about the best companion apps for games that have long since disappeared.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beyond-the-numbers">Beyond The Numbers</h2>



<p>I’m not just talking about <strong>stat trackers</strong>, by the way – they’re a dime a dozen. Everything from League of Legends to World of Warcraft, and from EA FC to Destiny has a companion app, most of which is focused on tracking events, managing minor inventory mechanics, accessing account information, and sending messages in-game.</p>



<p>I miss when the best companion apps felt like games themselves – miniature versions of a top-tier title that would allow you to truly stay connected long after you’d logged off.</p>



<p>Dying Light’s companion app was a perfect example of this.</p>



<p>Players could utilise the app to run missions, arrange scouts to travel to the most dangerous parts of the game’s world, and progress through a chain of missions with progressively better rewards. They’d need to make sure they were picking the right runner for the job, and the rewards they scavenged could be collected later in the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light had a brilliant companion app</figcaption></figure>







<p>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag had a similar mechanic.</p>



<p>The companion app for Black Flag was stellar, allowing users to control a full-fledged fleet of ships, sending them around the world on a multitude of missions. It was discontinued in 2015, but while it was online, it offered another angle to experience the pirating adventures found at the heart of this monumental Assassin’s Creed title.</p>



<p>It was inherently linked to the game, too. As you played Black Flag and added ships to your fleet, you could command those ships in real time through the companion app. Then, you could log into the game later on and reap the rewards of those missions.</p>



<p>GTA 5’s ‘iFruit’ app was also quite good. It featured mini-games that the player could use to train Chop, an in-game dog that belonged to Franklin Clinton, one of the game’s protagonists. It was entertaining enough, featuring three basic games and some additional features like car customisation and a stat tracker.</p>



<p>Sadly, it was discontinued in 2022, almost a decade after it surfaced alongside GTA 5. Will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> have another version, considering it’s very social media-heavy?</p>



<h2 id="h-run-of-the-mill">Run of the Mill</h2>



<p>Most games that have a companion app typically offer a no-frills experience that might feature a codex, an interactive map, or some kind of news feed mechanic. The best example of this is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-set-another-new-all-time-peak-record-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, which features just that. The map is nice enough, but it’s the most common thing for companion apps to feature.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Function over form, that’s for sure</figcaption></figure>







<p>How about if Red Dead Online had a companion app through which you could send bandits or buddies on missions while you were offline, allowing them to gather resources and cash for you to use when you next played? I mean, RDO is another microtransaction-packed game, so it’s unlikely that would happen – Rockstar wants you to purchase those gold bars.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, some companion apps without engaging features like this are still plenty helpful. There’s a nice <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Tarkov</a> companion app <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/treestn-tarkov_companion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Overwolf</a> with interactive maps, quest trackers, and guides for weapon presets and information on the latest updates. In a game that’s as complex as Tarkov, that’s a <strong>very welcome </strong>addition.</p>



<p>But imagine if you could use a companion app to ‘automatically’ run ‘Scav’ raids, having a timer count down at the end of which you’d see the loot secured by a Scav – if they were successful. It’d be a spin-wheel mechanic that would have a different result every time, and I could see Battlestate Games charging for ‘extra Scavs’, but I think it’d be a hit.</p>



<p>Nobody likes running Scavs <strong>really</strong>, so if you confine them to a companion app, allowing players to run them while in a regular PMC raid, everyone is happy.</p>



<p>I don’t know if I’m being hit with nostalgia or if there’s a genuine demand out there for better, more immersive companion apps.</p>



<p>It’s probably just me…</p>



<p>Let me know if there’s a particular app you enjoy using on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In just a couple of days, players worldwide will get their hands on the long-awaited release of Civilization 7 (stylised as Civilization VII). It has been almost a decade since the last major release in the Civ series, and fans are understandably very excited for the chance to drive empires forward once again.</p>



<p>Recently, an entirely new perspective on the Civilization series was revealed – a <strong>VR version </strong>of Civ 7. It’s being developed by PlaySide Studios and 2K in collaboration with Firaxis and it’s coming to Meta Quest 3 and 3S in the spring.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-truly-immersive">Truly Immersive</h2>



<p>Firaxis, PlaySide, and 2K worked to release a new trailer for Civilization 7, this one surprisingly showcasing a never-before-seen VR version of the game:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Sid Meier's Civilization VII - VR Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lavuwKvZki8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The world of VR has gone from strength to strength of late. The technology is sharpening, price points are dropping slightly, and the library of games and apps available on the best headsets is forever expanding. It’s still a tentative area for some, but some developers are investing much more in the technology, which is great for those who love the immersion.</p>



<p>This is the first time in history that a Civilization game has been available on VR platforms, and it’s coming <strong>exclusively </strong>to Meta Quest 3 and 3S – which isn’t an unheard of thing these days. These headsets dominate the market, and as a Quest 3 owner, I can say that they’re generally the cream of the crop.</p>



<p>The trailer shows exactly how this’ll work, with a unique UI and configuration created solely for VR users to enjoy the relatively complex experience that Civilization 7 promises to offer. Given how long the average game of Civ 7 lasts, it could be pretty exhausting and you might need an external battery on your headset, but those are choices for you to make.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll pick up Civilization 7 on Meta Quest? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Sony has given an actual reason for the PlayStation Network (PSN) outage that brought the service down for roughly 20 hours on Friday and Saturday. </p>



<p>In a post late Saturday night on <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the company blamed the outage on an “operational issue”. Specifics on the issue weren’t given nor was anything said about preventing another issue. However, PlayStation  did, once again, apologize for what happened.</p>



<p>“Network services have fully recovered from an operational issue,” they said. “We apologize for the inconvenience and thank the community for their patience.”</p>

<p>As a make good for nearly a full day of service being lost, PlayStation is giving all PlayStation Plus members five extra days. The extension will automatically be added to all plans.</p>



<p>The PSN <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally went down</a> on Friday, February 7 around 6pm ET. The outage impacted users across the globe, taking down the ability to sign in, play online, and even access the PlayStation Store. It started to come back around 3:40PM ET on Saturday, February 8.</p>



<p>As the service was offline, the company didn’t provide any updates to players aside from an acknowledgement of PSN being offline hours after it went down. The next update came to state that service was restored. </p>



<p>What do you think about the reason PlayStation gave for the PSN outage? What about receiving five days of PlayStation Plus for the troubles?

<p>The PlayStation Network is back online after being down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for nearly 20 hours</a>. Now, shortly after service was fully restored, PlayStation has issued a (very) brief update on the status of the network via social media.</p>



<p>“PSN has been restored,” the <a href="https://x.com/askplaystation/status/1888376843255824475?s=46&amp;t=hX1f8t9VMLBATttRMgQR3A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post said</a>. “You should be able to access online features without any problems now. </p>



<p>“Sorry for the inconvenience!”</p>



<p>The company also pointed people to the official PlayStation Network <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status page</a> where it lists all services as currently functioning.</p>



<h6 id="h-new-episode-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">NEW EPISODE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Aside from the apology, nothing else has been said by PlayStation. There has been no mention of what caused the outage in the first place. In fact, it was the first official statement from Sony since they made a post on Friday night stating that it was  “aware some users” were having problems. In between the post acknowledging the problem and the service being restored, the only other thing PlayStation posted was <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888316952004673561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">how to add M.2 storage</a> to the console.</p>



<p>PlayStation Network originally went down on Friday night around 6pm ET. The outage impacted users across the globe, taking down the ability to sign in, play online, and even access the PlayStation Store.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to PlayStation in an attempt to get an update as to what caused the PlayStation Network to go offline this weekend. Should a response be received—or an more in-depth statement be made in an official capacity—it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-patch-10-02-notes-all-changes-and-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT</a> scriptwriters for VCT Americas brought back a favorite from last season. Sentinels have qualified for the first Masters event of the year after a hot start at Kickoff, thanks to a masterful performance from Jordan “Zellsis” Montemurro in the lower final versus MIBR.</p>



<p>Known to some fans as the “vibes merchant” or just the Sentinels’ bundle salesman, Zellsis had his best individual series performance in years against MIBR. After the series in which he got just his second ace in VCT, the former Sentinels sub turned superstar spoke to Insider Gaming on his otherworldly performance, his progression as an emotional leader, and the things the team still needs to improve.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</em></p>



<p><strong>IG: A stupendous series from you against MIBR. What was the key to your performance?</strong></p>



<p>Zellsis: It has to be my teammates. Usually I’m the one that has to come in and keep everyone’s mood up, lift the energy, everything like that. And I kind of did not do that [today], I was just mellow, I kept my vibes neutral and focused on the game, instead of bashing my head against the wall like I usually do to keep emotions up.</p>



<p>My teammates started off the series with really good energy, so it made my job a little bit easier. When we got to Split though, I got a bit more amped because we loss a very intense [game of] Pearl, so I wanted us to get a bit more hype. But my teammates are insane as well; if I had brought the mood, one of them would have picked up the shooting.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Speaking of that Pearl, we saw a little bit of frustration from you after that knife from Aspas, and then some disappointed faces from the team after the map ended. How did you and the team recover after those moments?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, on the 1v2 I kind of raged. I was just very into the series, I did not want to lose. There were a lot of rounds that should have gone our way, and a lot of rounds where I messed up some key things. I knew one guy was Pit and one was Art, and I just whiffed and got very frustrated in the heat of the moment.</p>

<p>The MVP of vibes was N4RRATE. He was phenomenal today in keeping the vibes up, micro calling for people, and calling out mistakes. I think that’s a big thing that we’re starting to learn on stage together. We need to be calling each other out more when shit goes wrong. None of us are babies, we can fix it in the moment, and if you can’t, then you obviously don’t want to win.</p>



<p><strong>IG: You spoke the other day about your emotional maturity improving and “clicking” over these past couple years. Are there other players or coaches that helped you get better?</strong></p>



<p>All my coaches have always looked at me to be the leader on all my teams from Immi on Version1, to mCe on Cloud9, to now kaplan on Sentinels. They heavily rely on me being the emotional leader for everyone. People who know me know I’m very honest, I’m very brute, and I don’t beat around the bush. But I never try to put someone down when I’m saying something, it’s all about getting better and improving and making sure we’re in the right spot to win.</p>



<p>On C9, when vanity and yay left, mCe forced me to be more of a leader. When we got runi and jakee, we needed a huge voice on that C9 roster. We had the talent, we just didn’t have a lot of voices, we didn’t have a lot of decisive decision-making. And whether I wanted it to be me or not, mCe forced me into that. We had a lot of one-on-ones [together], and it kind of just spiraled me into always having to be like that now. And I’m not complaining, it’s made me a better player overall and a more complete player overall. I can control my emotions more. I can control when I talk about mistakes more and everything like that.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Do you feel your leadership role has increased this year after the departures of Sacy and TenZ?</strong></p>



<p>I definitely think we lack a little bit in high pressure mid-rounding situations. Sacy didn’t really do a lot of micro mid-rounding, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-valorant-champions-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his blueprint of playing the game was fundamentally the right way to play</a> the game. And that’s what he would kind of bring: “Okay, they’re doing this, we need to be doing this.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He just plays culturally differently than a lot of Americas teams. [NA teams] are always rushing, taking ones, whereas I feel like Brazilian teams always played fundamentally sound and he’s always played like that. So he brought that to this team when he played with us. I think with this team, we’re definitely missing a little bit of that discipline that he brought us. But we’re working on it.</p>



<p><strong>IG: What does it say about this team to be able to rebound from such a lopsided loss to G2 and qualify for Masters Bangkok?</strong></p>



<p>I think people need to remember we haven’t been a team [with this roster] that long. We’ve changed roles, we’ve changed so much to fit this team. And we’re still so young, I mean I’m 26 turning 27, John’s 26 turning 27. And then the drop off is insane: N4RRATE’s 22, bang is 20, and zekken is 19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s so much more re: mental and maturity to work on, but we all want to win and we work hard. I can confidently say this team is one of the hardest working teams I’ve ever been on, from the coaching staff to the players.</p>



<p>Can Zellsis and Sentinels claim another trophy this year? Let us know down below or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
