<p>Housemarque, the developers behind Returnal, have announced their next game: Saros. The game was announced at the end of PlayStation’s State of Play event on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Launching in 2026 on PlayStation 5—no other platforms were mentioned—, Saros starts Rahul Kohil and features similar sci-fi themes from Returnal. The announcement of the game came with a cinematic trailer giving players an idea on the game’s story.</p>

<p>“Set on the planet Carcosa under the threat of an ominous eclipse, take on the role of Arjun Devraj, a powerful Soltari Enforcer searching for answers on a lost off-world colony,” the game’s description reads.</p>







<p>“Saros features permanent progression systems, where every death reshapes the world while offering new upgrades to overcome challenges. With a haunting story, deep third-person action, and a grounded performance by Rahul Kohli, Saros presents the next evolution in Housemarque’s gameplay-first experience.”</p>

<p>Eclipse Glow Studios has revealed ‘Tides of Annihilation’ during the PlayStation State of Play showcase. This developing title promises to plunge players into a post-apocalyptic rendition of London, <strong>transformed </strong>by an ‘otherworldly invasion’. It’s a single-player, story-driven game that has ties to Arthurian myth and the Knights of the Round Table.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2024, I sat down with the team from Eclipse Glow Studios – which has since undergone a rebrand – to learn about and see exclusive, pre-alpha footage of Tides of Annihilation. Back then, it was called Ghosts of Fog, and it won me over in an instant.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-tide-is-coming-in">The Tide is Coming In</h2>



<p>Per the game’s description, Tides of Annihilation blends ‘intense, breakneck combat, an immersive narrative, and an unforgettable setting.’</p>



<p>Players assume control of Gwendolyn, a powerful protagonist and the sole survivor of the devastated human race, poised to battle incredible enemies in her bid to turn back time. She’ll be able to summon spectral knights and wield the powers of ancient beings in her fight for good.</p>



<p>Here’s a snippet from the game’s description:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players will encounter hordes of enemies, unforgettable bosses, and vertical levels in the form of gigantic knights roaming the landscape.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And here’s the impressive first trailer for the game:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tides of Annihilation | Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/om7mQozgOdQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Eclipse Glow Studios is a Chinese company headquartered in Chengdu. The team is made up of industry veterans who have contributed to games like Assassin’s Creed, Yakuza, and For Honor.</p>



<p>One of the topics I discussed with Eclipse Glow Studios’ representatives at Gamescom was how they could make the game more appealing to a Western market. This included making Gwendolyn appear as more of a strong, formidable lead than simply making her ‘eye candy’ like other, similar games have done in recent years.</p>



<p>The trailer that debuted today at the State of Play showcase represents that perfectly, and Gwendolyn looks like a phenomenal main character. This is comparable to a cross between Stellar Blade and Elden Ring.</p>



<p>Do you like the look of Tides of Annihilation, which is coming soon to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>At today’s PlayStation State of Play event, Konami confirmed the previously leaked release date of August 28, 2025, for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days ago, a PlayStation Store listing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked</a> Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater’s release date. The date was leaked alongside a new trailer featuring gameplay and narrative-based sequences. The same trailer was shown at today’s Play event, and excitingly, it also had the ‘Ape Escape Mode’ tease at the end. &nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Details about Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater have already been revealed. The game features two new perspectives, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-remakes-difficulty-will-vary-for-new-style-and-legacy-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘New Style’ and ‘Legacy Style,’</a> and the difficulty levels for each mode. Players have also been told about the latest battle systems, which reflect bullets and battle wounds on the body, with some permanent marks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the story, characters, voice acting and music have all been remade for modern consoles, with new intuitive controls that provide a more immersive stealth survival experience. Alternatively, you can always go back to the classic controls. There is an additional game mode called Snake Vs Money, where players will round up escaped apes as Snake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a recent claim stated that Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater will also be released for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 this year</a>. Konami has also indicated that it would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-1-would-be-hard-to-remake-konami-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard to remake Part 1</a>.
