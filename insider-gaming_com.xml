            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamestop-will-host-a-%E2%80%98trade-anything%E2%80%99-day-in-december.1355371/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On December 6, GameStop is hosting a bizarre event dubbed ‘Trade Anything’ Day. This is exactly what it sounds like, with the retailer suggesting that <strong>almost anything </strong>can be exchanged for store credit on that day only. There’s a list of excluded items, like ‘radioactive waste’ or alcohol, but everything else goes – including <strong>taxidermied animals</strong>.</p>



<p>There are a few more catches involved, and nobody knows how much these items will be worth, but it’s certainly a bold attempt to get customers into GameStop stores across the nation.</p>







<h2 id="h-gamestop-trade-anything-day-coming-soon">GameStop ‘Trade Anything’ Day Coming Soon</h2>



<p>GameStop might have opened the door to some truly weird potential this coming Trade Anything Day. On December 6, customers will waltz into GameStop stores with anything they can get their hands on in the hope of securing some store credit.</p>



<p>It’s highly unlikely the average item will be worth much, and there are a lot of caveats tied to the event, but it’s nothing if not a humorous event that’ll get people into the retailer’s stores.</p>



<p>GameStop staff will have the final say on what can be accepted as a trade item, and there’s a pre-defined shipping container that has been handed to stores to determine the maximum size of said items. That stops you from wheeling a refrigerator or something bizarre into the store to trade.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of things that you <strong>can not </strong>trade to GameStop during Trade Anything Day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hazardous waste or material, chemicals, liquids. Lithium ion batteries or items containing lithium ion batteries. Weapons and ammo. Dead or alive animals (Taxidermy items are valid for trade). Alcohol, Tobacco, drugs or pharmaceuticals (legal or not). Computers (such as desktops, laptops, notebooks, all-in-ones, minis, workstations, e-readers, tablets, thin clients, smart displays, virtual reality headsets with built-in processor, interactive flat panel displays with built-in processor) excluding certain MacBooks GameStop normally accepts in trade. Computer peripherals intended for use with a computer and weighing less than 100 pounds (monitors, keyboards/keypads, mice/pointing devices, external hard drives (excluding those normally accepted in trade), facsimile machines, document scanners, printers, 3D printers, label printers, digital picture frames. Small electronic equipment (portable digital music players, VCRs, DVD players, DVRs, digital converter boxes, cable or satellite receivers, projectors including those with DVD player capability). Small scale servers. Televisions. Gift cards and other currency (foreign or domestic). Jewelry. Sexual and explicit items. Items resembling body parts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a hefty list after all, and there are some strange things on there that you <strong>think would </strong>be accepted, like computers, peripherals, and ‘small electronic equipment.’</p>



<p>‘Items resembling body parts’ are also banned from trading, which is understandable.</p>







<p>Do you want to take part in Trade Anything Day? Let me know what you intend to take in on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-17-890/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-890-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-monday-november-17.1355368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a new week, and we’re smack-bang in the middle of November. It’s a busy time all around – Thanksgiving is on the horizon, Christmas is just beyond, and Black Friday starts soon. There’s a lot to focus on, but today, let’s start small by smashing this NYT Connections puzzle.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need to start your week on a high.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-17">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 17)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #890:</p>



<ul>
<li>TABOO</li>



<li>SLAM DUNK</li>



<li>GO-GETTER</li>



<li>SURE THING</li>



<li>SHOO-IN</li>



<li>SCATTERGORIES</li>



<li>OKEY-DOKE</li>



<li>PROSCRIBED</li>



<li>ALLEY-OOP</li>



<li>ABSOLUTELY</li>



<li>VERBOTEN</li>



<li>FADEAWAY</li>



<li>OFF-LIMITS</li>



<li>LEAVENING</li>



<li>FINGER ROLL</li>



<li>OF COURSE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Responses that enthusiastically confirm agreement</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Words that mark something as off-limits or prohibited</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Different ways to score on the court</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word begins with a command meaning “get lost!”</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 17.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-17-890">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 17 (#890)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– ABSOLUTELY, OF COURSE, OKEY-DOKE, SURE THING</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – OFF-LIMITS, PROSCRIBED, TABOO, VERBOTEN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ALLEY-OOP, FADEAWAY, FINGER ROLL, SLAM DUNK</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – GO-GETTER, LEAVENING, SCATTERGORIES, SHOO-IN</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>If you’ve played ARC Raiders, you’ve heard about (or seen, or fought…) the Queen. She’s a terrifying enemy with a hulking construct, an immense attack set, and an enormous health pool. Before the Matriarch arrived, she was the game’s apex predator and an aspirational target for talented players worldwide.</p>



<p>In a recent clip uploaded to social media, the Queen was flipped on her head and taken down in the most hilarious, unscripted way by her own kin, a lone Probe looking to ascend to the stars.</p>







<h2 id="h-queen-faces-brilliant-and-unscripted-takedown">Queen Faces Brilliant and Unscripted Takedown</h2>



<p>In a clip uploaded to social media by cHipChrome and shared by numerous users, we see a Queen thrown high into the air, flipped onto her belly, and sent crashing back down to Earth because she happened to wander over a Probe that was taking off at that moment.</p>



<p>The Probe, which must have one hell of a jet engine, took the Queen on a partial ascension to the skies, lifting her and bringing her back down again in the most undignified way for an ARC of her stature.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The player who captured the clip could do nothing but stare in awe at the event, which is a perfect representation of how unscripted and unpredictable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/arc-raiders-loaded-pc/">ARC Raiders</a> really is.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has been on the market for almost three weeks, and just yesterday, it managed to hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/">new all-time high</a> peak player count on Steam, securing another lofty height even amid the launches of Black Ops 7 and Escape from Tarkov.</p>







<p>It’s proving to be one of the most genre-disrupting games ever, shattering expectations and standing firm as one of 2025’s most impactful smash hits.</p>



<p>Have you played ARC Raiders yet? Let me know what you’re thinking about it on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blast-r6-munich-major-champions-m80/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/m80-crowned-champions-at-blast-r6-munich-major-2025.1355278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The BLAST R6 Munich Major concluded in dramatic fashion in Germany, with M80 devastating Team Falcons with a 3-1 finish during the Grand Final. The victory secured M80 a massive $250,000 cut of the prize pool <strong>and </strong>direct qualification for next year’s Six Invitational tournament, the biggest event in Rainbow Six esports.</p>



<p>M80 commanded control of the final fixture, with Team Falcons firing back on just one map, and even that was a close finish that went down to the final round as a decider.</p>



<h2 id="h-m80-secures-top-spot-in-munich">M80 Secures Top Spot in Munich</h2>



<p>This is a monumental moment for North America as M80 stands up and collects a Major trophy in the Rainbow Six Siege esports scene. Team Falcons put up one hell of a fight and had a stellar run, but M80 proved to be the rock that broke open the hull of Falcons.</p>



<p>M80 has ticked a major box and qualified for the Six Invitational, which is the most important event in the Rainbow Six space. The Six Invitational will be held in Paris, France, and it will feature a multi-million-dollar prize pool.</p>



<p>This is now an even more insane record for M80’s Fabian ‘<strong>Fabian</strong>‘ Hällsten, a 31-year-old competitor-turned-coach who has achieved a stunning number of accolades in his many years in the Rainbow Six space:</p>



<ul>
<li>Six Invitational 2018</li>



<li>Six Invitational 2019</li>



<li>Six Invitational 2023</li>



<li>Dreamhack Winter 2018</li>



<li>Pro League Year 2 Season 1</li>



<li>Pro League Year 2 Season 2</li>



<li>Six Major Paris 2018</li>



<li>South Korean League 2024</li>



<li>North American League 2025</li>



<li><strong>Munich Major 2025</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>In 2023, Fabian also coached G2 Esports to success at the Six Invitational, but in 2025, a drastically poor finish left the veteran so far down the leaderboard, he might as well have not bothered attending the tournament.</p>



<p>Will 2026 bring about a redemption tale for Fabian? It also has the potential for M80 to give it a solid run and end up higher than ever before, a seventh-place finish.</p>



<p>I had the pleasure of attending the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in 2024, when the M80 crew, then playing under the beastcoast banner, beat BTS in a dramatic grand final that blew the roof off the venue. This event told a similar story.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Just Hit Another All Time High, Even As Black Ops 7 and Tarkov Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-just-hit-another-all-time-high-even-as-black-ops-7-and-tarkov-launch.1355245/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders, the exhilarating extraction shooter from Embark Studios, is still going from strength to strength. Today, the title hit a new all-time high player count on Steam, pushing ever higher and continuing to hold a solid bar for the genre. As time goes on, ARC Raiders is only getting stronger, even with the arrival of Black Ops 7 <strong>and </strong>Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Not only that, but ARC Raiders maintains a phenomenal track record in terms of user ratings, boasting a score of 88% on Steam from more than 100,000 reviews.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-won-t-slow-down">ARC Raiders Won’t Slow Down</h2>



<p>There’s no stopping ARC Raiders. It was thought that the 1.0 launch of Escape from Tarkov might halt ARC Raiders where it stands, but even that wasn’t enough to pull hundreds of thousands of players out of Embark’s all-new extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the game recorded a peak player count of 481,966 users, a new high and a stunning figure for any extraction shooter. By numbers, ARC Raiders is the most popular and successful extraction shooter ever made, and it’s <strong>dominating </strong>the genre.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As this article was written, ARC Raiders was the third-most popular game on Steam, beaten only by Valve’s titans, Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2. It has topped Call of Duty, Battlefield 6, Marvel Rivals, PUBG, and Where Winds Meet this weekend with ease. </p>







<p>There’s plenty in the pipeline for ARC Raiders. Embark Studios has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">promised a hefty roadmap</a> for the title, which already covers November and December. Next month, we’ll get the Cold Snap update, which brings new map conditions, a new legendary weapon, a fresh Raider Deck, and <strong>much more</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-%E2%80%98series-low%E2%80%99-metacritic-user-rating.1355170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>While it does have an 84 critic score on Metacritic, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is not faring well with its user rating. The reviews, while not all serious, do touch on several notes like the reported usage of AI and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-reddit-reactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a disappointing campaign</a>.</p>







<p>Black Ops 7,&nbsp;which released last week, hasn’t had the best launch. While praise is there to the multiplayer and zombies, the game is in some hot water. First off, fans called out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-accused-of-using-generative-ai-art-for-black-ops-7-calling-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the usage of AI</a> for player calling cards and assets, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision has responded to</a>. Second, the campaign, fully co-op, has gotten a lot of flak for being absurd and far from the supposed series standard. With this, it’s not surprising that the game is not faring well with users on Metacritic, which is a series low.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 currently has an 84 critic score with 16 reviews. However, the user rating, which has more than 540 reviews, is not as great. As of writing, its score is 1.6 out of 10. 2023’s Modern Warfare 3, which is one of the lowest-scoring Call of Dutys with a 56 critic score, still has a higher user rating with a 2.3.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that this number is likely to change as some reviews may be spam and as more longtime players get to it. Still, it’s not a great look for the franchise. Unfortunately, it looks like the damage has already been done, as Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t even reached 100k players</a> on Steam, while competitors like Battlefield and ARC Raiders consistently get over 200k. Whether Activision and the teams will address some of the problems is unknown. Hopefully, the next games will do a better job of satisfying fans and critics.</p>

<p>According to a credible source, an Xbox Partner Showcase announcement is coming soon. A presentation was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reportedly-has-a-partner-preview-event-scheduled-for-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored a while ago</a> to happen in November, but it seems it may actually be true.</p>







<p>Also known as Xbox Partner Preview, the events are short but substantial presentations on games going to Xbox consoles. However, compared to Game Showcases, they consist of third-party titles from various companies. For example, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-preview-october-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last one</a>, which premiered in October 2024 had games like Cronos: The New Dawn, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and FBC: Firebreak. Last month, it was reported that Microsoft and Xbox were planning a new showcase, though details were thin. Now, it seems a prominent leaker has added some fuel to the fire.</p>



<h2 id="h-announcement-coming-very-soon-for-xbox-partner-showcase-claims-natethehate2">Announcement Coming ‘Very Soon’ for Xbox Partner Showcase, Claims NateTheHate2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The claim comes from notable leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1989885666679718304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate2</a>, whose track record has been quite good. From multiple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-direct-will-take-place-in-september-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Directs</a> to full games, the leaker does have a solid track record. Nevertheless, in response to a question regarding a future Partner Showcase, NateTheHate2 said that an announcement is coming ‘very soon’. As for when exactly that may be, we still don’t know. </p>



<p>The most likely date is early this week, as one of the games supposedly there, Silent Hill 2 Remake, is releasing this week, and no official announcement of the game’s port has been revealed yet. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Xbox Store listing</a> for the PS5 title popped up earlier this month with a release date of November 21st, 2025. If true, we could get an announcement tomorrow with a Wednesday date or Tuesday with a Thursday date. Either way, it seems all signs are pointing to a Partner Showcase sooner rather than later.</p>
