<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is getting a free content update <strong>tomorrow</strong>, December 16. This update will introduce a brand-new storyline with eight quests that can apparently take ‘hours to complete’. It also includes seven new locations, six unique characters with ‘their own backgrounds and stories’, and a new weapon.</p>



<p>It also introduces a mysteriously-named ‘hub to create’. The update will be completely free for all owners of the game across Xbox, PC, and now, PlayStation.</p>







<h2 id="h-stalker-2-s-free-content-update-is-huge">STALKER 2’s Free Content Update is Huge</h2>



<p>On a recent <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog post</a>, the team at GSC Game World expanded on the new quests coming to STALKER 2 with tomorrow’s spontaneous update:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map. The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations.</p>



<p>Professor Medulin witnessed everything with his own eyes. While being good at scientific research, he didn’t know enough about the radio signal and what to do to figure out what was happening. That’s where Banzai steps in, a radio enthusiast, who also joined the investigation, but something went wrong.</p>



<p>You may hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Pay close attention to the Red Forest Region on your map, and from here on, your intuition, rationality and choices will lead you down the rabbit hole to see how deep it is.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Alongside the new update comes the GP37V2 rifle, a modified version of the GP37 rifle that features a suppressor and a low-magnification scope for picking off enemies at range.</p>



<p>The blog post points out the ‘Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp’ and the ‘Old Mine in Red Forest’ being key locations to explore with the ‘Stories Untold’ update. In the Burnt Forest, players will be able to uncover a new hub location, fully stocked with traders, a stash, and a bed.</p>



<p>This permanent update has players excited, and the sentiments on social media are positive. Over time, GSC Game World continues to improve STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, which we reviewed at launch and gave high marks to.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Has Acquired The Developers Of March Of Giants]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has acquired a new studio. In a press release on Monday, the France-based company announced that it was bringing in the developers of March of Giants. </p>



<p>Terms of the agreement weren’t made public, aside from the fact that Ubisoft will gain the rights to March of Giants and Amazon will provide marketing for the game on Twitch.</p>







<p>March of the Giants is an upcoming 4v4 tactical&nbsp;MOBA that has players fight in lanes and command groups of “comparatively pint-sized enemies”. According to Ubisoft, the gameplay <strong>“combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat with large-scale coordination and mastery of the giant heroes that make up its roster.”</strong> When it launches, the game will be free to play. </p>



<p>With the deal for the Montral team, Ubisoft sees the <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6TYgLsRkVYP97hVH0Rhzn7/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-from-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">former creative director</a> of Rainbow Six Siege, Xavier Marquis, return to the company after seven years.</p>



<p><strong>“Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle,</strong>” Marquis said via release. “<strong>We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level.</strong>“</p>







<p>Also returning to the company is Ubisoft Toronto’s former managing director Alex Parizeau. </p>



<p><strong>“My thanks go to Amazon for their commitment during the first chapters of March of Giants,”</strong> Parizeau said. <strong>“Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs.”</strong></p>



<p>Aside from March of Giants, there’s no word on what the plans are for the former Amazon Games Montreal team with Ubisoft. As the weeks and months go by, those plans are likely to be made known.</p>
