<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s Zombies mode will be getting its big reveal soon enough. After showcasing the game’s co-op campaign and a hint of Multiplayer, Zombies got a small section of the trailer. Still, for those who want to know more, you won’t have to wait long to find out.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is returning to the cybernetic world of Black Ops 2. While the campaign picks up David Mason’s story, fans are no doubt excited for Multiplayer and Zombies. We previously reported that Multiplayer will be at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/">COD Next</a>, as well as Zombies. However, it looks like it may be sooner than that, thanks to confirmation from PlayStation.</p>

<p>At around <a href="https://youtu.be/r9Z15Z-f2Ys?feature=shared&amp;t=132">the 2:12 mark</a> of the latest trailer of Black Ops 7, a peek at Zombies is shown. We get a few seconds of gameplay, as well as an interesting arcade mode called Dead Ops Arcade 4. It’s not much, though it was confirmed that, alongside Multiplayer, it will be present at COD Next. The event, which takes place on September 30th, 2025, plans to show off both modes in detail. However, it looks like we may see Zombies earlier than that, as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/">PlayStation Blog</a> mentions an early September reveal for the mode.</p>



<p>From the Call of Duty blog, Black Ops 7’s Zombies picks off where Black Ops 6 left off, with the crew now meeting the original Black Ops Zombies members. The mode will apparently be its biggest yet, with the launch map being quite vast. For fans of Black Ops 2, Survival Maps return, so players can enjoy multiple maps to play on and last against the hordes of zombies. </p>



<p>While there isn’t a firm date as to when Black Ops 7 Zombies will be shown, it’ll be before COD Next. Given the game launches on Game Pass, you’ll be able to dive into Zombies day one if you own the subscription.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As part of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s post-launch content, the newest story expansion, Legacy of the Forge, got a brand new trailer at Gamescom Opening Night Live. Even more so, we now have a release date for it, and it’s quite soon.</p>



<p>Made by Warhorse Studios, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s immersive RPG gameplay improves over the original in many ways. Already being helmed as one of 2025’s best, the studio has been hard at work with post-launch content. It’s first, Brushes with Death, added new quests with an art-focused storyline, as well as shield customization. While one, Mysteria Ecclesiae, is still planned, the next one is Legacy of the Forge, which was shown off in a brand new trailer.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcvB6lH-LKI">shown above</a>, Henry acts upon his late father’s legacy and starts using his old forge to craft new weapons for the folks of Kuttenberg. Legacy of the Forge, which releases on September 9th, 2025, will let players create new weapons and armor to use. Plus, new story content following Henry uncovering his father’s past will be added. In it, you’ll meet allies that may reveal another side to Henry’s father that he never knew.</p>



<p>In addition, players can now customize their own houses. You can personalize many aspects of your domicile, like your armory and bedroom. With over 100 million variations, there are no limits to your medieval imagination. All of the new content in Legacy of the Forge will cost $13.99 on all platforms, though Expansion Pass holders will get the DLC for free. </p>



<p>The success of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, given the original’s reception. Still, the game has become a top contender for award season, especially for RPGs and Direction. Fortunately, Legacy of the Forge and subsequent DLC will ensure it isn’t going anywhere, which fans will be more than happy about. </p>



<p>Will you play Legacy of the Forge when it comes out on September 9th? Did you enjoy Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2? Let us know in the comments below and in the forums!</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is getting a COD Next all about it in late September. After getting its gameplay reveal at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Activision has announced when we’ll see more. Fortunately, it won’t be long before we see more Multiplayer.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, 2025, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/">brings the series back</a> to the Mason family, specifically David Mason. In 2035, he and his crew are taken into a warped reality thanks to Black Ops 2’s Raul Menendez. Going off of Black Ops 6 ‘s success last year, Raven and Treyarch aren’t pulling punches, as the new COD Next is weeks away.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-s-cod-next-streams-on-september-30th-2025">Black Ops 7’s COD Next Streams on September 30th, 2025</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s been announced that the next COD Next will livestream on September 30th, 2025. No exact timing or platforms are available as of writing. In it, fans will get a look at Black Ops 7’s Multiplayer, which <a href="https://youtu.be/r9Z15Z-f2Ys?feature=shared&amp;t=126">was teased</a> in the trailer above. COD Next also plans to have famous content creators try out the new Multiplayer and Zombies modes live. Then, on October 2nd, a beta will occur for fans to finally get their hands on it at home. </p>



<p>Despite releasing a bit later than most Call of Duty’s do, Black Ops 7 looks to be another fun futuristic take on the series. While the co-op campaign might turn some solo players off, there’s no doubt that it’ll sell quite well. Even more so, it will launch Day One on Xbox Game Pass, meaning more people than ever can play. All that said, COD Next is an event many should keep tabs on, especially since Multiplayer is the series’ bread and butter. </p>

<p>Microsoft is bringing Starfield to the Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>In a post on social media on Tuesday, known leaker Nate The Hate said that Starfield will be making its way to Nintendo’s latest console along with the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>“Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle won’t be the only Bethesda game coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1957886310896796027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. “See that planet? You can go there. Aside from landing on PS5… Starfield is planned for release on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was confirmed</a> for Nintendo Switch 2 during Gamescom Opening Night Live on Tuesday. No set date was announced for the game on the system aside from it being next year.</p>



<p>Going back to Starfield, right now the only information is from Nate The Hate’s initial tweet. It’s unknown if the game will launce with the Shattered Space expansion or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-spring-2026-new-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even the anticipated second</a> expansion. A new expansion, if rumors are to be believed, is expected to come in Spring 2026. </p>



<p>A potential release on the Switch 2 isn’t the only Starfield news to be making the rounds. Recently, a data mine suggested that real-time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-datamine-suggests-a-new-ship-feature-is-on-the-way" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interplanetary travel could be coming</a> in a future update.</p>
