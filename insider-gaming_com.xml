<p>NetEase has just released a statement regarding the recent layoffs of the Marvel Rivals team in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals game director Thaddeus Sasser revealed yesterday that his entire team in the United States was<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-laid-off-as-netease-guts-entire-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> suddenly gutted</a>. Sasser added that the layoffs took place even after their team was able to “deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games”. It was unclear why the layoffs occurred, but NetEase’s latest statement clarifies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NetEase’s statement on Marvel Rivals layoffs was first spotted on an <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1892090498803696046/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post by Stephen Totilo. It revealed that the layoffs were part of a “difficult decision” required for “organisational reasons and to optimise development efficiency”. The decision led to cutting down their Seattle design team, which comprised six people. The developers stated that the affected will receive confidential and respectful treatment “with recognition for their individual contributions”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, they assure players that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which resides in Guangzhou, China, and is led by Weicong Wu, is “fully committed” to providing the best experience for the players. The developers are investing more in the game’s growth and are looking forward to delivering new characters, maps, features, and engaging live-service content for their community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Here’s NetEase’s statement on the Marvel Rivals layoffs in Seattle:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We recently made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game. This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions.</p>



<p>We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyun Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience. We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We’re excited to deliver new super hero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Counter-Strike Major is returning to North America for the first time since the start of 2018. But while an NA team managed to lift the trophy then, it doesn’t feel like any team from the region is in the realm of contending for the BLAST.tv Austin 2025 trophy.</p>



<p>In the past couple of years, Counter-Strike fans have seen young phenoms like Danil “donk” Kryshkovet and Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov emerge. Why isn’t it happening in North America? CS2 caster, analyst, and former coach Jason “moses” O’Toole spoke to Gaming World Media about the state of NA CS, and what is needed for the region to properly compete with Europe.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-the-last-time-we-had-a-phenom">‘When Was The Last Time We Had a Phenom?’</h2>



<p>It’s been a long time since a North American player truly broke into the upper echelon of professional Counter-Strike play. When Moses spoke to GWM at the media event for the BLAST.tv Austin Major, he laid out his hopes that the event could reignite NA CS with new talent and new events.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When was the last time we had a phenom? When was the last time we had a new player burst onto the scene? If you look at the players at the top of the list [of NA players] you’ve got Twistzz and EliGE and they’ve been playing since 2015. I always wonder: all the talent in the country, but where’s it going?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moses pointed out a country like Mongolia, which has managed to produce tier-one-ready teenagers like Azbayar “Senzu” Munkhbold and Ayush “mzinho” Batbold, saying “if they can do it in Mongolia, we can do it in North America.” The former coach of Team Liquid says the NA scene isn’t structured right to produce that kind of talent, and that the biggest issue if discovering that talent.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We exist in that weird space where we expect North American players to go to tier one events in Europe, but we have no ability to find out who they are because we have no events here. And that’s what I hope, in one sense, the Austin Major solves. A shot in the arm of North American Counter-Strike that brings some events back, bring some energy back, so we can develop those circuits and figure out who the players are that we should promote to a top team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moses isn’t the only person who cares about developing talent in NA. Complexity owner Jason Lake told Gaming World Media about the importance of “staying loyal” to NA, saying the region won’t grow if organizations keep “recycling the same big names from Europe and other regions.” Acquiring new player talent isn’t solely an issue with NA or Counter-Strike. François-Xavier Deniele, the VP of Global Esports at Ubisoft, told GWM at the Six Invitational that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-vp-of-esports-no-new-talent-games-die/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games die without new talent coming in</a>.</p>

<p>Niantic Inc. is closing in on a deal to sell its games division, which includes Pokemon Go, to Saudia Arabia-backed Scopely Inc. for $3.5 billion. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg says</a> a deal on the sale could be announced “in coming weeks”, and would include Niantic’s video game business and gaming properties. In addition to Pokemon Go, Niantic games also include Ingress, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now, among others.</p>



<p>Despite talks being close, the report states that there’s “no assurance an agreement will be reached.”</p>

<p>Founded in 2011, Scopely was acquired by Savvy Games Group in 2023 for $4.9 billion. Savvy Games Group is a gaming subsidiary funded by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.</p>



<p>In August 2024, Niantic and Savvy Games Group <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">signed a deal</a> for Niantic to help with planned expansion into Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and United Arab Emirates. </p>



<p>“Our collaboration with Niantic marks a significant milestone in our efforts to bring cutting-edge games and esports experiences to the MENA-3 region,” Savvy Games Group CEO Brian Ward said, at the time, via PocketGamer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Scopely nor Niantic would comment on the potential sale when contacted by Bloomberg.</p>
