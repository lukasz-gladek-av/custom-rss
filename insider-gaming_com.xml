<p>Asus recently joined forces with Xbox to produce the ROG Xbox Ally, an upgraded gaming handheld device with stacks of processing power, battery life, and a clean Xbox-themed UI. That’s not all that the tech titan has up its sleeves when it comes to collaborations, as a new Xbox controller fused with Asus <strong>in some way </strong>was just teased.</p>



<p>In a new trailer uploaded recently, Asus suggested that ‘something extraordinary is coming’, showing a snippet of an instantly recognizable Xbox controller with an Asus ROG touch.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-asus-xbox-controller">What is the Asus Xbox Controller?</h2>



<p>While we know <strong>plenty </strong>about the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, the controller is a new concept to everyone.</p>



<p>In a 13-second clip uploaded to YouTube, the ROG team promoted a teaser for a grand reveal set to take place at Gamescom in just a few days:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Get ready to experience the future of gaming at #ROGGamescom2025. Stay tuned. 🎮⚡" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WyRyHC0t6zc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s impossible to glean much from the video, but we can see it’s an evolution over the standard Xbox controller, with a couple of extra buttons sitting around the grips. The Xbox button is smaller than on typical controllers, and a ROG RGB logo sits front and centre.</p>



<p>The share and start buttons also look new and are flanked by two <strong>extra </strong>face buttons.</p>



<p>Based on recent upgrades made to controllers in the gaming space, I’d predict that whatever this is, it has ‘Hall Effect’ thumbsticks, short-actuation triggers and shoulder buttons, perhaps fused with switchable stops, and high-polling, low-latency mechanics.</p>



<p>If nothing else, it’ll be an upgrade over <a href="https://rog.asus.com/uk/controllers/rog-raikiri-pro-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the ROG Raikiri Pro</a>, an Xbox controller with a built-in OLED display, tri-mode connectivity, and customization options via Asus’ Armoury Crate software.</p>



<p>What do you hope the reveal is? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 beta is back and taking the world by storm (again). Despite a few niggling changes that have left some players a little dismayed, the ongoing playtest is indicative of the hype surrounding this title, which is set to be released in full on October 10.</p>



<p>As the beta unravels, we’re seeing some trends emerge, and none of them is more wholesome than the selfless mission to become the best medic in Battlefield 6. Folks are going entire games without dealing a shred of damage, emulating <em>Hacksaw Ridge </em>and giving up their game to save as many players as possible.</p>



<p>I recently stumbled across a contender for the title of Best Battlefield 6 Medic.</p>



<h2 id="h-playing-the-medic-in-battlefield-like-never-before">Playing The Medic in Battlefield Like Never Before</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is nothing without classes, and for the most part, players are doing what the classes are made for. The Support folks are dropping ammo bags galore, the Engineer troops are taking out tanks, Assault soldiers are leading the fight from the frontline, and Recon fighters are sitting back in the hills and windows of crumbling buildings.</p>



<p>In my opinion, it’s the Support players who are living their role, leaning on the dual function of restocking ammo and providing revives to keep the battlefield flowing.</p>



<p>I was recently sent an image from a friend who is living out the role of conscientious objector in Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>While playing a game of Breakthrough on Liberation Peak, this user lived and breathed the Support class, refusing to kill a single enemy (and only dying four times!) as the match unravelled.</p>



<p>Instead, this player flew around the map with reckless abandon, reviving <strong>564 players </strong>and netting a whopping 56,575 XP while doing so. His buddy fell in second place, securing 395 revives but unfortunately taking the lives of seven enemies.</p>



<p>Phenomenal effort.</p>



<p>Have you secured a score that can rival 564 revives in a single match? Let me know how you’re playing Battlefield 6 on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PETA has gone after Nintendo over Mario Kart World, requesting that the gaming titan make one change to Cow by removing the character’s brass nose ring. In a letter sent to Shuntaro Furukawa, Nintendo president, PETA stressed that ‘nose rings are forcibly pierced through one of the most sensitive parts of a cow’s body.’</p>



<p>The argument is that Cow’s nose accessory in Mario Kart World is ‘glossing over real-world violence’ and should be removed.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-peta-bothering-nintendo">Why is PETA Bothering Nintendo?</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.peta.org/news/peta-mario-kart-world-controversy-cow-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post published hours ago</a> (at the time of writing), PETA explained what the deal was with it chasing down Nintendo over a design decision in Mario Kart World:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know Mario Kart World is just a game—and that’s exactly why Cow’s nose ring needs to go. Mario Kart is supposed to be a fun escape, not a reminder of the painful tools used on cows in the meat and dairy industries. No one wants to think about animal suffering while zipping around a race track.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team wrote, ‘No cow in the <em>real world </em>who is forced to wear a nose ring would ever sport Cow’s goofy grin in Nintendo’s game.’</p>



<p>I advise checking out the PETA link above with care—it’s a short jump from the article to some gruesome images, which is a classic shock move for the organization.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that PETA has challenged developers or publishers. In January 2024, I secured an exclusive statement from the organization regarding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peta-animal-cruelty-in-palworld-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegan outcry against Palworld</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>PETA has already heard from many Palworld fans who have no interest in eating ‘Pals’ and want a vegan guide created for the game. It’s ‘Veganuary’ after all, and gamers want to help animals by eating vegan in their game worlds and outside.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PETA has also petitioned against Hunting Simulator 2 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The latter claim was that players are encouraged to be ‘abusive towards fish and insects.’</p>



<p><strong>Seriously</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s any weight to PETA’s petition against Nintendo? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In a post on social media, Chris ‘To Catch a Predator’ Hansen has confirmed that he’s working with law enforcement, victims, and activists to investigate Roblox in the wake of the recent child abuse controversies.</p>



<p>In recent months, Roblox has faced scrutiny from the world as constant concerning cases have surfaced, and as the game grows, so too do the allegations and lawsuits.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-faces-to-catch-a-predator-treatment">Roblox Faces To Catch a Predator Treatment</h2>



<p>Chris Hansen, who is best known as the face of To Catch a Predator, a documentary-style show that trapped and captured child predators, is taking on Roblox. In a recent post on social media, the television host and investigator revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You may have heard that my streaming crime network TruBlu and I are investigating the exploitation of children on the popular gaming platform, Roblox.</p>



<p>It’s absolutely true and we’re deep into it. I’ve already interviewed law enforcement investigators and victims of this horrible activity.</p>



<p>We have collaborators, some people who have been working in this space, including Schlep, who have committed to help us in this endeavour.</p>



<p>Will Roblox actually say anything about it? Will it make any changes? We’re going to do our best to hold them accountable.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was rumored a couple of days back that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chris-hansen-roblox-plans-documentary-predator-claim/">Hansen was getting involved</a> with the ongoing scandal and backlash against Roblox. This might be the profile boost that the situation needs, with Hansen’s legitimate television network weighing heavily into the claims that the Roblox Corporation isn’t doing enough to protect children.</p>



<p>Roblox is one of the (if not <strong>the</strong>) most popular games in the world right now. It has racked up hundreds of millions of players exploring a diverse ecosystem of games, most of which are created by the users themselves. There’s a dark underbelly to the world of Roblox, and it’s one that parents are becoming increasingly aware of.</p>



<p>Do you think this effort by Chris Hansen will drive change in the Roblox space? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Just a week after its release, Mafia: The Old Country is adding a fan-favorite mode to the game for players to try out that many are sure to enjoy.</p>



<p>The game, which received decent reviews from critics and fans, took the story back to its roots in 1900s Sicily. From the start, the game made a point to change many controversial aspects from Mafia 3. The biggest was to return the series to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-devs-removed-open-world-because-of-mafia-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a more linear format</a>, akin to Mafia 1 and 2. Yet, with the returning mode, announced on the game’s official website, that may not be the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-free-ride-mode-is-coming-to-mafia-the-old-country">Free Ride Mode is Coming to Mafia: The Old Country</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/the-old-country/news/free-ride-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thank you message</a> from the team, Hangar 13 and 2K Games hyped up the future of the gangster series’ fourth entry. To celebrate, the team announced the return of Free Ride mode, which made its debut in Mafia: Definitive Edition. The mode allowed players to ride and drive around the open world and take on a variety of optional missions. Mostly, it serves as a great way to take in the beautiful sceneries, especially now with the Italian countryside. While the game is linear, Free Ride isn’t technically open world like Mafia 3, but it’s a rather interesting addition.</p>



<p>The mode will be available for free at a later date, along with new content for players to enjoy. While details were sparse on the timing and specifics, it does bode well for returning fans. Toward the end, we got some fun statistics on player behavior to look at. For example, 600 million bullets were fired, though only 185 million enemies were hit by them. Regardless of the decent reception, it seems Hangar 13 and 2K Games are planning to stick with the Torrisi family for a while longer.</p>



<p>Are you excited to try out Free Ride mode in Mafia: The Old Country? Let us know what you think down below or in the Insider Gaming forums.</p>
