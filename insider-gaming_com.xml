<p>The principal game designer at DICE is asking players to share video examples of unexpectedly fast time-to-death (TTD) during the Battlefield 6 open beta. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s first open beta was a resounding success, becoming the franchise’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest open beta</a> yet and also beating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty’s concurrent record</a> on Steam. However, players encountered several bugs during the weekend, but nothing that couldn’t be fixed. The developers have already begun investigating BF6’s unexpectedly fast TTD bug. </p>







<p>Battlefield 6’s open beta is now over, and the developers have started addressing the bugs players encountered over the weekend. Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/as-the-dust-settles-on-battlefield-6s-first-beta-weekend-devs-confirm-theyre-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-kill-times-in-the-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Florian Le Bihan posted on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954811982399381685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today, informing players that the developers are already in the office reviewing BF6’s open beta feedback. Soon after, Le Bihan posts <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">again</a>, asking players to share video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD” they might have experienced during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If some of you have some video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD that you've recorded in the Battlefield 6 Open Beta – send my way 🙂</p>— Florian – DRUNKKZ3 (@DRUNKKZ3) <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Many players shared video examples, and others shared their experiences in reply. One player <a href="https://x.com/Mokonoise/status/1954848559708221684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> videos of two such instances: one where they were fighting under cover and were shot down instantly, and another where they took delayed damage after downing an enemy. For those unaware, TTD or time-to-death refers to the duration it takes for the player to die after taking damage. </p>
