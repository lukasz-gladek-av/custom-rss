<p>Football Manager 26’s Open Beta date, launching ahead of its November 4th release, has been revealed.</p>



<p>The upcoming football management simulator, published by SEGA, has been highly anticipated by fans. Releasing on November 4th, the sports series plans to up the game with more realistic features and graphics. Even more so, FIFA announced a partnership for the title today for the upcoming World Cup. Fortunately, even with the November date nearby, the Open Beta is going to be even sooner, according to an article from our sister site, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-is-lauching-football-gaming-zone-a-new-football-focused-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a>.</p>

<p>In an exclusive from <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/exclusive-football-manager-26-open-beta-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Football Gaming Zone</a>, it’s stated that behind-the-scenes access to an alpha form of Football Manager 26 is out in the open. While access is reportedly only for professional footballers, the site learned that the code distribution email includes the release date of the Open Beta: October 24th. The information does work with a tease from developer Sports Interactive, who <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1978853555210457306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hinted at news</a> next week. While nothing is official until it’s fully revealed, it does seemly highly likely it’s set for then.</p>



<p>Dropping the Open Beta two weeks prior to the game’s release is a bit ballsy. However, the team has shown a ton of confidence in the product. A move to Unity Engine, as opposed to an in-house engine, has provided a lot more opportunities for the game to shine. Whether or not it will live up to fans expectations is unknown, but we won’t have to wait long to find out.</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios, the developers of the widely acclaimed Helldivers 2, are working on a brand new game and are looking for a new system designer to help with it. </p>



<p>According to a job listing on the company’s website, Arrowhead Studios is searching for a Senior System Designer for a new co-op Action game. </p>



<p><strong>“We’re looking for a talented Senior Systems Designer to join our growing design department and help shape the foundation of a brand-new, unannounced project,” </strong>the <a href="https://jobs.arrowheadgamestudios.com/jobs/6618789-senior-system-designer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">description reads</a>. <strong>“This is your chance to be part of an co-op action game from the start. You’ll be at the heart of building and tuning the core systems, progression loops, and combat feel like an Arrowhead Game.”</strong></p>



<p>Not much else is known about what this new action game will feature, but, based on what’s said later on, it will be for a completely new IP and built in Unreal Engine. </p>



<p>One thing that’s for sure, this new title isn’t going to be in partnership with Sony. In the spring, CEO Shams Jorjani said that Arrowhead’s next game will be “100% funded” by the studio.</p>



<p>A new IP coming from the studio shouldn’t be seen as a surprise by anyone. In September, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developers-have-no-plans-for-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jorjani said that the goal</a> is to make Helldivers 2 a “forever game” and that there were no plans to make another sequel. Instead, they want to expand the current game even further as the months and years pass.</p>



<p>What do you hope to see Arrowhead Game Studios build with this new game after the success of Helldivers 2?

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s Long-Awaited Console Version is Coming]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-console-version-coming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-long-awaited-console-version-is-coming.1328161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recap video recorded from Tokyo Game Fest, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov spoke about the imminent future of Escape from Tarkov. The game is set to hit a 1.0 release on November 15, dropping on Steam and welcoming an entirely new audience into the scene.</p>



<p>Within that summing-up video, Nikita dropped a juicy tidbit and confirmed that the console version of Escape from Tarkov <strong>is being worked on</strong>, along with new games set in the Tarkov universe <strong>and </strong>DLC for EFT’s post-launch window.</p>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-finally-coming-to-console-but-when">Tarkov is Finally Coming to Console, But When?</h2>



<p>It’s impossible to say when Escape from Tarkov will arrive on console platforms, and when it does, we can’t predict what it’ll look like. Many have long believed that Escape from Tarkov will take a ‘lite’ form for console users, with Battlestate Games stripping back some of the complexity, which is better handled using a keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video, uploaded by Battlestate Games earlier today:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>It’s only a snapshot reference, but at 02:10, Nikita says (while talking about what BSG is working on):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Also, the console version, by the way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s it—the truth of the matter from the horse’s mouth.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has been going for almost ten years, and for the last <strong>eight </strong>of those, it has sat in a beta state, with Battlestate making many tweaks and issuing content drops every six months or so. It’s all coming to a head next month when Escape from Tarkov <strong>finally </strong>hits 1.0, becoming established as a ‘fully released’ game.</p>



<p>That immense update will usher in a new map, fresh factions, and even a linear story that will see players finally escape from Tarkov, securing one of <strong>four endings</strong>.</p>



<p>How do you feel about a possible release of Escape from Tarkov on consoles? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>
