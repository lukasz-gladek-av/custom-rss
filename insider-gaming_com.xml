<p>Kirby Air Riders allows you to customize special skins and sell them for in-game currency. One skin has taken it too far, and the already-infamous bikini skin has been rendered unavailable on the Kirby Air Riders Machine Market.</p>



<p>Sometimes you need to take a step back and realise what you’re saying and typing. But it’s all true: A controversial customizable bikini skin is no longer obtainable in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-1-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a>. The humorous but risqué&nbsp;outfit can no longer be bought, and it’s probably a warning to all players that you need to tread carefully with any sus designs.</p>







<h2 id="h-kirby-air-riders-bikini-skin-is-now-unavailable">Kirby Air Riders Bikini Skin Is Now Unavailable</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Family-friendly entertainment, right? Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within 24 hours of the game coming out, users were making eye-opening skins and selling them on the game’s Machine Market. Everything is bought and traded using the game’s currency.</p>



<p>One particular skin went viral very quickly: A design showing Chef Kawasaki wearing a micro-bikini. If you didn’t know, Chef Kawasaki is a regular character in the Kirby universe, and their default getup is usually just some kind of cooking apron.</p>







<p>According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasaki-micro-bikini-ride-deleted-from-kirby-air-riders-machine-market-immediately-replaced-by-succubus-chef-kawasaki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>: “Chef Kawasaki&nbsp;wearing a micro&nbsp;bikini has been a running&nbsp;joke&nbsp;among&nbsp;a&nbsp;portion&nbsp;of&nbsp;Japanese Kirby fans for quite a few years.&nbsp;The&nbsp;headcanon&nbsp;seems to have resulted from fans looking at Chef Kawasaki’s standard attire –&nbsp;naked&nbsp;save for a single&nbsp;apron&nbsp;– and thinking, ‘Isn’t that kind of lewd?'”</p>



<p>So, once you give players the appropriate tools, they are sure to create inappropriate outfits. Kirby Air Riders’ technology finally allowed the Chef Kawasaki&nbsp;bikini look to happen.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Have you rinsed your eyes yet? Well, it only took hours for the design to be removed.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It was fun while it lasted, but this dual-wields as both an action and a warning to Kirby Air Riders players: Think twice before putting Chef Kawasaki—or anyone, for that matter—in a micro-bikini and selling it on the Machine Market.</p>
