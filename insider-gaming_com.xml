            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 is finally moving to the modern era. According to the game’s ratings page on the ESRB website, WWE 2K26 will no longer release on last-gen consoles.</p>



<p>That means those only playing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are seemingly out of luck.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-esrb-page-gives-a-bit-away">The ESRB Page Gives A Bit Away</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A visit to the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41019/wwe-2k26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s page</a> on the website mentions a release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>. That lines up with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-releases-in-march-available-nintendo-switch-2/" id="172294" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what had been previously reported</a> on the status of the game. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has also reported in the past that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" id="170633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Island</a> mode was set to come to PC this year. With it only being on current-gen systems and PC, it now makes sense as to why. </p>



<p>2K Sports has yet to officially confirm this, so it could be a case of just missing the systems. That said, with it so close to the game’s March 13 release, it’s highly likely that what’s on the ESRB website is accurate. </p>







<p>WWE 2K26 is expected to have a number of improved features and even some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new and returning match types</a> this year. One of the game’s main modes, Showcase Mode, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also feature current World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk</a>. Other features include the Draft in Universe mode, a revamped reversal system, intergender matches in MyFACTION, and more. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[BLAST Wants To Deliver 40 Live Esports Events Worldwide in Two Years]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blast-deliver-40-esports-events-two-years/</link>
            <guid>1419481</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>BLAST, one of the leading names in the esports industry for event organization, has unveiled an all-new destination process, inviting countries worldwide to host BLAST-backed events in 2027 and 2028. The ambitious roadmap will incorporate more than 40 events and should accommodate more than <strong>half a million </strong>fans.</p>



<p>In 2025, a single BLAST Counter-Strike Major held in Austin, Texas, generated a whopping $102 million in economic impact, with fans travelling to the arena from <strong>37 countries</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-blast-to-host-another-global-sprint">BLAST To Host Another Global Sprint</h2>



<p>In a press release, the team at BLAST revealed an ambitious plan to host 40 events through 2027 and 2028, encompassing several games, hundreds of competitors, and dozens of countries. The expectation is that the company will achieve 250,000 ticket sales per year, for a total of half a million across the two-year window.</p>



<p>Per the latest update, cities and regions worldwide are invited to ‘express interest’ in hosting these grand and increasingly valuable tournaments, covering games like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike</li>



<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Rainbow Six</li>
</ul>



<p>But it doesn’t end with games, as BLAST also promoted ‘new competitive entertainment formats.’</p>



<p>In a statement, BLAST’s VP of Destinations and Market Development, James Wollard, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Esports continues to be one of the fastest growing entertainment sectors globally and BLAST has built a strong track record of delivering world class live events that attract millions of viewers and that increasingly sell out iconic arenas.</p>



<p>Our focus is on building long-term, strategic partnerships with host destinations that deliver measurable economic impacts, global exposure and lasting community and cultural value. We consistently return to and repeat partnerships with host cities, which demonstrates the value of our model and our commitment to sustainable, multi-year, deep collaborations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Any host country interested in supporting a BLAST event must get its ‘expressions of interest’ logged by February 13.</p>



<p>The average esports major, at least for the largest games, draws thousands of visitors from around the world. They boost tourism, hospitality, and travel spending, aside from also spending money in the venue, buying merchandise, and supporting the teams and organizations that make the esports industry sustainable</p>
