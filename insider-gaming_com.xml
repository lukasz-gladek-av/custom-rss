<p>InZOI officially released in Early Access on Friday and one of the first viral experiences making the rounds was the fact that the game allowed players to run over children. According to the game’s developers, however, this isn’t supposed to be the case.</p>



<p>In a message sent to Insider Gaming, a Krafton representative said that it was caused by a “unintended bug” that has since been resolved.</p>

<p>“This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch,” the representative said. “These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of inZOI.

<p>The video game industry layoff trend is picking up steam as Cyan Worlds, the developers behind Myst and Firmament, have announced a round of layoffs at the studio.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://xcancel.com/cyanworlds/status/1905668238899327249/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> post on Friday afternoon, the studio said that 12 people will be let go despite their “best efforts to avoid it”. The layoffs will be effective at the end of March.</p>



<p>“Industry conditions have forced us into a tricky spot where we are having to weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025,” the statement reads. </p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft And Tencent Have A Deal, GTA 6 Release Questions, and An Exclusive Game Announcement</a></h6>



<p>“Throughout the past year, we have been ultra-transparent with the entire Cyan team about the choppy waters we find ourselves in, as well as the dangers ahead. While the news of a layoff was not a surprise to the team, it was (and is) still deeply saddening for all of us.”</p>



<p>Those part of the layoffs at Cyan Worlds are receiving a severance package. However, the company is also working on helping them find additional work. That includes <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NURnVwfeqolPAVN-Dn44UpXZS3bRVMaCNQczIzhIpdc/edit?gid=1838665401#gid=1838665401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sharing the information</a> of those laid off and now looking for employment elsewhere.</p>



<p>As far as what’s next for Cyan Worlds, the studio says its “number one priority is to secure financing for our next project, and to restabilize the studio.”</p>



<p>“We’ve been around for a very long time, and have been through tough times before,” they said. “Our sincere hope is to continue to be around, and to provide the types of experiences that only Cyan can deliver.</p>



<p>“As always, we are grateful for all the love and support from our amazing player community.”</p>



<p>Cyan Worlds was founded in 1987 by brothers Robyn and Rand Miller. Since its establishment 38 years ago, the studio has shipped dozens of games.</p>

<p>A recently-released kids movie has received the greenlight for a new game. As first reported on the latest episode of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast</a>, Dog Man is set to receive another video game adaptation.</p>



<p>“Hold on to your police hats because Dog Man has been approved for a video game,” Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson revealed during the show. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>It was added that there is a belief that the new game only recently was given the go ahead after the success of the Dog Man movie earlier this year. For context, the Dog Man film had a box office of around $130.5 million against a budget of just $40 million.</p>



<p>Not much else is known about the new Dog Man game other than its been approved. Dog Man made its video game debut in October 2024 with Dog Man: Mission Impawsible. </p>

<p>If you really are impatient and want to get money fast, using the InZOI money cheat is as easy as taking candy from a baby. First, open the Psicat guide from the bottom right of your screen. After that, you’ll see a<strong> “Money Cheat” button on the left-hand side of the guide</strong>. <strong>Clicking that button will give you 100,000 Meows</strong>—the game’s currency—every time you click it.</p>



<p>And that’s it. Seriously. </p>



<p>You can <strong>press that button as many times as you’d like</strong> with no issues, and live the life of your dreams. And while it could impact your Zoi’s Karma in the future, there is currently no penalty of any kind for taking advantage of the game’s money cheat. So, if you really don’t want to earn money the same way you have to in real life, go ahead and take advantage of the systems that’s available to you in the game.</p>



<p>In addition to the money cheat, the game’s developers at InZOI Studio say that more cheats for players are coming to the game later on in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">early access</a>. </p>
