<p>There’s something eerily exciting about a game set in the ‘post-apocalypse’. They’re typically morbid, darker adventures that see players tackle all the threats that come with surviving in a world devastated by a virus or a nuclear holocaust, but despite those bleak elements, they’re often highly enjoyable experiences. In this list, we’re taking a look at the best post-apocalyptic games ever.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-post-apocalyptic-games">What Are The Best Post-Apocalyptic Games?</h2>



<p>There’s a huge library to work with, as post-apocalyptic games are traditionally quite good sellers that are able to ultimately stitch together expansive universes that traverse as a series of unique releases. Some of them will even go on to spawn post-apocalyptic movies, books, or television shows.</p>



<p>So, what are the best post-apocalyptic games? Let’s find out.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-fallout-4">1. Fallout 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fallout 4 is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic games you’ll ever play. It’s expansive and it embodies the ‘wasteland vibe’ perfectly. It wasn’t a favourite of the die-hard Fallout fans because it became more ‘mainstream’ and sold out a little, but it’s a solid choice and offers hundreds of hours of entertainment in one of the most engaging maps in the game’s history.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-the-last-of-us">2. The Last of Us</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Last of Us (and later, Part II) was a smash hit when it was released back in 2013 exclusively on PlayStation 3. It became an overnight sensation and birthed one of the most memorable and emotional post-apocalyptic stories in gaming history. With the player getting the opportunity to travel across the outbreak-ravaged United States, it’s easily one of the top titles on offer in the post-apocalyptic scene.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-metro-exodus">3. Metro Exodus</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Metro is a legendary series that was a novel before it became a best-selling video game. In Metro, the player embarks on a perilous journey through the subways of Moscow, with the above-ground environment having been turned into a post-apocalyptic nightmare. In Exodus specifically, an open-world formula was introduced, and the player went far beyond Moscow…</p>



<h3 id="h-4-half-life-alyx">4. Half-Life: Alyx</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Half-Life: Alyx is one of the best VR games ever made, and it’s set in a gritty, harrowing post-apocalyptic world that never fails to keep you on your toes. Following a cataclysmic event during an experiment at a research facility, portals are torn open to alien worlds that instantly threaten Earth.</p>



<p>As Alyx, you’ll take a journey through a world torn apart by alien oppressors and invaders. Every step is fraught with danger, and you’ll need to scavenge, fight, and hide to survive. </p>



<h3 id="h-5-horizon-zero-dawn">5. Horizon Zero Dawn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Horizon Zero Dawn (and later, Forbidden West) boasts a unique story that lends itself perfectly to this post-apocalyptic games list. It’s a gorgeous game on the surface, making use of cutting-edge technology to deliver a visual display that amazes the player. It’s marvellously well-written, boasts a star cast, and has some of the most innovative combat we’ve seen for years. </p>



<h3 id="h-6-gears-of-war-3">6. Gears of War 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s no list of the best post-apocalyptic games that doesn’t include Gears of War – and in this case, we’re looking at the third game in the series. This all-out action-packed saga sees enormous men in hefty suits of armour fight to defend their home planet from an uprising of subterranean mutants.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-dying-light">7. Dying Light</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dying Light (and 2022’s Dying Light 2) emerged into the post-apocalyptic world of games as one of the most fast-paced and high-octane titles in years. It dropped in 2015, bringing a parkour-fuelled, zombie-slaying adventure to gamers the world over. In Dying Light, the stage was set, and in Dying Light 2, the world fell so much deeper into its apocalypse.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-fallout-3">8. Fallout 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We’ve already named Fallout 4 on this list, but a special space must be reserved for Fallout 3. This is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever made, and it was a turning point for the franchise itself when it was released. It introduced gamers to a massive, open-world bursting at the seams with danger and destruction, and even fifteen years later, it’s still a fan-favourite game.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-left-4-dead">9. Left 4 Dead</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left 4 Dead was designed to be a cooperative slayer of sorts, but it fared well as a single-player game nonetheless. If you’re listing the best zombie games, you can’t help but mention Left 4 Dead, and even though it has some years today, it remains one of the best post-apocalyptic games ever. It’s littered with bloodthirsty zombies, one-liner quips, and pure, unbridled violence.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-dead-rising">10. Dead Rising</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dead Rising is an iconic zombie series that only just makes this list by way of technicality. It’s one of the best post-apocalyptic games, but in this series, it’s usually just one area that’s impacted by a zombie outbreak – like a town or a shopping mall. Regardless, all the Dead Rising games boast large, open worlds, thousands of zombies to slay, and more weapon-crafting mechanics than you could shake a sharp stick at. </p>

<p>Battlefield is one of the most tumultuous first-person shooter franchises ever made. It has fallen from grace in recent years, but once upon a time, it was a legitimate Call of Duty killer – or at least, it could have been. In this list, I’m breaking down all Battlefield games, ranking them from worst to best and determining where things went wrong for the series.</p>



<p>There are high expectations for the future of the series with Battlefield 6, which is set to be the most ambitious game the team has ever cooked up, but the proof will be in the final delivery, of course.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s the list – all Battlefield games, ranked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-battlefield-games-ranked">All Battlefield Games, Ranked</h2>



<p>If you think our organisation of all the Battlefield games is a little off, feel free to mention that in the comments and we might consider jiggling our list around a little!</p>



<p><strong>Update: Based on some valuable feedback, we’ve made adjustments to the list. It’s encouraging to see such a loyal fanbase still exists that is passionate about Battlefield games both new and old!</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-12-battlefield-hardline">12. Battlefield Hardline</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Hardline was a strange paradigm shift that didn’t hit too well with the Battlefield community. It was sort of Battlefield as knew it, but it was fused with a ‘Cops vs. Robbers’ foundation that at no point lent itself to the classic Battlefield formula. It had an entertaining enough campaign and it was visually pleasing, but it just never at any point felt as though you were playing a Battlefield game.</p>



<h3 id="h-11-battlefield-vietnam">11. Battlefield Vietnam</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield Vietnam was released in 2004, exclusively on PC. It was the second Battlefield game ever, and for some, it seemed odd jumping from World War II to the jungles of Vietnam, but it was their game to make, I guess. It was a little more visceral than its predecessor but it didn’t move mountains, and aside from a brief Bad Company expansion, this theatre of war hasn’t been revisited.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-battlefield-1942">10. Battlefield 1942</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 1942 is where it all began – way back in 2002. It was a remarkable game for the era and boasted near-unparalleled realism, and it easily became one of the best-selling games of the day. It kickstarted the entire franchise, but that’s not enough to rank it at the top of all Battlefield games. </p>







<h3 id="h-9-battlefield-2042">9. Battlefield 2042</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2042 launched in a terrible, heartbreaking condition but has been on a road of redemption ever since. It’s a tough one to place on the list of all Battlefield games, as those who never went back to it following its disappointing release will <strong>not </strong>remember it fondly. However, hundreds of changes have been made and it’s now at least a <strong>good </strong>game if not a great game. </p>



<h3 id="h-8-battlefield-v">8. Battlefield V</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield V has a bad rap, but it wasn’t a terrible title. It boasted some of the best features we’ve ever seen out of all Battlefield games, including construction, a sorely missed and personal favourite attribute of mine. It had gorgeous maps, exhilarating combat mechanics, great customisation options, a brilliantly mixed campaign, and plenty of post-launch content – and battle royale!</p>



<p>Sadly, it was also seen as the beginning of the downfall of the Battlefield franchise, and it couldn’t ever live up to the greatness of Battlefield 1, which was this game’s predecessor.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-battlefield-2142">7. Battlefield 2142</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2142 was an outlier – a futuristic title set two centuries beyond the ‘oldest’ Battlefield game. It wasn’t a terrible game by any means and boasted some highly enjoyable combat sequences and solid multiplayer, but it was an almost unexpected injection of innovation (or so they thought) into a series that had, until then, focused on real-world conflicts. Do we ever want to see mechs again in Battlefield? Probably not – but they were fine in 2142.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-battlefield-bad-company">6. Battlefield: Bad Company</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bad Company, good game. This 2008 release introduced us to the foursome that we’d follow for a total of two releases. This was a Battlefield packed with humour, one-liners, and pleasing action sequences that unfolded over semi-linear maps, and it was great. Even today, we mourn the loss of Bad Company, and the servers were recently taken offline, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-battlefield-2">5. Battlefield 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 2 is, according to Metacritic, the highest-ranked title out of all Battlefield games. It was technically the third game in the series, and it was a great step up from the first title that was launched three years prior. It was one of the most collaborative shooters of its time, making it a brilliant multiplayer option and one of the best team-based first</p>







<h3 id="h-4-battlefield-4">4. Battlefield 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 4 boasted one of the best campaigns we’ve ever seen in the series, so much so that certain characters made a return in 2042 almost ten years later. It also featured one of the most balanced and memorable multiplayer modes in franchise history, which went hand-in-hand with fantastic destruction mechanics, multi-faceted combat roles, and some of the greatest maps we’ve ever seen.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-battlefield-bad-company-2">3. Battlefield Bad Company 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bad Company 2 was a send-off of sorts for the sub-franchise, but to this day, fans are still expecting a resurgence. It took everything the first game did and improved upon it, introducing a better story, more quips, larger maps, and a more immersive multiplayer experience. It was released in 2010, but the next game to be released in the franchise would be so mighty that it would completely overshadow Bad Company 2.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-battlefield-1">2. Battlefield 1</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Out of all Battlefield games, Battlefield 1 was the most emotional, heart-wrenching title of them all. It was a cutting-edge experience that remains the best-selling Battlefield game ever, and it was iconic for the story mode alone. In the multiplayer offering, players discovered a brutally realistic, immersive ecosystem that felt incredible to play every single time. It felt authentic, it looked flawless, and it was a gritty and honest portrayal of one of human history’s most devastating wars.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-battlefield-3">1. Battlefield 3</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 3 is the best Battlefield game ever made, period. It is a masterpiece of a first-person shooter, and despite launching way back in 2011, it still holds up to scrutiny today. It effortlessly competed against the likes of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Killzone 3, and Crysis 2, and even if it didn’t come out on top in some of those bouts, it was a game that never refused to quit. </p>



<p>With stacks of post-launch content, some of the most instantly recognisable maps in franchise history, jaw-dropping visuals, and mountains of destruction, this truly was the Battlefield game to end all Battlefield games. It had a fantastic and gripping story and cooperative missions, and the multiplayer just felt so good to play over and over again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-doubles-all-time-player-peak-of-original-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 is currently standing tallest during a stacked weekend of free game releases on Steam. Players have been patiently waiting in queue for early access to the hack-and-slash action RPG from Grinding Gear Games. But even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-ii-queue-warning-issued/">foreseen server issues</a> have not stemmed the wave of excitement for the game.</p>



<p>The most impressive part to PoE2’s hot start? The numbers so far are just from players that paid $30 for early access to a game that will eventually release free-to-play. Now that’s dedication.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-is-on-the-path-to-success">Path of Exile 2 is on the path to success</h2>



<p>As of the morning of December 7, Path of Exile 2 is at its highest player peak of 496,736 players, and that number is expected to climb. That places the game right behind the perpetual number one and two on the Steam player charts: Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2. PoE2 is even outpacing another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launch-performance-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massively popular recent release in Marvel Rivals</a>, which peaked at 444,286 players just a couple days prior.</p>



<p>The sequel to Path of Exile has more than doubled the original game’s all-time player peak of 229,337 players. Even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam reviews from players</a> that can’t even log in yet are positive, signaling exceptionally high anticipation for the game rivaling Blizzard’s ARPG giant Diablo. According to developers at GGG, over one million accounts redeemed early access for Path of Exile 2.</p>



<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/path-of-exile-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first batch of reviews</a>, it’s high praise for Path of Exile 2. The consensus is that the sequel has improved on many, if not all of the features of the original game. PoE2 has also kept the things that help it stand out from other games in the genre, like its terrifyingly expansive skill trees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-delayed-due-to-database-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the early access bugs get resolved</a>, it shouldn’t come as a surprise when Path of Exile 2’s player peaks continue to climb. Typically, when games release alongside widespread login issues, the response can be quite negative online. But even while enduring these massive login issues, there’s an incredible amount of positivity excitement around this game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-ballistic-esports-operating-model/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-ballistic-fits-perfectly-into-the-most-popular-esports-operating-model.1054785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-ballistic-esports-operating-model/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Epic Games recently unveiled Fortnite Ballistic, an all-new first-person shooter built into the game’s core platform. It’s a competitive shooter by nature, boasting both a ranked and unranked ecosystem, and it has been designed to mimic one of the best-known esports operating models in the world.</p>



<p>It’s arriving in early access on December 11 – but let’s talk about the game’s potential to disrupt the established Fortnite esports paradigm.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ballistic-will-change-the-fortnite-scene">Ballistic Will Change the Fortnite Scene</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite Ballistic</a> is a tactical shooter that borrows elements from Counter-Strike 2 and VALORANT.</p>



<p>Each game is split up into several rounds, and the model follows the traditional ‘attackers vs. defenders’ structure that we know from so many other games. In Ballistic, Attackers need to carry a Rift Point Device to one of two sites on the map and plant it while the defending team tries to prevent that from happening.</p>



<p>That’s as cut and dry as it gets in the esports world, and it’s a system mirrored by Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, and other games.</p>



<p>It’s a first-to-seven game, which means each series will be a lengthy one.</p>



<p>Like other titles, Fortnite Ballistic gives players the bare minimum when they start each match. They’ll have a Ranger Pistol and 800 credits, and they’ll need to manage their eco appropriately as the game unfolds, earning more credits for eliminating enemies and planting the Rift Point Device.</p>



<p>In many ways, this is the most cookie-cutter model possible, but in others, it could be a boon for the Fortnite esports ecosystem that has been sorely missing after many years of battle royale rotations.</p>



<p>In Ballistic, weapons and equipment have been tapered to a select few items, to keep things as balanced as possible. In place of abilities (like VALORANT), players can use ‘Flex Gadgets’ such as the Proximity Mine, Bubble Shield, and Recon Grenade to gain an edge over their opponents.</p>



<p>It sounds like a dream for competitive FPS fans, and the fact that it’s built in Fortnite – a free-to-play title – means that it’ll have a huge draw at launch on December 11. There will be a ranked and unranked offering for players to soak up, and new settings will be introduced to the game to address the addition of a first-person perspective.</p>



<p>It’s only launching with one map, but imagine what things will look like when there is a host of maps and more equipment to flick through. This could be a cultural shift for the Fortnite esports ecosystem.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-ballistic-revealed-by-epic-games/</link>

<p>Epic Games has lifted the lid on Fortnite Ballistic, an all-new first-person experience built <strong>inside </strong>Fortnite. It’s launching in early access on December 11 with both ranked and unranked modes. It’ll serve as another angle to the Fortnite competitive ecosystem that players have loved for many years, but this time, the perspective has been completely altered.</p>



<p>In a post on the Fortnite blog, it was revealed that Fortnite Ballistic will launch into early access with <strong>one map</strong> – Skyline 10. It’ll drop with a select assortment of weapons and items, and as the community explores the game, Epic will make the necessary adjustments.</p>



<p>The new perspective starts here.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-introducing-fortnite-ballistic">Introducing: Fortnite Ballistic</h2>



<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a no-build competitive shooter that utilises the Fortnite platform in a much more intense way. It’s a no-holds-barred, 5v5 first-person shooter that’s broken down by rounds. Players are free to use their presets from the core platform, which means they’ll be able to use outfits, wraps, sprays, emotes, and more in Ballistic.</p>



<p>When it drops on December 11, Fortnite Ballistic will be available on all platforms and regions where Fortnite is supported <strong>except </strong>South Korea and Russia, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post revealed</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here’s how it works:</p>



<p>To start the match, players are sorted into two teams, attacking and defending. The attackers will try to plant a device at site A or site B on the map, while the defenders try to defend said sites. It’s the most typical competitive operating model we know, and it’s replicated in the likes of Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, Counter-Strike, and VALORANT.</p>



<p>Continuing the CS/VALORANT vibe, players will start each round with a pistol and credits, and as they play, they’ll unlock <strong>more </strong>credits, and thus better weapons and equipment.</p>



<p>It’ll have ranked and unranked modes from the get-go.</p>
