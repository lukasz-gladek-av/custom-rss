<p>Use these Roblox Sol’s RNG monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Rare Chests, Mega Chests and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sol’s RNG is one of the first popular RNG-based experiences on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-creatures-of-sonaria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>. Players must collect the rarest Auras by rolling the die to progress. The game has thousands of Auras, while the finest ones take forever to appear. This is when you must redeem the active codes. Using these codes, you can easily obtain Chests and open them for various Potions. Potions are the lifeline for newbies and veterans alike, as they can cut short the intense grinding session by consuming Haste and Fortune Potions for faster and better rolls. This guide features all the active codes, the redemption process, and a lot more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ahead of Season 1’s launch for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the complete patch notes have been released. In it, details regarding new maps, weapons, modes, adjustments, and several bug fixes have been addressed.</p>



<p>Released in November, Black Ops 7 is the latest in the iconic FPS series. While it hasn’t reached the heights of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successors or rivals like Battlefield 6</a>, it’s still growing. With Season 1, the shooter is going all out with new additions and fixing several elements after fan feedback. </p>



<p>In Season 1, new maps for Zombies and Multiplayer are available and will be released throughout the season. The biggest fixes come to the Ricochet Anti-Cheat system and bullet penetration, which were heavily mentioned by fans after release. In addition, weapons like the NX Ravager and Ballistic Knife can be secured via new challenges. On top of all that, many bug fixes and adjustments have been made to the UI and gameplay. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Micron is completely shutting down its consumer brand Crucial, and is ending the line of budget-friendly RAM and solid-state drives (SSDs). </p>



<p>Announced on Wednesday, Micron said that the growth of AI has led to this “difficult decision”.</p>



<p><strong>“The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage,” </strong>Micron EVP Sumit Sadana said in the media release.<strong> “Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments.”</strong></p>



<p>Sadana continued to thank the “passionate community of consumers” the Crucial brand has had over the last 29 years.</p>



<p><strong>“This decision reflects Micron’s commitment to its ongoing portfolio transformation and the resulting alignment of its business to secular, profitable growth vectors in memory and storage,”</strong> the company added. <strong>“By concentrating on core enterprise and commercial segments, Micron aims to improve long-term business performance and create value for strategic customers as well as stakeholders.”</strong></p>



<p>Micron says Crucial shipments will continue until the end of February 2026, and they will work with partners and customers to provide warranty service. </p>



<p>The decision to end the entry-level Crucial brand comes at a time when AI and data center growth continue to harm the consumer sector. Because of larger companies buying up all the supply, consumer RAM <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-prices-have-soared-by-up-to-250/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices have even risen by 250%</a> and beyond across different brands. </p>
