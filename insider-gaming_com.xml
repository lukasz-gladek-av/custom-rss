<p>Marvel Snap developers are hard at work getting the game back online, and according to the latest developments, it may return within a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Snap was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned</a> along with TikTok yesterday and is currently unavailable to play in the United States. The game was banned because the company that developed TikTok also owns Marvel Snap publisher Nuverse. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> spotted that the developers of Marvel Snap, Second Dinner recently took it to <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881154403333521795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> to reveal that they have been “working around the clock” to bring the game back and&nbsp;“hope to have it back online within 24 hours.”</p>



<p>Players who are missing out on content while waiting for Marvel Snap to return shouldn’t worry too much. The developers have <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881099521310269578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">assured</a> that they will compensate all players fairly for the lost time. They have also <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881135534548107414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">advised</a> players unable to play Marvel Snap to check out content creators.</p>



<p>Currently, the game isn’t available on the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. If you try to log in to Marvel Rivals through any device in the United States, you are met with a message stating, “A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals will receive a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-comic-book-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comic book in April 2025</a>. Also, Rivals will receive a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mystery skin</a> to celebrate the release of Captain America: Brave New World. Do you think Marvel Snap will return within 24 hours?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Avowed is a new IP from the big brains at Obsidian Entertainment. The ARPG is a diverse experience taking the best bits from action games and the depth of role-playing titles. It comes in a busy year for the company, so let’s check out Avowed’s release date, and where you can find the release.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment is all hands on deck in 2025. The developer is preparing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2 sequel</a>—another ARPG—whereas Avowed takes on a more magical feel. It’s fresh, looks exciting, and it’s the sort of magical fun the world needs. Spells, weapons, swords, and axes are part and parcel of this jaw-dropping, semi-open-world release. </p>



<p>There are big expectations, and rightly so, and we’re here to see what Obsidian is cooking up for launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-avowed-s-release-date">When is Avowed’s Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The big, bad bear. Credit to Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Avowed launches on February 18, meaning the full release date is almost here.</strong></p>



<p>February and March are always a competitive period for gaming. Companies are keen to capitalize on the quieter January and post-Xmas lull. If you check your calendar, you’ll notice Avowed is only a few days after Valentine’s Day, making it a perfect late present. </p>



<p>Keep the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-confirmed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed release date</a> in mind if you need gift ideas!</p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-release-time">Avowed Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Avowed doesn’t have a special launch time yet, meaning a midnight launch is likely.</strong></p>



<p>Very few games come with unique launch windows. Avowed also looks to be heading this way—unless Obsidian intervenes and ruins my theory—so you can ready yourself for midnight in your region. </p>



<p>New Zealand users get their usual benefit of first access due to the time difference. Make sure to keep off of social media until Avowed is installed and ready to go on your format.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-avowed-platforms">All Avowed Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox Series X|S and PC are the only platforms you can find Avowed for now.</strong></p>



<p>Avowed is published by Xbox Game Studios, meaning it’s a <strong>Microsoft-exclusive title</strong>. So bizarre is the gaming landscape in 2025 that I wouldn’t rule out Avowed coming to PS5. Exclusivity means a lot less than it used to—with Sony publishing exclusive games on PC too—and the PlayStation and Xbox crossover is only getting stronger.</p>



<p>Reports are abound that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellblade 2 and Gears of War are coming to PS5</a>. There are rumors about Halo dropping too. If this is all possible, an Avowed PlayStation port doesn’t seem beyond the realms of possibility.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does Avowed catch your eye in 2025? Or is it a standalone interest, is The Outer Worlds 2 also sending you to space? Let us know your thoughts on both games.</p>

<p>Netease’s latest hero-shooter, Marvel Rivals, has managed to wow fans worldwide in a very short time, so much so that it is receiving a comic book adaptation by Marvel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is an original story woven by the game’s developers to create this hero-shooter. After seeing the numbers it has pulled off, Marvel has decided to adopt the game’s narrative in a comic book. Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-infinity-comic-physical-print-release-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, a new <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/new-marvel-rivals-comic-book-spins-out-of-the-hit-video-game-sensation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Marvel website revealed that “MARVEL RIVALS #1, a special one-shot inspired by the game’s story,” is set to arrive in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marvel Rivals comic book is written by Paul Allor and drawn by Luca Claretti. The comic will receive “all six issues of Marvel Unlimited’s Marvel Rivals Infinity Comic in print for the first time.” Players can grab a digital copy of the comic through the Marvel Unlimited App or purchase a physical copy from their local comic book store when it arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the story of Marvel Rivals #1 comic book, the events are set in Tokyo 2099, where a time rift has hampered the Web of Life and Destiny. Two groups have been formed with their own opinions on solving the problem. The first group is led by Peni Parker, who wishes to plug the Web into Cyberspace, and the second group is led by Spider-Man, who wants to use Chronovium to strengthen the Web so that it repairs itself.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals #1 comic book series will take us through “an epic battle between two squads” composed of characters from the game’s original roster. This means we will see heavy hitters like Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Jeff the Land Shark, Peni Parker, and more battle it out.&nbsp;Which group do you think will emerge victorious in this battle?</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals could receive a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mystery skin</a>‘ to celebrate Captain America: Brave New World’s release. Also, the developers have issued a warning for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-issues-warning-for-keyboard-and-mouse-adapters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keyboard and mouse adapters</a>. What are your thoughts on the upcoming Marvel Rivals comic book?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>It was recently claimed that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was banned in Saudi Arabia due to “unskippable gay scenes” in the game; however, the writer of the game, Daniel Vávra, has just provided clarification on the situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vávra is a Czech video game writer who has worked on several popular franchises, such as Mafia and Kingdom Come Deliverance. Vávra recently took to <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1881081082612944935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to address the claims about “unskippable gay scenes” <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-banned-saudi-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and the game being banned in Saudi Arabia</a>. However, his clarification included some spoilers for the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vávra’s clarification started by confirming that there are “no unskippable scenes” in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and that they haven’t been banned in any country, to their knowledge. Vávra added that he doesn’t like “forced diversity,” and neither are they forced to do anything nor force anyone to do specific things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Vávra spoke about the fact that gay characters were already part of the original Kingdom Come Deliverance, and it’s not new for KCD 2. Also, KCD 2 is an RPG so players can choose “a same-sex adventure” or not. Vávra confirmed that “All affairs are (and were in KCD1) purely optional”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vávra’s clarification on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 claims also included some story points and the upcoming game’s setting, which comes with some spoilers. He explained that KCD 2 “takes place in one of the richest cities in Europe, which was besieged by a massive foreign army,” so players might see the city life “as more diverse” compared to the previous game set in villages. If you want more context about KCD 2’s story, check out Vávra’s entire thread <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1881081082612944935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has the most extensive<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> script in gaming history</a>. Also, check whether you must play the original title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-deliverance-before-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before jumping into the sequel</a>.
