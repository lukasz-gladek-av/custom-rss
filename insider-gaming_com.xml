            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pocketpair-publishing-warns-gamers-to-not-expect-%E2%80%98more-palworld%E2%80%99.1133082/</guid>

<p>Pocketpair Publishing was announced just a few weeks ago, at the tail end of January. As an all-new arm of Pocketpair, the developer behind Palworld, Pocketpair Publishing is dedicated to bringing indie titles to life. However, the brand’s publishing manager, John Buckley, recently issued something of a warning.</p>



<p>He mentioned that while Pocketpair Publishing bears <strong>the name</strong>, it’s not related to the creation of Palworld, nor should it be assumed that ‘more Palworld’ is coming from the games that sign to the publishing label. By that, he means that players shouldn’t expect the vast levels of success seen with Palworld’s 2024 release, which turned heads worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-they-are-all-bangers">‘They Are All Bangers’</h2>



<p>John Buckley from Pocketpair Publishing recently took to social media to stress how nervous he is about announcing the first batch of games that the team is working on. It was revealed in January that Surgent Studios, the creator behind Tales of Kenzera, has aligned with Pocketpair Publishing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-surgent-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to produce a new game</a>.</p>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1899644637826203835" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Buckley wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m very nervous to reveal our first batch of games. </p>



<p>Not because I think the reception will be bad (they are all bangers), but because I worry people will just expect more Palworld. </p>



<p>PPP’s goal is to help cool indies get made so I hope you like our first round of games!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then pointed out that Palworld’s ongoing development is ‘completely unaffected by PPP’ and that ‘us publishing more games like Palworld’ isn’t on the cards.</p>



<p>It’s a relatively loaded statement that has been taken with a mixed reception. Some feel that Buckley – who goes as ‘Bucky’ online – has immediately soured the line-up of games that PPP is yet to announce, restricting expectations and making us feel as though there’s a lack of faith at the publisher regarding the potential success of these games.</p>



<p>After all, nobody expected Palworld, which was presented as ‘Pokémon with guns,’ to break player count records and secure tens of millions of fans in the blink of an eye, but that’s what happened. If I were a developer aligning with Pocketpair Publishing, I’d perhaps be critical of that post by the brand’s publishing manager.</p>

<p>There’s <strong>another </strong>live-service competitive multiplayer title in the works at PlayStation, but the identity of the game is yet to be revealed. In a recent job posting that was discovered from PlayStation, it was revealed that a studio under the label is working on an ‘unannounced project’ that’s set to feature competitive, esports, and live-service elements.</p>



<p>Because that has worked so well for PlayStation in recent years, right?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-could-it-be">What Could It Be?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ja1ptk/playstation_next_unannounced_multiplayer_title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, eagle-eyed users spotted the recently-posted job listing from an undetermined studio, and they instantly started theorising what game the role could be referring to. The consensus was that it could be some kind of multiplayer fighting game, but at this point, it could be anything.</p>



<p>What’s made clear by <a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5447168004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the job listing</a> is that it’s set to be a live-service multiplayer game, and the team is eager to introduce a ‘competitive gaming/esports landscape’ into the title. As some one who has been in the esports world for many years, I’d like to point out that you can’t just invent a landscape or a competitive community – that only works when it’s grown, not bought.</p>



<p>The listing goes on to mention that the game will be multi-platform, covering PC, console, and mobile, and that it’ll be developed in Unreal Engine. It might be that the game is <strong>very early in </strong>the development cycle, as the listing says that the successful candidate will help drive the game ‘from prototype to production’. </p>



<p>It <strong>might </strong>be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-sony-studio-la-jason-blundell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Blundell’s new game</a>, too. In 2023, rumours started surfacing regarding Blundell’s appointment to a new PlayStation studio in Los Angeles, and it has been suggested the former Call of Duty legend is working on a game that fits the bill. If the job listing was for a placement in LA, it would offer more credence to that claim, but it’s a remote position, so there’s nothing to go on.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s a safe idea for PlayStation to piece together another live-service multiplayer title given the state of the industry? Hours ago, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-spectre-divide-closing-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spectre Divide</a>, another game fitting into that category, is shutting down.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-is-spectre-divide-closing-down-in-2025.1133073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-spectre-divide-closing-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Spectre Divide went live in September 2024, and in March 2025, it was announced that the game – and the developer behind the title – would be shutting down. This news came despite the studio securing tens of millions of dollars in investments while being backed by some of the most prolific streamers in the business.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spectre-divide-and-mountaintop-studios-to-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The news</a> shocked everyone involved, even if Spectre Divide wasn’t the first shooter released in 2024 to close down so quickly. Let’s take a closer look at the situation and determine why Spectre Divide is closing down in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-did-spectre-divide-fail">Why Did Spectre Divide Fail?</h2>



<p>Spectre Divide was penned as being the next big thing in competitive arena shooters, boasting a unique aesthetic and some innovative mechanics. It was publically backed by Michael ‘shroud’ Grzesiek, one of the biggest streamers and former esports players in the world.</p>



<p>The core USP of Spectre Divide was a ‘duality’ feature that would allow players to split themselves into <strong>two bodies</strong>, controlling each in real-time.</p>



<p>None of this was enough, as ultimately, Spectre Divide fell down the charts relatively quickly at launch, failing to gain traction and secure a healthy base of users.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Mountaintop Studios revealed that was why Spectre Divide failed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the Season 1 launch hasn’t achieved the level of success we needed to sustain the game and keep Mountaintop afloat.</p>



<p>We were optimistic about the first week. We’ve had ~400,000 players play, with a peak concurrent player count of ~10,000 across all platforms. But as time has gone on, we haven’t seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is a huge pitfall for free-to-play shooters built around a live-service operating model. If there are no players, there’s nothing to support the studio, and this is something we’re seeing happen increasingly often. Last year, Concord was pulled from stores mere weeks after launch, after failing to secure a meaningful player count.</p>



<h2 id="h-was-spectre-divide-bad">Was Spectre Divide Bad?</h2>



<p>Almost as soon as the game hit the market, people were asking, ‘Is Spectre Divide dying?’ It was an immediate concern for those eager to explore the game, as it looked as though the game was on the rocks from the moment it arrived. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, Spectre Divide was fairly buggy when it was released in September 2024. That kind of thing can cause a game to be DOA, as nobody wants to play a game riddled with glitches – even if it’s free.</p>



<p>It was also determined that the Duality feature was more of a gimmick than anything else and didn’t necessarily add too much to the game’s core makeup. </p>



<p>Many prospective fans of Spectre Divide were also displeased with how Shroud, the game’s main advocate, busied himself with other games like Deadlock and Marvel Rivals, failing to support the game he’d promoted since day one.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this was a masterclass in what not to do when launching a new game, and that’s why Spectre Divide is closing down in 2025.</p>
