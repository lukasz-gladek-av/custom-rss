<p>Everyone is waiting patiently to see what Grand Theft Auto 6, Rockstar Games’ next open-world epic, will be priced at. For the longest time, the belief has been that the game will be priced at a whopping $100 for the standard edition, and the divisive potential price point has split the community down the middle.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, one of the creators of Saints Row spoke about Grand Theft Auto 6 and insisted that Take-Two and Rockstar Games can charge what they want for what might be the biggest game ever made.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-gta-6-push-the-pricing-boundaries">Will GTA 6 Push The Pricing Boundaries?</h2>



<p>If there’s one game that can ‘get away with’ a $100 price tag, it’s probably Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>That’s what Chris Stockman, Design Director on the first Saints Row game, insisted in a recent exclusive <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Esports Insider</a>. When asked about the <strong>potential </strong>for Grand Theft Auto 6 to emerge with a $100 price point (and likely more for a special edition), Stockman offered his two cents:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They’re the only ones that can get away with it.</p>



<p>I don’t think it’s a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that there’ll be a tremendous amount of backlash if&nbsp;everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope it’s $100. I think it deserves to be $100.</p>



<p>The scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stockman revealed that Grand Theft Auto 3, released in 2001, was so awe-inspiring that it opened his eyes to the possibilities of gaming. In his words, he believed it was ‘the future of games’. Five years later, he’d play a pivotal role in bringing Saints Row, a solid GTA competitor, to the market.</p>



<p>It was predicted in July that GTA 6 will make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-make-7-billion-two-months-analyst-predict/">an eye-watering <strong>$7 billion</strong></a><strong> </strong>within two months when it’s released in May 2026. These unprecedented predictions are based on the expectation that GTA 6 will be the fastest-selling game in history. It will easily surpass anything made to date.</p>

<p>As a gamer, finding enough time to sit and enjoy a game can be tough. That’s especially true when you have responsibilities like a full-time job or being a parent. Luckily, there’s a specific genre of game that exists for this exact reason: roguelites. These games offer quick, pick-up-and-play action without much setup. But what games are the best roguelites of all time?</p>



<p>Overall, there are hundreds of these games to choose from over the years, but some stand out more than others. These are seven of the best roguelite games that you can pick up and play right now.</p>



<h2>What’s The Difference Between Roguelikes and Roguelites?</h2>



<p>You’ve probably heard people toss around “roguelike” and “roguelite” as though they mean the same thing. And while they do share many similarities, there are enough differences to make each game feel different. </p>



<p>Roguelikes are games that often stick to the formula of permadeath and procedurally-generated levels. Every run is a fresh start, so it’s all about your skill, learning tendencies, and getting a bit lucky.</p>



<p>Roguelites, on the other hand, add on to that formula. While they also follow the single-run strategy, they give players some sort of progression system. As you play, you’ll unlock abilities, new levels, characters, upgrades, and more to keep you coming back. </p>



<p>TL;DR: Roguelikes start you from zero every time, while roguelites let you grow a little with each run, making them easier for players to jump into and keep playing.</p>

<h3>Dead Cells</h3>

<p>A metroidvania-inspired Roguelite, Dead Cells is one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-cells-gets-final-update-from-evil-empire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the toughest games</a> you’ll find on this list. The game has you exploring an ever-changing castle, where the more you play, the easier it <em>should </em>get. As you play, you’ll unlock new levels, mutations, weapons, and abilities to help you out. Weapons like the War Spear and Panchuku&nbsp;will have you mowing through your enemies like a hot knife through butter. </p>



<p>There aren’t any checkpoints, meaning that once you die, it’s back to the beginning in a new corpse. It’ll be frustrating at times, but it’s the type of frustration that has you thinking you finally figured out how to make it to the end. </p>
