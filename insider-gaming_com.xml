<p>Game Freak brings Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green into 2026 to show generations what they missed out on two decades ago. In the middle of the reveal, some confusion arose concerning Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green’s platforms, such as the Nintendo Switch, and where to play them.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> community went into a frenzy when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green</a> were finally announced after the rumors. If you are one of those many Poké Maniacs, check out how to actually play either remake!</p>

<p><strong>The first thing the reveal trailer made clear is that you can play both Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on the original Nintendo Switch console.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>It’s easy to see why there’s been a question mark over the games’ platforms. The first trailer had an interesting iron-clad fact: You can play both games “on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> system.”</p>



<p>The video also shows a Game Boy Advance, but doesn’t show or mention the Switch 2.</p>

<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pokemon-fire-red-amp-leaf-green-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green On Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>You can also play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on the Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>We can’t honestly fathom the reasoning behind not advertising the Switch 2. Either Nintendo assumed people would know, or it was another reason entirely.</p>



<p>Either way, if you check the game’s eShop listing, it says this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Pokémon FireRed Version&nbsp;is a remake of&nbsp;Pokémon Red Version, one of the first two titles in the Pokémon video game series. This Game Boy Advance game was originally released in 2004. Now you can enjoy this classic Pokémon adventure on Nintendo Switch and&nbsp;<strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So stop panicking and make sure you’ve got some space clear on your Nintendo Switch 2 to ensure you can begin a journey to be the very best—you know the rest.</p>

<p><strong>As you might have guessed, you can’t play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on a PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>The guide promised to cover all possibilities, and it does. Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green sticks with tradition and remains a Nintendo-based game, meaning the only for you to play if you’re on these platforms is to line Nintendo’s pockets even more.</p>
