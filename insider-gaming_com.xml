<p>The bulk of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s marketing features The Replacer. The bearded character appears in various BLOPS 6 trailers and spoofs, but his origins are confusing to many—so let’s tell you everything you need to know about The Replacer.</p>



<p>Treyarch brought back the iconic character for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>—marking the first time The Replacer has been seen since Black Ops 4. The character has been used in various pre-release trailers, depicted as a replacement for real people in everyday life.</p>



<p>The Replacer’s face has become synonymous with CoD, and I’m here to dive into who he is, the actor behind the role, and more.</p>

<p><strong>The Replacer is a fictional character created specifically for the Call of Duty universe and was first seen in Black Ops 2.</strong></p>



<p>With CoD’s reputation continuing to grow and its popularity soaring at an unfathomable rate, The Replacer debuted in a marketing trailer to hype up new BLOPS 2 content. In the video, The Replacer steps into the shoes of normal people going about their day to “replace” them, allowing the person to enjoy Black Ops 2 instead.</p>



<p>The hot reception for The Replacer resulted in the persona returning for Black Ops 3, and Black Ops 4, and they have returned for 2024’s Black Ops 6. Again, following the same ideology; players desperate to play Black Ops 6 can call upon his services to step in and fulfill their day-to-day duties.</p>



<p>If only The Replacer was real, he could be here writing this while I kick back and camp Hardpoints!</p>
