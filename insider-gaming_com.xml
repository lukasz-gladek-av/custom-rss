<p>Hytale feels like the spiritual successor to Minecraft in many ways, and it could be one of the big games over the next few years. Its early access release has been met with various questions, including whether Hytale includes controller support or not.</p>



<p>The tension building for Hytale’s thought-impossible launch has been seismic. After getting the green light to continue production in mid-2025, Hypixel Studio has been working hard on an old build to ensure the game is in a good state for early access.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-has-secured-development-costs-for-the-next-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale has secured development costs for the next two years</a>, which is great, but it could mean nothing without controller support for some.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-use-a-controller-for-hytale">Can You Use A Controller For Hytale?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale doesn’t support any form of official controller support for its early access launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you struggle with a mouse and keyboard, you might come unstuck at times trying to negotiate Hytale. The developer has been very transparent over many of the details surrounding Hytale’s early access build, and the official website has even addressed the question of controller support.</p>



<p>Under <a href="https://hytale.com/accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Accessibility</a>, here’s what the information has to say.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are currently missing controller support.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, there’s no second-guessing if you can hook up a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S pad to play Hytale—you can’t, and it’s unfortunate, as it will ultimately exclude a handful of potential users.</p>



<p>On the plus side, it’s not all doom and gloom.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-controller-support-being-added-to-hytale">When Is Controller Support Being Added To Hytale?</h2>



<p><strong>Hypixel Studios has said that controller support is a “top priority” that the team is looking to add ASAP.</strong></p>



<p>You might have to hang fire just a little bit for controller support. From the sounds of it, you might not be waiting too long. Once again, let’s check in with the game’s Accessibility page:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This [controller support] is one of our top priorities and is expected to be available soon after release.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>How soon is ‘soon,’ is anyone’s guess. It could be a week or a month. Time is relative here and affects different groups of players. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-expects-one-million-players-at-early-access-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale expecting one million users during the early access launch</a>, stability and a structurally solid framework could be the goal at first.</p>



<p>Hopefully, controller support arrives in the time it takes to get stomped on by a dragon in the game’s world.</p>



<p>Is a lack of controller support at the early access launch a big no-no for you? What other key features is Hytale missing for its debut?

<p>A whole cache of documents and footage from the cancelled Monolith Batman game has surfaced online, showcasing audio systems, character art, game mechanics, vehicles, and more. </p>



<p>Footage and other details about cancelled Batman games have been surfacing online for quite some time now. Last year, we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-concept-art-cancelled-batman-game-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concept art</a> and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/potential-footage-for-canceled-damian-wayne-batman-game-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">potential footage</a> from the cancelled Damian Batman game by WB Games Montreal. Now, much more footage has been released for Monolith’s title, along with additional details.</p>











<p>The cache of footage and documents for the cancelled Monolith Batman game comes through a series of posts by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social/post/3mcba4da5xk2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MrTalida on BlueSky</a>. The bulk of the footage was part of “internal-facing and Warner Bros.-facing pre-production milestone deliverables”; however, some files are from an actual build. </p>



<p>The first set of videos discusses the dynamic audio system from the cancelled Monolith Batman game, showcasing how the music reacts and transitions as the player moves in and out of stealth, enters combat, and plays quests. </p>







<p>Then we get to see an example of cloth physics, showcasing how Batman’s cape moves around while walking. We also get to see character art for Gordon and members of the Gotham police, along with a facial animation test. </p>







<p>We were also shown other game mechanics from the cancelled Monolith Batman game, including the caped crusader throwing Batarangs to knock enemies down, using smoke bombs to enter stealth, knocking enemies down, using detective mode to collect evidence, and more. </p>







<p>The last video shows the Tumbler Batmobile in action, maneuvering through various sets of obstacles, using its boosts, and ramming into other elements on the map. Readers should note that this is very early footage, from 2009 to 2010. More files and documents are available <a href="https://archive.org/details/project-apollo-documents-and-videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>

<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is now available to play in full on PC following release, and symptoms are a crucial mechanic that can make or break your playthrough.</p>



<p>Available on PC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including with a Game Pass subscription</a>, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check puts you in charge of the entry of survivors into a camp during a zombie apocalypse, and it’s down to you to decide whether a survivor is showing signs of being infected.</p>



<p>Remembering all the symptoms can be tricky, but Insider Gaming is here to help with a breakdown on what survivors can show, and the action you should take as a result.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-symptoms-in-quarantine-zone-the-last-check">All Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</h2>

<p><strong>Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check are a crucial stage of the game, and processing a survivor incorrectly can quickly lead to disaster, so it’s important to know what each symptom indicates.</strong></p>



<p>You can uncover symptoms by using a variety of tools that are at your disposal, though you won’t have access to all of these immediately upon entering the game, as others are unlocked through progression.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the symptoms available in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, and the action you should take with those displaying them.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Symptom</th><th data-align="center">Survivor Status</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Yellow Eyes</td><td data-align="center">Good to Go</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Freckles</td><td data-align="center">Good to Go</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bruises</td><td data-align="center">Good to Go</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Conjuctivitis</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">37 to 41 Degrees</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">120 to 180 Pulse</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hyper Reflex</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sneezing</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hiccups</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Coughing</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sick Breath</td><td data-align="center">Possibly Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Necrosis</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bite Mark</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Red Eyes</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Above 41 Degrees</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Above 180 Pulse</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Cross Reflex</td><td data-align="center">Infected</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-deal-with-symptoms-in-quarantine-zone-the-last-check">How to Deal With Symptoms in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</h2>



<p><strong>There are three approaches to dealing with survivors in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check. You can either allow them to pass, send them to quarantine, or deny their entry.</strong></p>



<p>The correct choice is uncovered by discovering the symptoms a survivor is showing, highlighting whether they’re safe to pass or risk spreading an infection. If an infection is confirmed, entry should be denied, and if it’s suspected, but not guaranteed, the safe choice is to send them to quarantine.</p>



<p>Here’s an easy breakdown of what to do with each survivor based on the symptoms they show.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Good to Go: </strong>Safe to allow the survivor to pass through the checkpoint.</li>



<li><strong>Possibly Infected: </strong>Send the survivor to quarantine to monitor their symptoms further.</li>



<li><strong>Infected: </strong>Deny entry. </li>
</ul>
