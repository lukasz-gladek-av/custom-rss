<p>Konami has publicly addressed a number of launch issues for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater that have been reported by players.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Metalgear/status/1960740185957917022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Komani says that it has <strong>“received reports of several issues and are preparing a patch to address them.” </strong></p>



<p>The issues all center around game crashes and includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Performing an additional survival knife attack after completing a series of consecutive attacks to secure food may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while it is equipped may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Collecting food when a hungry crocodile is nearby may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Transitioning from a roll into a crawl may result in the character model floating in mid-air under certain conditions.</li>



<li>In areas where the camera switches to Intrusion View, character movement may become restricted under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Opening the Radio Window under certain conditions may cause the game to crash.</li>
</ul>



<p>Konami doesn’t have a specific timeline for a release for the update, but says that it will “take a little longer to implement the fixes” as they investigate the causes.</p>



<p><strong>“We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause,”</strong> they said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hot off Gamescom, Silent Hill f has officially revealed the English voice cast. In it, there are plenty of RPG heavyweights, as well as some promising new actors. </p>



<p>Silent Hill f, the next entry in the acclaimed horror franchise, takes players to Japan. You play as Hinako, a high school student who’s town is now shrouded in an eerie fog. While it doesn’t take place in the town of Silent Hill like previous games, you’ll still encounter disgusting monsters and deadly situations. As the eight mainline title after 2012’s Silent Hill: Downpour, the series may be on it’s way to claim the horror crown again. Luckily, they have some great voice actors along with them on the journey.</p>



<h2 id="h-english-cast-of-silent-hill-f-features-final-fantasy-and-nintendo-voice-actors">English Cast of Silent Hill f Features Final Fantasy and Nintendo Voice Actors</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="First Look | SILENT HILL f English Voice Cast Interview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2ebMX6kV2w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a video from Konami, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2ebMX6kV2w">seen above</a>, it was confirmed that five voice actors will be performing in the English dub of Silent Hill f. The full list of actors can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Suzie Yeung as <strong>Hinako Shimizu</strong></li>



<li>Nicholas Leung as <strong>Iwai Shu</strong></li>



<li>Frankie Kevich as <strong>Nishida Rinko</strong></li>



<li>Courtney Lin as <strong>Igarashi Sakuko</strong></li>



<li>Caleb Yen as <strong>Fox Mask</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The most notable of the bunch is <strong>Suzie Yeung</strong>, who was confirmed last week at Gamescom Opening Night Live. So far, the actress has voiced several main characters in gaming, specifically RPGs. This includes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-the-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-voice-cast/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> as Yuffie, Persona 3 Reload as Fuuka, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-teases-deadpool-daredevil/">Marvel Rivals</a> as Invisible Woman. She will voice Silent Hill f’s protagonist, Hinako.</p>



<p>In addition to Yeung, the rest of the cast are fairly new to the VA scene, like <strong>Nicolas Leung</strong> and <strong>Frankie Kevich</strong>. <strong>Caleb Yen</strong>, who plays Fox Mask, starred as the protagonist of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/play-these-games-after-metaphor-refantazio/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, which earned a fair share of awards last year. <strong>Courtney Lin</strong>, interestingly enough, is now the new voice of Princess Peach for Nintendo, first playing the role in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-all-characters-in-mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>. Overall, it seems like a great lineup and one many will enjoy hearing when it launches on September 25th, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/judas-creative-director-talks-villainy-system-and-development-progress/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/judas%E2%80%99-creative-director-talks-villainy-system-and-development-progress.1282362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Judas’ creative director Ken Levine has broken Ghost Story Games’ silence on the state of the game, offering the a new look at how the game is shaping up. Instead of waiting months between trailers and “fancy imagery”, Levine says these “lo-fi” updates will give players more frequent insights into development while the team keeps its main focus on finishing the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-judas-villainy-and-relationship-system">Judas’ Villainy And Relationship System</h3>



<p>One of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the biggest updates</a> comes in the form of a new feature called Villainy. Unlike BioShock or BioShock Infinite, where the antagonist was fixed, Judas will let players determine who the villains are. The game’s “Big 3” characters can be drawn to the player as friends and allies, but if ignored, they may turn into enemies. </p>



<p><strong>“From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals,”</strong> Levine says.</p>



<p>The update also reinforced the game’s focus on character-driven storytelling. Inspired partly by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis System, Judas aims to take things deeper by making relationships with the Big 3 emotionally meaningful. Characters will try to earn the player’s trust through bribes, saving them in fights, gossiping about rivals, or even sharing secrets. Losing one of them is meant to feel like losing a friend.</p>



<p>In contrast to BioShock Infinite’s Elizabeth, who players came to know well but who didn’t really know the player, the Big 3 in Judas will actively observe your actions. They’ll react to how you handle combat, crafting, hacking, and especially how you treat the others.</p>



<p>As for when players can get their hands on Judas, the team isn’t ready to commit. While development is moving forward and milestones are being hit, the studio says it wants to avoid announcing a release date that could slip. </p>



<p><strong>“But we know Judas is not really a game until the players get their hands on it, and that’s a day everyone on the team is working toward,”</strong> he said.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>As part of No Man’s Sky’s big Voyagers update, patch notes for the latest version are now available. The new update, called Update 6.0, is the third largest in No Man’s Sky’s almost decade-long release. While it had a nightmare launch, No Man’s Sky has grown in popularity and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-new-steam-review-rating/">redeemed itself</a>.</p>



<p>Voyagers now allows players to customize their spaceships, called Corvettes, however they’d like. While it is the highlight of Update 6.0 of No Man’s Sky, other improvements have been made to several aspects of the title. For example, load times have been shortened and multiple bugs have been fixed to ensure the best possible experience. </p>



<p>The full patch notes can be found below for No Man’s Sky and <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/voyagers-update/">on the official website</a>. The game has grown quite a bit, with no signs of stopping, so keep it at Insider Gaming for more like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-beacon-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-launches-massive-omega-update-with-free-trial/">updates</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-corvette-class-starships">Corvette-class Starships</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added a new class of starship, the Corvette. Corvettes are large, fully bespoke ships with furnished interiors, capable of accommodating multiple passengers.</li>



<li>A lightweight tutorial for assembling your first Corvette will activate upon first collecting a Corvette module or interacting with the Corvette Workshop.</li>



<li>A large catalogue of snappable structural and decorative modules is available for Corvette assembly, including habitation modules, hulls, wings, engines, windows, accessways, weapons, reactors, shield generators, connectors and decorative peripherals.</li>



<li>Corvette modules can be unearthed from salvage containers buried on worlds across the universe, as well as discovered in Derelict Freighters.</li>



<li>Modules can also sometimes be retrieved from defeated pirates, freighter cargo pods, crashed freighter crates, frigate expeditions, or received as rewards for completing missions.</li>



<li>Structural Corvette modules are collected individually in the inventory and spent directly when assembling a Corvette.</li>



<li>While standing within a Corvette, specialised furnishings and a selection of base decorations can be installed in the ship’s interior.</li>



<li>Internal modules can be installed without limitation, but require resources to construct.</li>



<li>Habitation modules (“habs”) form the main living area for Corvette-class starships. Habs are available in three distinct classes: Titan, Thunderbird, and Ambassador, each with its own sci-fi aesthetic. Installed furnishings reflect the style of their hab, and multiple habs placed adjacently are automatically linked with doorways.</li>



<li>Multi-storey Corvettes can be assembled with the installation of internal stairways.</li>



<li>Several installable Corvette modules have practical functionality, such as the Living Wall, Nutrition Unit, Refiner Unit and Mission Radar.</li>



<li>A number of Corvette modules are linked to technology upgrades, automatically improving the Corvette’s stats alongside its appearance.</li>



<li>Corvette Workshop terminals can be found aboard the Space Station. These terminals provide an interface through which collected Corvette modules can be assembled into a pilotable, habitable starship.</li>



<li>The terminal also provides access to a shop for purchasing basic Corvette modules, and a barter interface for trading advanced Corvette modules.</li>



<li>The Corvette Workshop can store a draft Corvette, allowing work-in-progress edits to be saved and returned to at a later time.</li>



<li>A nearby cache will collect any overflow of refunded Corvette modules if there are too many to store in the player’s inventory.</li>



<li>The Corvette benefits from an especially powerful pulse drive, which moves faster than single-occupancy ships.</li>



<li>Corvettes can autopilot to space stations, discovered planets, and mission destinations.</li>



<li>Corvettes can also be set to autopilot along the current flightpath.</li>



<li>Corvette accessways are accompanied by a specialised teleporter, allowing the ship to hover above especially mountainous or difficult terrain, while passengers beam themselves to and from the planetary surface.</li>



<li>Added support for multiple physics worlds, enabling players to travel stably and walk on foot around fast-moving Corvettes.</li>



<li>Spacewalking is now a fully supported mode of navigation, allowing players to leave their ships (or freighters) and use their jetpack to fly among the stars.</li>



<li>Added a number of Corvette-specific visual effects for engines and landing.</li>



<li>Added new audio effects and ambient environments for Corvettes.</li>



<li>Added specialised camera handling for piloting Corvettes and navigating their interiors.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-corvette-multiplayer-missions">Corvette Multiplayer Missions</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added a Corvette-based mission board, allowing players on board the Corvette to register as mission crew to co-operatively complete objectives in the local system and earn rewards and standing.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-corvette-expedition">Corvette Expedition</h3>



<ul>
<li>Expedition Nineteen, Corvette, will begin shortly and run for approximately six weeks.</li>



<li>Rewards include new posters, decals and titles, the vigilant jetpack trail and plasma starship trail, an exclusive deadeye cannon module for Corvettes, and the unique Mecha-Mouse robotic companion.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-skyborn-exosuit-and-jetpack">Skyborn Exosuit and Jetpack</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added the 5-piece Skyborn Exosuit to the Appearance Modifier, including armour, gloves, boots, legs and torso customisations.</li>



<li>Added the Skyborn Jetpack to the Appearance Modifier.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-twitch-drops">Twitch Drops</h3>



<ul>
<li>A new package of Twitch drops will begin shortly. Sign up and connect your platform accounts on the Twitch Drops page, then tune in to Twitch to earn exotic base parts, high-tech starships, fireworks, appearance modifications, and more.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-gameplay-and-quality-of-life">Gameplay and Quality of Life</h3>



<ul>
<li>Implemented support for rebinding controls on console.</li>



<li>Rearranged a number of input bindings in the controls menu for improved usability.</li>



<li>Added a graphics option to adjust the strength of blurring / light scattering on distant objects in underwater environments.</li>



<li>On PC and MacOS, added text translations for system-level dialog boxes (for example, when the operating system reports a graphics driver error).</li>



<li>Improved the visibility of the “Switch Base” control, for selecting which base to edit while within the perimeter of multiple planetary bases, or within both a planetary base and a Corvette.</li>



<li>Added the ability to copy and paste No Man’s Sky Friend Codes on PC and MacOS.</li>



<li>Improved the appearance of several dialog boxes on the boot and pause screens.</li>



<li>Added “scroll on hover” functionality to a number of UI buttons that could overspill in non-English languages.</li>



<li>Improved the mouse scroll speed in the base building menu.</li>



<li>Increased the number of planets featuring buried ancient bones.</li>



<li>Increased the number of planets featuring buried salvageable scrap.</li>



<li>Salvageable scrap containers are no longer guarded by corrupt Sentinels.</li>



<li>Prevented Echo Locator hint notifications from appearing when a harmonic camp was already locally marked, or while within the perimeter of a camp.</li>



<li>Improved the system for displaying the estimated remaining time to a destination on HUD markers, resulting in much more accurate time estimates and tick-down speed.</li>



<li>The landing pad readout at the Space Anomaly now indicates where your ship is docked, and accurately reflects landing space availability.</li>
