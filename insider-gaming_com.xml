            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One player has gone viral for spending an astonishing $32,000 in NBA 2K25 in just five months on microtransactions.</p>



<p>The clip was posted to <a href="https://x.com/Troydan/status/1953657155896095112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, which showed YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2KOGGaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2KOG</a> going through his microtransaction purchases for NBA 2K25 on the PlayStation Store, where he revealed that he’s spent an astonishing $32,831.68 on the game.</p>



<p>The clip reveals that transactions started on March 31, 2025, and ended on August 5, 2025, the date the clip was recorded. All of the transactions are for the game’s Virtual Currency Pack, with the highest costing $160.48 each.</p>



<p>You can watch the full clip below:</p>

<p>The YouTuber himself revealed that he’s learned his lesson from spending such a large amount of money, and warned others that it’s not worth chasing cards or spending large amounts of money for content creation. </p>



<p>What’s worse is that despite him spending $32,000, he’s still not obtained all of the best cards in the game. In fact, just by watching his video, he would probably need to spend an equal amount of money to get near completion.</p>



<p>“One things for sure, I will not spend this much again, because you don’t get rewarded for it. As much as I spent, I should have everything in the game, but it’s not even close,” he said. </p>



<p>NBA 2K26 also releases on Setpember 5, 2025, which will make all of his purchases pretty useless if he was to move on to the next game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98biggest-open-beta-ever%E2%80%99-is-celebrated-as-success-continues.1266555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last night, the Battlefield 6 open beta hit more than 500,000 concurrent players <strong>on Steam alone</strong>. It shattered records held by Call of Duty and pushed past 850,000 peak viewers on Twitch, widely representing the fact that <strong>Battlefield is back</strong>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the Battlefield team reiterated that this is the largest open beta in Battlefield history, as if we didn’t already know that. The hype is skyrocketing, the excitement is at unprecedented levels, and the future of Battlefield is (finally) looking bright.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-peak-times">Peak Times</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1954179027834474694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on social media, EA’s Battlefield Comms team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is Battlefield’s biggest Open Beta ever. </p>



<p>Peak time is approaching and queues will be expected. We’re working on entry times to the game, but appreciate your patience as you wait for your time to arrive. </p>



<p>We want everyone to experience a smooth and fair Open Beta, including those currently within the game too. </p>



<p>Thank you for your continued excitement for Battlefield 6’s Open Beta!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even issues with Battlefield 6’s first cheaters haven’t hampered the fun too much. The Javelin anti-cheat engine is doing a great job at nipping that in the bud, with almost half a million attempts at cheating being caught by the system. <span>Some will inevitably</span> get through, but after many hours in the beta, I’m happy to say I’ve seen no suspicious behaviour.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is set to drop on October 10, which could be mere weeks before the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The performance of the beta has given fans a renewed sense of adoration for the series, and there’s now a hope that this will be the year that Battlefield batters Call of Duty in the leaderboard stakes.</p>



<p>Have you jumped into the Battlefield 6 beta yet? Let me know what you think on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Someone at Ubisoft might have made a boo-boo by posting early about a Far Cry television series reportedly in development at FX. Eagle-eyed users spotted the post on the Ubisoft site and relayed it across social media, but the article was quickly removed and the link set to redirect to the site’s home page.</p>



<p>They weren’t fast enough for the avid internet users who captured snippets of the post, revealing some cast and crew information and a lowdown on the show’s envisioned season structure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-darkest-and-most-absurd">‘Darkest and Most Absurd’</h2>



<p>Far Cry is a legendary series from Ubisoft, but it has been a fair few years since the series has had any time in the spotlight. Far Cry 6 emerged in 2021 and became regarded as one of the worst games in franchise history, so it seems Ubisoft is eager to take a little extra time finessing Far Cry 7 (or whatever it’ll be called).</p>



<p>In a recent post on <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft’s news site</a>, it was revealed (potentially prematurely) that a Far Cry TV show is in production at FX. The post has now been removed, but not before users could capture and share information on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mac (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Mythic Quest, Welcome to Wrexham) and Hawley (Fargo, Alien: Earth) are the co-creators of the Far Cry series. Hawley will also serve as showrunner, while Mac is set to star in the show. The series will be executive produced by Mac, Hawley, and Jackie Cohn for More Better Productions; Michael Garcia for 26Keys Productions; Nick Frenkel for 3Arts Entertainment; and Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill for Ubisoft Film &amp; Television.</p>



<p>“This collaboration is really an embarrassment of riches. Far Cry a psychological tailspin that doesn’t shy away from the darkest and most absurd parts of humanity, which aligns perfectly with FX’s bold and fearless storytelling style,” said Margaret Boykin, head of film and television content, Ubisoft Film &amp; Television.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that while the article was deleted, the slug remains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>far-cry-series-adaptation-in-the-works-at-fx</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That tells you all you need to know.</p>



<p>One of the most recent Far Cry stories to drop exclusively here at Insider Gaming concerned the extraction-based multiplayer shooter that’s in development at Ubisoft with the Far Cry name attached to it. In March, our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Henderson revealed</a> the game had been rebooted internally.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-open-beta-hits-500-000-concurrent-players-on-steam-and-passes-call-of-duty-all-time-high.1266420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has smashed past the 500,000 concurrent player mark on Steam, surpassing Call of Duty’s all-time high of 491,670.</p>



<p>The milestone was hit just minutes ago as the game sees its first Open Beta date kick off today (the past two days were a closed Beta period with limited access).</p>



<div><p>While the comparison against Call of Duty is somewhat unfair, it’s worth noting that Battlefield 6 is in an Open Beta period, and its concurrent player count success does not reflect how many people will buy the game when it launches on October 10, 2025.</p><p>However, the game has smashed past Call of Duty’s all-time high for Steam, which includes the highly popular and free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone and any betas that have taken place over the past couple of years. </p></div>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported that Activision executives were not worried</a> about Battlefield 6’s success because Call of Duty is “too big to fail”. But perhaps the recent success has had executives rethinking that thought.</p>



<p>Of course, Call of Duty will remain one of the highest-selling games each consecutive year, but there has to be some props given to EA and Battlefield Studios for turning around the franchise. </p>

<p>Sentinels CEO Rob Moore believes the introduction of team bundles to Marvel Rivals is “critical” for the future of the game in the Esports scene.</p>



<p>Still in its infancy, Marvel Rivals has created a storm on the Esports front, luring big names to make the jump from Overwatch. Other pros have been attracted from the likes of Fortnite and Halo.</p>



<p>An impressive showcase at the Marvel Rivals Ignite Mid-Season Finals in Guangzhou is evidence that NetEase holds the cards required to become a mainstay on the scene. However, speaking exclusively to Insider Gaming at the event, Moore is adamant the next step must be team bundles and skins.</p>

<p>“The real key is what happens next. In terms of skins that are part of the game for tournaments, or something to continue to reward the investment in the game.</p>



<p>“That is a critical element of having organisations continuing to invest, showing that support. I think that’s the one key additional step that needs to take place.”</p>



<p>Moore confirmed that no talks between Sentinels and the Marvel Rivals team have taken place yet for such an addition, though he hopes it is a “priority” and pointed to other Esports that have introduced those items as “really having helped the economics of the game.”</p>



<p>Although there is no concrete news on whether team bundles or the like will be added to Marvel Rivals, Esports Tournament lead Adam Huang <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1953474966185214111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed to Jake Lucky</a> that they need to be considered and more needs to be offered to teams beyond the initial prize pools up for grabs.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Marvel Rivals could be adding esports skin bundles in the future👀</p><p>"We have to launch something similar to team bundles… maybe bundles that contribute to the players, teams, and grand finals prize pools" <a href="https://t.co/TlV92MCJN5">pic.twitter.com/TlV92MCJN5</a></p></div>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1953474966185214111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>While Moore is hopeful more will be offered by Marvel Rivals in the future, he was clear in his praise for the efforts so far and the quick impact that NetEase has made on the Esports scene.</p>



<p>“As an organisation, we really try to prioritize getting into new games that have a lot of growth, and we saw this early, it took off. We had the opportunity to be one of the first brands in the game.</p>



<p>“Netease has made a real commitment to the esports game and really supported it, you can see with what they have put on, bringing in all the teams early so they can boot camp. All in all, it’s been a really good event considering it’s the first they’ve put on.”</p>



<h2 id="h-next-marvel-rivals-finals-will-be-bigger-amp-better">Next Marvel Rivals Finals Will Be ‘Bigger &amp; Better’</h2>



<p>Next on the agenda for Marvel Rivals’ Esports scene is Stage 2 of the Ignite Regionals, culminating in the Grand Finals later this year. Speaking to Insider Gaming, game director Guangguang outlined his hope that tournament, which could take place outside of China, will be “bigger and better.”</p>



<p>“We are so glad to see many professional teams and media friends joining the tournament. This is our first time holding an offline tournament like this, so we’re feeling the challenge. </p>



<p>“We’re working very hard and focusing our effort on making a better game to see players enjoy themselves.</p>



<p>“This offline tournament is a different environment from the in-game environment, so we will try to make the finals bigger and better.”</p>
