<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> is one of the most legendary franchises in gaming history, with a series stretching back over fifteen years. It’s an iconic, open-world collection that boasts ambitious adventures, immersive stories, and memorable characters. But, given that there are dozens of games in the series, we’re asking (and answering) an all-important question: ‘Can you play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed/">Assassin’s Creed</a> in any order?’</p>



<p>Some die-hard fans might have their ideal chronology, but in this guide, we’re looking on a more general scale. If you’re wondering what order to play Assassin’s Creed in, look no further than this guide.</p>



<p>Perhaps you can use it to get an idea of the size of the franchise ahead of the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows on February 14.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-assassin-s-creed-games-are-there">How Many Assassin’s Creed Games Are There?</h2>



<p>It’s a rich and storied franchise that can be traced back to 2007. It’s a little-known fact, but <em>Assassin’s Creed’s</em> origins rest with <em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/prince-of-persia/">Prince of Persia</a></em>. It was later revealed that 2007’s <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> title, which kicked off the franchise, was an experiment, with the project being twisted from the failed development of a<em> Prince of Persia</em> game. </p>



<p>In total, there are <strong>13</strong> major <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games and several more spin-off titles that were typically released on handheld consoles and mobile devices. It’s a franchise that has taken players from Ancient Greece to Victorian London, and with each new release, the lore gets richer, deeper, and more immersive.</p>



<p>With that in mind, can you play<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>in any order?</p>

<h2 id="h-can-you-play-assassin-s-creed-in-any-order">Can You Play Assassin’s Creed in Any Order?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Technically, no restrictions are blocking you from playing<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>in whatever order you so desire, but some barricades might make the experience a little confusing.</p>



<p>For instance, if you wanted to soak up the entire timeline in order of release, you’d start with <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> (2007) and end with <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage </em>(2023). But, if you wanted to play the series in chronological order, you’d start with <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> (2018) and end with <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em> (2015). </p>



<p>With the most recent releases, Ubisoft pivoted to an RPG-based model, with each game more or less being a standalone title with only a few concepts and aspects connecting them. For instance, Assassin’s Creed Origins (2017), Assassin’s Creed Odyssey (2018), and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (2020) can all be experienced as standalone games but there is an underlying story that connects them.</p>



<p>It’s not as jarring an experience as if you were to play the older games as standalone titles, though. For example,<em> Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood</em> (2010) was a direct sequel to <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> (2009). The former game starts in the exact scenes where the latter game ends, so if you’ve not played<em> Assassin’s Creed II</em>, <em>Brotherhood </em>will be disorienting until you’ve managed to catch up on the story.</p>

<h2 id="h-does-that-answer-your-question">Does That Answer Your Question?</h2>



<p>If you’ve been wondering what order to play<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> in, we hope that’s cleared things up. There are a few ways to soak up the franchise, but ultimately, it’s up to you in which order you play the games. Realistically, if you were to play them in order of release, you’d be neck-deep in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games for several hundred hours.</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s best to start with the most recent titles and track backwards if you want to learn about the origins of the series and what it all means. You can also skip some games if you don’t feel like they’d interest you. It’s your journey, after all. There might not be any one ‘best Assassin’s Creed order’.</p>

<p>It was almost ten years between Dead Island 2 being revealed and it being released – and fans are hoping that history doesn’t repeat itself. During the closing scenes of Dead Island 2, there are suggestions made that point to a follow-up title being delivered, but we need to dig into that idea to see the truth in it.</p>



<p>Is Dead Island 3 coming out? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-long-until-dead-island-3-is-released">How Long Until Dead Island 3 Is Released?</h2>



<p>Dambuster Studios, the developer that finally created Dead Island 2 in all its zombie-slaying glory, is reportedly ‘prepared for Dead Island 3.’ In <a href="https://gamerant.com/dead-island-2-release-sequel-threequel-when-dambuster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with Game Rant</a>, one developer at the studio revealed that the team has ‘set the stage’ for an eventual release of Dead Island 3, given how the second game closes out. </p>



<p>It’s very open-ended – but don’t worry, I won’t spoil it here.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the ending – and how it was laid out – would facilitate an expansive sequel, but is Dambuster Studios truly committed to delivering it? Are we going to have history repeat itself, seeing Dead Island 3 announced and then put on a back burner for ten years?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Dead Island 2 suffered so greatly because it kept changing hands. If it stays with Dambuster Studios – which it should – then there’s almost no doubt that Dead Island 3 will come out at some point in the next few years.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 was an overwhelming success, with many post-apocalyptic gamers being all too eager to get their hands on a game that they’d waited a decade for. It secured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-2-1m-sales-zombies/">over one million sales</a> in a relatively short time – just a few days. It went on to remain successful, with Dambuster releasing a string of expansions and content drops that kept the player base fully engaged for many months to follow.</p>



<p>But what about a sequel?</p>



<p>Ultimately, to answer the question, ‘Is Dead Island 3 coming out,’ we’ll have to say that we honestly don’t know – but we can wait and hope that something is revealed in a year or two, perhaps. </p>

<p>The esports industry continues to expand at an alarming pace, getting bigger each year with more games being added to the competitive collection. For a game to be considered ‘an esports game’, it simply needs to foster a competitive multiplayer environment – which means <strong>many </strong>games fit the bill.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re looking at every esports game coming out in 2025. Which are you most excited about?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-esports-games-coming-out-in-2025">All Esports Games Coming Out in 2025</h2>



<p>This list represents every esports game either confirmed to be or <strong>expected </strong>to be launching in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-deadlock">Deadlock</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Valve’s Deadlock is one of the most anticipated esports games out there. It was kept on the DL by Valve for the longest time until it could be contained no more. In 2024, it stormed the charts on Steam, presenting users with a fresh and exciting hero shooter environment that’ll be set to rival Overwatch and Marvel Rivals if it’s one of the esports games coming out in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gears of War once fostered a solid esports ecosystem, but times changed. There are high expectations that E-Day, an all-new adventure set in the Gears of War universe and a prequel of sorts, will bring back Gears esports once and for all. We don’t know what that’ll look like, but it’ll be good to see if it has a competitive environment if it’s released in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fortnite-ballistic">Fortnite: Ballistic</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a first-person competitive shooter built in the heart of the Fortnite platform. It’s everything you know and love from Fortnite intertwined with traditional multiplayer elements from the likes of Counter-Strike and VALORANT. It’s everything you’d expect from an esports game, and it’s expected to release in full, graduating from early access, later in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fragpunk">FragPunk</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>FragPunk is a brand-new IP from Bad Guitar Studio. It’s a gaudy, colourful five-vs-five hero-based FPS with plenty to offer, and it has impressed users in beta testing. It’s set to be released on March 6, 2025, making it one of the first new esport games releasing in 2025. It has a unique ‘powerup card’ mechanic that keeps gameplay as fresh as possible, which is well-needed in today’s world.</p>



<h3 id="h-virtua-fighter-6">Virtua Fighter 6</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>At The Game Awards 2024, Sega unveiled ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’, which many have dubbed Virtua Fighter 6. It’s the first new game in the series in almost twenty years, and it’ll be a nice addition to the stacked FGC roster. It <strong>could </strong>launch in 2025, but it’s not at all guaranteed. Instead, keep an eye open for Virtua Fighter 5 REVO, a remaster of sorts of the last game, released in 2006.</p>



<h3 id="h-splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Splitgate 2 is expected to be one of the fastest-paced shooters on the market when it drops in 2025. It’s a high-octane, energetic shooter that uses portals to empower players to traverse the map in genius ways, but under the hood, it’s a typical multiplayer title with oodles of esports potential. </p>
