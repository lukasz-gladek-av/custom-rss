<p>The sequel to Subway Surfers, Subway Surfer City, releases on February 26, 2026; interested players can pre-register now. </p>



<p>Subway Surfers is undoubtedly not only one of the most popular endless runners out there, but also one of the most-played mobile games. I know I have spent hours on end trying achieve the highest score and beat all my friends. Fans of this game can now look forward to a brand new sequel, which introduces a lot of new stuff. </p>







<h2 id="h-subway-surfers-city-release-date-revealed">Subway Surfers City Release Date Revealed </h2>



<p>Revealed through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/subwaysurfers/status/2011831031184138243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Subway Surfers City arrives next month with new gameplay mechanics, game modes, challenges, and improved visuals. A new press release on <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260115285583/en/SYBO-Announces-Subway-Surfers-City-The-Long-Awaited-Next-Chapter-to-Subway-Surfers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Wire</a> by the developer SYBO reveals some of the new mechanics players will be able to try out. </p>

<p>The game will introduce a “<strong>stomp move</strong>” that can be used to reveal hidden advantages, a “<strong>bouncy bubblegum shield</strong>” that can enhance your jump abilities, and more. </p>



<p>Additionally, there are three new modes to look forward to once Subway Surfers City is released. <strong>Classic Endless</strong>, the endless runner experience where players chase new high scores. The <strong>City Tour</strong>, which is a finite game mode where players will progress through levels, complete goals and explore districts while completing missions and finding hidden stars. Lastly, there is the <strong>Events</strong> mode, which will feature a rotation of finite runs and trials. </p>



<p>The original Subway Surfers game crossed 4.5 billion lifetime downloads in 2025, making it the most downloaded mobile game of all time, so the sequel has some pretty big shoes to fill. </p>

<p>The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake has been in the pipeline for years from Ubisoft, but reports suggest that the sands of time could be running out on its release date—courtesy of a shadow drop.</p>



<p>A shadow drop never goes amiss. Last year’s Oblivion Remastered shadow drop drama was absolute cinema. When the moment came for Bethesda to drop one of the greatest RPGs ever onto all of our laps at a moment’s notice, the world lost its mind. The long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-rated-by-esrb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> isn’t <em>quite </em>on that level, but it would be incredible if Ubisoft dropped a late Christmas present.</p>

<p><strong>Insider Gaming cannot confirm or deny the existence of a Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake shadow drop happening imminently, but it would line up with the reported belief of a <strong>mid-January 2026</strong> release.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re an Insider Gaming regular, you know the site’s coverage of Ubisoft titles is exceptional. If you’re new here, IG has followed The Sands of Time Remake’s journey since the beginning. An exclusive story even revealed everything about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sands of Time Remake</a> and its shaky development.</p>







<p>On May 14, 2025, it was confirmed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake Would Release by April 2026</a>. Suddenly, we’re not too far from the end of the window.</p>



<p>After that, Insider Gaming dropped another exclusive, featuring an update on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sands of Time Remake update</a>. Sources revealed that the Sands of Time Remake was targeting a ‘<strong>mid-January 2026′</strong> launch. It’s believed that Ubisoft wanted to release the POP: The Sands of Time Remake before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leaks-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake</a>, and this could be the case.</p>



<p>But drama unfolded on January 15, when a report from the <a href="https://x.com/popuniverseX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@popuniverseX</a> account (which has been suspended as a result) revealed that a ton of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time images and files were uploaded between December 31, 2025, and January 13, 2026.</p>



<p>The most intriguing file was one that had “game-release-tomorrow” in it! </p>



<p>Make of this what you will. Can Insider Gaming say for certain that a Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake is happening for certain? No. But don’t be surprised if Ubisoft suddenly drops the announcement in the coming days.</p>
