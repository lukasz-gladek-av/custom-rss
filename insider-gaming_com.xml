<p>Ahead of next week’s Xbox Developer Direct, the Forza Horizon 6 release date may have been leaked. An alleged screenshot has made its way online that appears to show when players will get their hands on the next installment in the popular racing series.</p>



<p>Early Wednesday morning, Xbox Infinite posted the screenshot online that says that the Forza Horizon 6 Premium Edition will open up for players on May 15. With the ability to “play 4 days early”, that would suggest a Tuesday, May 19 release.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-else-is-coming-with-forza-horizon-6">What Else Is Coming With Forza Horizon 6?</h2>



<p>In addition to the early access release date, the image, which looks like an ad for the game, mentions other features for those who buy the Premium Edition. Those include:</p>



<ul>
<li>VIP Membership</li>



<li>Welcome Pack</li>



<li>Car Pass</li>



<li>Time Attack Car Pack</li>



<li>Italian Passion Car Pack (coming post-launch)</li>



<li>2 Premium Expansions (coming post-launch)</li>
</ul>



<p>Players will also get a “pre-tuned and exclusive” Ferrari J50 if they preorder the game. </p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 was first announced in September at Tokyo Game Show. The game heads to Japan for the first time, and will feature more than 550 cars in what is being labeled as <strong>“Forza Horizon’s biggest open world driving adventure yet”.</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As always, none of this has been confirmed by Xbox or Playground Games, nor has it been independently verified by Insider Gaming. Until that happens, please take the information with a grain of salt.</p>







<p>The first look at gameplay for the upcoming racing title will come during the aforementioned Xbox Developer Direct showcase on January 22 at 1pm ET/6pm GMT. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the event and bring you all of the latest details. </p>
