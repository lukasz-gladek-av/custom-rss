<p>Corinne Busche, the director of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and longtime BioWare employee, has joined Wizards of the Coast’s Skeleton Key Studio. The news was confirmed in by Wizards of the Coast’s Dan Ayoub.</p>



<p>In a new interview with Stephen Totilo’s <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-preps-an-edgy-snake-eyes-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, Ayoub confirmed that Busche has joined the studio as a creative lead on a new game currently in production. It’s the studio’s first game since opening in 2022.</p>



<p>Skeleton Key had been working on two projects, but cut one of them in order to streamline its focus. Since then, Ayoub says that a “vast majority” of those who were working on the cancelled project have moved over to the unannounced game.</p>



<p>News of Busche’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure from BioWare</a> became public in January. The move comes after she spent 18 years at the Canadian-based studio. Busche has yet to comment publicly on her new role. At the time she said that she didn’t want people to “read too much” into her departure. </p>



<p>“I want to encourage everyone not to read too much into this,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/corinnebusche.bsky.social/post/3lfxyo5h5vk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">she said</a>. “This was my decision so I could continue making the kind of RPGs you (we) enjoy. Thank you for the outpouring of love and support. You mean the world to me.”</p>



<p>What do you think the new game in development at Skeleton Key is, and Dragon Age’s former director Busche joining the team?

<p>One of the biggest sports superstars (or SIU-perstar) and soccer sensation Cristiano Ronaldo is officially joining the roster of playable fighters in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. One of the most popular figures in sports and social media will have a soccer-themed set of attacks, and can hit his trademark celebration.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-closest-cristiano-ronaldo-will-ever-come-to-joining-wolves">The Closest Cristiano Ronaldo Will Ever Come to Joining Wolves</h2>



<p>Ronaldo <a href="https://x.com/Cristiano/status/1904942189102182598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that he would join Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves today, announcing the news to his 115.1 million followers on X (the third most on the platform). He also posted the trailer on his Instagram account, where he has the most followers of anyone on the world: a staggering 651 million followers. Ronaldo will be voiced by voice actor Juan Felipe Sierra.</p>



<p>One of the most recognizable faces in sports and social media is now joining one of the most recognized and beloved fighting game franchises. The original Fatal Fury: King of Fighters released in 1991, and was created by Takashi Nishiyama, the creator of the original Street Fighter. The series was immensely popular in the 1990s, but an original game has not released since Mark of the Wolves came out in 1999, though there have been several ports of different titles in recent years.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>News of the first Fatal Fury game in over 20 years first emerged at EVO 2022, when a new title was announced on stage at the world’s biggest fighting game tournament. Street Fighter characters Ken Masters and Chun-Li will join the roster as part of the first season of downloadable content. Ronaldo was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ronaldo-fatal-fury-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first linked to Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves back in September</a>, when he posted a teaser that said: “A legendary player joins a legendary game.” Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is also one of several titles that will be featured at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this summer; Ronaldo currently plays in the Saudi Pro League for club Al Nassr.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-exclusives-are-dominating-playstation-store%E2%80%99s-pre-order-charts.1145655/</guid>

<p>Xbox exclusives like Indiana Jones, The Great Circle, and Forza Horizon 5 are at the top of PlayStation Store’s pre-order section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-forza-horizon-5-best-selling-playstation-5-ps5-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, if you head over to the PlayStation Store’s pre-orders <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/3bf499d7-7acf-4931-97dd-2667494ee2c9/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a>, it is visible that Xbox exclusives are dominating the PlayStation Store. Moreover, it’s not just one edition of these games; both standard and premium editions of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle and Forza Horizon 5 are the most pre-ordered games on the PlayStation Store right now.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-exclusives-have-overtaken-playstation-exclusives-in-pre-orders">Xbox Exclusives have Overtaken PlayStation Exclusives in Pre-Orders</h2>



<p>Interestingly, in pre-orders, Xbox exclusives have overtaken PlayStation exclusive Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. The game’s digital deluxe edition stands at the 6th position in the pre-order charts, and the standard edition barely reached the top 10 (at the time of writing). Third-party title, The First Berserker: Khazan’s standard edition is 5th in the PlayStation Store’s pre-order charts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at their performance, it seems like Xbox made the right decision by bringing their exclusives on PlayStation. Players are ready to invest money not just in the standard editions of the game but also shell out more to get access to additional content for these titles. Interestingly, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle’s pre-orders opened just a few days ago, and they have already beaten every other game on the PlayStation Store within such a short period.</p>



<p>In other news, an Xbox blog post accidentally leaked a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-blog-post-accidentally-leaks-steam-tab-in-user-interface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam tab in its UI</a>. Also, PS5 is outpacing PS4 sales, while Xbox Series <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-is-outpacing-ps4-while-xbox-series-trails-xbox-one-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trails behind</a> Xbox One. What are your thoughts on Xbox exclusives’ dominance of the PlayStation Store’s pre-order charts?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/triple-i-initiative-2025-every-studio-involved/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The second annual Triple-I Initiative takes place on April 10, 2025, and will feature 37 game announcements from 36 studios. Games like Enshrouded and Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core are confirmed to be involved, but they won’t be the only titles on the show.</p>



<p>Like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-game-shown-at-the-triple-i-initiative-2024-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year’s debut</a>, this year’s event wont include any hosts or general advertisements. Instead, it focuses solely on games and those who make them. The showcase will feature revealed, new gameplay, demo announcements, and release date details.</p>



<p>While we don’t know all of the games making an appearance, we do know all of the studios involved with the this year’s showcase. And, based on the studios appearing, certain games could be expected to make an appearance like Endless Legend 2 from Amplitude and Outbound from Square Glade Games. Even Unfrozen is part of the showcase as they work on the new Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. The rest is up to speculation and guessing. </p>



<p>The original Triple-I Initiative featured games like Slay the Spire 2, The Rogue Prince of Persia, The Last Spell, Flintlock, V Rising, and more. If that’s any indication of what to expect, than fans should be in for quite a treat.</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of studios involved in the 2025 Triple-I Initiative below. And stick around on the day of the event for full coverage from Insider Gaming.</p>
