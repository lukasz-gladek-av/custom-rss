<p>The director of Chainsaw Man is working on a new roguelite horror game on Roblox called The Inn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/534957/article/chainsaw-man-director-reveals-his-next-project-is-a-roblox-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, The Inn’s official <a href="https://x.com/TheInnRoblox/status/1909996710543421643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) revealed the upcoming Roblox game with a new trailer recently, informing players that Ryu Nakayama, the director of Chainsaw Man, is directing the title. Nakayama is known for his work on projects like Jujutsu Kaisen, Yatterman Night, and more. Nakayama hasn’t worked on a game before The Inn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Inn’s trailer starts with the players stepping into a traditional Japanese inn, which seems inviting from the outside but dreadful from the inside. We see some rooms engulfed in flames, supernatural beings popping up in jump scares, blood splattered everywhere, and other horror elements. No release date or window was provided for the game. </p>



<p>On the Chainsaw Man Director’s personal <a href="https://x.com/r_nkym_/status/1910016940346859949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account, Nakayama revealed that he is working on the Roblox Horror Game in collaboration with Mayflower. It is his “first time working on a game” and has been a “challenging and exciting” experience. The director added that even though he knows that Roblox is a popular platform in North America,&nbsp; he is “deliberately trying to give it a stronger Japanese feel” (as translated by Google on X).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nintendo’s Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild and its DLC will set players back $90 for its Nintendo Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>That’s according to the mathmagician wizard out there (not really), who have calculated that whichever way you try to get the game and its DLC on the Nintendo Switch 2, it’s going to be $90.</p>



<p>That’s because Nintendo are notoriously bad for not discounting its games, no matter how old they are.</p>



<h2 id="h-90-quick-maths">$90, Quick Maths</h2>



<p>I first spotted these amazing calculations by Paul Tassi at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/04/11/nintendo-says-switch-2-breath-of-the-wild-is-90-with-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>, but basically, $90 is the number you get to no matter how you try and play the game on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For those looking to buy the game outright, it will set you back $70, plus the $20 DLC taking you to $90. For those looking to upgrade from the original Nintendo Switch version, you’ll still have to buy the game for $60 and need to buy the “enhanced” edition for an additional $10. Add on the $20 for the DLC and you’re at the $90 price point once again.</p>



<p>The news likely adds even more frustration to what has been a disastrous reveal for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s $450 console price point (which could still increase in the US following all the tariff shenanigans) has been a constant cause for debate in the community. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – Nintendo Switch 2 Games Will Cost Up To $98 For Physical Games When Converted From Euros</a></strong></p>



<p>Admittingly, though, it’s a console that’s still going to fly off the shelves, but I’m personally finding Nintendo’s greed here a little hard to stomach, especially given the current economic climate. It seems like whichever way we look at it, more expensive games are going to be hitting us sooner rather than later. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/has-schedule-1-been-sued-lawsuit-controversy-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1 is one of the most impressive success stories of 2025. The indie drug-dealing game is a hit sensation on Steam, but a lawsuit controversy has jeopardized that feel-good story. </p>



<p>The concept of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> is simple. Players start as small-time drug dealers and work their way up, producing drugs and distributing them. However, It’s not always smooth sailing, as law enforcement and rival cartels will force you to defend your empire. </p>



<p>While relatively straightforward, the addicting gameplay loop is a massive draw. In only a few weeks after launching,  Schedule 1 reached nearly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/#:~:text=You're%20a%20small%2Dtime,coast%20city%20of%20Hyland%20Point." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a million concurrent players</a> at its peak. The meteoric rise inspired <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console port imitations</a> as other developers tried to steal the magic formula. Yet, Schedule 1 also faces similar clone accusations. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-schedule-1-being-sued">Is Schedule 1 Being Sued?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Schedule 1 puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer. Image via TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Schedule 1 is not being sued</strong>, <strong>but the game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/#:~:text=April%204%2C%202025-,Schedule%201%20Being%20Investigated%20For%20IP%20Copyright%20Infringement%20Claims,full%20investigation%20into%20the%20game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under investigation</a> for IP copyright infringement</strong>. </p>



<p><a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes</a> published a document titled “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>



<p>Movie Games S.A. already had an established foothold in drug-dealing games with Drug Dealer Simulator 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator 2 before Schedule 1, raising questions about whether it is too similar. </p>



<p>The investigation is strongly looking into: “Elements of the game’s plot, mechanics, as well as UI – User Interface.” It finishes by saying: “The Issuer will immediately inform about further actions related to the pursuit of claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and the act of unfair competition in subsequent current reports.”</p>



<p>When news about the investigation surfaced, Schedule 1 fans lept into action and review-bombed the Drug Dealer Simulator games on Steam. The feud forced Movie Games to respond. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-schedule-1-be-sued">Will Schedule 1 be Sued?</h2>



<p><strong>If the investigation concludes that the similarities between Schedule 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator’s game plot, mechanics, UI, or anything else are too close, a lawsuit could be filed. </strong></p>



<p>After the incessant review bombing of Drug Dealer Simulator, Movie Games stepped forward and cleared up any confusion with a post on its <a href="https://x.com/MovieGamesSA/status/1909573722219888913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official X account</a>. </p>



<p>The company made it abundantly clear, “<strong>There is no lawsuit</strong>,” and it’s not the company’s intention to “<strong>Prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game</strong>&nbsp;[Schedule 1].” The statement goes on to say the investigation is being conducted because of the similarities, and “Movie Games, being a publicly traded company,&nbsp;<strong>could face severe litigation for negligence.</strong>“</p>



<p>Movie Games emphasized, “There is no ill will toward TVGS,” and they “<strong>Emailed them best wishes shortly before the release.</strong>“</p>



<p>Despite the reassuring statements, the investigation is ongoing, and we won’t know if there will be a lawsuit until it concludes. </p>



<hr>



<p>The investigation hasn’t slowed down the creation of new content for TVGS. Schedule 1 has an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive roadmap</a>, including the addition of fishing, shooting, mini-games, and more. In addition, the game regularly receives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new updates</a> to ensure an enjoyable experience. </p>
