<p>The reveal of the nominations for The Game Awards 2025 is coming next week, according to new social media. With the show coming out on December 11th, 2025, we won’t have to wait long to know the winners.</p>







<p>Started in 2014 after separating from SpikeTV, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-most-watched-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> have grown in size and scope since then. Celebrating the best of the year, the show, hosted by Geoff Keighley, is home to several big reveals and moments, which can overshadow things a bit. Even still, with a year as big as 2025 was for games, the competition is sure to be worthy of watching. Plus, with Prime Video users now able to watch it, even more can tune in for the big ceremony. Well, we now know what games will be up for the big awards, including the highly-anticipated Game of the Year category, in less than a week. </p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1989073068938211349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Twitter/X post</a>, the official Game Awards account finally revealed that <strong>nominations for the awards show</strong> will go live on <strong>Monday, November 17th, 2025</strong>. A livestream announcing all of the titles will happen on <strong>Monday at 9 am PT/12 pm EST</strong>. To find out when it’s live in your time zone, <a href="https://everytimezone.com/s/99b6fbcf">click here</a>. In years past, the videos have ranged from 8-10 minutes and go over every category, lastly having Game of the Year. You’ll be able to watch it go down on YouTube, Twitch, and other social media. We at Insider Gaming will also post the full nominations once available, so stay tuned for that!</p>



<p>As mentioned before, 2025 has been host to several amazing games. From independent games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/french-president-applauds-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Blue Prince to AAA titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-final-launch-trailer-playstation-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a> and Donkey Kong Bananza, the competition is fierce. While The Game Awards isn’t the ultimate say-so for what’s the best game of the year, past winners have been called as such. 2024’s Astro Bot and 2022’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-expansion-dlc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a> are still highly regarded. Though, with 2025, it won’t be as clear-cut as other ceremonies.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crystal-dynamics-hit-with-more-layoffs-due-to-%E2%80%98reorganization%E2%80%99.1353226/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the third time in 2025, Crystal Dynamics has laid off more of its staff. As for why, it states that it’s due to reorganizing that is ‘necessary’.</p>







<p>Since 1992, Crystal Dynamics has delivered a solid lineup of games that many hold dear. From the epic Legacy of Kain series to the iconic Tomb Raider franchise, the company has a great legacy behind it. In recent years, however, it hasn’t lived up to that degree. Its last big release, 2020’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-avengers-final-update-makes-nearly-all-cosmetics-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Avengers</a>, was a commercial and critical flop. Unfortunately, the one project hoping to change that, Xbox’s reboot of Perfect Dark, was cancelled earlier this year. Now, after two already devastating layoffs, another one has come, this time firing 30 workers.</p>

<p>In a LinkedIn post by the company, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released a statement</a> regarding new layoffs. This time, it is letting go of around 30 staff members, though from which departments is unknown. As mentioned before, this is the third round of layoffs the company has had. The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-holds-layoffs/">happened in March</a> with 17 employees, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-layoffs/">the second in August</a> after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark’s cancellation</a> with an undisclosed amount. </p>



<p>“<strong>Today we’ve made the difficult but necessary decision to reorganize Crystal Dynamics’ studios and teams</strong>,” the team stated on LinkedIn. “<strong>As a result, we’ve parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation</strong>. Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition.”</p>



<p>As with last time, Crystal Dynamics assures fans that Tomb Raider is still in development. In fact, it stated that <strong>“…as the realities of the industry continue to evolve, we’ve made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future.</strong>“</p>



<p>Layoffs are sadly not uncommon in the gaming industry, but the past few years have been terrible. Whole studios like Monolith Productions and games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-medias-fault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rares-everwild-cancelled-amid-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a> shuttered instantly. Hopefully, the people affected will land on their feet and wish the best to them on their journey.</p>







<p>What do you think of the Crystal Dynamics layoffs? Is it disappointing to see? Still excited for the next Tomb Raider?
