<p>Ubisoft‚Äôs ‚ÄòProject U‚Äô, which was in development at Ubisoft Annecy has had its intro cinematic leaked online.</p>



<p>In November 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> that the game was put back into incubation following five years of development.</p>



<p>The footage, which was uploaded to YouTube by known leaker Shaun Weber shows off the games intro cinematic, which sets the tone for the game. You can watch the intro below (expected to soon be DMCA‚Äôd)</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Project U, which was internally called ‚ÄòPathfinder‚Äô was set to be a new take on PvPvE, officially being announced in September 2022 as a ‚Äúnew kind of session-based cooperative shooter.‚Äù</p>



<p>According to sources, the game faced constant pushbacks and delays due to the games replayability, which also saw the games budget explode in size. Five years on, the game still wasn‚Äôt up to par, and Ubisoft pulled the plug on the project.</p>



<p>However, instead of cancellation the game entirely, it‚Äôs understood that the game went back to an internal incubation team because of Ubisoft‚Äôs belief that PvE games could still be successful. The team cited Helldivers 2 as being a particularly successful PvE game that could work well in today‚Äôs climate.</p>



<p>As for what Project U will turn into or if it will eventually be cancelled remains to be seen, regardless, it is nice to see (in my opinion at least), a little bit of the project made public.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Project U cinematic? Does it interest you in the game? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov‚Äôs Scavs Have Been Upgraded Based on Community Feedback]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-scavs-upgraded/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-scavs-have-been-upgraded-based-on-community-feedback.1128429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-scavs-upgraded/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games recently carried out a survey in Escape from Tarkov geared towards gathering feedback centered on the ‚ÄòScav‚Äô player character. When folks play Escape from Tarkov, they can do so as a PMC, which is their dedicated character, or as a Scav, which is a randomised ‚Äòlocal‚Äô character that has many restrictions and drawbacks.</p>



<p>Following the collection of the survey results, Battlestate Games has already implemented some major changes to Scav characters. It was stressed that further changes are in the pipeline.</p>



<p>Find out below what Battlestate Games has done to upgrade Scavs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-scav-life">Scav Life</h2>



<p>The feedback received from the recent Escape from Tarkov survey revealed that 64% of players want to be able to ‚Äòplan and control‚Äô where their Scav character can go, which is mostly centered around picking the map they want to explore. Additionally, 84% of players confirmed that they only play as a Scav to perform loot runs and secure items to upgrade their in-game Hideout.</p>



<p>By comparison, 30% of players said that playing as a Scav should be truly random, right down to which map the player is forced to explore. Also, 2.6% of players admitted that they never play as a Scav character, and 6.6% play as a Scav to actively seek out PvP scraps with PMC characters.</p>



<p>To improve the state of play with Scav characters since the survey, Battlestate Games has made af few key changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Player Scavs will now spawn no earlier than 17 minutes <strong>after </strong>the start of the raid on all maps except for Reserve, Factory, and Ground Zero.</li>



<li>The Scav equipment system has been improved, and a higher fence rep will now reward a player with better Scav gear.</li>
</ul>



<p>It was then promised that more optimisations are coming to the role that 97% of Tarkov players enjoy.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov remains at the top of the table where extraction shooters are concerned. It has been around for almost ten years and shows no signs of slowing down. In just a couple of months, players will be transitioning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">into another ‚Äòwipe‚Äô event</a>.</p>



<p>Do you play as a Scav in Escape from Tarkov? What would you like to see changed? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It has been a silly amount of time since the first trailer for GTA 6 was released by Rockstar Games. In December 2023, we got our first look at the upcoming game, and since then, things have run completely flat. Many rumours and proposed release dates for the second GTA 6 trailer have come and gone time and again, and right now, we have <strong>no idea </strong>when the next snippet will drop.</p>



<p>Recently, Rockstar Games took a break from not promoting GTA 6 to back something else entirely ‚Äì a new Danny Dyer movie. It‚Äôs bizarre, but there‚Äôs a method to the madness that led to the gaming titan promoting a small British movie.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-proper-naughty-comedy">‚ÄòA Proper Naughty Comedy‚Äô</h2>



<p>Everyone is on tenterhooks, wondering when the next GTA 6 trailer will be released, but Rockstar is keeping tight-lipped. It seems that gamers worldwide have plundered the first trailer clean of every tidbit and detail, and there‚Äôs nothing left to be discovered ‚Äì not that everyone is giving up, of course. </p>



<p>In an unexpected post on social media, Rockstar took a moment to promote Danny Dyer and Nick Love‚Äôs new British movie, Marching Powder.</p>



<div><article><p><span>From our friends Nick Love and Danny Dyer, the absolute legends behind The Football Factory‚Ä¶

</span><a href="https://twitter.com/MarchingPowder_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MarchingPowder_</a><span> ‚Äî a proper naughty comedy out tomorrow in the UK and Ireland.

Get tickets now at </span><a href="http://marchingpowderthemovie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marchingpowderthemovie.com</a><span> and look out for details on worldwide release soon.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Fans have already theorised that this is a clear nod to Danny Dyer appearing in GTA 6, potentially reprising his ‚ÄòKent Paul‚Äô character, which was last seen in 2004‚Äôs GTA: San Andreas. Others more privy to the situation have recollected how Rockstar Games was a <strong>producer </strong>of the movie penned in the recent social media post ‚Äì The Football Factory.</p>



<p>Given that the GTA universe split in 2008 when GTA 4 was released, it seems highly unlikely that Kent Paul is returning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/">in GTA 6</a>, but never say never, right?</p>



<p>Keep on waiting for that trailer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-xbox-exec-believes-microsoft-wouldn%E2%80%99t-make-consoles-if-they-had-a-choice.1128345/</guid>

<p>In the last few months, the concept of ‚Äòeverything being an Xbox‚Äô has skyrocketed. Following a marketing campaign from Xbox that stressed just that notion, many have questioned the company‚Äôs future in the hardware market. It‚Äôs no big secret that Team Green has fallen behind PlayStation in recent years, and the goal to make Xbox an ecosystem without technical borders is front and centre.</p>



<p>One former executive ‚Äì one of the most eccentric, by some accounts ‚Äì has gone on record suggesting that Microsoft wouldn‚Äôt make consoles if the tech titan had the choice. In an ideal world, Microsoft would drop hardware and focus on delivering games to all kinds of devices.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-classic-netflix-model">‚ÄòThe Classic Netflix Model‚Äô</h2>



<p>If you so desire, you can pick up an Xbox controller and play games <strong>right now </strong>without owning an Xbox console. That‚Äôs possible through Game Pass apps, cloud solutions, VR headsets‚Ä¶ You name it. You no longer need to have an Xbox console in your home to be an Xbox fan.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs what Peter Moore, one of the most prolific former Xbox executives, said during a recent podcast appearance. He appeared on Danny Pe√±a‚Äôs show to discuss console wars, the propagation of first-party games on other platforms, and Microsoft‚Äôs status in the console space.</p>



<p>When asked if Microsoft should keep going with hardware, Moore explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If they had the choice, would they make hardware? No. Would they be delighted if they could be a multi-hundred-billion-dollar entity delivering content directly to your television or to whatever monitor you choose to play on? You bet.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs the classic Netflix model. No latency, no lag ‚Äì you‚Äôre in, and there doesn‚Äôt need to be a box between you and your controller and the TV set. Still, consoles are ‚Äì as we‚Äôve seen particularly with Nintendo now‚Ä¶ People love their hardware.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-did-encourage-the-battle-playstation-vs-xbox-console-war-was-healthy-but-has-lost-its-feistiness-peter-moore-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> for the initial quote.</p>



<p>In many ways, Microsoft is already leaning towards this future, but recently, rumours surfaced suggesting that developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/">are already crafting games</a> for the next-generation Xbox platform. That rumour was tied to whatever Call of Duty game is coming in 2026, but as with all rumors like that, take it with a pinch of salt.</p>



<p>Do you think Microsoft should quit making consoles and focus on the software side of things? Let me know in the comments.</p>
