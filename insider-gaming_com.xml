<p>A purported Gears of War Collection has been a frequent topic of conversation in recent times. It’s a rumored remake or remastering of many legendary Gears titles, and if you’re eager to learn more, we’ve gathered the latest details on a possible collection of classics.</p>



<p>Gears of War was once one of Microsoft’s most powerful franchises. From day one, its first few sequels sold like hot cakes as fans lapped up the lopping off of Locust heads. Fatigue eventually kicked in, and the famous franchise has stagnated in recent years due to the dwindling popularity of Xbox.</p>



<p>We could be set for a Gears resurgence thanks to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-official-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War E-Day</a> and a potential Gears of War Collection. Let’s dispense with the dialogue and do some digging.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-gears-of-war-collection-release-details">Do we Know Gears of War Collection Release Details?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Eye see you there. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The latest reports indicate a Gears of War Collection could release in mid-2025—possibly August 2025.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is all speculation, so take the information with a trusty pinch of salt. But leaker <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Detective Seeds</a> claims the <strong>Gears of War Collection is already on storefronts</strong>. They also claim the release period is likely to be <strong>mid-August</strong>.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Gears of War collection should be releasing early to mid August.  It is PS5 pro enhanced, but I have been told NO Multiplayer PVP, campaign focus only.</span></p></article></div>



<p>This would back up industry insider <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden</a>‘s previous report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War is coming later in 2025</a>. Leakers and insiders tend to have exclusive information (as we know ourselves) that is usually correct. All signs point toward a Gears of War Collection and an assortment of remade or reimagined Gears titles in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-games-could-be-in-gears-of-war-collection">Which Games Could be in Gears of War Collection?</h2>



<p><strong>Currently, rumors and leaks can’t identify which Gears of War games will be added to the Collection—it could be any number of games from Gears of War 1 to Gears 5.</strong></p>



<p>The only report so far—also from Jez Corden—indicates <strong>Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition</strong> could be one of the games. One crucial aspect seemingly known about the collection is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-collection-will-feature-co-op-but-no-pvp-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op is present, but there’s no multiplayer</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll update this if concrete details are revealed or rumors intensify.</p>



<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-collection-platforms-rumors">Gears of War Collection Platforms Rumors</h2>



<p><strong>The possible Gears of War Collection could release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>The headline here is <strong>Gears of War arriving on PlayStation hardware for the first time</strong>. Gears has long been a treasured Xbox exclusive. However, we already know several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox games are coming to PlayStation</a>, making this expected and no longer a shock.</p>



<p>YouTube leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a> claims the collection “Will be revealed during the Xbox Showcase later this year.” It’s all a lot to take in, but it’s an interesting and exciting time for the games industry. Check back as we try to find out more about the rumored Gears of War Collection.</p>

<p>The latest Xbox update for members of the Xbox Insider program is resetting consoles to their factory default settings. This, according to many who’ve gone through with the update.</p>



<p>The problem arises for those who have installed the Alpha or Alpha Skip-Ahead updates. When installed, Xbox profiles, Quick Resume information, and console settings are wiped. To make matters worse, the update is mandatory for insiders.</p>



<p>A quick visit to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Insider subreddit</a> sees a number of posts complaining about the issue. Many are requesting the update be pulled offline, but it doesn’t appear anyone has heard from the company.</p>



<p>“I totally understand that programs like this are here to find problems like this but it’s the complete lack of action on the development team when a bad update goes live on a test branch and it stays live for 18+ hours,” said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/1j4n9bj/comment/mgbh7r1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user</a>.</p>



<p>One thing the update doesn’t appear to do, at least, is deleted any local game save data on the Xbox consoles. As of publishing, Microsoft has yet to comment on the issues. Insider Gaming has reached out for an official response.</p>

<p>2K’s annual tradition of unveiling a ton of post-launch superstars continues. WWE 2K25’s sizable roster will grow thanks to the confirmed release dates for many DLC characters, and you can start your training right now.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wwe-2k25-ratings-roster-confirmed-so-far-every-superstar-legend-dlc-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25 offers a roster</a> so big it would tower over Andre The Giant, Big Show, Omos, and The Great Khali combined. There’s a ton of hype for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>, so much so that players are already grabbing their tickets through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-wwe-2k25-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>.</p>



<p>Getting your ticket to the dance is one thing, but what about the afterparty? The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-season-pass-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2K25 Season Pass</a> is the perfect remedy for those who want a rollicking Royal Rumble of talent to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>The WWE 2K25 Season Pass includes Five full Character Packs introducing new wrestlers and the Supercharger Pack to inject more content into WWE 2K25 after launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re wondering why many of your favorite in-ring stalwarts are missing, there’s a good chance they’re being saved for the upcoming <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25 DLC</a>.

<p><strong>A new piece of DLC is arriving pretty much every month between now and the end of November 2025. The Supercharger Pack is available from launch, meaning you can jump into its contents straightaway.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll have a brief gap in August of this year. Other than that, a new Character Pack is inbound in most months. It’s likely 2K will completely shift focus and turn its attention to WWE 2K26 after this.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-showcases-a-deep-dive-into-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows%E2%80%99-hideout-feature.1126863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new Assassin’s Creed Shadows blog post, Ubisoft has released new information on the Hideout feature coming to the game.</p>



<p>As briefly explained in the introduction, the Hideout will be the players base of operations and a fully customizable sandbox allowing you to build your perfect home.</p>



<p>The Hideout will be located in the Izumi Settsu province and is surrounded by hills on all sides for protection. Its said that the Hideout will be a acre of fully customizable land, which players are able to place buildings, pavilions, pathways, bushes, trees, ponds, mossy rocks, local flora &amp; fauna, and countless other Japanese cosmetic elements found or acquired throughout their journey.</p>



<p>“We really want players to make the Hideout their own” says Dany. “Throughout your adventure, most of the content for customization keeps unlocking as you progress, so your customization options will truly reflect your journey.” The building tools are simple enough for everyone to draw up a quick and easy layout, but there’s enough depth to sink hours into crafting your vision.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the Hideout, players will be able to create six main rooms, which are:</p>



<h2 id="h-main-rooms">Main Rooms</h2>



<p><strong>Tomiko’s Hiroma</strong><br>Tomiko’s main house and gathering hall is already built when players first get their hands on the Hideout. This building is the cornerstone of the Hideout, granting quick access to most of the important functions of the Hideout. It can be changed cosmetically, but the Hiroma cannot be moved or removed.</p>



<p><strong>Stables</strong><br>An important pillar of your Hideout, the stables unlock the ability to use your scouts for smuggling stockpiles in enemy camps or castles; doing this will allow you to receive extra resources at the end of a season.</p>



<p><strong>Forge</strong><br>The Forge unlocks the ability to upgrade your weapons and gear to higher tiers, which is crucial for staying strong as you level up. It also allows you to dismantle unwanted armor and weapons into raw materials, engrave new perks on existing gear, and unlock the transmog feature for customizing your look and weapons, accessible in the inventory menu.</p>



<p><strong>Kakurega</strong><br>This unlocks the ability to purchase and claim safehouses around Japan. These safehouses extend the Hideout’s functions to distant areas, as well as unlock safe fast travel points well outside enemy territory. Some features, like the regional contract boards, can be accessed from here as well. As mentioned in our exploration article, kakurega are also great to refill your tools, replenish your scouts, or manage the allies you want to bring on your next missions.</p>



<p><strong>Study</strong><br>The Study increases the maximum number of scouts and refines the search zone when scouts locate an objective on the World Map, optimizing objective investigations.</p>



<p><strong>Dojo</strong><br>The Dojo unlocks the ability to train Naoe and Yasuke’s allies that can be recruited and called in combat, elevating their ranks and increasing the power of each of their unique skills.</p>



<p>In addition, players can also create seven themed rooms which are:</p>



<h2 id="h-themed-rooms">Themed Rooms</h2>



<p><strong>Tera</strong><br>Adding a Tera (altar) in the Hideout boosts the amount of XP players can gain while venturing out in the world, effectively acting as a 10% XP booster.</p>



<p><strong>Jinja</strong><br>Shinto shrines around the world allow players to pray and earn a small stat boost – called a boon – for a few minutes. The Jinja’s presence in the Hideout magnifies the effects of any shrine’s boon encountered in Japan.</p>



<p><strong>Nando</strong><br>The Nando – a kind of barracks for sleeping and storing personal items – makes recalling scouts that have been used less costly – a function that extends to all Kakurega safehouses.</p>



<p><strong>Zashiki</strong><br>Apart from the cool factor of owning your very own&nbsp;<em>sake</em>&nbsp;room, the Zashiki&nbsp;increases ration efficiency (health restoration) for both Naoe and Yasuke.</p>



<p><strong>Tea Room</strong><br>This Tea Room also increases ration efficiency – an effect that can be compounded with the Zashiki bonus.</p>



<p><strong>Gallery</strong><br>A place where players can display armor sets and weapons they’ve acquired, which unlocks the possibility of creating equipment loadouts.</p>



<p><strong>Generic Rooms</strong><br>Players have access to a variety of rooms with varied layouts for showing off their earned cosmetics such as outfits, wall art and more.</p>



<p>For more customization options, players can also join rooms together and decorate them to their hearts content. The Hideout aaims to be the players safe place, where they can spend hours creating their perfect home.</p>



<p>“Once recruited, allies will spend a significant amount of their time in the Hideout, working, resting, training, and otherwise occupying themselves during their down time. Building new rooms will diversify the actions that they can perform there – allies with an inclination for martial training might spend more time in the Dojo, while others with a taste for&nbsp;<em>sake</em>&nbsp;might enjoy spending time in the Zashiki,” the blog reads.</p>



<p>You can read more about the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Hideout feature on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/75Ec8tj1T1Y0mqJTLVE4fD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Ubisoft blog</a>.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows officially launches March 20 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>
