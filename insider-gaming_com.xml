<p>Marvel Rivals devs recently spoke about drawing inspiration from Hazelight Studios’ It Takes Two when they had performance issues with Dr Strange’s portals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Strange’s portals in Marvel Rivals are one of the strongest abilities for strategic gameplay. The character can create a portal between any two points on the map, providing a direct line between those two points. However, while developing this ability for the character, Marvel Rivals developers were worried about the performance issues it might cause in the game, and to bypass this issue, they took inspiration from It Takes Two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-surprising-game-helped-improve-doctor-strange-portals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Marvel Rivals senior graphic designer Tieyi Zhang recently spoke about drawing inspiration from It Takes Two at a panel at GDC 2025. Zhang talked about how the Unreal Engine game (It Takes Two) “simultaneously renders two views without catastrophic overhead”, which made him wonder whether this game uses “some magic” he doesn’t know about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Marvel Rivals’ breakthrough came after “discovering the local function, creating a local player.” Zhang realised that adding a local player “automatically enables split-screen rendering via distant cameras.” The report reveals that Marvel Rivals devs didn’t go through It Takes Two’s source code. The problems were solved by researching how Hazelight addressed its performance issues and using a similar strategy for Marvel Rivals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While speaking on a panel at GDC, Pocketpair’s John Buckley, who leads the Pocketpair Publishing arm of the firm, took a deep dive into the rampant and overwhelming success of Palworld. In January 2024, Palworld – which was dubbed ‘Pokémon with guns’ – was released to the open market, going on to secure <strong>25 million players </strong>in a single month.</p>



<p>To this day, Pocketpair still has no idea how or why Palworld was such a roaring success, as Buckley revealed at GDC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-things-started-to-get-weird">‘Things Started To Get Weird’</h2>



<p>On the panel at the Game Developer’s Conference, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley reeled off his impression of the release of Palworld, which took place a little more than a year ago:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We quickly go over a million wishlists within the first year, so we knew that something was happening, and it kept going.</p>



<p>2023 was when things got really weird – we rose to number three on Steam wishlists, then we hit a crazy peak around November 2023. People always ask us, ‘Why? What happened? How did you get so much attention?’ But we don’t know. If we knew how to do it, we’d do it again, but we have no idea what happened.</p>



<p>Within this first week, we hit this disgusting number that makes me feel sick when I see it.</p>



<p>Why did we get this many players? I don’t know, please don’t ask me. I know someone will ask me after, but I promise you we don’t know the answer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/we-hit-this-disgusting-number-that-makes-me-feel-sick-palworld-devs-dont-know-why-their-survival-game-was-so-successful-if-we-knew-how-to-do-it-wed-do-it-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>Palworld became one of the best-selling games in history, shattering player count records and skyrocketing up the charts on social and streaming platforms worldwide. It was an overnight sensation, and it became the talk of the town mere hours after hitting the market.</p>



<p>Pocketpair could barely handle the weight – and Epic Games struggled as well. The popularity of the game brought servers offline, struggling under the stress of the sheer volume of people trying to play the game.</p>



<p>While the player count has understandably petered off by now, Palworld remains a popular title that’s being updated by Pocketpair all the time. It wasn’t exactly a flash in the pan.</p>



<p>It’s tough to understand exactly why Palworld was such a success. Perhaps it’s the disbelief that it was ‘allowed’ to exist or the sheer inanity of the concept that pulled players in. Pocketpair doesn’t know, and I don’t know either.</p>

<p>Ark: Survival Ascended, the controversial upgrade of the 2015 survival game, is getting a major expansion in November titled ‘Lost Colony’. It’s the first expansion designed specifically for the evolved version of the game, and it’s laying the foundations for the eventual release of Ark 2, which still doesn’t have a date.</p>



<p>It was mentioned by Studio Wildcard, the developer behind the Ark ecosystem, that Lost Colony will ‘connect the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and lead into the events of Ark 2.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-connections">Connections</h2>



<p>The link between Ark: Survival Ascended and Ark 2 is front and centre in Lost Colony, which features the vocal talents of Auli’i Cravalho, of Moana fame. She represents Meeka, a character revealed in the 2022 trailer for Ark 2, which also starred Vin Diesel. </p>



<p>To kick off 2025, Studio Wildcard revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2399830/view/526457668016013820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a two-year roadmap</a> for Ark: Survival Ascended that runs until December 2026. It’s relatively safe to assume that Ark 2 won’t be released before then, but if the later updates for Survival Ascended aren’t all that meaningful, perhaps Studio Wildcard could manage with a skeleton crew working on the ‘old game’.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583650/ARK_Lost_Colony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lost Colony</a> looks like a unique expansion at first blush. It’s fused with anime-style cutscene pieced together by MAPPA, a Japanese studio famed for the likes of Attack on Titan and Chainsaw Man. It’s being dubbed a ‘massive canonical expansion pack’ that’ll ease players into the impending world of Ark 2.</p>



<p>Players will get to explore Arat Prime, a frozen wasteland while battling their way through new enemies, exclusive ability trees, and fresh building systems. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Lost Colony and the release of Ark 2? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with Epic Games around Escape from Tarkov Arena, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov explained just how long it takes to develop a single weapon for the popular extraction shooter series. Escape from Tarkov has been on the market for almost a decade, and in that time, it has amassed a staggering arsenal of weaponry, but it’s not all that easy to add <strong>more</strong>.</p>



<p>Typically, new weapons will be introduced with major updates to the game – otherwise known as ‘wipes’. The weapons, Buyanov says, can take <strong>several months </strong>to be designed, created, coded, and balanced in Escape from Tarkov, and by association, Arena.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-putting-in-the-effort">Putting in the Effort</h2>



<p>In the discussion <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-interview-nikita-buyanov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Epic Games</a>, Buyanov, who heads the studio at Battlestate Games, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a long and complex process that requires many iterations. We have a large team of game designers and testers who constantly check and refine the balance. We also carefully listen to feedback from our community. Many people are passionate about&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>&nbsp;and eagerly share their comments and impressions with us.</p>



<p>It’s a very slow and meticulous process.</p>



<p>To fully implement a single weapon in the game, with textures, animations, and all the details, takes about two to three months. It depends on the specific weapon. The fastest one we ever made took about a month, but we already had the animations ready. However, for example, belt-fed machine guns <strong>take an average of four months</strong> to complete.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He stressed that the team has a perfectionist attitude towards new weapons because they’re all ‘gun nerds’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We shoot real firearms very often. This is especially helpful for our programmers who work on the gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p>When you fire a real weapon, you hear it, smell the gunpowder, feel the weight, and experience the recoil, something in your mind shifts, and you start approaching weapon creation in the game with much greater attention to detail.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the extraction shooter might not agree with the perfectionist claims, but the weapons in Escape from Tarkov are being adjusted and balanced all the time in a bid to keep as many people as possible happy. Every time a major update surfaces, it seems a new meta emerges, and that’s often by design.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released this week, ushering in a new generation of Ubisoft’s open-world flagship franchise. In the run-up to the game’s release, the title (and Ubisoft itself) has been criticised numerous times for historical inaccuracy and faced intense backlash from ‘anti-woke’ grifters. </p>



<p>It was recently claimed by sources speaking to a French outlet that Ubisoft has prepared an anti-harassment plan, and that lawyers stand at the ready to pursue anyone attacking the company’s employees on social media.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-preparing-for-the-inevitable">Preparing for the Inevitable</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has already faced mass blowback, which has almost always been related to Yasuke, the African samurai representing one-half of the game’s dual protagonist operating model.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is no stranger to facing aggression online at the hands of keyboard warriors, but the chatter around Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been much more volatile than with any other game in the series.</p>



<p>In the report from <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/assassin-s-creed-shadows-pour-ubisoft-il-s-agit-de-sortir-de-l-ombre-ou-d-y-plonger-un-peu-plus_AV-202503170023.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BFMTV</a>, it was claimed by unnamed Ubisoft employees that an anti-harassment plan has been presented to the CSE in Canada – the Communications Security Establishment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s an initiative from Canada. There’s a team that monitors networks and acts quickly in the event of a targeted attack. Unlike what we’ve had before, this is serious.</p>



<p>Messages posted by internet users on X, Reddit, or even videos on YouTube will be closely monitored by a dedicated unit in order to respond quickly to the slightest problem. </p>



<p><strong>Lawyers are already ready</strong> to file complaints in the event of proven harassment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another claim stressed that Ubisoft has ordered a social media blackout of sorts, advising employees to <strong>not mention </strong>that they work at the company online to avoid harassment.</p>



<p>In a statement handed to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/assassins-creed-shadows/ubisoft-anti-harassment-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, Ubisoft’s representatives backed up the initiative to keep employees safe but didn’t mention the specific plan:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our stance has always been that team members’ social media channels are their own. Our top priority is the safety of our employees, including online, which is why, as a standard practice across Ubisoft, we offer guidance on navigating social media, digital safety, and support for team members’ well-being. </p>



<p>We also share resources to help prevent and protect against online harassment, something our teams have unfortunately faced.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released worldwide on March 20. Stay tuned, because later today, my full review of the game will go live and you can get my full impression.</p>
