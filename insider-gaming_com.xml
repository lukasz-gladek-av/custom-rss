            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-path-of-exile-2-free-to-play.1052391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If Path of Exile 2 is free to play, then not only does it follow in the footsteps of the original ARPG, but it also shows the community’s willingness and trust in supporting the eagerly awaited follow-up. Making PoE 2 free would be a huge decision, so let’s dissect Grinding Gear Games’ strategy.</p>



<p>Free to play has become the norm over the last decade. I remember PS4’s Warframe being free to play, and I couldn’t wrap my head around the decision to make a AAA title free. Now, everyone’s doing it, and it’s because the business model is highly sustainable—<em>sometimes</em>. </p>



<p>Path of Exile 1 was released in 2013, it was free to play, and it worked like a charm. Now, in 2024, it’s sequel time, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-path-of-exile-2-pre-download-guide-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>‘s free-to-play status is one of the biggest questions.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play">Will Path of Exile 2 be Free to Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Keep your money to yourself. Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Path of Exile 2 is free to play</strong>, and like its predecessor, requires no money to play, and its main way of generating income is through <strong>optional microtransactions</strong>.</p>



<p>After years of supporting the first game, the developer decided it was time for a sequel. The acclaim and adulation PoE received meant it was entirely feasible for Grinding Gear Games to make PoE 2 a pay-to-play adventure. </p>



<p>Path of Exile continually gained in popularity after its release, and <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/238960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a> shows PoE has barely dipped below 10,000 players a day on Steam since Jan. 2017. The numbers have regularly dipped into the 60K and 70K region—achieving <strong>76,501 concurrent players in Aug. 2024</strong>!</p>



<p>The developer clearly trusts the PoE community, so this is presumably why Path of Exile 2 is once again free to play. If you do intend to support PoE 2, various Supporter Packs are available to buy with the cheapest one offering 300 Points and an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> Key. </p>



<p>Conversely, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3349430/Path_of_Exile_2__King_of_the_Faridun_Supporter_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">King of the Faridun Supporter Pack</a> includes the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>1000 Points.</li>



<li>A Hideout</li>



<li>A Portal Effect</li>



<li>Early Access to Path of Exile 2</li>



<li>Level-up Effect</li>



<li>Three Pets</li>



<li>Three Weapon Skins</li>



<li>Two Armour Sets</li>



<li>Two Back Attachments</li>



<li>Two Badges</li>



<li>Two Forum Titles</li>



<li>Two Hideout Decorations</li>



<li>Two Portrait Frames</li>
</ul>



<p>Path of Exile 2’s future doesn’t necessarily hinge on selling extras, but this surely goes a long way to helping its stability. I’ve no idea how PoE 2 is going to perform compared to the classic before it, but it’s going to be interesting to find out.</p>

<p>More Mortal Kombat insiders have corroborated last week’s claims that Mortal Kombat 1 future DLC has been cancelled.</p>



<p><span>Rumors began to swirl at the end of November when FateUnknown, a known Mortal Kombat 1 leaker, posted on Reddit that the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future DLC for Mortal Kombat 1 had been cancelled </a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to poor expansion sales.</a> </p>



<p>Subsequently, two other Mortal Kombat insiders have since come forward to corroborate the rumor. One such insider is X user (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1704677366629310953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@thethiny</a>, who said, “The final insider has reached out and said that she also heard that there’s no more content after Terminator with a possibility of finishing what they originally had lined up since last year. Her KP3 list was also different. I have officially no hope left.”</p>



<p>KP3 refers to Kombat Pack 3, the next DLC to be released for the game. </p>



<p>As always, Ed Boon has refused to comment on the rumors, but Insider Gaming has contacted NetherRealm Studios for comment on the claims.</p>



<p>As previously pointed out by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mortalkombatleaks/comments/1h0c1lo/comment/lz2xyr9/?share_id=xUcvJ-sw8qJXVkTAM75be&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FateUnknown</a>, characters from Kombat Pack 2, such as Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2, are still to join the roster.</p>

<p>The Holiday season is all about giving, and gamers absolutely love gifts themed around their favorite franchises. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> had one of its most successful launches ever with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, as millions have been enjoying the title ever since its launch on October 25.</p>



<p>As with every Christmas, plenty more players will join the pool after being gifted the game, but if they already have it, what sort of presents would a Call of Duty fan love?</p>



<p>Here’s our Holiday Gift Guide for a Call of Duty fan, so you know exactly what to get them.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> $70 / £70</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 full game</a></li>
</ul>



<p>While it may seem obvious, the best gift you can get a Call of Duty fan this Christmas is the new title, Black Ops 6. While most will likely already have the game, this should certainly be the first consideration when gifting a CoD fan. </p>



<p>If you know what platform they play on, great, and if you know whether they’d prefer a digital or physical copy, even better. If they usually get games digitally, and especially if they have a PlayStation Digital Edition or Xbox Series S, you’ll want to gift them with a voucher for the platform so they can purchase it with ease.</p>



<p>It’s also important to note that the price will vary depending on what edition you purchase, as you may find it cheaper at certain outlets. There are always some great deals around Christmas too, so keep an eye on Black Ops 6 as you may be able to get it on sale.</p>

<p>An amazing gift for any gamer is a SteelSeries Headset, and that’s even more so for a Call of Duty player since it’s an extremely competitive game. Having top-notch audio is essential for detecting footsteps and other audio cues, and SteelSeries are widely regarded as the best.</p>



<p>As an owner of a SteelSeries Headset myself, I can vouch for the quality. No matter what range you go for you’re guaranteed comfort and high-quality audio, but if you have a bigger budget I’d recommend the Arctis Nova 7 Wireless, which is compatible with all platforms. </p>



<p>You should find some great deals on SteelSeries Headsets around the Holiday period too, so keep an eye out on places like Amazon and the official SteelSeries website.</p>

<p>Call of Duty is all about having smooth aim and movement, and the controller is the main instrument for that. So, having a premium controller with extra buttons and customization options can increase performance and that’s something a CoD addict will value greatly.</p>
