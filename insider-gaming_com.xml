<h2 id="h-undisputed-update-1-2-details">Undisputed Update 1.2 Details</h2>



<h3>New Venues</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added Cambrian Hall. Located in the heart of England’s Capital and draped in rich boxing history, fighting at this venue is every prospect’s dream.</li>



<li>Added Atlantis, an underwater aquarium-like venue, located on the ocean bed. Can you keep your composure in the ring when you’re deep under water?</li>
</ul>



<h3>New Cosmetics</h3>



<ul>
<li>All players will receive an additional free outfit for Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk – recreate their historic first fight in all its glory with their fight-accurate outfits.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Career Mode</h3>



<ul>
<li>Introduced the ability for players to move up and down a weight class from their starting weight class. We know this is one a lot of you have been asking for and we’re excited to see you step up to the challenge of becoming Undisputed in not one, not two, but three weight classes with the same fighter!</li>



<li>Introduced the esteemed boxing correspondent Gareth A Davies to the Career Mode media feed, the first in a series of real-life media figures and brands.</li>



<li>Made a range of quality-of-life improvements to the career mode’s UI.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3>General Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Introduced Cruiserweight, Bantamweight, and Light Heavyweight queues to online quick fight and online ranked.</li>



<li>Added new knockdown and knockout animations.</li>



<li>Added an animation that plays when a fighter’s block health has been depleted, giving players better visual feedback during gameplay.</li>



<li>Slightly reduced stamina cost on missed punches and power punches to make combination and pressure fighting a more viable option.</li>



<li>Made a range of quality-of-life improvements to game audio and commentary.</li>



<li>Made performance optimisations to custom characters.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that meant players that quit out of online games on PlayStation weren’t being punished, and the win was not being correctly awarded to the remaining player. This now works as expected.</li>



<li>Many other bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</li>
</ul>
