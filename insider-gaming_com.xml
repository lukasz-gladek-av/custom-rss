<p>Call of Duty has become a mammoth network of games culminating in the infamous CoD HQ hub. But if you’re having trouble playing Warzone, Black Ops 6, or any other Call of Duty game on PlayStation, the serves could be an issue. Let’s take a look at the latest happenings.</p>



<p>Activision has so many CoD games live at once it’s untrue. There are so many different eras of CoD you can enjoy and gameplay styles too. Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer, and Battle Royale, mean there’s something for everyone. Every now and again <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD’s servers</a> go down, and it can be due to issues with Activision’s servers.</p>



<p>There are other circumstances where everything breaks too. If you’re a PlayStation user trying to get into CoD but can’t, the PS servers are probably a big reason why.</p>

<p><strong>The Call of Duty PlayStation servers are not working due to an issue with the PlayStation Network.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been wrapped up in work, your busy life, or anything else, you might not have heard about PSN. PlayStation’s online infrastructure mysteriously went offline on February 8, causing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worldwide outage of PlayStation online services</a>.</p>



<p>No one knows for sure <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-psn-down-how-long-is-it-down-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why PSN is down</a>, and the only details so far come from the <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ask PlayStation X page</a> on social media. The page officially addressed the problem with a quick message: “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN</strong>.”</p>



<p>This does mean <strong>all forms of Call of Duty work elsewhere</strong>. Warzone, Black Ops 6, and any other CoD game currently work just fine on Xbox, PC, and other applicable platforms. If you have another console, or maybe COD Mobile on your phone, this might have to keep you ticking over until the maintenance issue is sorted.</p>



<p>We have pages dedicated to checking the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN server status</a>, to make sure you know the latest information and updates. Other online multiplayer games are being affected, with PlayStation Network’s issues affecting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fortnite-down-on-playstation-now-fortnite-psn-servers-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s online server status</a> too.</p>



<p>Keep checking back to Insider Gaming for the latest updates on the PlayStation Network <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">servers</a>. Let’s hope this isn’t a repeat of the infamous 2011 PSN outage that lasted several weeks!</p>



<hr>



<p>This is especially bad timing with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-play-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty having a free weekend for Black Ops 6</a>. It’s also Double XP too. Are you hoping Activision extends the free trial and Double XP Weekend for all those affected. Discuss it in the comments.</p>



<p>Forget about the PSN troubles for now and check out some CoD content while you wait. We have guides on completing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-the-tomb-main-quest-easter-egg-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tomb Easter Egg</a> and building the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-build-staff-of-ice-wonder-weapon-the-tomb-zombies-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Staff of Ice Wonder Weapon</a>.</p>

<p>PlayStation Network being down is a catastrophic issue for the company and players. Millions of users (myself included) are subscribed to PSN and use PlayStation services regularly. But PSN is down, so let’s look into why this and how long the outage is expected to last.</p>



<p>I still vividly remember the great PlayStation Network outage of 2011. From April 20 to May 14, the community could not use PSN services. This meant no online play, messaging friends, or buying games using the PlayStation Store. It was an awful time, and I wanted to play Call of Duty and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield</a> with my friends.</p>



<p>Déjà vu has struck again in 2025. On February 8, PSN suddenly went down without notice, and it’s been off ever since.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-playstation-network-down-right-now">Why is PlayStation Network Down Right Now?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not again. Credit to PlayStation</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The only thing any of us have been told so far is Sony is “currently experiencing issues” with its PlayStation Network service.</strong></p>



<p>A closer look at the PSN server status tells us “Some services are experiencing issues,” and this applies to all PSN media: Account Management, Gaming and Social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Social, and PlayStation Direct.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ask PlayStation X page</a> posted a single message <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888041723831484682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saying</a> “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN</strong>,” on February 8, and has neglected to comment since. PlayStation further cemented this mystery by having its main X page repost the Ask PlayStation message to its 42 million followers on the platform—but provide no statement itself.</p>



<p>Sony nor PlayStation have commented on the issue. Like PSN right now, we are all in the dark, and the community is understandably getting frustrated at the lack of updates. </p>



<p>With the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-play-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 getting a free weekend</a> and Double XP to boot, many gamers were probably looking forward to kicking back over the weekend and enjoying some gaming.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-psn-coming-back-online">When is PSN Coming Back Online?</h2>



<p><strong>We still don’t know when PSN is coming back online, and there are zero updates or hints as to when.</strong></p>



<p>I wish I could give you more information, and we are doing our best to get the latest on the outage. Keep checking back as we intend to inform you as soon as we can. Furthermore, we have a separate page letting you know the latest on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Network being down</a>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for updates as we hope and pray PSN comes back online sooner rather than later.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shotzzy-haunted-interview-london-cod-league/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shotzzy-is-still-haunted-by-that-interview-and-needs-to-%E2%80%98get-his-get-back%E2%80%99.1103892/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/shotzzy-haunted-interview-london-cod-league/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Shotzzy is one of the most decorated esports players in the business. He’s one of just two competitors to secure a world title in <strong>two </strong>games, and he’s a multi-time champion and MVP. In the Call of Duty League, he’s known as one of the most consistently entertaining and capable players, taking up a key spot on OpTic Texas.</p>



<p>But he’s still not over the interview he gave in London in 2020. During the Madrid Major between January and February 2025, I sat down with Shotzzy and Huke behind the scenes, asking them where they’d like to go next in Europe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-redemption-story">Redemption Story</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas fell hard in the Madrid Major, being knocked out of the elimination bracket by a dominant Carolina Royal Ravens side. For a while, OpTic Texas was the favourite to win, coming into the season hot off a win at COD Champs 2024. The team put up a solid fight, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the competition.</p>



<p>Most recently, OpTic Texas was in the news because Pred, who went on a hiatus from the squad in December 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pred-optic-texas-call-of-duty-league-retur/">rejoined the team</a>, knocking Huke out of his temporary spot on the roster.</p>



<p>In 2020, Shotzzy journeyed to London with Dallas Empire, the team with which he’d win the Call of Duty League Championship later that year. He gave an iconic interview, but it seemed that the bright lights of the big stage put the young superstar on edge, and this was the result:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MOST AWKWARD ESPORTS INTERVIEW EVER!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZ6fz8StG8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Shotzzy</a> in Madrid, I learned that the interview had never left his mind. When I asked if he and Huke would consider going to London for another Call of Duty tournament, Shotzzy said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d say London, yeah. I need to do — I had a really bad interview back then, in London. I’ve got to get my get back on that interview.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since that interview, Shotzzy has gone on to win two world championships in the Call of Duty space and is one of the most entertaining and charismatic players on the mic, so it’s safe to say that if he goes back to London, he’ll be able to ‘get his get back’.</p>

<p>The Six Invitational 2025 is unravelling in Boston, and the group stage has already provided stacks of entertainment. Most recently, I covered comments made by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/m80-gunnar-team-liquid-six-invitational/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M80’s Gunnar</a> following a win over Team Liquid. Thanks to the work of M80, Team Liquid sits in the bottom of the bracket going forward.</p>



<p>The full bracket is now locked in and we have our first matches confirmed for the Six Invitational 2025 playoffs. There are some gems hidden within the fixtures, including a clash between M80 and DarkZero and a face-off between FaZe Clan and SSG that’ll see one team move on to face G2 Esports, the tournament favourite.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-six-invitational-playoffs-are-finally-here">Six Invitational Playoffs Are Finally Here</h2>



<p>G2 Esports has stormed to the top of the standings ahead of the Six Invitational 2025, securing the top seed and earning a bye. The team performed masterfully in the group stage, refusing to drop a map and effortlessly walking all over M80, Liquid, JOEL, and Unwanted.</p>



<p>Alongside Team BDS, Virtus, and FURIA, G2 earned that all-important bye to automatically move one step further in the bracket at the Six Invitational.</p>



<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Team Falcons, Liquid, Oxygen, and CAG have all found themselves in a critical spot in the elimination bracket.</p>



<p>Here are the opening matches for the Six Invitational 2025 playoffs bracket:</p>



<ul>
<li>w7m Esports vs. Unwanted</li>



<li>FaZe Clan vs. Spacestation</li>



<li>Razah vs. Shopify Rebellion</li>



<li>M80 vs. DarkZero</li>
</ul>



<p>From the group stage, JOEL, Team Secret, PSG, and SCARZ were all sent home without making it out of their respective groups. It’s unfortunate, but both SCARZ and JOEL failed to win a single map in the tournament – but they don’t go home empty-handed. Even the bottom-placing teams win $35,000 apiece.</p>



<p>The grand final of the Six Invitational 2025 will take place in Boston on February 16, and it’ll feature an intense best-of-five series. The winning team will secure $1 million, which is one of the biggest single prizes in esports. For the second-place team, there’s still a handsome prize worth $450,000 waiting for them.</p>

<p>The PlayStation Network is the critical backbone of Sony’s entertainment infrastructure, supporting tens of millions of gamers worldwide. Today, our digital, ever-connected world depends on these services staying online – and if they go down, players everywhere will panic. In this guide, I’ll teach you how to check the PSN server status in a couple of seconds.</p>



<p>If you’re sitting there enjoying a game and suddenly discover you’ve been thrown offline, your first question will be: ‘Is PlayStation Network down?’ That’s just common sense – but it might not be immediately obvious how to check service status of PSN.</p>



<p>Read on to learn what you need to do if PlayStation Network is down.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-check-if-playstation-is-offline">Check if PlayStation is Offline</h2>



<p>The easiest way to know if the PlayStation Network is down is to check the central <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN service status page</a>. This is the most common way gamers will check if the PlayStation Network is offline or experiencing any issues.</p>



<p>On the network service status page, you’ll see a breakdown between various services, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Account management</li>



<li>Gaming and social</li>



<li>PlayStation Video</li>



<li>PlayStation Store</li>



<li>PlayStation Direct</li>
</ul>



<p>It might be that one area of the PlayStation Network is down while the rest is online as normal, so make sure the PSN server status page is your first port of call in a suspect outage.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-to-check-if-psn-is-down-on-twitter">How to Check if PSN is Down on Twitter</h2>



<p>If you want to use Twitter (X) to determine if the PlayStation Network is offline, you’re best off following the <a href="https://x.com/askplaystation?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘Ask PlayStation’ profile</a>. This page is managed directly by Sony PlayStation, but admittedly, it’s not the swiftest solution to get updates on PSN server status issues.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Otherwise, you can conduct general searches across social media to see if any gamers are experiencing PlayStation Network outages, or you can use a service <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/playstation-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">like Down Detector</a> to gauge the situation.</p>



<p>If the PlayStation Network is down worldwide, you’ll soon know about it. With the way modern gaming solutions work, when the PSN goes offline, you won’t be able to access <strong>anything </strong>worthwhile on your PlayStation console. It’s a huge pitfall for today’s ever-connected world, and it’s a crux we have to handle as gamers.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-playstation-network-down">When was PlayStation Network Down?</h2>



<p>On February 8, 2025, the PlayStation Network was plunged into darkness for several hours, with gamers worldwide taking to social media to vent their frustration. One of the kickers of this situation was that almost nothing was addressed by Sony, and just a comment was made on social media – and then nothing more for <strong>hours</strong>.</p>



<p>You can read more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about this PSN outage here</a>.</p>



<p>In October 2024, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-issue-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outage lasting several hours occurred</a>, with players losing access to every area of the PlayStation Network.</p>

<p><strong>LATEST UPDATE 9:00PM ET: </strong>Sony has published on social media that it is “aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN.” They then point people to the official PlayStation Network status page for updates where it says they are “working to resolve the issue as soon as possible.” </p>



<p>As of this update, the service remains offline.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: It’s not just you. The PlayStation Network is down for everyone.</p>



<p>Outages began appearing around 6pm ET, according to multiple reports. A visit to the official PlayStation <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status page shows</a> that all services are down, including the PlayStation Store, gaming,  account management, and more.</p>



<p>As of writing there is no official word from PlayStation regarding the outage. Nor is there any idea as to when service will be restored.</p>



<p>Based on a preliminary check, it appears to be only PlayStation Network suffering issues. Other major online services such as Xbox Live, Nintendo Online, and Steam appear to be working as expected. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to provide updates as they become available.</p>

<p>Earlier today, M80 dominated Team Liquid in the group stage of the Six Invitational 2025 tournament. This super-sized event boasts a $3 million prize pool and is one of the most important tournaments in the annual esports calendar, so it comes as no surprise that emotions can run wild.</p>



<p>Following the 2 – 1 win over Team Liquid, M80’s Shaun ‘Gunnar’ Pottorff blew up behind the scenes, with the moments after the victory just about being captured by M80’s social team. </p>

<h2 id="h-it-doesn-t-matter-what-team-i-m-on">‘It Doesn’t Matter What Team I’m On’</h2>



<p>Gunnar has been around the block against Team Liquid. The comments he made following M80’s win in the group stage of this year’s Six Invitational were backed up by cold, hard numbers. In recent years, Gunnar has taken down Team Liquid while being a part of three separate rosters.</p>



<p>He did it with Soniqs, then against with beastcoast, and now with M80.</p>

<p>In 2024, Gunnar and beastcoast stormed to success at the BLAST Manchester Major, securing the organisation’s first major win. That victory included the brutal knocking out of Team Liquid. Beastcoat eliminated the Brazilian squad without dropping a map, before going on to beat Team BDS 3 – 2 in the grand final.</p>



<p>Gunnar had sharp words for Team Liquid following today’s win:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You can’t beat me! You guys just can’t beat me. It doesn’t matter what team I’m on.</p>



<p>That’s three different teams – you can’t beat me.</p>



<p>Three different teams, three different rosters, same f***ing results, bro.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>M80 picked up the former beastcoast roster following the disbanding of the team in the run-up to the Six Invitational 2025. Thus far in the tournament, M80 has performed pretty well, and at the time of writing, the team sat in second place in the group, just a few points behind G2 Esports, the favourite to win the event.</p>



<p>This weekend, the Six Invitational will depart the group stage and enter the playoffs bracket, with the bottom teams in each group being effectively eliminated from the running.</p>
