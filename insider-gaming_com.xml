<p>The Resident Evil Movie’s director has stated that it “adheres more to the tone” of RE4. </p>



<p>We have yet to see an official trailer for the upcoming Resident Evil Movie, but new information about the adaptation seems to emerge periodically. Last time, we learned the movie’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-leak-reveals-link-to-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link to the game series</a>. Now, the director has revealed that the upcoming RE movie will be aligned with the tone of RE4. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-much-bigger-in-scale-than-the-director-s-previous-movies">Resident Evil Movie is Much Bigger in Scale than the Director’s Previous Movies</h2>



<p>Resident Evil Movie’s director, Zach Creggor, was recently interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnKTQ2Xenbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Double Toasted</a> (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-2026-movie-zach-cregger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>) and was asked questions about the adaptation. When discussing the approach, Cregger explained that the upcoming movie is “true to the experience of the games.” The journey the audience would have as a viewer in this movie is similar to a player of these games, where we follow “one protagonist from point A to point B as they just descend deeper and deeper and deeper into Hell.”</p>



<p>Cregger elaborates that he has played “thousands and thousands of hours of Resident Evil,” which has made him well-versed with the franchise’s pacing. He understands that it is “inherently cinematic” and is “really pumped” about the story they are building in this world. The Resident Evil movie features an original story and is very much in line with Cregger’s sensibility and his “sense of tone”. Moreover, “it is just a much bigger scale than Weapons and certainly Barbarian”. </p>



<p>Cregger adds that fans of the Resident Evil movie franchise might not be prepared for what he has planned, but fans of the games “are probably going to be stoked.” </p>

<p>The upcoming Resident Evil movie is more closely tied to the world of the games, the director states. Cregger explains that the upcoming Resident Evil movie probably “lives more” in the world of RE2 and RE3, but it “adheres more to the tone” of RE4. He explains that the game franchise has always been malleable, with every new game featuring different settings and tones. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-being-shot-in-prague-and-shooting-begins-mid-october">Resident Evil Movie is Being Shot in Prague, and Shooting Begins Mid-October</h2>



<p>Zach Cregger has revealed that shooting for the Resident Evil Movie begins in mid-October and is expected to wrap up by January 2026. The movie is being shot in Prague, and when asked why that location, the director explained that it has a rebate that allows them to make this movie with the budget they have. Moreover, it has a talented crew, great stages, and a lot of resources; “it is the right place for it”. </p>
