<p>A reliable insider has revealed that the announcement for Starfield’s PS5 port will not arrive until 2026. </p>



<p>Starfield’s PS5 port is something players have been hearing about since the first lot Xbox titles made it over. We have already heard rumours about the space-adventure title releasing for PS5 in 2026, and now new rumours about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 port</a> have surfaced as well. However, it seems none of this will be officially announced this year. </p>



<h2 id="h-starfield-s-ps5-port-will-be-announced-in-2026">Starfield’s PS5 Port Will be Announced in 2026</h2>



<p>NateTheHate was recently asked on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980100112702660639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), whether he had any new information to share about Starfield’s PS5 launch. The insider replied stating “believe the announcement will be in 2026 unless plans change.” The insider had previously confirmed that the game is indeed releasing for the PlayStation 5, and the “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-is-coming-to-ps5-its-once-again-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intent</a>” of releasing the port should be announced in 2025. However, now it seems that players won’t see an announcement until next year. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-spring-2026-new-expansion/">report</a> from another source had stated earlier this year that Starfield and it’s new expansion should release for PS5 by Spring 2026. Moreover, a Starfield port for PS5 has never been ruled out by Microsoft. When Phil Spencer was asked about this specific topic, he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that “here’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place that it will find players where we would have business success for us.”</p>



<p>In other news, Bethesda teased Starfield ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ in an anniversary post. Additionaly, the developers have mentioned the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next DLC three times</a>, but haven’t confirmed any details.

<p>Football Manager 26 wouldn’t have reached its current level of polish and quality if last year’s entry hadn’t been scrapped, so says Sports Interactive Design Manager Ant Farley.</p>



<p>The game marks a significant step for the franchise as it leaves behind the Sports Interactive Operating System engine in favor of the Unity engine. This change saw Football Manager 25 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/">suffer through</a> multiple delays <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and feature cuts</a> before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-cancelled-after-multiple-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately being cancelled</a> to focus on making sure the game was up to the standards that players have come to expect from the 20+ year franchise.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/interview-football-manager-26-definitely-benefited-from-fm25-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a>, Farley says that canceling last year’s game wasn’t an easy choice to make, but it was necessary.</p>



<p><strong>“There’s no way we’d have been able to reach the same level of quality that FM26 currently has if we shipped FM25,” </strong>Farley said. <strong>“Some of the decisions where we rethought and changed direction, we’d have had to push them out there if we released FM25. And, once they’re out in the world, it becomes difficult to rethink it. We probably would have needed to fix them, rather than rethink them.”</strong></p>



<p>He added that instead of building a complete game, they would’ve been spending more time fixing bugs than anything else. But with the focus shifting towards Football Manager 26 instead, it gave them even more determination to make the best game possible. </p>



<p><strong>“The original disappointment [of the cancellation] “was tangible, but it quickly made way to an attitude of ‘let’s crack on now, we’ve got a chance to make something we are really proud of, ‘”</strong> he said. <strong>“We weren’t proud of FM25, we didn’t think it offered good value for money for our playerbase, and that’s our real motivating factor.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“When we had news of the cancellation, it gave us the determination to get it right for FM26.”</strong></p>



<p>Football Manager 26 launches on November 4. An open beta will be <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/exclusive-football-manager-26-open-beta-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking place starting October 24</a>, with progress being able to be brought over to the full game post-launch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 is Great, But There’s Still One Feature I Want Back]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-feature-i-want-back/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-great-but-there%E2%80%99s-still-one-feature-i-want-back.1329490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 continues to impress gamers, and there’s still an immense amount of life left in a roadmap that’s yet to deliver the game’s first multiplayer season and a free-to-play battle royale component. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my review</a>, I rated Battlefield 6 highly on account of its stellar multiplayer platform, but points were detracted for the less-than-desirable campaign portion of the game.</p>



<p>As I play Battlefield 6, I can’t help but find myself lusting after a feature from bygone days that hasn’t been seen in a Battlefield game since 2018’s Battlefield 5. It’s something I adored in the World War II shooter that added a layer of immersion and ownership, but it’s not present in Battlefield 6, and I mourn the loss of it.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-want-to-fortify-objectives-in-battlefield-6">I Want To Fortify Objectives in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>In Battlefield 5 (2018), users could take over an objective in a mode like Conquest or Breakthrough and set about <strong>fortifying it</strong>. They’d pull out their toolkit and construct everything from tank traps to sandbag walls. They could board windows, dig trenches, install machine gun nests, and set up barbed wire fences.</p>



<p>It was all pre-determined and linear, but it gave players a sense of ownership over an objective. They could capture the spot and then fully fortify it, preparing for the inevitable retake attempt from the opposing team.</p>



<p>It was also a nice way to earn an extra chunk of experience points, with the game’s support class having abilities that allowed them to craft fortifications faster.</p>



<p>Sadly, this feature was removed going into Battlefield 2042 (because the game lacked destruction), and it hasn’t resurfaced in Battlefield 6, which was released on October 10.</p>



<p>This is a shame, as Battlefield 6 has wonderful destruction that can see buildings razed to the ground, and I could imagine fortifications becoming progressively ramshackle as objectives crumble to dust under the weight of incoming fire.</p>



<h6><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-should-battlefield-6-take-from-battlefield-5/">What Should Battlefield 6 Take From Battlefield 5?</a></strong></h6>



<p>The idea came to me again while occupying objective ‘D’ on Liberation Peak, which is a site set in the middle of a road flanked by houses, all of which are begging for fortifications. It would be the best spot to lay some tank traps to prevent vehicular pushes from either end of the street, and the ruined houses are perfect for sandbagging and trenches.</p>



<p>I can fully appreciate why this <strong>isn’t</strong> a thing, of course. Battlefield 6 is a fast-paced game with immense destruction mechanics, and any fortifications would likely be taken out the second they’re built. It’s not worth the development time to implement something that can so quickly be destroyed.</p>



<p>Being an objective player, I’ll forever wish for the integration of fortifications. It’s the perfect way to gain a sense of ownership over an objective, and it’s a way for players less skilled in the gunny space to earn extra experience points and complete challenges.</p>



<p>Do you wish Battlefield 6 had fortifications? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
