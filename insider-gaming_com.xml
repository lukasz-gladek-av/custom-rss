<p>Split Fiction is an intertwining narrative from the creative mind of Josef Fares. It requires you to guide two unique characters from start to finish, but we’re here to see if you can only play the game in co-op or if solo play is permitted.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a> is firmly behind us now. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios has a new game called Split Fiction</a>. We’ve been treated to periodic trailers and footage since its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal at The Game Awards 2024</a>. Anyone familiar with It Takes Two or A Way Out should instantly feel at home with Split Fiction.</p>



<p>It has tons of mini-games and tandem gameplay sections, and requires teamwork to succeed. Many co-op games allow you to play with an AI partner, so let’s see if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> is the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-split-fiction-be-played-solo">Can Split Fiction be Played Solo?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A co-op boom is happening. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><strong>Split Fiction cannot be played solo and is a co-op title requiring a human companion.</strong></strong></p>



<p>This is how Josef Fares wants his games to be experienced. It Takes Two was such an emotional gut punch as you felt every story twist alongside a real player. A Way Out was the same, and Split Fiction continues this thematic direction by requiring two real-life players—not AI.</p>



<p>If you don’t believe me, check out the official <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/ea-originals-discussion-en/announcement--faq-split-fiction%E2%84%A2---launching-march-6-2025---pre-order-now/5037251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction FAQ</a>. Under the “Is it possible to play with an AI?” question, the answer states: “<strong>No, this is a co-op-only game uniquely tailored for two friends to play together.</strong>“</p>



<h2 id="h-will-split-fiction-add-solo-play-to-split-fiction">Will Split Fiction Add Solo Play to Split Fiction?</h2>



<p><strong>I think the chances of Split Fiction adding a solo option through a patch are slim-to-none.</strong></p>



<p>Again, Hazelight Studios’ previous work—A Way Out and It Takes Two—didn’t add this option. Given the official stance on solo play, it feels unlikely to be added in Split Fiction either. If you’re a fan of Fares and Hazelight games and want a solo-driven journey, all is not lost.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/02/13/josef-fares-split-fiction-interview-we-will-not-co-op-22554563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Fares said: “We will not only do co-op, we will definitely do other stuff with a Haze-like twist. We want to do something different like a twist… like what we did with the co-op. But co-op is great and, I mean, you can tell great stories and there’s so much to be explored there.”</p>



<p>Who knows where the studio goes once Split Fiction is wrapped up and in the history books.</p>



<hr>



<p>It Takes Two was a bona fide Game of the Year winner. It’s going to take a lot for Split Fiction to replicate its success, but it’s not impossible. Are you picking up Split Fiction as quick as a flash?</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone surfaced in 2020 as a free-to-play battle royale of epic proportions. Within just a few days, it had secured tens of millions of players worldwide, and it became known as one of the best games in the genre. Unfortunately, the game didn’t stand up well to the test of time, and after a couple of years, too many bad decisions were made, and players started rapidly abandoning the title.</p>



<p>Given that times have changed and players are still moving on, is Warzone being shut down? Activision won’t support a ‘dying game’ forever, but is Warzone going to be discontinued?</p>



<p>Join me as we find out the answer to that question.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-dying">Is Warzone Dying?</h2>



<p>In 2025, a prominent Call of Duty leaker revealed that the revival of Verdansk – due to take place in April 2025 – is the last-ditch effort for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/">Activision to bring players back to Warzone</a>.</p>



<p>It was mentioned that if Verdansk isn’t a success and players aren’t retained, then <strong>Warzone will be shut down before Call of Duty 2026 arrives</strong>.</p>



<p>This comes as Warzone struggles under the weight of network issues, a plague of cheaters, and lacklustre updates that haven’t given the community a sense of hope for the future of the iconic battle royale.</p>



<p>The esports scene for Warzone is wavering; streamers are abandoning the game for other battle royales, and players worldwide are losing faith in the platform at large.</p>



<p>When you ask if Warzone is dying, you can just look at the streaming figures for the game:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit: TwitchTracker.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Warzone’s performance on streaming platforms like Twitch is at an all-time low. The peaks we’re seeing now are lower than ever before, which is a telling indicator that the game is dying.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-being-discontinued">Is Warzone Being Discontinued?</h2>



<p>Presently, Warzone isn’t being discontinued, but there’s a very real possibility that it will be within the next year or so.</p>



<p>If the leaks are to be believed, Verdansk is the last shot developers have at making Call of Duty: Warzone an ongoing success. It’s an attempt to revive the player base and bring millions of users back onto the platform. If it fails, Warzone could be shut down by the end of 2026.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been said if Warzone Mobile will be shut down, though. This speculation is in reference to the ‘main’ version of Warzone on console and PC.</p>



<p>What will you do if Warzone is shut down? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hideki Kamiya Still Wants To Develop Scalebound with Xbox]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideki-kamiya-still-wants-to-develop-scalebound-with-xbox.1124466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent post on social media, Hideki Kamiya, who founded CLOVERS Inc. after leaving PlatinumGames in 2023, revealed that he’d still love to make Scalebound. The ill-fated RPG was cancelled in 2017 after years of discussions and rumours, but it seems that the Japanese gaming legend hasn’t forgotten about it – to the point that he still wants to make it.</p>



<p>Scalebound was in development at PlatinumGames for around four years before it was ultimately cancelled, and Kamiya was the game’s director. This isn’t the first time that the industry icon has pleaded for Xbox to pick the project up again, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shot-down">Shot Down</h2>



<p>PlatinumGames is famous for the creation of titles like Niear and Bayonetta, but Scalebound would have been a more ambitious game on a different level entirely. In Scalebound, players would have explored a world populated by dragons – and dragonriders. It was announced in 2014 with a trailer dropping at E3 (which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/e3-is-officially-over/">has since died a death</a>), and prospective fans were excited.</p>



<p>The year before Scalebound was revealed, Microsoft penned a deal with Platinum, assuming control of Scalebound in exchange for pumping cash into the coffers to build it. It was shaped around a third-person action-RPG model, and it looked good enough on the surface, but it was ultimately cancelled by Microsoft in 2017.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SCALEBOUND Gameplay Trailer (E3 2016)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dgxcs_5cztw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It was cited that the game’s stoppage was caused by issues with the Unreal Engine, ‘an inability to live up to player expectations’, and a lack of experience at the studio creating some of the game’s core elements.</p>



<p>But along came Hideki Kamiya, almost a decade after that cancellation, saying he still wants to make Scalebound:</p>











<p>His cry of ‘Let’s do it, Phil!’ came following a post from CLOVERS Inc. on Twitter. This post revealed that the team at CLOVERS was banded around Kamiya’s desk, reminiscing about Scalebound while watching videos of the game on YouTube. In the snippet, he said, ‘I’d love to make it again someday.’</p>



<p>In 2023, it was suggested in a discussion on a podcast that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scalebound-revival/">a revival of Scalebound</a> <strong>could </strong>be on the way, but we’ve heard nothing since.</p>



<p>Based on everything we know about Scalebound, would you like to see it made and finally released? Let us know in the comments what you think.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast is set to be released in the summer, opening up another chapter in the decade-old open-world zombie game. As one of the most prolific games in the genre, Dying Light has enjoyed ten years in the spotlight, and that streak of success is set to persist with the arrival of the standalone game, The Beast.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Dying Light’s franchise director, Tymon Smektała, revealed that there’s a secret tucked away in the first trailer for Dying Light: The Beast, and he believes nobody has found it yet.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-easter-eggs">Easter Eggs</h2>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://thethumbwars.com/dying-light-the-beasts-interview-exclusive-director-talks-missed-trailer-details-banned-games-and-lore-answers-10-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with The Thumb Wars</a>, Tymon Smektała suggested that the ‘general location’ of Castor Woods, the in-game map, is hidden somewhere in an easter egg in the game’s first trailer. He said it’s a ‘barely visible’ piece of text that’s written in a dialect that would ‘hint’ at where Castor Woods is located.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer, in case you want to go egg hunting:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Where is Castor Woods set?</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve been through the trailer frame-by-frame, and I can’t see any unique dialect that would indicate where Castor Woods is set.</p>



<p>There are plenty of English language signs and storefronts, and everything from warning notices on generators to the emergency number on the back of police vehicles suggests we’re looking at another European adventure. The architecture is hard to pin down, though.</p>



<p>Harran, which was the centrepoint for the first game, was a fictional Middle Eastern city based on Istanbul, Mumbai, and Wroclaw. In Dying Light 2, players explore Villedor, another fictional location that’s an ‘amalgam’ of multiple European cities, including Germany, Belgium, and Poland.</p>



<p>I’m inclined to believe that Dying Light: The Beast is also set in Europe, but I can’t scale it down.</p>



<p>Perhaps you can do better – let me know in the comments if you’ve solved the easter egg.</p>
