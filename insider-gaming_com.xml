<p>At the center of Rick and Morty’s early years and High on Life was Justin Roiland. He co-created the sci-show TV show and founded Squanch Games, the studio behind High on Life 2 and its predecessor. But controversy has courted Justin Roiland in recent years, making his High on Life 2 status a questionable one, to say the least.</p>



<p>Rick and Morty at its pomp was untouchable. It shifted merchandise like nobody’s business, TV numbers were great, and those first three to four seasons were gold. It made Justin Roiland a star, and he boosted his profile by founding Squanch Games and creating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life/" id="106984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life</a>.</p>



<p>In 2026, the dynamic is very different, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> makes some changes.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-justin-roiland-be-in-high-on-life-2">Will Justin Roiland Be In High on Life 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No squanching. Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s confirmed that Justin Roiland has had no involvement whatsoever in High on Life 2, whether it’s the game’s development or conception.</strong></p>



<p>Quite simply, Justin Roiland resigned from Squanch Games in 2023. He’s gone off the grid since, and it means he hasn’t been associated with the company in the meantime, ensuring the voice actor hasn’t played a part in High on Life 2.</p>

</ul>



<p>Long-time fans will know he voiced Kenny in the first game, but the Gatlian was later replaced in post-launch HOL content.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-justin-roiland-in-high-on-life-2-controversy-explained">Why Isn’t Justin Roiland In High on Life 2? Controversy, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Reports of domestic abuse, harassment, and other accusations against Justin Roiland were made public in 2023, and the voice actor and creator was subsequently dismissed or parted ways with most (if not all) companies he was associated with at the time.</strong></p>



<p>Roiland was actually arrested as early as 2020. Once everything became public knowledge in 2023, many women came forward with claims against Roiland, and it wasn’t long before he was dismissed from Adult Swim and Rick and Morty—where he voiced the titular Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith for several years.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Eventually, he resigned from Squanch Games, and despite criminal charges being dropped against Roiland in 2023, new claims of assault surfaced later in the year.</p>



<p>Justin Roiland has been out of the spotlight since, and it remains to be seen if he’ll make a comeback to any of his former companies or projects. For now, he’s not associated with Rick and Morty, High on Life 2, or anything else.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill Transmission Announced for This Week]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Silent Hill Transmission is arriving later this week, focusing on Silent Hill: Townfall.</p>



<p>Silent Hill fans have been hoping for a new announcement for a very long time, especially after the movie adaptation, Return to Silent Hill, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-bombs-hard-in-early-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t score so well with reviewers</a> or the audience. Now, the developers have planned a full showcase that will provide all the latest details on their upcoming title. </p>







<h2 id="h-silent-hill-transmission-to-focus-on-townfall">Silent Hill Transmission to Focus on Townfall</h2>



<p>A new post by the official Silent Hill account on <a href="https://x.com/SilentHill/status/2021388925982416947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) confirms the upcoming Transmission event for this week. The upcoming showcase is scheduled for February 12 at 4:00 PM PT. The event will feature the developers sharing “the latest news on SILENT HILL: Townfall”. The streaming links for the event haven’t been posted at the time of writing. </p>



<p>Silent Hill Townfall is a title we have heard very little about, aside from the title. We know that it will be a horror title and a spin-off of the Silent Hill series. The game will be developed by No Code and published by Konami and Annapurna. What’s more, the Silent Hill showcase comes right after PlayStation’s State of Play event. </p>



<p>The developers had released a very cryptic trailer back in 2022, with a confusing voiceover and shots of a tape recorder and waves. Since then, this is the first time the developers will reveal more details about the game. </p>







<p>In other news, Silent Hill 2 Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrived for Xbox Series X/S consoles</a> late last year. Additionally, the release date for Townfall was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-townfall-release-date-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked last year</a>.

<p>Squanch Games do be squanching around with High On Life 2, the new 2026 sequel. Another round of Gatlians and gross jokes is guaranteed in High on Life 2, and it’s time to check if there’s early access to get the laughs in now. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> looks to be more of the same outrageous content as the original, and if you do love the original, that’s hardly a bad thing. You’ll be skateboarding and doing <em>even more</em> talking, and it’s looking to capitalize on the large following amassed with the first game’s release.</p>



<p>If you’re keen on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/squanch-games/" id="2701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squanch Games</a>‘ High on Life 2, let’s check if it has early access or a demo.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-high-on-life-2-through-early-access">Can You Play High On Life 2 Through Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Booooo. Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no early access option for High on Life 2, which means you need to wait until launch to play it.</strong></p>



<p>You can only buy the standard edition of High on Life. There is no Deluxe Edition or Mega-Ludicrious Cromulon Edition designed to throw in a few digital or physical trinkets in exchange for mass sums of Schleem (one for the less-casual Rick and Morty fan there), although there is a now sold-out Collector’s Edition.</p>



<p>It’s quite a nice change of pace, and something more developers and publishers could do with.</p>

</ul>



<p>There’s now one universal High on Life 2 version to buy. Unfortunately, it doesn’t provide early access.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-high-on-life-2-have-a-demo">Does High On Life 2 Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>You can’t even play High on Life 2 early via a free-to-play demo from any applicable storefront.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>If you’re asking Squanch Games to ‘show me what you got,’ the developer has a solid and firm answer: No.</p>



<p>No early access, no demo; it’s a traditional launch-day affair where you need to be patient to play it on PlayStation 5 and other platforms.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" id="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Contexto</a> a go if you haven’t already! </p>

<figure><figcaption>It’s guessing time. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<li>Game</li>

<li>Food</li>

<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-11-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 11, 2026</h2>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. The February 11, 2026, Quordle has four new words for you to find, and this guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone and region, meaning the next game will start on February 12.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Relooted Launches To Double-Digit User Count on Steam but Positive Reviews]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/relooted-launches-double-digits-steam-reviews/</link>
            <guid>1432030</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On social media, discussions have surfaced surrounding the recent launch of Relooted, an Africanfuturist heist game that sees players assume control of characters stealing African artifacts from Western museums. Those discussions aren’t entirely positive, as Relooted has managed to secure a peak player count of just 57 users on Steam on launch day.</p>



<p>While the bulk of users will be playing Relooted via Xbox Game Pass, on which the game dropped on day one, it’s not a strong look for just the second game from Nyamakop. It is worth stressing that the game has a review rating of ‘Mostly Positive’ on Steam, so perhaps it’s much better than the player count suggests and is just struggling with adoption.</p>







<h2 id="h-relooted-regarded-as-genuinely-bad-by-some">Relooted Regarded as ‘Genuinely Bad’ by Some</h2>



<p>If you hold any stock in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">user reviews on Steam</a>, you might baulk at the most recent recollections. One gamer wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game sucks. I’m not saying that because it’s “woke”; the game is genuinely bad. The art style is ugly, the mechanics are terrible, and it has a multitude of other issues. Avoid this game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course, the almost immediate mention of ‘woke’ does something to invalidate their opinion a little, as it’s a phrase too easily lobbied around these days by those not happy with their evaluation of a game.</p>



<p>By comparison, another user explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a fun and vibrant little platformer with a lot of interesting history driving it. Sadly, Americans struggle to think anything can be made without centering around their politics.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s <strong>extremely tough </strong>not to take a political approach to judging Relooted, and that might be what’s slowing adoption. It’s not possible to see how many people are playing the game on PC or Xbox via the Game Pass subscription service, but at the time of writing, just 15 people were playing it on Steam.</p>



<p>In June 2025, our Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-nyamakop-ceo-ben-myers-relooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sat down with Ben Myres</a>, CEO at Nyamakop, who said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We struggled with the design for quite a while – how to make an interesting mechanical adaption of heist movies was tricky (most heist games are shooters, and don’t always feel accurate to the vibe and sensibilities of say an Ocean’s 11). It was only when Teardown came out that something clicked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team also stressed that the Metroidvania-style game wasn’t influenced by games like Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown or Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, despite bearing similarities to both.</p>



<p>Time will tell how Relooted pans out, but the critics’ impressions <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/02/relooted-is-available-today-with-xbox-game-pass-and-some-early-reviews-are-now-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are mostly positive</a>. One outlet described the game as ‘unique and rewarding’, while another dubbed it ‘a fantastic premise’.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Overwatch is Back’: Claims Surface Online as Game Hits New All-Time High Player Count]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Overwatch has been ‘relaunched’, the game’s previous ‘2’ has been removed from the title, and a new season of content has brought players flooding back to the hero shooter in droves. In recent hours, Overwatch managed to hit a new all-time high peak player count on Steam, soaring and prompting many to declare that <strong>Overwatch is back!</strong></p>



<p>Of course, it’s not all good news. In the last couple of days, the community was wrestling with the voice actor for one of the newest characters, Anran, who used her position to ‘push an agenda’ regarding unrealistic beauty standards in games. She <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-anran-actor-bags-on-ozempic-chic-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dubbed them ‘Ozempic chic’</a> and drew immense flak from one half of the community.</p>



<p>So, is Overwatch back?</p>







<h2 id="h-overwatch-skyrockets-on-steam">Overwatch Skyrockets on Steam</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch</a> has hit a new all-time peak player count of 165,651 users <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/#max" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> in the hours before writing this article. That’s not just a slight climb over the previous high; it’s a <strong>120% </strong>boost. Previously, Overwatch had secured a high of around 75,000, back in 2023. Since then, it had slowly been working its way down the leaderboard.</p>



<p>Despite the arrival of a rebrand and a fresh season of content, plus the huge leap in players, Overwatch has managed to drop in review standings. It has a rating of ‘Mixed’ in recent reviews and ‘Mostly Negative’ overall, so it might be a case of users dipping back in, seeing what’s what, not being impressed, and leaving again.</p>



<p>Regardless, fans of the franchise have taken to social media platforms worldwide to declare the almighty and unstoppable return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blizzard/" id="1092">Blizzard’s</a> hero shooter, which has fallen in and out of good graces over the last few years.</p>



<p>Even Zedd, a popular music producer and DJ with millions of followers, declared Overwatch <strong>back </strong>on socials:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Whether this resurgence is a flash in the pan remains to be seen. The five new characters (which include a cat with a jetpack), the new meta event, and the countless tweaks might not pay off for long enough for Overwatch to be considered entirely renewed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CDL Teams Opt to GA Snipers Going Into Major II Qualifiers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-teams-ga-snipers-major-ii-qualifiers/</link>
            <guid>1432009</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest sweeping change to hit the Call of Duty League, the scene’s pro teams have decided to eradicate snipers from the competitive circuit, pushing for a GA that moves them firmly out of the meta pool.</p>



<p>As we go into the Major II qualifying stage, which leads up to the first CDL Major to land in the United Kingdom in <strong>many years</strong>, very few changes are being made. The map pool is expected to remain the same, rosters haven’t shifted too much (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud9-new-york-failing-to-build-new-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aside from Cloud9</a>…), but yes, snipers are now out of the picture.</p>







<h2 id="h-too-many-changes-could-harm-the-cdl-s-image">Too Many Changes Could Harm the CDL’s Image</h2>



<p>Snipers have been pulled in and out of the meta for the longest time. It seems that they’re a point of contention every single season, and we rarely go an entire year without them being kicked out of the pool. All it takes is for them to dominate for a few games and for some players to get sharper with them, and the consensus boots them from the meta.</p>



<p>That’s what’s happened this time around, with a reported <strong>nine teams </strong>agreeing to GA (Gentlemen’s Agreement) snipers and eviscerate them from the weapon pool.</p>



<p>The ever-shrinking weapon pool, we might add.</p>



<p>Many have their concerns about Call of Duty’s approach to the competitive meta, and it almost always results in the game becoming a two-gun esports title. It’s a theme not replicated in any other game, including the likes of Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six, Apex Legends, and VALORANT, all of which are much more diverse.</p>



<p>It’s now almost exclusively down to the Dravec and the M15 to determine the outcome of each match, with a few Jäger 45 clips thrown in for good measure. It’s already tough for Call of Duty to be seen as a ‘serious esport’ without this issue surfacing every season.</p>



<p>Major II welcomes the first UK-based Call of Duty esports major in more than six years, with the NEC at Birmingham welcoming both CDL Major II <strong>and </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhack-coming-to-the-uk-in-2025-call-of-duty-dota/">a wider DreamHack event</a>.</p>
