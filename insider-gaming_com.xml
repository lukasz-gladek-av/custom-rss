            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>KRAFTON recently pushed out the first closed alpha for PUBG Black Budget, an all-new extraction shooter with some innovative mechanics and an accessible operating model. It’s aiming to disrupt a genre most recently dominated by the likes of Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders, but does it actually have a chance?</p>



<p>I’m a keen extraction fan (not extractor fan, that’s what lives in your bathroom) and have spent thousands of hours across the genre, so I was all too eager to leap head over heels into PUBG Black Budget, try out the alpha, and feed back my thoughts.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-pubg-black-budget-looking-good">Is PUBG Black Budget Looking Good?</h2>



<p>I’m happy to report that PUBG: Black Budget certainly is looking good. The game is designed to be more of an arcade-like extraction shooter than a borderline milsim title like Escape from Tarkov or Gray Zone Warfare, but it still has plenty of realism. It’s rooted in sci-fi, and players must explore the island of Coli, which is being crushed by the ever-growing anomaly, suffocating the map as the raid goes on.</p>



<p>This means you’re effectively getting a battle royale, extraction shooter hybrid, balancing the best of what PUBG does so well with the growing popularity of the extraction space.</p>



<p>What makes PUBG Black Budget different, though?</p>



<p>I was surprised to learn that a few things are setting PUBG: Black Budget apart from the stock of extraction shooters already on the market.</p>



<p>For instance, Black Budget’s core gameplay loop sees players pick where on the map they infil, giving them some semblance of control over their raid. They can place markers, navigate a dynamic map, and ultimately enjoy a simple, accessible introduction to the extraction shooter space.</p>



<p>It’s how ARC Raiders found so much success recently, by being welcoming rather than punishing.</p>



<p>The game’s anomaly mechanic is a welcome addition, as it ensures players need to adapt <strong>very quickly </strong>in some circumstances. The game’s extraction points are dynamic, and they pop up all over the map as the game unravels, but they’re more prevalent in the closing minutes of the round, which encourages you to stay around longer.</p>



<p>What I will say is that the map is <strong>enormous</strong>, especially for an extraction shooter. It’s going to take a very long time to explore it all, especially as the anomaly frequently eats entire portions of it right off the bat.</p>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-anomaly">Enter The Anomaly</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>PUBG: Black Budget is set on an island where a time-loop mechanic is employed. Every raid is different, but you’re effectively launching a skirmish into the same setting on repeat, because of the time-loop feature. You load up, load in, secure objectives, grab loot, kill other players, and get out alive.</p>



<p>That’s the bread and butter of the extraction space, but how PUBG: Black Budget is doing it is what impressed me.</p>



<p>The arcade approach means a wider audience will be attracted to this game right out of the gate. There are neat traversal mechanics, such as ziplines, vaulting, clambering, and so on, and the weapon mechanics and ballistics are about what you’d expect for an arcade-style shooter.</p>



<p>By that, I mean it’s point-and-shoot without worrying too much about intricate calculations.</p>



<p>The looting loop is attractive, and there’s plenty to find, and players are encouraged to explore the game’s more critical mechanics, such as inventory and health management. It’s pretty basic, but that’s what makes PUBG: Black Budget so good. Even the tutorial is masterfully crafted to give you the best introduction possible to the game’s core concepts.</p>



<p>The quality-of-life improvements over other extraction shooters, like proximity looting, uncomplicated healing mechanisms, and a faster pacing, are all top-notch. It’s also kind of a combination piece. The map feels like Gray Zone, the fundamentals feel like Escape from Tarkov, and the accessibility feels like ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>When your raid is over, and you’ve extracted through a submersible or a wormhole, you’ll find yourself in your hideout. This is a dynamic location that can be expanded and upgraded over time, but unlike Escape from Tarkov’s hideout function, it allows the player to pick and choose what they do and where they place upgrades and new benches.</p>



<p>As someone who loves base-building mechanics, this spoke to me quite nicely.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-pubg-black-budget-worth-it">Is PUBG Black Budget Worth It?</h2>



<p>PUBG: Black Budget is in closed alpha as I write this, with a second window set to take place <strong>next weekend</strong>. That means it costs nothing to get involved, but there’s a specific path you need to follow <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-black-budget-alpha-key-for-steam/">to get a Black Budget alpha key</a>.</p>



<p>If PUBG: Black Budget were to be released in the state it’s currently in, I’d certainly invest, but I would either hope it’s free to play, or that it has a price tag not exceeding $30. I would like to stress that there were no AI-based enemies when I played, beyond a little wildlife, and that’s strange for a PvPvE shooter.</p>



<p>The niggling issues aren’t really there, as I had no problems occur when I was playing. All the issues came from getting a key in the first place, and once I did, I was very happy with what I experienced in Black Budget.</p>



<p>With the backing of KRAFTON and the inevitable massive creator campaigns sitting on the horizon, I’m confident that Black Budget will at least enjoy a solid launch, if not a lengthy lifecycle in the extraction shooter space.</p>

<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 has almost reached its climax, with the semi-finals promising some of the most intense action of the season thus far. The $1.25 million tournament has already delivered some unforgettable clashes, but the best is yet ot come.</p>



<p>The first semi-final fixture will see Team Spirit face Team Vitality, while the second pits FaZe Clan against Natus Vincere. These stellar match-ups are almost impossible to predict, but that’s just what we’re doing below.</p>



<p>If you want to place a bet on the Budapest semi-finals, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-everything-to-play-for">Everything To Play For</h2>



<p>Vitality, led by the legendary ZywOo, remains one of the most consistent forces in Counter-Strike after a stunning season. Team Spirit, surfacing in the opener of the semi-finals, will need to pull off something remarkable to push Vitality out of the tournament, but it’s by no means impossible.</p>



<p>Faze Clan versus Natus Vincere is an interesting fixture. The former team has had a tough run through the tournament thus far, producing a rocky streak that has had many surprised they’ve made it this far. The team recently eliminated MOUZ to get into the semi-finals, and they’re mere steps away from that $500,000 grand prize.</p>



<p>In terms of honest predictions, GG.bet has Vitality in the best spot to win the Major, while Spirit follows close behind. If you’re playing the outright markets, this is a relatively safe route to follow. If you want a bigger return, back FaZe Clan, the outsider at this point in the tournament.</p>



<p>However, my prediction is that we’re looking at a Vitality vs. NAVI grand final, with Vitality taking the trophy this time around.</p>

<p>Friday evening in Budapest has proven to be chaos incarnate, with two favorites falling out of the StarLadder Major. In two fell swoops, MOUZ and FURIA were eliminated from the running by FaZe Clan and NAVI, respectively. These upsets have blown the Major wide open, and the handful of teams remaining will now prepare for a weekend that will end with a trophy being lifted.</p>



<p>Find out how today’s action unfolded below.</p>

<h2 id="h-budapest-major-playoffs-are-electrifying">Budapest Major Playoffs Are Electrifying</h2>



<p>FURIA arrived in top form, but Natus Vincere managed to stay resilient, dismantling the top-tier pick in a three-map thriller. It was the only series thus far in the playoffs bracket to go beyond a two-map sweep, with FURIA at least doing <strong>something </strong>to try and stay in the running.</p>



<p>The fixture gave way to some stunning moments, such as a scenario that unfolded to allow w0nderful to secure a massive quad-kill accolade.</p>



<p>In the MOUZ vs. FaZe Clan space, a two-point sweep that wasn’t even close was all that was needed to eliminate MOUZ from the tournament. The second map, Inferno, was a whitewash, with FaZe producing a staggering 13-2 scoreline and drowning MOUZ out in a short series.</p>



<p>In the post-match coverage, FaZe Clan’s broky was praised for putting up some big numbers.</p>



<p>The bracket goes forward with two huge matches airing tomorrow:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit vs. Team Vitality</li>



<li>Natus Vincere vs. FaZe Clan</li>
</ul>
