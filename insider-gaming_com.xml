<p>It has been claimed by a prominent Call of Duty leaker that Warzone 3 won’t happen alongside Call of Duty 2026 if Verdansk’s revival fails to retain enough players. That includes either those currently playing or those returning for the map’s revival next month.</p>



<p>Warzone has been in a sorry spot for a while, and Verdansk’s imminent return is expected to move mountains, but for how long?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-road">End of the Road?</h2>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1896672391457349981">TheGhostOfHope wrote</a> a few exclusive details about Modern Warfare IV – otherwise dubbed ‘COD 2026’.</p>



<p>Amongst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other details</a>, he claimed that Warzone 3 won’t be implemented alongside next year’s Call of Duty title if Verdansk fails to perform when it’s brought back alongside the Season 03 update. Earlier today, Activision revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/">Season 03 is delayed</a> to April 3 in Black Ops 6 and Warzone to allow more time to finesse the update.</p>



<p>In March 2020, Call of Duty: Warzone was released to an overwhelmingly positive reception, with tens of millions of gamers worldwide pouring their hearts and souls into the battle royale. It changed the face of Call of Duty, creating an entirely new ecosystem that stood at the top of the genre for quite some time.</p>



<p>Things have changed since then, though.</p>



<p>Warzone has been on the rocks for a while, but Activision is hoping that Fornite OG-style event can bring back millions of players. It was claimed recently – also by TheGhostOfHope – that Verdansk will return as it was in 2020, which is sure to be a blast from the past for many players.</p>



<p>Do you think Verdansk is enough to save Warzone, or will the map’s imminent failure prove to be the final nail in the coffin for Call of Duty: Warzone?</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>It’s been claimed that Call of Duty 2026, which is assumed to be another Modern Warfare title is in development for the next generation Xbox.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope</a>, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to break the news after it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 of Black Ops 6 would be delayed until April</a>. </p>



<p>According to Hope, the 2026 title is not being development for past generation consoles (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-in-development-for-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlike Call of Duty 2025</a>) and is being developed for the next generation of Xbox. If true, this could be our first real hint that the next-gen Xbox could release around Fall 2026.</p>



<p>Also pointed out by Hope is that apparently if Verdansk does not bring players back to Call of Duty: Warzone, a third game in the free-to-play Battle Royale will not release.</p>



<p>Officially, Activision nor Microsoft have released any information on Call of Duty 2026, or even Call of Duty 2025 at this moment in time. But according to our sources, the next game in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty franchise is a Black Ops 2 seque</a>l headed once again by Treyarch Games following rough internal decisions that saw Sledgehammer Games wanting to develop their own fully-fledged Call of Duty title for 2027.</p>



<p>As always, take such rumors with a grain of salt, but Call of Duty 2026 being in development for the next-generation Xbox console is an interesting tidbit of information, if true.</p>



<p>What do you think of the next generation of Xbox potentially releasing in 2026?

<p>During an IRL livestream, popular streamers Valkyrae, Emiru, and Cinna were stalked and harassed by a young man who threatened to kill them. The stream ended abruptly, but thankfully all three women and their staff were unharmed after the disturbing incident.</p>



<h2 id="h-stream-stalker-charges-at-and-threatens-streamer-trio">Stream Stalker Charges at and Threatens Streamer Trio </h2>



<p>During the multi-day Sis-a-Thon stream, hosts Valkyrae and Cinna were hanging around Santa Monica Pier yesterday with fellow streamer Emiru when the incident occured. The trio, along with members of the camera crew, walked past a young man crouching on the ground who asked for Emiru’s number. She declines and the group decides to move on, but the man says “I’m going to keep following her.”</p>



<p>After being followed for some time, despite asking him to stop, the group attempts to leave. The man then gets into an altercation with one of the friends of the group, and when the streamers call for security to intervene, he charges at them, threatening first to fight them before saying “I’ll kill you right now.” After distancing themselves from the man, amidst more calls for security, the stream ended.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Soon after the stream ended, both Cinna and Valkyrae took to Twitter to tell fans they were alright, but also to inform them that the Sis-A-Thon would be ending as a result. The next day, Valkyrae went back on Twitter to <a href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1896613433245614442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">address</a> baseless accusations that the incident was staged, while also criticizing those that stirred up hate towards the women earlier during the stream:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Seeing accounts that have harassed us for a 10 second clip of downtime during a 24/7 marathon accusing us of “just begging for subs, women do nothing” to then farming engagement from this stalker situation while we IRL stream has been so sad to see. Seeing accounts accusing my friends and I for faking this and blaming us instead of questioning the man’s behavior has been embarrassing to see. I’ve learned it doesn’t matter how much I accomplish in this industry or how much I try to gain respect, some men will hate women and blame women no matter the situation.”</p>
</blockquote>
