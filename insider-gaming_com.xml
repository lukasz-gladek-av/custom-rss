<p>Nvidia’s upcoming GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards were recently spotted on Zotac’s website.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/zotac-confirms-geforce-rtx-5090-with-32gb-gddr7-memory-5080-and-5070-series-listed-as-well" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, Zotac’s website featured listings for the upcoming, next-gen Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs. These listings have been removed; however, there are still some hints that point towards an upcoming announcement. If you head to Zotac’s <a href="https://www.zotac.com/us/product/graphics_card/all?field_filter_g_memory_type_tid%5B%5D=2954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will observe new additions to its filters section. Players can filter the GPUs on the website by GDDR7 memory type and 32 GB capacity; these features are not available for the current RTX 40 series GPUs.</p>



<p>Five new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs surfaced on Zotac’s website, including RTX 5090, RTX 5090D (China Exclusive), RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070. The website didn’t feature the RTX 5060 and RTX 5080D GPUs. The listing also confirms 32 GB GDDR7 memory for the upcoming GPUs. With the graphics cards already surfacing on hardware manufacturer’s websites, it seems like Nvidia might be gearing up for an announcement soon. </p>

<p>Elden Ring has sold over 28.6 million copies, reaching a significant milestone for the franchise.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-sells-over-28-6-million-copies">Elden Ring Sells Over 28.6 Million Copies</h2>



<p>Announced <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/jp/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20241213_eldenring_nightreign_debut" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently</a> by FromSoftware and Bandai Namco, Elden Ring has sold over 28.6 million copies globally. Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daniel Ahmad</a> from Niko Partners, the Dark Souls series sold only 27 million units before Elden Ring was released in February 2022. Since then, however, the franchise has sold over <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/integrated/pdf/2023EN_fact.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">35 million units</a>, and Elden Ring was one of the factors that helped amplify the sales of this series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One factor that helped Elden Ring hit this number was the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, which was released in June 2024. Before its release, Elden Ring’s sales were at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-breaks-major-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25 million</a>; an additional 3.6 million units were sold in the last six months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Elden Ring franchise already has plans to keep the sales going in 2025. Announced during the latest iteration of The Game Awards, Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are developing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new co-op action-adventure game</a> called Elden Ring Nightreign. This co-op title will act as a spin-off rather than a sequel and will be released for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was recently reported that China has enjoyed a record-high year for revenue in the games industry. In new data, it was highlighted that numbers swelled by more than 7.5% in 2024, hitting highs of $44.8 <strong>billion</strong>. This makes the Chinese video games market the second-largest domestic market on the planet.</p>



<p>Most of the growth is being attributed to Black Myth: Wukong, which set staggering sales records this year and was regarded as China’s first AAA game. The mythical title was released in August 2024 and remains popular today.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-boosted-figures">Boosted Figures</h2>



<p>While it’s not the largest year-on-year increase China has seen of late, the figures speak for themselves – China’s video games industry is <strong>soaring</strong>. In 2023, a post-COVID boom introduced 14% growth in revenue, and while this year’s increase rate has been slashed in half, the total value is much higher overall.</p>



<p>This news was reported by the ‘China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association’ in Beijing and was circulated <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3290626/chinas-video-gaming-revenue-hits-new-high-2024-back-blockbuster-releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by SCMP.com</a>.</p>



<p>In a statement, the Chinese organisation said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The scale of the domestic market has been steadily increasing, with new mobile titles and single-player titles making outstanding contributions. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>China is also enjoying a boom in mobile gaming, with the data showing that up to three-quarters of the overall revenue accrued through 2024 is attributed to mobile games. Black Myth: Wukong may have turned millions of heads both in China and overseas, but mobile games are still king in the country.</p>



<p>It was further reported that the number of active gamers in China also grew this year, and now more than 670 million individuals across the country are engaging in video games in some way.</p>
