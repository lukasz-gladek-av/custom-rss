<p>Excitement levels for the Fortnitemares event in Fortnite continue to rise, and further teasers have been shared by Epic Games showing the big collabs fans can expect.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s annual Halloween event has become a fan-favorite, with previous years including collabs with Saw, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, among others, and Epic Games is going big again.</p>



<p>The event, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-fortnitemares-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to kick off this week</a>, is yet to have full official details shared, but we know have confirmation of three major collabs.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnitemares-collabs-2025">Fortnitemares Collabs 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Peely-good collabs. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Official teasers were <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1975685374996312433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Reddit</a> by the Fortnite team, showcasing promo art featuring Ghostface, Scooby-Doo, and R.E.P.O alongside recognisable Fortnite characters and items.</p>



<p>The Scooby-Doo Mystery Crew are depicted surrounded by thorns, likely a nod towards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doja-cat-is-coming-to-fortnite-as-fortnitemares-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doja Cat’s Mother of Thorns skin</a>, alongside a terrified Loot Llama, while Ghostface was shown with the reflection of a terrified Peely on his knife.</p>



<p>Finally, characters from R.E.P.O were shown with long arms and legs in order to fit the Fortnite style, a terrifying look in itself, running away from a zombie.</p>



<p>The build-up to Fortnitemares has already seen the return of several horror-themed outfits to the Item Shop, including Ash Williams, Leatherface, and there’s still more expected to be revealed in the coming days, including a Terrifier collab.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether any skins will be available for free through the event or if they are merely appearing in the Item Shop for purchase.</p>



<p>Usually, Fortnite makes some cosmetic items available to earn for free during Fortnitemares, although last year’s content did not include any free outfits.</p>



<p>What collabs do you want to see in Fortnitemares? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The PowerWash Simulator 2 release date is set for October 23, just two weeks following the announcement of the release date. It is releasing on all current-generation consoles and PC and will be included in </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-confirmed-for-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions</strong></a><strong> on day one.</strong></p>



<p>As a continuation of the first game, you will be cleaning all kinds of different buildings and all kinds of various objects covered in some nasty gunk across a total of 38 levels at launch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-revealed-with-new-announcement-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There are some new tools</a> you can use for the job, as well as the ability to take stuff to your shop, clean it, and decorate the headquarters with the newly cleaned items.</p>



<p>Friends will be able to join you in the fun as well. While online co-op was available in the original game, there is an added bonus of splitscreen local multiplayer this time. Additionally, people who join you in an online lobby will share the progress made alongside the host as levels are completed and various rewards are earned.</p>
