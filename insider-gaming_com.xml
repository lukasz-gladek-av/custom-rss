<p>An early prototype of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-announced-for-2026-nintendo-switch-2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, Nintendo’s upcoming farming sim, has leaked online. Furthermore, it is fully playable in Unity and verified by the recent Teraleak.</p>



<p>Revealed earlier this year, Pokémon Pokopia is a joint collaboration between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo. The life-sim lets you play as a humanoid Ditto, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-dev-responds-to-pokopia-and-palfarm-comparisons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">befriending different Pokémon</a> and building a life for themselves. With crafting and farming, the title is one of 2026’s most anticipated games. However, it seems an early playable prototype of the title has been leaked, as well as information regarding its development.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-pokopia-prototype-leaks-online-features-pixel-art-style">Pokémon Pokopia Prototype Leaks Online, Features Pixel-Art Style</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Teraleak: A complete unreleased prototype of Pokopia has been found, and we have the full Unity source code.</p><p>Pokopia originally looked a lot more like Stardew Valley than Minecraft. You would assign your Pokémon to build and harvest resources.</p><p> <a href="https://t.co/oNryTNkZNP">pic.twitter.com/oNryTNkZNP</a></p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1983243634729165265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The leak first came from RyDawgE, who was then verified by the infamous Centro Leaks, who previously revealed much of Pokémon’s future with the Teraleak, like Gen 10. In a Twitter/X post, RyDawgE <a href="https://x.com/RyDawgE_/status/1983010050663751705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">captured in-game screenshots</a> and footage of an early prototype of Pokémon Pokopia. Centro Leaks then posted <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1983243634729165265">video footage of an early prototype</a>, seen above, and linked the apparent source code of the prototype, allowing anyone to play it on Unity.&nbsp;The leaker also claims that the project was originally all Game Freak before being outsourced to Koei Tecmo.</p>



<p>As you can see from the leak, Pokémon Pokopia looks quite different than what was revealed this year. Instead of the 3D style we know, it’s entirely pixel-art, similar to Stardew Valley. Early reports mention that the game was originally <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/pokemon-pokopia-nintendo-switch-1-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Nintendo Switch 1 title</a> and a successor to Pokémon: Let’s Go from the Teraleak. Fans online have expressed enthusiasm over the art style and visuals, as it feels reminiscent of older titles. While knowing this is what the game could’ve been, it does seem like, if this is what the final product will play like, it’ll be a great one.</p>



<p>What do you think about Pokémon Pokopia’s early prototype? Do you wish the game kept the pixel art style? Has it made you more or less excited for the full release in 2026?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-wants-games-%E2%80%98to-be-on-every-platform%E2%80%99.1337617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the company <strong>wants to put its games “on every platform”</strong>. Just recently, Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of Combat Evolved, is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heading to PlayStation consoles</a> at launch, a first for the series.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-possibly-considering-gears-of-war-playstation-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> made the jump to PlayStation 5, as will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025</a>. Many Xbox exclusives have slowly been heading to different consoles. Now, it seems this is the start of many, maybe even ending the exclusivity fans have come to respect forever.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-wants-its-games-to-be-everywhere-says-ceo-satya-nadella">Microsoft Wants Its Games To Be Everywhere, Says CEO Satya Nadella</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The consoles wars are now over. What does that mean for Microsoft's gaming business model?</p><p>"We just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere; consoles, PC, mobile, cloud, or TV." – <a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@satyanadella</a> <a href="https://t.co/AOGf3mj0Kf">pic.twitter.com/AOGf3mj0Kf</a></p></div>— TBPN (@tbpn) <a href="https://twitter.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The news comes from <a href="https://x.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TBPN</a>, as the group chatted with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about the company’s new partnership with OpenAI. The CEO talks a bit about Xbox and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/white-house-uses-ai-donald-trump-master-chief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘end’ of the console wars</a>. In the clip, <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1983255817785597980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">transcribed by GameFile’s Stephen Totilo</a>, Nadella states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Remember, the biggest gaming business is the Windows business,” says Nadella to TBPN. “To us, gaming on Windows, and of course Steam – has built a massive marketplace on top of it and done a very successful job of it.&nbsp;So to us, the way we are thinking about gaming is; let’s first of all, now we are the largest publisher, after the Activision [deal] so therefore we want to be a fantastic publisher, similar approach to what we did with Office. <strong>We’re going to be everywhere, in every platform</strong>. We want to make sure, whether it’s consoles, whether it’s the PC, whether it’s mobile, whether it’s cloud gaming – or the TV; <strong>we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not too surprising to see Microsoft and Xbox shed the exclusivity factor. Many games, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sales-drop-about-90-in-japan/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, sold less than stellar due to sticking to one console. While it’s franchises, especially Halo, never seemed to have that problem, it may lead to more sales. Still, the recent shift, plus <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-is-outpacing-ps4-while-xbox-series-trails-xbox-one-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lackluster sales of Xbox Series X|S</a>, do ring out a touch off for the once-influential company. Whether it’s next console, rumored for a 2027 release, is going to include big changes is unclear.</p>



<p>What do you think of Satya Nadella’s comment on bringing Xbox games everywhere? Is it too ambitious? Too risky? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New World Ends Development Following Amazon Layoffs]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-twitch-hit-by-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Amazon layoffs</a>, <strong>New World is stopping development</strong> and ending with Season 10 and the recent Nighthaven update. The news comes after more than 14,000 were let go from Amazon and its affiliates like Twitch. </p>



<p>Released in 2021 on PC and in 2024 for consoles, New World, also known as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-aeternum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World Aeternum</a>, is an MMORPG from Amazon Games. It was revealed as one of three titles announced to be in development for Amazon. New World was the only one to succeed, despite abandoning its original free-to-play entry. Unfortunately, the game’s journey will stop here, unfortunately ending development and future updates.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-world-ending-with-season-10-after-amazon-layoffs-servers-shutting-down-after-2026">New World Ending with Season 10 After Amazon Layoffs, Servers Shutting Down After 2026</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a statement from <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the New World team</a> on the official website, development on the game has ended. According to the team, <strong>further support is no longer sustainable</strong> and have pulled the cord. The recent Season 10 and Nighthaven update, which launched earlier this month, are the final updates. <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In the blog</a>, the team states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, <strong>we’ve reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates</strong>. The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for&nbsp;<em>New World</em>&nbsp;on PC and consoles. It is only after much consideration that we’ve reached this decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Both the Nighthaven and Rise of the Angry Earth updates are now free for fans on PC and Aeternum will remain on PS+ Premium and Extra for the time being. <strong>Servers for New World will remain open through 2026</strong>, with more information regarding the game’s future to be revealed at a later date. </p>



<p>While not stated in the blog, the team was hit with multiple firings due to today’s massive-scale Amazon layoff. A report from Bloomberg, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-twitch-hit-by-layoffs/">which we wrote on</a>, said that Amazon’s game studios were hit hard. Specifically, the layoffs were felt hardest for teams developing MMOs, like Amazon Game Studios. Sadly, this will likely be the first of many bad news stories surrounding the topic, as the studios were working on multiple new titles that are now in jeopardy.</p>
