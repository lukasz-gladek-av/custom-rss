<p>Ubisoft has just released a new blog post detailing the parkour systems for Assassin’s Creed Shadows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parkour has always been an integral system for every Assassin’s Creed title, and it seems to be a handy tool in Shadows. Parkour will be an excellent feature for exploration and a key tool for stealth and combat. Naoe is the parkour master, and she can quickly scale castles, leap across rooftops and surf the crowds in the streets of Kyoto thanks to her speed and agility. Check out how parkour works in Assassin’s Creed Shadows below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-parkour-inputs-for-assassin-s-creed-shadows-nbsp">New Parkour Inputs for Assassin’s Creed Shadows&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The upcoming game has changed specific inputs to add more mechanics. The crouch and dodge buttons have switched places to add the ability to go prone and let dodge mechanics lead directly to parkour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players will see that dodge and parkour down mechanics have merged thanks to the new input mapping. The new mapping will also disable the stance switch so that you can use any stance when going down from a rooftop. Players will also see new moves with the dodge button, such as acrobatic dodges over railings, jumping out of windows, or new silent drop-downs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-parkour-moves-nbsp">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Parkour Moves&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-parkour-up">Parkour Up</h3>



<p>Players who have played previous Assassin’s Creed games will know that this mechanic lets players hold a button to scale any building or structure they want, and the same parkour system will make its way to Shadows, too. The mechanic works while running up walls, jumping across gaps and leaping into the void. Naoe is better at jumping further and reaching higher than Yasuke.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-recovery-roll-nbsp">Recovery Roll&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When jumping from a distance, players can use the Igan Recovery Roll by pressing the dodge/parkour down button, considerably softening the blow and reducing the noise.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down">Parkour Down</h3>



<p>Here’s where the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows parkour system comes into play. As dodge and parkour mechanics have blended, players can press dodge near a ledge to transition into a parkour down traversal. Naoe will have acrobatic descents, while Yasuke will have heavy drops. Parkour down will let you access the safest lowest point below your character and avoid the player needlessly jumping into the void.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-sprint-mechanics-nbsp">Sprint Mechanics&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A new system unique to Naoe, the fastest assassin in the franchise, has been introduced. This mechanic allows players to trigger an extended dive roll over smaller objects such as fences, crates, rails, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows also includes two more systems: automated passovers and shoulder tackles. Automated Passovers allow the characters to jump over smaller objects acrobatically. On the other hand, automated shoulder tackle is exclusive to Yasuke, allowing him to bash through enemies or destructive objects while sprinting. If there are non-destructible objects, Yasuke will use automated passover, but it won’t be as clean as Naoe.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-grappling-mechanics">Grappling Mechanics</h2>



<p>Apart from sprinting and parkour, Assassin’s Creed Shadows players can also access a grappling hook. With this tool, players can perform vertical ascents and hook swings. Naoe can also scale unclimbable walls by wall running and using the grappling hook on a ledge.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-advanced-parkour-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Advanced Parkour in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<h3 id="h-stance-dodges">Stance dodges</h3>



<p>There are three types of stances: standing, crouching, and prone, and each stance has its own way of dodging for Naoe. Yasuke can dodge directionally while standing and crouching; however, only Naoe can dodge directionally while prone. This prone dodge will allow her to move side-to-side, roll forward, or slide backwards.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-wall-run-eject">Wall Run Eject</h3>



<p>Thanks to her acrobatic skills, Naoe can run up any wall. The Wall Eject tool allows her to perform an incredible jump off the wall by pressing the parkour button at the top of the run. If her hands and feet are connected to a surface, Naoe can also use this move while climbing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down-backward-dodge-and-high-structure-safety-nbsp">Parkour Down Backward Dodge and High Structure Safety&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Parkour Down Backward Dodge is a new move that allows the character to move while their back is facing the edge. In this position, the player can tap the parkour down button without directional input to cause their character to perform a backward dodge, rolling over the edge and down on the ground with a “muffled landing.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Backward Drop Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXehGq8UkuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Parkour Down High Structure Safety is a new system that provides safety for the character at heights where fall damage could occur. In this situation, using parkour-down transitions would cause the character to hold on to the edge and hang there. You must press an additional button to make the character drop-down or climb up.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-unclimbable-surfaces">Unclimbable Surfaces</h2>



<p>Lastly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have surfaces that Yasuke and Naoe <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd/assassins-creed-shadows-parkour-system-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cannot climb</a> with the help of parkour, as they do not have any physical handholds to grab on. The associate game director, Simon, shared that this move is a big deal for them as they must be “more thoughtful about creating interesting parkour highways.” Additionally, this allows them to have “more control about where Naoe can go and where Yasuke can’t,” adding more contrast to the play style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the developers have assured that most Assassin’s Creed Shadows areas are “very much climbable,” and even more so with the grappling hook. Players must look for “valid entry points from time to time.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Balatro’s Blank Voucher is a classic roguelike example of asking players to enter the unknown. The item appears to do nothing, offers zilch to a run, and wants to sap you of precious Store currency. So we’re here to dig into what the Blank Voucher is, what it does, and the real purpose behind its existence.</p>



<p>The beauty of a roguelike gameplay loop is each run differs—some more so than others. Balatro joins this <em>club</em>, shows <em>heart</em>, and is ultimately a <em>diamond </em>in the rough. Its endless array of Jokers and gameplay modifiers are why the indie title is our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Indie Game of 2024</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Community’s pick</a>.</p>



<p>Curiosity is a big aspect of your first few hours in Balatro. You add cards you don’t know the purpose of, and choose items that seem innocuous now but could be the difference between a failed run and a victory. The Blank Voucher epitomizes these traits, and I’ve got everything you need to know about the expensive Shop voucher.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-blank-voucher-in-balatro">What is the Blank Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So why should I buy it then? Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Blank Voucher is a $10 consumable added to your redeemed Vouchers once you purchase it from Balatro’s midround Shop.</strong></p>



<p>Complete any Small, Big, or Boss Blind in Balatro, and you’re taken to the Shop. You can spend your accumulated money on Jokers, Booster Packs, standalone cards, and Vouchers here. We’re taking a closer look at Vouchers, in particular, the Blank Voucher.</p>



<p>On its own, the Blank Voucher “Does nothing?” and is a little disconcerting as the eye-watering $10 fee could be better spent elsewhere. Balatro has a trick or two up its sleeve though to make the purchase worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-blank-voucher-do-in-balatro">What Does the Blank Voucher do in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>The Blank Voucher on its own has zero effects and offers nothing to a run</strong>, but if you <strong>buy it 10 times</strong> during different playthroughs, <strong>you unlock the Antimatter Voucher.</strong></p>



<p>You need to suffer for 10 runs buying the Blank Voucher knowing it provides no bonuses. It’s a meaningless, stagnant consumable designed to look pretty. Purchase it on 10 unique occasions, and you unlock the Antimatter Voucher.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-buy-blank-voucher-in-balatro">Should You Buy Blank Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>You should buy the Blank Voucher whenever you get the opportunity—unless you’re struggling on a run—as the Antimatter Voucher is an incredible item.</strong></p>



<p>I can tell you now the <strong>Antimatter Voucher is one of my favorites in the game</strong>. It gives you an <strong>extra, free Joker slot</strong> to use however you wish—with zero consequences. Whereas a Negative Joker gives you an extra slot in exchange for requiring the Negative Joker to remain in your possession, Antimatter is more liberating.</p>



<p>I don’t need to tell you how beneficial this is, but I will anyway. How many runs have you had where an additional Joker could help you beat the Ante 8 Boss Blind? You’ve got a couple of scaling Jokers, a plus-mult Joker, a times-mult Joker, and a Chip-boosting Joker, but the shop is offering another Rare Joker to push your score potential over the edge.</p>



<p>Antimatter gives you a lot more flexibility and firepower to stack Chips on Mults—or add Blind-beating modifiers. <strong>Always buy a Blank Voucher</strong>.</p>

<p>Balatro’s addictiveness continues to consume me as the months go by. Are you still enjoying it? Also, what are your favorite Jokers to use?</p>
