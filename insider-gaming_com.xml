<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sony-interactive-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> has announced the free games coming for PlayStation Plus members in February. As per usual, the games will be available for all active PlayStation Plus subscribers.</p>



<p>Starting on February 3, members will <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/28/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-undisputed-subnautica-below-zero-ultros-ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have four games</a> from different genres to add to their library. </p>







<p>The headline game in February will be <strong>Undisputed</strong> from Steel City Interactive. First <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/undisputed-coming-to-playstation-plus-free-games-in-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on earlier this week</a>, Undisputed joins the catalog roughly 15 months after it’s 1.0 release. </p>



<p>Also coming is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival</a> action-adventure game <strong>Subnautica: Below Zero</strong>, science fiction title <strong>Ultros</strong>, and the combat flight game <strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong>.</p>







<p>As mentioned, the games will be available starting February 3 until March 2. Simply adding them to your library will give you continued access to install them when you want, as long as you have an active subscription.</p>



<p>If you haven’t yet, you have until February 2 to add January’s free games to your library. Those games include Need For Speed: Unbound, Disney’s Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, and Core Keeper. Again, you don’t have to download them right away to add them to your account. </p>

<p>Reigns: The Witcher by Nerial and Devolver Digital releases for iOS, Android, Mac, and PC on February 25, 2026. </p>



<p>In recent days, we have been hearing a lot about the current and upcoming instalments of The Witcher series, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured expansion</a> for The Witcher 3 and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-could-spend-up-to-800-million-on-the-witcher-4-its-estimated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development and marketing budgets</a> for The Witcher 4. However, today we aren’t talking about any of these titles, but a spinoff within a choice-based title, Reigns. </p>







<h2 id="h-reigns-the-witcher-release-date-set-for-february-2026">Reigns: The Witcher Release Date Set for February 2026</h2>



<p>Nerial and Devolver Digital have teamed up with CD Projekt Red to introduce a new spinoff titled Reigns: The Witcher, as announced in the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9it7oMf0l00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a>. This game will incorporate Reigns’ signature decision-driven gameplay into The Witcher universe, featuring Geralt of Rivia as he navigates the ballads of Dandelion. Players will have the opportunity to explore a unique narrative experience, making choices that may involve running a hot bath instead of slaying monsters.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game will also feature beloved characters from the series, including Yennefer, Triss, and Vesemir. Players can look forward to numerous combat mini-games, where Geralt will face off against familiar foes such as ghouls and rotfiends. Ultimately, the decisions made throughout the game will have significant consequences; a wrong choice could provoke the mages, while the right choice could earn you respect among the nobles.</p>







<p>In other news, The Witcher 3’s rumoured expansion could take players to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3s-rumoured-expansion-could-take-players-to-a-new-region/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new region</a>. Additionally, Netflix’s live-action adaptation will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflixs-the-witcher-series-will-end-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conclude in 2026</a>.
