<p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, which is one of the biggest mobile games in the world, is one of several games banned in the United States following the TikTok takedown that hit ByteDance. ByeDance boasts ownership over the likes of Nuverse and MOONTON Games, which impacts ML:BB, Marvel Snap, and Land of Empires, among others.</p>



<p>This ban impacts the esports industry, as ML:BB is one of the key drivers of the mobile competitive gaming market. In data from Esports Charts, it’s revealed that ML:BB is one of the most-viewed games in history, boasting a peak concurrent viewer count of more than <strong>five million users</strong>, secured during 2023’s M5 World Championship.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-hit">Another Hit</h2>



<p>The TikTok ban is live now in the United States, and when you try to access the application from the region, you’ll be met with a prompt saying that… Well, that you <strong>can’t</strong>.</p>



<p>The ByteDance ban has impacted a few games, too – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/">including Marvel Snap</a>, which is published by Nuverse, a ByteDance-owned brand.</p>



<p>Many esports fans are concerned about the ban that has impacted Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, arguably the most popular mobile esports game in the world, alongside the likes of PUBG Mobile. </p>



<p>This action has also hit Mobile Legends: Adventure. When you try to access that game, you’ll be met with a message that reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mobile Legends: Adventure is currently unavailable.</p>



<p>Due to circumstances beyond our control, Mobile Legends: Adventure is currently unavailable to players in the US.</p>



<p>We deeply value our vibrant player community and are actively exploring possibilities to bring the game back in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Trying to access ML:BB and TikTok will reward you with similar message prompts.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://escharts.com/top-games?order=peak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to Esports Charts</a>, ML:BB was the eighth most valuable esports game in 2024, awarding players almost $8 million across 163 tournaments. It closely beat PUBG and trailed just behind VALORANT. Behind League of Legends, ML:BB was the most-viewed esports game of the year, beating Counter-Strike, Dota 2, and Fortnite.</p>



<p>While North America isn’t the most populous region where ML:BB is concerned, this is still a blow.</p>

<p>Marvel Snap, the competitive digital collectable card game developed by Second Dinner, is currently unavailable in the United States. This is due to the U.S. government’s ban on Chinese social media application TikTok, as the company that developed the app also owns Marvel Snap publisher Nuverse.</p>



<p>The sudden downing of the popular card game without warning from the developer has left players based in the United States baffled.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-oh-snap">Oh Snap</h2>



<p>On the evening of January 18, 2025, TikTok officially went dark in the United States due to the enactment of a law banning the social media application. As a consequence of this ban, the availability of apps from ByteDance, the company that developed TikTok, has been restricted on mobile app stores. This unfortunately includes Marvel Snap.</p>



<p>Players in the U.S. who attempt to sign in to the game are greeted with a message very similar to the one TikTok users are seeing:</p>



<figure></figure>







<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, Marvel Snap isn’t available right now. A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now. Rest assured, we’re working to restore our service in the U.S. Please stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Players who attempt to sign in either on mobile or PC are either greeted with the above message or are unable to sign in entirely. The game’s website is also unavailable to access in the U.S.</p>



<p>The game does not appear in a search of the Google Play store, and a notification there states that downloads for ByteDance applications are “paused due to current U.S. legal requirements.”</p>



<p>Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner has stated that both it and publisher ByteDance were surprised by the TikTok ban affecting their game. “Marvel Snap isn’t going anywhere,” the developer <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> on X. “We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.”</p>



<p>What other impacts will the TikTok ban have on gaming? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new mystery skin is going to be coming to Marvel Rivals for those who purchase tickets to watch Captain America: Brave New World.</p>



<p>The announcement was made by the <a href="https://x.com/RegalMovies/status/1880276448826581174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1880276448826581174%7Ctwgr%5E0f18271dfee288d41369c312d0387dd4c9b35628%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fembedly.forbes.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FRegalMovies%2Fstatus%2F1880276448826581174image%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Regal Crown Club</a>, which said that those who purchase theatre tickets to watch Captain America: Brave New World will receive three exclusive items for Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>The three items will be a spray, nameplate, and mystery costume.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-mystery-costume-in-marvel-rivals">What is the Mystery Costume in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>It’s currently unclear what the mystery costume will be to celebrate Captain America: Brave New World in Marvel Rivals, but the spray and nameplate will be Captain America-related. </p>



<p>However, given that Captain America: Brave New World will feature the Red Hulk for the first time ever (played by Harrison Ford), it will almost certainly be a skin for the Hulk. While it’s not yet confirmed, a Red Hulk skin in Marvel Rivals would be easy to implement without profound changes to the existing default Hulk skin (just a change of skin color, face, and probably shorts).</p>



<p>If the skin isn’t Red Hulk, Captain America is the likely next option.</p>



<p>Luckily though, speculation of what the skin will be won’t have to last long, as Captain America: Brave New World hits theatre on on February 14.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-mystery-skin">How to Get the Mystery Skin</h2>



<p>For those wanting to get the mystery skin, Regal Crown Club says that theatergoers must purchase their tickets by February 17 to collect the skin.</p>



<p>Presumably, ticket purchases will then receive a redemption code in their emails after purchasing the ticket.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals currently has a total of 37 playable heroes in the game, with developer NetEase Games confirming that the game will receive two new heroes a season moving forward. The Thing and the Human Torch are the next heroes to be released, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-thing-human-torch-release-dates-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find out when here</a>.</p>
