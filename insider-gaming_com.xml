<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants everyone to stop being so negative about AI. </p>



<p>The head of the company with the $4.502 trillion market cap—the highest in the world—feels that people spreading a “doomer narrative” are only doing harm to the industry.</p>







<p>Speaking on a recent episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">No Priors podcast</a>, Huang was asked about the idea of “God AI” and the stigma that’s surround the growth of the technology as a whole. </p>



<p>Regarding God AI, Huang doesn’t see researchers “having any reasonable ability to create god AI.” </p>



<p>“The ability&nbsp;to understand human language, genome language, and molecular language and protein language and amino-acid language and physics language all supremely well—that god AI just doesn’t exist,” he says. </p>



<p>He continues to say that there are a lot of industries that “need” AI, which he calls “just the next computer industry”. Huang says that while this God AI isn’t coming next week or next year, the “whole world needs to move forward next week, next year, next decade.”</p>



<p><strong>“I think that the idea of a monolithic, gigantic company, country, nation-state is just…super unhelpful, it’s too extreme,” </strong>he said. <strong>“If you want to take it to that level, we should just stop everything…what’s the point?”</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-a-continued-fear-of-ai">A Continued Fear Of AI</h2>



<p>With the growth of AI continuing at a rapid pace, there are many people out there who are completely against the idea. Whether it be for the fear of losing jobs or the ability to create believable falsehoods, you don’t have to go far to find someone with a negative opinion on the technology. </p>



<p>To that notion, Huang feels that the constant negativity from the general public and prominent figures has been <strong>“extremely hurtful”.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“I think we’ve done a lot of damage lately with very well-respected people who have painted a doomer narrative, end of the world narrative, science fiction narrative,”</strong> he said. <strong>“And I appreciate that most of us grew up enjoying science fiction, but it’s not helpful.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“It’s not helpful to people, it’s not helpful to the industry, it’s not helpful to society, it’s not helpful to the governments.”</strong></p>







<p>Huang then continued to question what the purpose of that type of narrative and what the intentions are of those who spread it. </p>



<p>Of course, the feeling around AI is going to continue to be division both in the general population and within the games industry. Just recently, the use of generative AI resulted in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 seeing its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of the Year award at the Indie Game Awards</a> stripped away. </p>
