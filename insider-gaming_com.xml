<p>Crystal Dynamics has revealed that Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will receive a difficulty adjustment for modern players, and players might remember the original version as extremely difficult. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 was a great day for the original Tomb Raider fans, as Legacy of Atlantis was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced for 2026</a>. It is a complete remake of the original game, built from the ground up. Now, the developer has revealed that the remake might not be as brutal as the original title. </p>

<p>During a presentation attended by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leads-say-its-essential-to-adjust-the-ps1-originals-difficulty-for-modern-player-tastes-but-things-that-you-expect-in-a-tomb-raider-game-are-going-to-be-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked how they would be targeting the difficulty of Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, given all the insta-death situations and other problems players faced in the original title. Kerslake replied, stating that “part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes.”</p>



<p>However, that doesn’t mean the core Tomb Raider experience will change, as “there are puzzles in combat and traversal and death-defying action.” Also, players will also “see big rolling balls, and you know, the things that you expect in a Tomb Raider game are going to be there in spades,” added Kerslake. </p>



<p>The Anniversary edition of Tomb Raider also had a workaround for the original’s difficulty, adding quick-time events to get through the insta-kill situations. </p>

<p>In its new financial report, UK-based Dambuster Studios has reported that it is aiming to release Dead Island 3 by Q1/Q2 2028 (April – October 2028).</p>







<p><span>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09140280/filing-history/MzQ5NDAyNTM3OGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial report</a>&nbsp;(thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank">Timur222</a>), it says that the primary focus for Dambuster Studios is now Dead Island 3, a</span>nd all developers, who currently consist of 194 employees, will be assigned to the project once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete.</p>



<p>“Parts of the game [Dead Island 3] are now in early production with feature, character, world, and story design moving at pace,” says the report.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time that we’ve heard of Dead Island 3 from Dambuster Studios, though.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the studio celebrated 14 years since the original game debuted, with the studio revealing that the second game has accumulated an impressive 20 million players.</p>



<p>The post teased that the “journey” was far from over, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-3-teased-dambuster-new-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accompanied by a photo showing a character leaving LA</a>, suggesting that there will be a new location for the third game.</p>







<p>In July,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-dead-island-2-dev-address-delay-sucked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a former Dead Island 2 developer</a>&nbsp;addressed the calamities caused by the game’s delay, which saw its development cycle pushed out to around&nbsp;a decade, including studio swaps and abandoned deadlines.</p>
