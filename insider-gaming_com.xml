<p>Meta’s recent earnings report revealed that its virtual reality division lost over $19 billion in the last year. </p>



<p>Earlier this month, Meta announced it would scale back its gaming presence, laying off 10% of Reality Labs staff. This led to the supposed cancellation of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/harry-potter-vr-game-canceled-by-meta-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter VR game</a>, as well as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-likely-canceled-after-meta-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman Arkham Shadow sequel</a>. Now, a new report reveals just how much they have lost in this business. </p>











<p>According to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-says-reality-labs-will-eventually-stop-losing-so-much-money-222900157.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechCrunch</a> report, Meta’s latest <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results-302673127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings</a> reveal that its virtual reality division incurred a $19.1 billion loss in 2025, up from a $17.7 billion loss the previous year. Of this total, $6.2 billion was lost in the fourth quarter alone. Mark Zuckerberg also mentioned that the company will focus most of its investments on “glasses and wearables” for the Reality Labs division moving forward.</p>



<p>The CEO stated that there will be an increased focus on Horizon, Meta’s VR social ecosystem, trying to make it a “massive success on mobile.” The goal is to turn virtual reality into a profitable ecosystem. Zuckerberg also mentioned that losses are expected to remain similar this year; however, he believes that the losses in 2025 are likely to be the “peak” and will gradually decrease thereafter. Interested readers can find the complete statement below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on Mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years. I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year, and this will likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.”</p>

            <guid>1419568</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26</a> is finally moving to the modern era. According to the game’s ratings page on the ESRB website, WWE 2K26 will no longer release on last-gen consoles.</p>



<p>That means those only playing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are seemingly out of luck.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-esrb-page-gives-a-bit-away">The ESRB Page Gives A Bit Away</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A visit to the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41019/wwe-2k26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s page</a> on the website mentions a release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>. That lines up with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-releases-in-march-available-nintendo-switch-2/" id="172294" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what had been previously reported</a> on the status of the game. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has also reported in the past that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" id="170633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Island</a> mode was set to come to PC this year. With it only being on current-gen systems and PC, it now makes sense as to why. </p>



<p>2K Sports has yet to officially confirm this, so it could be a case of just missing the systems. That said, with it so close to the game’s March 13 release, it’s highly likely that what’s on the ESRB website is accurate. </p>







<p>WWE 2K26 is expected to have a number of improved features and even some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new and returning match types</a> this year. One of the game’s main modes, Showcase Mode, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also feature current World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk</a>. Other features include the Draft in Universe mode, a revamped reversal system, intergender matches in MyFACTION, and more. </p>
