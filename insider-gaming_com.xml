<h2>Amateur Years Gameplay Extended</h2>



<p>Of course, no baseball player starts their career in the MLB. As such, not only will you go through the amateur years in MLB The Show 26, but you’ll also have the option to extend them. Your character will be recruited out of high school to one of 11 new colleges, with 19 colleges in total, each offering recruiting packages. The package you choose will influence your skill development, equipment, scouting exposure, and more.</p>



<p>That level of control doesn’t stop at the amateurs, however. Once you’re in the major ranks, you can request trades and talk with coaches about potentially changing positions. You’ll also have more leverage to make big mid-season moves.</p>







<h2 id="h-changes-to-perks-in-mlb-the-show-26">Changes to Perks in MLB The Show 26</h2>



<p>This year, specific requirements unlock Perks for your ballplayer. This means you can pursue the options you believe will benefit you most. Also, a revamped menu simplifies learning and upgrading your player’s Perks.</p>



<h2>Simulate More and Simplify Your Career to Your Liking</h2>



<p>In MLB The Show 26, you can simulate parts of the career mode experience. Your sim options will be driven by your overall rating. Achievements such as hitting streaks will temporarily boost your ballplayer’s overall, improving performance in simulated games.</p>



<p>However, players are also alerted when big moments in their careers are approaching. This will allow you to regain control and stop the simulation experience if you choose.</p>

<p>MLB The Show 26 is now available to pre-order in the Standard Edition and Digital Deluxe Edition. Those who pre-order the Deluxe Edition can play on March 13; the game releases to the general public on March 17. </p>



<p>There’s also a 10% discount on the Digital Deluxe Edition if you have purchased any previous digital edition of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With the second season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> set to launch, the game’s communications team has shared a list of updates players can look forward to.</p>



<p>While new maps and challenges are already known to be coming to Battlefield 6<a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/status/2021313449754755403?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">, major updates are also on the way,</a> bringing quality-of-life improvements, faster progression, and more.</p>



<p>One such change includes faster Battle Pass progression. The team notes that this season will be more rewarding and that Battle Pass Tokens earned from Career XP have been recalculated, allowing players to progress faster through regular gameplay and weekly challenges.</p>



<p>Additionally, in-game movement has been improved. The team behind Battlefield 6 now says it feels more predictable and readable during fast-paced action changes, including acceleration curves, smoother vaulting, and smoother ladder transitions. The team has also made fixes that reduce visual inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.</p>







<h2 id="h-updates-coming-to-redsec">Updates Coming to REDSEC</h2>



<p>REDSEC is Battlefield 6’s Battle Royale mode. This community update notes that there will be more rewarding progression in the mode, as Career and weapon XP earn rates have been increased. Hopefully, baseball helps progression feel more balanced between the regular gameplay experience and Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Also, they are increasing overall armor availability in REDSEC. Plus, they’re introducing a cooldown on Vehicle Keycards as a mission reward after players acquire one. This is intended to help balance tank access in Battle Royale mode.</p>
