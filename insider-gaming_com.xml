<p>Counter-Strike players in 2025 will have the opportunity to capitalize on an entirely new landscape. Following post-Major roster changes and new rules implemented by Valve, the competitive CS2 scene will feel drastically different compared to years past.</p>



<p>Many of the same players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who dominated the 2024 season</a> will almost certainly do so again in 2025. Obviously you should be watching established greats like donk, m0NESY, ZywOo, and others next year. But rather than highlight the best players of 2024 who will repeat success again next year, we’re going to look at players ready to break into the top echelon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-to-watch-in-2025">Best CS2 Players to Watch in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-mario-malbsmd-samayoa">Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa</h3>



<p>With long-time rifler Nikola “NiKo” Kovač set to depart for Falcons, G2 is looking to Argentinian rising star malbsMd to step up another level. malbsMd was brought in from North American roster M80 this past summer and made an immediate impact on G2. He showcased his star capabilities at some of the biggest events of the year, including the recent Shanghai Major. NiKo has big shoes to fill, but with G2 also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-will-reportedly-keep-cs2-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly holding on to superstar AWPer Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</a>, malbsMd is in a great position to take a huge leap forward.</p>



<h3 id="h-roland-ultimate-tomkowiak">Roland “ultimate” Tomkowiak</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There’s no shortage of incredible AWPers in CS2, and Team Liquid’s ultimate looks primed and ready to reach that top tier. Liquid grabbed ultimate from the Polish roster of Illuminar Gaming this past year, and outside of IEM Rio and the final BLAST events, he’s been splendid. At his first ever Major, he was a bright spot during Liquid’s playoff run, providing incredible value as both an AWPer and a secondary entry player.</p>



<h3 id="h-dorian-xertion-berman">Dorian “xertioN” Berman</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The current MOUZ lineup is absolutely stacked with young talent, but xertioN gets the nod here. The Israeli 20-year-old player is a prolific main entry player, with an ability to properly utilize utility in a way that’s invaluable to MOUZ. MOUZ made a number of deep playoff runs this year, and won ESL Pro League Season 19, thanks to spectacular play from xertioN. Since his return from a VAC ban, Jimi “Jimpphat” Salo has also been spectacular for MOUZ.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Year 2 Content is Planned for Ubisoft’s Skull and Bones]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-year-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-year-2-content-is-planned-for-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-skull-and-bones.1064793/</guid>

<p>Ubisoft plans to release year 2 content for its quadruple A game Skull and Bones.</p>



<p>That’s according to sources who have knowledge of the plans for the pirate action-adventure game.</p>



<p>Year 2 Season 1 is set to kick off sometime early next year with brand-new PvP gamemodes, places of interest (POIs), new world tiers, and more.</p>



<p>It’s also understood that Ubisoft is exploring more premium crossover events, with one source saying that one idea includes a Black Flag crossover event around the time of the release of Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake (codenamed Obsidian). But whether or not that comes to fruition remains to be seen.</p>



<p>The news that Skull and Bones will be having Year 2 of content might surprise some, as the publisher <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently canceled XDefiant</a>, its free-to-play offering that saw nearly 300 people lose their jobs.</p>



<div><p>However, sources tell me that Ubisoft is fully committed to continuing the game’s support and that the player numbers “might surprise people.” Still, Insider Gaming could not verify the game’s current player count statistics.  At the time of writing, though, Skull and Bones get just shy of a peak of 200 concurrent players in 24 hours on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2853730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.</p><p>The game is currently slashed from its £49.99 price tag to just £20.00&nbsp;on the <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/skull-and-bones/6295077a27efc536e38350a0.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft store page</a>, with the publisher also offering a 6-hour free demo for those on PC should you wish to try.</p></div>



<p>Earlier this year, Insider Gaming reported that one week after the games release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-players-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skull and Bones saw an estimated 850,000 players</a>, which also included those who had played via Ubisoft’s free 8-hour game trial.</p>



<p>What do you think of Skull and Bones nearly a year on? Will you be giving Year 2 content a go? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
