<p>Activision has announced that moving forward, it will no longer have back-to-back releases of Call of Duty’s subfranchises like Modern Warfare and Black Ops.</p>



<p>The news came as part of a new update from Activision, which acknowledged that the franchise has recently failed to meet some players’ expectations. The admission comes following what has been described to Insider Gaming from sources as a “rough launch” for Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>“We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward,” the blog post read.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-call-of-duty-stop-being-annual">Will Call of Duty Stop Being Annual?</h2>



<p>Despite Activision’s admission and realisation that Call of Duty has failed to meet some players’ expectations, they have pretty much said that annual releases will continue moving forward, which will provide fans with an “absolutely unique experience each and every year.”</p>



<p>It’s said that those plans will not be shared today but will be “when the time is right.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> concludes with the following message,</p>



<p>“To&nbsp;be clear, the future of Call of Duty is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams. We have been building the next era of Call of Duty, and it will deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward. We look forward to welcoming you in, listening to you, and moving forward together.&nbsp;“</p>



<p>What do you think of Activision’s admission? Do you think Call of Duty should stop doing annual releases altogether? </p>
