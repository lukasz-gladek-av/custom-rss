<p>A release window has been set for the next game in the Control franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-resonant-confirmed-the-game-awards-remedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">At the 2025 Game Awards,</a> Remedy Entertainment announced the sequel to CONTROL would be released in 2026. CONTROL Resonant is the follow-up game to the popular 2019 action-adventure game. Now, a clear release window for the next game has been confirmed: Remedy announced to investors <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/en/research/remedy-release-of-control-resonant-marks-turning-point-in-investment-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in filings at the end of 2025</a> that Resonant would be released in the second quarter of 2026.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are now waiting for the release of Control Resonant at the end of Q2’26 (was H1’27), which has significantly altered our revenue estimates for the coming years. Additionally, we had previously assumed that Annapurna’s share of the game’s sales would be outside of Remedy’s income statement, but it appears that this share will also flow through Remedy. Thus, our revenue estimates have increased accordingly, but Annapurna’s share is reflected as an expense in the income statement as well. Our net assumption regarding Control Resonant’s returns for Remedy over the first three years remains essentially unchanged. We now assume that Remedy will receive royalties from the Max Payne project only in 2027 (was Q4’26), even though the game may still be released in 2026. We estimate that Control Resonant will sell approximately 1.8 million copies in 2026 and approximately 2.2 million copies in 2027. Consequently, Remedy’s revenue is projected to surpass 120 MEUR in 2026–2027, with EBITDA reaching slightly over 20 MEUR. Conditions for strong game sales are favorable, as the original Control has sold over 5 million copies and has additionally been played by over 20 million players across various platforms.</p>

<p>A fictionalized Manhattan will be the setting for the open-world game. Fans will play as Dylan Faden and learn to control supernatural abilities with the promise that things will only get weirder as more information about the game is released.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Manhattan is at the peak of a paranatural crisis, the likes of which it has never seen, and the Federal Bureau of Control is running out of options. The FBC deploys Dylan Faden, their former captive, to take on a mysterious cosmic entity that is altering the fundamental aspects of our reality. As Dylan, you must harness your newfound supernatural abilities and take on a myriad of mind-bending threats.</p>



<p>Your fight will take you through multiple warped areas of Manhattan, allowing you to explore an unfamiliar world reshaped by a cosmic force that is defiling natural law, distorting gravity, and reordering Manhattan into a geophysical nightmare.</p>

<p>The CONTROL games also share the same universe as Alan Wake. The second game in the Alan Wake series has sold well over 2 million copies. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-over-2-million-copies-and-is-finally-profitable/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide updates on the next CONTROL game as more information becomes available.</p>

<p>A new job listing shows that Electronic Arts is laying the foundation for the next game in the Mass Effect series.</p>



<p>It has been the better part of a decade since the last release in the Mass Effect series, 2017’s Mass Effect: Andromeda. Now, EA has made a public move to secure the franchise’s direction. A new <a href="https://jobs.ea.com/en_US/careers/JobDetail/Production-Director/212271" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> from EA notes that the company is seeking a production director to serve as a leader on the next title in the game series.</p>



<p>EA is hoping the new Mass Effect Production Director has 10+ years of experience on AAA titles, deep ARPG and RPG knowledge, and proven team-building.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for a Production Director with a passion for the Mass Effect universe to serve as a high-impact leader on our next Mass Effect title. You will partner closely with creative leadership, studio teams, and internal and external partners to champion the game’s vision and ensure its execution at the highest quality bar.</p>

<p>In November 2025, Mass Effect executive producer Mike Gamble proclaimed that EA and BioWare remain<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-confirms-next-mass-effect-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> committed exclusively to the series</a> and noted that there are more stories to tell in the universe. It has also been suggested that many believe the next title in the series will be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-moves-some-employees-to-other-ea-projects-while-developing-mass-effect-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make-or-break moment for BioWare</a> after the turbulent development of Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>







<p>There’s also a TV series in the works at Amazon. However, it has been confirmed that the series will not adapt the original game trilogy and will be an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-trilogy-original-story/">original story set after the events of the third game.</a></p>
