<p>Shopify Rebellion has burst onto the Rainbow Six Siege scene after assuming control of the former Soniqs roster.</p>



<p>It was revealed three days ago by Seth ‘supr’ Hoffman that Soniqs ‘no longer wished to invest in Rainbow Six’ and that the whole team was being unceremoniously booted to the curb. This now means that Surf, Ambi, Rexen, Gryxr, and Canadian will represent Shopify Rebellion going forward.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-org-same-squad">New Org, Same Squad</h2>



<p>This is Shopify Rebellion’s first outing in Rainbow Six Siege, and it comes out of the blue after Soniqs was disbanded… Well, out of the blue. Here’s what supr had to say about the change:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I, along with the rest of the Rainbow Six Siege team, are no longer with Soniqs. I was told following the Montreal Major that Soniqs no longer wished to invest in Rainbow Six – a decision that I completely understand – and have decided that my passion for Siege and dedication to the team that I started six years ago is what is most important to me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Supr also transitioned to Shopify Rebellion and will support the core roster as GM and head coach.</p>



<p>This is a new and powerful arrow in Shopify Rebellion’s quiver. The organisation has had a great year and covers a wide variety of esports titles, from League of Legends to Halo, and from Rocket League to VALORANT.</p>



<p>Heading into February’s Six Invitational in Boston, Shopify Rebellion will have a spot with this newly acquired squad, making the event something of a baptism by fire for the organisation.</p>



<p>Recently in the Rainbow Six space, a touch of bad news hit the Cloud9 Beastcoast roster. M80 acquired <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/m80-acquire-beastcoast-rainbow-six-team-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Beastcoast brand</a> and cast out the Major-winning squad, and now the team is org-less ahead of the Six Invitational.</p>

<p>Rocksteady is officially ending support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. In a post on the <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s official website</a>, it was announced that Season 4 will see the final updates for Suicide Squad moving forward. </p>



<p>Those updates include the addition of Deathstroke along with a new medieval-themed Elseworld, new gear, and an offline mode. The offline mode will be available on December 10 alongside the rest of Season 4 episode 7.</p>



<p>“Offline mode will allow you to experience content released for the game, including the main story campaign and all seasonal story mission content, without an internet connection,” Rocksteady said. “To access Offline mode, you can either create a new profile by starting from the beginning of the game or create a copy of your existing Online profile, allowing you to jump in with all of your progress.”</p>



<p>The final Suicide Squad update will come with Episode 8 in January 2025. That wraps up the promised full year of updates for the game from Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Games.</p>



<p>Despite the updates ending, Rocksteady says that all online features will remain available, including online co-op and all previous seasonal/episodic content. It’s unclear if critical support updates will still come after regular updates are over.</p>



<p>The ending of updates for Suicide Squad brings to a close a controversial era for Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Games. After being delayed into 2024, the game launched with issues that causes it to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-pulls-suicide-squad-just-one-hour-into-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily pulled in early access</a>. From there, Warner Bros. Games revealed that not only did the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-reportedly-says-suicide-squad-fell-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perform below expectations</a>, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost them $200 million</a> in revenue.</p>



<p>Rocksteady even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a round of layoffs</a> after the launch of the game.</p>

<p>It could be a matter of days until we’re treated to the second Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer from Rockstar Games, and the community is<strong> </strong>writhing in anticipation. We’ve heard nothing for more than a year, since the launch of the game’s initial trailer, and fans are <strong>starving </strong>for more GTA 6 content from the famed developer.</p>



<p>Recently, ‘GTA VI’ was spotted on the PlayStation store available to add to wishlists, but it’s not the game you’re hoping for.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-art-of-creative-excuses">‘The Art of Creative Excuses’</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grand Taking Ages VI</a> is a satirical title from Violarte that’s set to launch in May 2025, per a listing on the PlayStation store. The game’s presence was spotted recently by eagle-eyed users, and while it seems unlikely it’s <strong>real</strong>, it’s accompanied by a product description that’s worth a read.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The most anticipated game about making the most anticipated game!</p>



<div><p>You’re now in charge of the biggest gaming disaster… Or masterpiece?</p><p>Run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>At first blush, Grand Taking Ages VI (GTA VI) reads like a game dev simulator – which already exists in a few forms. The bio stresses that Grand Taking Ages VI is inspired ‘by real gaming industry events’.</p>



<p>It’ll feature a rags-to-riches story that sees players start in a ‘tiny apartment’ before expanding and growing as their creations succeed on the open market. </p>



<p>It’s impossible to tell if the game is real to any extent – and it probably isn’t – but it’s a funny jab at the wait we’re all struggling with where GTA 6 is concerned.</p>



<p>It’s also far from being the first copycat or parody game to surface on the PlayStation Store. Most recently, a rip-off title mimicking Gray Zone Warfare appeared on the PS Store.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to go up against Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>The upcoming open-world epic from Rockstar Games is poised to be the biggest single-title launch of all time, and that’s enough to strike fear into the hearts of competing publishers, per a recent report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier. It was claimed by Schreier that some competing publishers are preparing to set their own launch dates based on GTA 6’s ultimate release window.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-t-compete">Can’t Compete</h2>



<p>Presently, Grand Theft Auto 6 is set to be released in the fall of 2025, which gives it around a three-month window in which it can drop. Typically, GTA games are released in or around October, so it’s a safe bet that GTA 6<strong>, if the schedule is adhered to, </strong>will be released globally in October 2025.</p>



<p>However, some folks in the industry are anticipating a delay.</p>



<p>In a report published in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar?embedded-checkout=true&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Jason Schreier explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Anticipation is so high that some competing game publishers are waiting as long as possible to commit to their release dates for the fall, according to people familiar with their deliberations who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.</p>



<p>The publishers want to see whether&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>&nbsp;will make its deadline or slip into 2026, these people say, and they’re determined to <strong>keep their own games far, far away.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nobody wants to set a release date for that three-month window between September and November because there’s the chance it could clash with GTA 6. It’ll take a monumental powerhouse of a game to compete with Rockstar Games’ newest iteration in the legendary franchise, and most publishers likely think it’s not worth attempting.</p>



<p>If Rockstar Games or Take-Two were to reveal a delay for GTA 6 tomorrow, then it’s fair game for these publishers to announce their games for fall 2025 – happy days.</p>
