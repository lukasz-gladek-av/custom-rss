<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay was recently addressed by the franchise’s Vice President Executive Producer, Marc-Alexis Côté. Côté addressed the franchise’s “inconsistency in quality” over the years and talked about “changing that narrative,” not just for the franchise but for the entirety of Ubisoft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the Bafta event yesterday, Marc-Alexis Côté was able to answer several questions regarding Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay through an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. Côté started by acknowledging that “Ubisoft’s portfolio has faced criticism in recent years for a perceived inconsistency in quality.” He speaks about how the community wishes for “more polish, more innovation and deeper engagement” from the games they release, which is helping them “to be better”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Côté explains that by delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, they have the opportunity to “change that narrative, not just for Assassin’s Creed” but for the whole of Ubisoft. Côté expands, stating that the upcoming game “has the potential to be one of the best in the franchise’s storied history”; however,&nbsp; he knows that “being amongst the best is just not enough anymore.”</p>



<p>This is why Côté decided to delay the game. The playtests and feedback “made it clear” that the game has immense potential, but it needs more time to meet the players’ expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the “most ambitious and complex project” for the franchise, featuring “interconnected mechanics, narrative and technology” while being released across a larger number of platforms. With the delay, the developers can “polish every aspect and set a new standard for the franchise”. The decision will reflect their “commitment to delivering an experience worthy” of their players’ time and attention on day one.</p>

<p>The first set of new maps coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have been revealed. On Monday morning, the game’s official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1853467391688110288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> channels shared a teaser look at the three new maps coming to Black Ops 6 season 1. </p>



<p>The new maps are Heirloom, Hideout, and Extraction. </p>



<p>All of the maps will be available for 6v6 multiplayer gameplay. Heirloom, however, will also be available for 2v2 combat. More details about the maps will come closer to the start of Season 1, but the teases should give players an idea of what to expect.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 1 will feature new maps, weapons, and other additions for all players. It’s set to kick off on November 14 with a full reveal happening shortly before.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is available now. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review of the game</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill said that “Black Ops 6 feels accommodating to both newcomers and veterans. It’s as typical a multiplayer offering as you can ask for, but you&nbsp;just get it<strong>&nbsp;</strong>so much faster than previous titles.”</p>



<p>Check out the teaser below, and let us know what you think in the comments. You can also take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/call-of-duty.12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. </p>
