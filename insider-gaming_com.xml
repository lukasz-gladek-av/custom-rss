<p>MSI has released the souped-up Claw AI+ handheld units, unveiling in full the Claw 8 AI+ and the Claw 7 AI+. As the latest entrants into the handheld market, the AI+ devices boast several key innovations that’ll have gamers considering securing one over a close competitor, like the ASUS ROG Ally X.</p>



<p>The larger unit – the Claw 8 AI+ – will cost you a pretty penny, though. MSI has advised that the RRP for this device is $899.</p>



<p>Read on to learn what MSI is doing to make that price point seem worthwhile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-msi-claw-ai-is-on-the-market">MSI Claw AI+ Is On The Market</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-s-New-Claw-8-AI----Claw-7-AI--Handheld-with-Powerful-Performance-and-Low-Power-Consumption--Available-Now--145096?utm_source=msi-news-feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=msi-news&amp;utm_content=MSI%27s%20New%20Claw%208%20AI%2B%20%26%20Claw%207%20AI%2B%20Handheld%20with%20Powerful%20Performance%20and%20Low%20Power%20Consumption-%20Available%20Now%21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new MSI Claw AI+ handhelds</a> utilise Intel Core Ultra 7 processors and Arc graphics, and by all accounts, they boast some of the sharpest handheld gaming experiences available right now.</p>



<p>It might seem like a mid-generation refresh, but the MSI Claw AI+ range is much more.</p>



<p>The Claw 8 AI+ is the pick of the bunch, boasting an 8-inch 1080p 120Hz IPS display that offers crisp visuals and a smooth refresh rate. MSI has claimed that the Claw 8 AI+ offers around 20% better performance than competing devices, like the ROG Ally X. </p>



<p>The Claw 8 AI+ is riddled with tech, that’s for sure. It features Thunderbolt 4 ports for fast charging, which means the 80Wh battery will go from flat to full in no time at all. It now features hall-effect triggers and the on-board software has received a significant upgrade from MSI.</p>



<p>With 32 GB of RAM, the MSI Claw AI+ range outpaces the ROG Ally X, which totes just 24 GB of RAM.</p>



<p>Between the two devices (Claw 8 and Claw 7), there are some major differences. The larger device has a much more powerful battery, and it has better WiFi capabilities – it also weighs 120g more. </p>



<p>MSI has promised a more optimised experience with the in-built AI capabilities of the Claw 8 and Claw 7 devices. They’re built with power consumption, visuals, and ergonomics in mind, it’s just up to you if those enhancements are worth the $899 price tag.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-human-touch-will-be-crucial%E2%80%99-playstation%E2%80%99s-ceo-on-ai-in-game-development.1051362/</guid>

<p>Hermen Hulst, one of PlayStation’s CEOs, has spoken to the BBC during the brand’s 30th anniversary. Before diving into the history of the company, Hulst was doorstepped with a question about AI in game development. It has been a sore spot for a while, with some developers leaning much more into AI, sometimes at the cost of human employees.</p>



<p>Hulst assured that while AI has the potential to revolutionise game development, ‘preserving the human touch’ is still of the utmost importance.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-authenticity">Authenticity</h2>



<p>In an interview with the BBC, Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino, the co-CEOs of PlayStation, spoke about the past, present, and future of the brand.</p>



<p>To open <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview</a>, Hermen Hulst spoke about AI in game development, given that he oversees software at Sony’s gaming giant, while Nishino focuses more on hardware development.</p>



<p>Hulst explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I suspect there will be a dual demand in gaming: one for AI-driven innovative experiences and another for handcrafted, thoughtful content</p>



<p>Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In many ways, AI is allowing for extraordinary leaps in the development process, allowing for procedural generation, the likes of which were previously unobtainable. AI is also being used to automate laborious, repetitive, or operationally impactful tasks that might have traditionally slowed down the development workflow.</p>



<p>In others, it’s putting jobs at risk, ‘stealing identities’, and putting fear into industry workers the world over.</p>



<p>As the interview unfolded, Hulst and Nishino explored the success of Astro Bot, recent leaps into live-action adaptations, and the origins of PlayStation. Nishino laid out a neat anecdote, recalling his mother’s toy store and how he would demo gaming devices for unaware shoppers when the technology was just starting to emerge.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s a world where AI and human-based game development can exist in sheer harmony? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The production of the second season of Fallout is well underway, and recently, Walton Goggins—who plays The Ghoul—appeared on social media to share a brief message. His post went hand-in-hand with a new image showing him in the makeup department having his ‘ghoul skin’ applied.</p>



<p>In Fallout, the live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic series that aired in April 2024, Goggins plays Cooper ‘The Ghoul’ Howard. He stars alongside Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten, and his performance in the show’s opening season was nothing short of stellar.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-feo-fuerte-y-formal">Feo Fuerte y Formal</h2>



<p>To celebrate his return to the character of The Ghoul, Walton Goggins posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It feels good to slip back into this skin. I do this shit for the love of the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was referencing a line his character utters in the show, and the image that accompanied the post showed him having a thick layer of prosthetics applied to portray a Fallout ‘ghoul’, a character warped by radiation.</p>



<p>In April, Fallout debuted on Prime, and it became the biggest launch the platform had ever seen. From there, things skyrocketed for the Fallout franchise. Across the entire suite of games, player counts and investment soared, and titles like Fallout 76 reached new heights, several years after being released.</p>



<p>It was recently suggested that the production for the second season of Fallout is moving ahead of schedule, but it’s still likely it won’t surface until 2026. These days, almost every show has a two-year gap between seasons, much to the chagrin of viewers.</p>



<p>For instance, the first season of The Last of Us was released in January 2023, and the second season isn’t expected to drop until a few months into 2025. </p>

<p>Several sources have revealed that Ubisoft will be shutting down XDefiant in June 2025.</p>



<p>The news was mentioned in an internal all-hands meeting today. The decision was made due to poor player numbers and a lack of player spending, according to sources familiar with the decision to sunset the game.</p>



<p>It’s understood that layoffs will impact a significant number of employees at the San Francisco studio and supporting studios, with some staff already receiving severance information. Another wave of layoffs will happen in February, with Ubisoft San Francisco and Osaka closing its doors. Around 170-180 people are understood to be losing their jobs.</p>



<p>Season 3 will be the last entire season of XDefiant, with a skeleton crew maintaining the title until June 2025. According to those familiar with the situation, Ubisoft will be updating XDefiant players on refunds for cosmetic items and other purchases at a later date.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>XDefiant started its uphill battle soon after the release of Season 1, with a lack of player spending having the team scrabbling to cut costs. </p>



<p>In August 2024, Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/">XDefiant was on borrowed time</a> despite initially having strong player numbers. Frustrations within the studio were always aimed at its leadership, who refused to take responsibility for the project’s shortcomings, which could have been avoided with a better studio culture, said the people.</p>



<p>In late March 2024, I&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/behind-xdefiant-toxic-work-culture-crunch-and-years-of-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on the studio’s toxic work culture</a>, and despite an internal investigation that concluded last month, I&nbsp;was told that the issues had been swept under the rug and that its problems were still prevalent.</p>

<p>UPDATE – Mark Rubin has <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelsofMark/status/1864090964748321266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1864090964748321266%7Ctwgr%5Ec7382b5ea525a198c6ed45941a8bc5ef8cb83cee%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D71846action%3Dedit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">issued a statement</a> that XDefiant is closing down.</p>
