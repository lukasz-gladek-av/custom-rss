<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick “loves” Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford despite some of his recent comments.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Zelnick was asked about Pitchford’s recent comments, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/randy-pitchford-real-fans-would-pay-80-for-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as telling a fan</a> that if they were a “real fan” of Borderlands, they would spend $80 on Borderlands 4 if that was the price.</p>



<p>For Zelnick, that’s just part of Pitchford’s “big personality”</p>



<p><strong>“I love Randy, first of all. Let me just say that on the record,”</strong> Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick-says-borderlands-chief-randy-pitchford-can-be-controversial-at-times-sometimes-intentionally-sometimes-unintentionally-but-i-still-love-him-to-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told IGN</a>. <strong>“And I love his big personality. I love his passion and he is one of the all time great game makers. He also can be controversial at times — sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally. I still love him to death.”</strong></p>



<p>For his part, Pitchford addressed the “real fans” comment saying he didn’t mean any harm with his words while acknowledging players being frustrated with price increases.</p>



<p>Circling back to Borderlands 4 itself, the first mainline game in the series since 2019’s Borderlands 3, the base edition price ultimately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-price-has-been-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remained the standard $70</a> that has been common for years. The game is scheduled to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-move-forward-after-randy-pitchford-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release on September 12</a> for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 version</a> will launch just weeks later on October 3.</p>

<p>More collaborations with other Marvel titles are coming to Marvel Rivals in the future, Game Director Guangguang has confirmed to Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has seen regular updates bringing costumes and looks from other Marvel media into the title, including some from other games, and that shows no signs of stopping.</p>



<p>Speaking exclusively to Insider Gaming at the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ignite-mid-season-finals-complete-scores-standings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Ignite Mid-Season Finals</a>&nbsp;in Guangzhou, Guangguang would not elaborate on specifics with the plans but confirmed they are on the agenda.</p>

<p>Asked whether collaborations with other Marvel games are on the cards, including the upcoming Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, Guangguang did not confirm whether that specific title would be featured in collaborations but confirmed “future plans on collaborations with other Marvel titles.”</p>



<p>While this isn’t too surprising, given the game already features a Spider-Man costume based on the Insomniac series, albeit a PlayStation exclusive, it’s still exciting news for players—particularly given the slew of upcoming Marvel titles in the works, including Insomniac’s Wolverine, EA’s Iron Man, and Arkane’s Lyon.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Ri</a>vals has also had collaborations outside of the Marvel sphere, including with Fortnite, and teased “maybe” when asked if similar collaborations with Epic Games could happen in the future.</p>



<p>There will also be a continuation with collaborations with other Marvel properties, as Guangguang confirmed discussions with Marvel Studios, Marvel Animation, and Disney+. In future, releases could be timed to coincide simulataneously with other media forms, bringing new costumes and locations into the game at the same time as movie releases, for examples.</p>
