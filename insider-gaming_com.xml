<p>Splinter Cell Remake director David Grivel has returned to Ubisoft to finish what he started in 2021.</p>



<p>Announced on his LinkedIn profile, David Grivel announced that he’s rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as the project’s Game Director for the Splinter Cell Remake. </p>







<p>The Splinter Cell Remake originally started development in 2021 under the codename ‘North’, with not much else being said on the game since. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> in 2024 that the game is currently in development on the Snowdrop engine, with a tentative release date of 2026. It’s likely given the projects (and Ubisoft as a whole) issues that this release date is no longer accurate, but we will update our readers when we learn more.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming received footage of the project in early 2025, which showed Irving Lambert speaking to Sam Fisher in a superb cinematic. As it’s understood, the Splinter Cell Remake is a fully-fledged remake from the ground up, which will include being built around a modern audience from the ground up, rather than a simple graphic rehaul.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the game is in development for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>



<p>As for what Grivel’s return to the game means for the game’s immediate future is unclear, but the news that development continues on the game will be a warm welcome to those who were skeptical of the project’s future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon’s God of War Series Gets Shogun Director, Second Season Greenlit]]></title>

            <guid>1369741</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The live-action God of War from Amazon Prime Video has found a director for its inaugural episodes in an Emmy winner. Furthermore, the show has already been greenlit for a second season.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s bloody God of War series has entertained players since 2005. While it has likely been attempted, a Hollywood adaptation has never been successfully done. In 2022, Prime Video announced that the reboot duology would be brought to streaming as a show, with many of the game’s crew helping with the production. While rumors of casting and filming have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made their way online</a>, it seems the show is already far into production.</p>







<h2 id="h-amazon-prime-video-s-god-of-war-gets-frederick-e-o-toye-to-direct-first-episodes-casting-and-pre-production-underway">Amazon Prime Video’s God of War Gets Frederick E.O. Toye to Direct First Episodes, Casting and Pre-Production Underway</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive report from Deadline</a>, the outlet revealed that director Frederick E.O. Toye has been tapped to direct the first two episodes of God of War for Prime Video. The acclaimed director has done many shows for Amazon like The Boys and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-release-date-when-is-the-new-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a>, but is most known for his Emmy-winning work on Shogun and the episode “Crimson Sky”. It’s unclear if E.O. Toye will direct any other episodes in the first or second season.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, the show has already been renewed for a second season, as it was pitched to have a two-season order. Pre-production for God of War is already underway, with casting also currently going on. That means that, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-filming-march-2026-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the February film date is true</a>, fans may know who Kratos and Atreus are in the next two months. Many names for Kratos, like Dave Bautista and Winston Duke, have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kratos-actor-shortlist-outlined-by-movie-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">floated around</a>, but it seems fans will know quite soon. With a second season, it does look quite likely that it will adapt both God of War and God of War: Ragnarok.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Sonic the Hedgehog Film Gets December 2028 Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-sonic-the-hedgehog-film-december-2028-paramount-spinoff/</link>
            <guid>1369687</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Paramount Pictures has announced that a new Sonic the Hedgehog film is set to release in December 2028. This is on top of the already-announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-confirmed-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a>, releasing in March 2027.</p>



<p>Released in 2020, the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog films have been a surprise hit with fans and newcomers alike. Despite backlash for the original design, Paramount has turned the Blue Blur into a box-office smash hit. The latest release, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, has made over $492 million, making it the third-highest-grossing video game movie of all time behind <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-minecraft-movie-awards-campaign-warner-bros-oscars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Minecraft Movie</a> and The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Now, it seems there’s a lot more left to explore in the universe, even after the upcoming fourth film.</p>







<h2 id="h-untitled-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-set-to-release-on-december-22nd-2028">Untitled Sonic the Hedgehog Movie Set to Release on December 22nd, 2028</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/">an article from Variety</a>, Paramount revealed the dates for two new upcoming films: a live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and an untitled Sonic the Hedgehog movie, with Sonic releasing on December 22nd, 2028. The article mentions it’s a “Sonic Universe Event Film, so it’s unclear if the film is going to be a spinoff and, if so, what that spinoff could be. Fans have already gotten one in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/knuckles-series-release-date-and-official-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount+’s Knuckles show</a>, but it seems this is an actual film. It’s also unknown who will be directing and producing, especially since longtime collaborator Neal H. Moritz is now helming the TMNT film series.</p>



<p>In any case, it’ll be interesting to see what the new Sonic film could be. Fans have been asking for Team Chaotix and Shadow to get their own projects, so perhaps it could be that. With Sonic the Hedgehog 3 introducing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy and Metal Sonic</a> in the post-credit scenes, maybe there’s a spinoff somewhere in there. Either way, more Sonic is never a bad thing and, luckily, Paramount has a good streak going.</p>
