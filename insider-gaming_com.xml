<p>If you’re a Call of Duty fan who has yet to upgrade to a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, it looks like you’ll be able to still keep your old system for at least another year. According to a new report, Call of Duty 2025 is in development for last gen PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>



<p>The claim was first reported by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1895228195471007981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a> on Thursday night. Insider Gaming sources have since been able to corroborate the report that the game is in development for those platforms. Whether it actually releases on them is something that sources couldn’t confirm just yet.</p>

<p>In addition to the plans for the game to remain on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, CharlieIntel speculates that the 13-year-old systems might be a reason why Warzone doesn’t have “two big maps at the same time”.</p>



<p>As far as why the game could continue on last-gen consoles, it likely has to do with the popularity on those platforms. Still, it has fans on social media split about the decision.</p>



<p>“Studios having to support 12 year old hardware is bad for the industry and holds back the full potential for games,” <a href="https://x.com/xSERP3NT/status/1895230590129185239" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user said</a>. “It’s time to move on.”</p>



<p>Said another: “Crazy but not surprising. Still a ton of ppl on there, and the game scales to low end hardware, [and the] game engine can even play on phones now as we saw with warzone mobile.”</p>
