<p>Predecessor is getting it’s next big update next week. Developer Omeda Studios has announced that version 1.8 of the free-to-play MOBA will go live on September 2nd. The update introduces a new map mechanic called World Shift and adds a highly anticipated hero, Demon King Akeron.</p>



<p>World Shift is a mechanic that changes the battlefield in real time. During a match, paths, objectives, and environmental hazards can appear or disappear, keeping teams on their toes. </p>



<p><strong>“This isn’t just a visual upgrade,”</strong> Omeda says. <strong>“The World Shift reshapes strategy on the fly, demanding swift adaptation and tight teamwork.”</strong></p>



<p>Aside from the new mechanic, Akeron joins Predecessor as a tank/off-lane/jungle hero with a playstyle all his own. He can climb walls to strike from above and focuses on controlling areas while staying strong in extended fights. Players can tweak his passive, ultimate, and movement abilities to suit different strategies. Akeron is part of the ongoing Ashes of the Damned storyline, bringing the next chapter of the game’s story to life.</p>



<p>While those are the two major additions, Predecessor Version 1.8 also sees the launch of a new ranked season, battlepass updates, and even the launch in a new location: Japan. With the launch of the game in Japan, players will have a dedicated Asia server to provide the best connection possible. </p>



<p>Lastly, performance updates for the new with 1.8 include support for Nvidia DLSS with AMD FSR support coming later. Additional changes cover improvements to the in-game store, user interface, and mini-map.</p>



<p>Predecessor’s 1.8 Update launches on September 2nd for all players. Let us know if you plan on checking it out in the comments below.</p>

<p>You can earn free Battlefield 6 goodies from Battlefield 2042. The problem is that the grind is slow, and players have complained. In keeping with EA’s recent acknowledgment of player feedback, Battlefield 2042 players can expect regular double—and triple XP—weekends every weekend moving forward.</p>



<p>The Battlefield Team has once again heard your cries. The community has lamented how long it takes to level up the Battlefield 2042 Free Battlepass to obtain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> items. If you like your double XP weekends, your day is about to get much better.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-rewards-will-be-easier-to-get-with-battlefield-2042-double-xp">Battlefield 6 Rewards Will Be Easier To Get With Battlefield 2042 Double XP</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Still a grind, but less of one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>An August 29 update from the Battlefield Team (through <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Comms</a>) has recognized the negative noise surrounding the Free Battlepass in Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>Here’s what the team has had to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve heard your concerns that you might have missed out on an XP weekend already, or might miss one of the upcoming ones, making it harder to catch up and get all the items from the Free Battlepass you’ve wanted. We therefore will have a double XP events every weekend until the Free Battlepass ends on October 7. Additionally, the last two weekends will feature triple XP gains, so keep those circled in your calendar!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s right: Double XP every weekend basically until Battlefield 6 launches, and the occasional triple XP weekend for good measure.</p>



<p>There are countless items for you to earn in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-road-to-battlefield-6-pass-all-exclusive-bf6-rewards-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass</a>. The more you earn now, the greater your haul of cosmetics and bonuses by the time Battlefield 6 finally makes its way around.</p>







<p>Is this going to make you complete the entire Free Battlepass for BF6 bonuses? Is this a smart move from EA, showing that it’s prepared to listen to players ahead of Battlefield 6’s launch?

<p>Albeit a port of an older game, Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the big third-party launch titles for the Nintendo Switch 2. And while the game was both available in both digital and physical form, players clearly had a preference for how they wanted the game.</p>



<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/08/cd-projekt-group-presentation-h1-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings report</a>, CD Projekt Red revealed that of the game’s sales on the console, more than 75% of players bought the physical version of Cyberpunk 2077. </p>



<p>CD Projekt Red joint CEO Michał Novakovski believes that the game sold well physically on the system because they included the full game, including the Phantom Liberty expansion, on the 64GB game card. Novakovski said that they believe players find the “plug and play experience” attractive. He added that the Switch 2 enhancements for the game helped push it to a new audience, but he does think digital sales will pick up moving forward.</p>



<p><strong>“This dominance of physical sales continues into the current quarter with additional stock orders coming in,”</strong> he said. <strong>“In the long run, we expect the breakdown of sales between these channels to reflect our past experiences with the share of digital sales progressively increasing as time goes by. It’s worth noting that physical and digital sales channels have different economics. Digital sales naturally yield higher net revenue, while physical copies involve additional manufacturing and packaging costs as well as distributor fees.”</strong></p>

<p>Battlefield 6 brings back Battlefield 2042’s popular Portal game mode. If you can’t wait until BF6’s launch to see what it features, a Battlefield 6 Portal gameplay footage leak has given us all a sneak peek of what to expect—did someone say Battlefield 6 meets Only Up?</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> has returned. With the open beta now way behind us, it’s time for Labs participants to get back into testing and ensure the FPS sequel is primed and ready for its October launch. But, like with Labs before, you can expect leaked footage to appear from time to time. A new video has surfaced showing off Battlefield 6’s revamped Portal mode.</p>

<p>EA and Battlefield Studios are promising some wild scenes with the new and improved Portal mode. Players can build their own maps, and as we’ve seen in a new leak from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a>—even homages to hit indie games.</p>



<p>A full 5-minute video shows off Battlefield 6’s Portal mode in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-testing-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returning Labs test</a>. It’s not the most compelling footage, admittedly, and will be a mere taste of the creations and chaos the community is bound to concoct. But in the video, the tester has assembled a mammoth-sized structure, intricately designed to be climbed.</p>



<p>Comments on the video compare the footage to that of Only Up—the viral 2023 game in which you have to climb an entire landscape until you reach the top, risking total failure if you fall. Once at the top, the Battlefield 6 player looks down, and a full-blown firefight is taking place atop the structure.</p>

<p>BF6 devs claim <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-mode-will-keep-the-game-fresh-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s Portal Mode will keep the game fresh for years</a>. To be honest, I don’t doubt it, and I’m excited to see what some creative people are capable of building in Portal.</p>



<p>Did you play much of Battlefield Portal in 2042? Do you already have ideas of what you want to make in Battlefield 6? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
