<p>You didn’t read the title wrong. A new live-action reboot of Resident Evil is being made. Let that sink in. After several disastrous attempts, it looks like the franchise will finally get a respectable movie. At least that’s what the names involved in the project indicate.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/resident-evil-reboot-zach-cregger-1236117563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the production of the movie will be handled by Constantin Film and PlayStation Productions. PlayStation’s involvement took many people by surprise, after all, this is a Capcom IP.</p>



<p>The project will be written and directed by Zach Cregger. Shay Hatten, who worked on John Wick 4 and Army of the Dead, is co-writer. Cregger is known for Barbarian, a great horror movie. His next film, Weapons, also a horror film, was very successful with test audiences, which explains all the hype surrounding the director.</p>



<p>At the moment, four companies are in a bidding war to secure the rights to the film. According to THR, Netflix and Warner Bros. are leading the bidding.</p>



<p>According to THR’s sources, Cregger already has a vision for the project. He plans to make a horror movie that takes the franchise back to the tone of the first games, released in the 90s. Back then, the games had a strong survival horror vibe. It was a very different approach, without action elements embedded in recent games.</p>
