<p>NVIDIA is offering a free GPU to the best Fortnite players in the world during an upcoming tournament in the game, amid the growing shortage of the gear.</p>



<p>The price of GPU and RAM has skyrocketed in recent months amid growing shortages, driven by the increased use of AI, pricing many out of the components. However, the door has been opened for a limited number of players to claim an NVIDIA GPU in Fortnite.</p>

<p>On December 21 and 22nd, with the precise date depending on your region, Fortnite is hosting the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/competitive/events/s39_nvidia?lang=en-US&amp;region=NAE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NVIDIA GeForce RTX Cup</a>, a solo tournament where players can face off to secure grand prizes, including an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for the “top competitors.”</p>



<p>While earning the GPU requires being one of the best Fortnite players in your region, the shortage and growing price of components makes playing in the Fortnite tournament potentially an easier option than splashing out on the market.</p>



<p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU starts at $999.99 on the NVIDIA website, with prices on the secondary market being even higher.</p>



<p>Participation in the tournament also opens the door to earning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-fortnite-cosmetic-finally-returns-after-seven-year-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rare cosmetic that has not been available in Fortnite for seven years</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-fortnite-rust-bucket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust Bucket Back Bling</a>, which will be distributed to all players who earn at least eight points during the tournament.</p>



<p>There are restrictions to competing, however, as players need to have participated in at least 14 tournaments in the past 180 days to be eligible.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders players are busy exploring every inch of the new Cold Snap update, which introduced the Flickering Flames event and maps blanketed in snow and harsh conditions. However, thanks to a clever trick, some are poring over what’s coming next to ARC Raiders, including a new map condition called ‘Toxic Swamp’.</p>



<p>We’ve taken a look at what’s coming in ARC Raiders, including the next few weeks of Trials and this mysterious map condition.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-arc-raiders-calendar">How to Check ARC Raiders’ Calendar</h2>



<p>If you want to see what’s coming next in ARC Raiders, you’ll need to be on PC. Simply boot the game, alter your system’s date to reflect one in the future, and you’ll see the game update to reference future events.</p>



<p>Of course, this means that things are still subject to change, so take anything you see with a pinch of salt.</p>



<p>In the next few weeks, players will be diving into Cold Snap-related challenges in the form of the Trials circuit:</p>



<ul>
<li>Search Frozen Raider Containers</li>



<li>Throw Snowballs at Rocketeers</li>



<li>Throw Snowballs at Bastions</li>
</ul>



<p>Things change midway through January, as Cold Snap ends on January 13. For a week, Hidden Bunker will return as the map condition of choice, and then on the week starting January 19, a new condition called Toxic Swamp opens up.</p>



<p>We don’t know exactly what that means, but it’s a relatively safe assumption that it’ll be a condition tied exclusively to Dam, given that the map already has a prolific swamp region. The newest missions added to ARC Raiders also reference growing toxicity in the swamp, which could be a precursor to the new map condition.</p>

<p>One of the rarest cosmetic items in Fortnite is finally available after a seven-year wait, although there are still some major restrictions on getting your hands on the item.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-fortnite-rust-bucket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust Bucket Back Bling in Fortnite</a> has not appeared in the Item Shop since April 2018, where it was available across seven days after releasing before vanishing into the void. Now, though, Fortnite has made the item available again.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-rust-bucket-back-bling-returns">Fortnite Rust Bucket Back Bling Returns</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Back again. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The news of the return of the item comes from the ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/2001674471896170583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ShiinaBR</a>, who reveals that it is distributed as a reward during the NVIDIA Cup taking place in various regions this weekend.</p>



<p>Any player who participates in the event and secures a minimum of eight points will receive the Rust Bucket Back Bling as a reward, although the tournament is not open to all players and there are eligibility requirements.</p>



<p>To complete, players need to have participated in at least 14 tournaments during the past 180 days, have multi-factor authentication enabled on their account, and meet the age restrictions.</p>



<p>Due to these limitations, the Rust Bucket Back Bling will remain as one of Fortnite’s rarest and most exclusive items, with no suggestion that it will be available for direct purchase in the Item Shop anytime soon.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?source=shop&amp;sort=shop-longest-wait" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite.GG</a>, the Rust Bucket Back Bling is the second-rarest item across all of Fortnite, having not featured in the Item Shop for over 2,800 days, and is only behind the Mako Glider, which has not been in the Item Shop for over 2,900 days.</p>
