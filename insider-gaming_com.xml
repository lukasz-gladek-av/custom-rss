<p>TheBurntPeanut has been on a monumental glow-up this year. His escapades on games like Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders have propelled him to superstar status, and during a recent ‘streamer battle’ on the latter title, he secured a concurrent viewer count of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost 100,000 people</a>, a number seldom secured by <strong>any </strong>streamer.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, TheBurntPeanut, who literally streams as an animated peanut, slammed Dr Disrespect and his followers after a slew of comments arose about him ‘moving in’ on Dr Disrespect’s territory.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-and-dr-disrespect-beef-explained">TheBurntPeanut and Dr Disrespect Beef Explained</h2>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has, in his words, been ‘making jokes’ about Dr Disrespect since ‘day one’. This all goes back to Dr Disrespect’s immense controversy in 2024, which saw him <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-admits-minor-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admit to messaging a minor</a> on Twitch years ago, which ultimately led to his permanent ban from the platform.</p>



<p>In the months that have followed, Dr Disrespect, who has since returned to streaming and maintains a solid following, has preached his innocence on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut is at times a scandalous creator who has had to bite his tongue to avoid making ‘cancel-worthy’ statements, but where Dr Disrespect is concerned, it’s <strong>open season </strong>for the vtuber.</p>



<p>The most recent comment from TheBurntPeanut wasn’t at all veiled and was borderline inflammatory:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been making jokes since day one about Dr Disrespect, I think they think since I’m big now I’m encroaching on his territory.</p>



<p>I’m on ARC Raiders not<strong> the playground</strong>, you got nothing to worry about!</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Season 01 Battle Pass To Have ‘Improvements’ For The First Time]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On December 4, Season 01 of Black Ops 7 and Warzone (like the fifth time it has had a ‘Season 01’) will be released worldwide, granting players an all-new Battle Pass to experience across two tiers. As always, there’s the standard Battle Pass and the BlackCell Battle Pass, both of which include dozens of rewards, boosts, and bonuses.</p>



<p>In a recent blog post, the Activision team uncovered fresh changes coming to the Battle Pass system, which have been dubbed the first ‘improvements’ ever to be introduced.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-changes-are-coming-to-the-call-of-duty-battle-pass">What Changes Are Coming to the Call of Duty Battle Pass?</h2>



<p>It was revealed recently in a Call of Duty blog post that when the Season 01 Battle Pass drops on December 4, it’ll land with improvements, the likes of which have <strong>never been seen </strong>before.</p>



<p>Here’s the full spiel from the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-season-01-battle-pass-blackcell-bundles#Improvements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty blog</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock Timing:&nbsp;</strong>The team has taken learnings from&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>’s Battle Pass completion times and made tuning adjustments for a more satisfying journey. The result: each season’s Battle Pass in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;will be more rewarding for your time spent in-game, no matter where you’re playing across all parts of the game.</li>



<li><strong>Shorter Initial Pages:&nbsp;</strong>Earlier pages in the&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>Battle Pass can now be completed faster with fewer tiers needed to unlock HVT content at the end of the page, while later pages in the Battle Pass will contain more rewards. This means players will earn more high-value content sooner across all 100 tiers.</li>



<li><strong>Battle Pass Tokens via Daily Challenges:&nbsp;</strong>For the first time, players will have the ability to earn Battle Pass Tokens through completing Daily Challenges, which are now available not only in Multiplayer, Zombies, and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, but also Co-Op Campaign and Endgame (another first!) On certain days in the season, completion of your bonus Daily Challenge will grant you a Battle Pass Token, which can be used right away.</li>
</ul>



<p>This means that the first few pages in the Battle Pass will be shorter and will have a faster completion rate, which means you’ll feel like you’re getting more rewards right off the bat. The further along the Battle Pass you get, the longer the pages will become, which kind of makes perfect sense.</p>



<p>Additionally, for the first time, Battle Pass Tokens will be unlockable via daily challenges that are completable across all game platforms, including the campaign and ‘Endgame’ modes. This will make it easier to get those all-important tokens to grind through the Battle Pass tiers.</p>



<p>The full patch notes for the Season 01 update should be available later today, so stay tuned.</p>
