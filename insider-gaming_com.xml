<p>In a rather surprising turn of events, in celebration of Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, Blizzard unveiled and surprise launched remasters of Warcraft 1 and Warcraft 2, which are available on Battle.net at this very moment. If you want to purchase the entire collection, you can score Warcraft Remastered, Warcraft 2 Remastered, and Warcraft 3 Reforged for $39.99 in a unique Battle Chest. Oh, and if you buy now, you’ll also receive Warcraft Orcs &amp; Humans, Warcraft 3 Reforged multiplayer hero skins, and the World of Warcraft Meat Wagon mount, akin to a siege weapon with massive, bloody spikes on its front, rear, and wheels.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The surprise shadow drop of both Warcraft remasters occurs alongside the announcement that, after two decades, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-20-years-world-of-warcraft-is-getting-player-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft is finally getting player housing</a> in its upcoming expansion, Midnight. However, it’s still a year or two away from launch. But for now, if you pick up the Warcraft Battle Chest, you’ll find yourself with plenty of real-time strategy goodness to sift through before then.</p>



<p>For now, let’s focus on Warcraft Remastered and Warcraft 2 Remastered. For starters, Brad Chan, senior manager of Warcraft RTS, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These remasters have brand new hand drawn visuals that capture the original art style from each game, and you’ll be able to swap between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The remasters feature UI and UX improvements, making both real-time strategy games more accessible to modern audiences. Alongside the remasters, Warcraft 3: Reforged Patch 2.0 is on its way, featuring an environment and lighting overhaul, and improvements to the user interface. Oh, and there are uprezzed HD assets.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long ago that Blizzard took the stage at BlizzCon 2023 to announce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-worldsoul-saga-warcraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 more years of World of Warcraft with the Worldsoul Saga</a>!</p>

<p>I’ve lost myself to the MMORPG genre since 2004, and no, it wasn’t at the launch of World of Warcraft. I started with EverQuest 2. But I quickly jumped ship after a few years, joining the fun in Blizzard’s monolithic MMO sometime around the launch of Cataclysm. However, the experience always missed one immersive feature that most other games in the genre offered. Well, it’s happening. World of Warcraft will receive player housing after two decades!</p>



<p>In a teaser on <a href="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1856769095112200343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Blizzard unveiled player housing for World of Warcraft, which is coming in the next major expansion, Midnight. From the short teaser trailer, it appears we can decorate the walls and floors with various trinkets and furniture, and there’s a quick scene of a warrior consuming a mug of some type of drink before sitting down at the fire, with the whole trailer culminating in a look at two floor mats with Horde and Alliance logos, respectively.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/player-housing-is-coming-to-world-of-warcraft-after-20-years-though-youll-have-to-wait-until-the-next-expansion-its-a-tremendously-large-undertaking/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Blizzard’s Ion Hazzikostas said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to give players a little sneak preview of some of what the team is cooking. This also gives us a chance, I think, to have more open conversations about it that aren’t possible when it’s a top secret feature.</p>



<p>[Player housing] an idea that’s been kicked around for a long time—but we knew that to do it, we needed to be able to do it right. It’s a tremendously large undertaking.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Furthermore, Hazzikostas said the team wants to hear from the community regarding what they want to see and what they expect from player housing. If you have suggestions, don’t be afraid to make them known. Blizzard is generally quite active on social media, and they have forums where you can submit suggestions for the player homes feature coming in the upcoming expansion!</p>



<p>After all these years, are you still enjoying World of Warcraft? Let us know over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forum</a>!</p>

<p>It was only earlier this past summer that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-of-warcraft-developers-have-formed-a-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft developers formed a union</a>, so hopefully we see better working conditions and content coming from the studio!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/this-zombie-survival-game-is-on-sale-through-the-end-of-november/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Depending on how long you’ve had an account on Steam, you probably have hundreds of titles waiting in your backlog. You scored them cheap, right? I couldn’t help myself, either. I have so many games in my library, many of which I’ve never played, but whenever a new zombie survival game is on sale, I can’t help myself. I grab it. And now, you can score Dread Dawn, by developer Kioop, on sale until November 26!</p>



<h2 id="h-dread-dawn-is-on-sale-through-november-26">Dread Dawn is On Sale Through November 26</h2>



<p>Dread Dawn is available for 20% off for this extended sale, bringing the total price down from $19.99 to $15.99. While $20 for an open-ended zombie survival game is already an excellent deal, the reduced price through the end of November should help anyone on the fence.</p>



<p>On launch, Dread Dawn received a mixed reception from fans. The studio launched the game as a full release, but it was evident that it required more time to cook. An Early Access launch may have mitigated many negative reviews, but it’s still an exciting zombie survival sandbox!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-dread-dawn">What is Dread Dawn?</h2>



<p>Dread Dawn is a top-down, open-world zombie survival game with sandbox and RPG elements. You play a student trapped on the campus alongside your classmates and other survivors as the evacuation goes wrong and you’re left behind. With zombies approaching on all sides, you must find ways to survive, growing food, wielding firearms and melee weapons, and constructing barricades and turrets to help you defend against the encroaching hordes. It’s part tower defense and part Project Zomboid, but with a little more jank and no controller support currently.</p>



<h2 id="h-other-zombie-survival-games-worth-your-time">Other Zombie Survival Games Worth Your Time</h2>



<p>Of course, the zombie survival genre is positively massive, thanks to years of content flowing through the game development pipeline. If Dread Dawn doesn’t catch your fancy, then check out:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Project Zomboid</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dying Light 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>7 Days to Die</strong></li>



<li><strong>Left 4 Dead 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zompiercer</strong></li>



<li><strong>No More Room in Hell 2</strong></li>
</ul>
