<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that, amid ongoing issues with the redemption and dropping of Twitch rewards in the Escape from Tarkov 1.0 launch, the campaign has been greatly extended. After reviewing ‘all possible options’ with Twitch, Battlestate has agreed to extend the campaign, running it from November 29 to December 20.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games confirmed that <strong>no changes have been made </strong>to the rewards unlockable via the campaign, but Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio, stated that his unique voice line pack has received a boosted drop rate.</p>

<p>Most of the viewers chasing the Tarkov Twitch drops are doing so because they want to unlock Nikita’s voice in the game. As one of the most exclusive rewards, users have a chance of securing Nikita’s voiceover for their character, regardless of whether they’re playing as a BEAR or a USEC PMC.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, Nikita responded to the concerns about the rarity of this drop, stating that things have been addressed:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">btw increased chances of drops with my voicelines 👆</p>— Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1993341219242754260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<p>The new Tarkov Twitch drops campaign will run from November 29 at 11 AM GMT to December 20 at 11 AM GMT. It was stressed in an <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated article</a> that the rewards are to remain the same, as is the process to earn them:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One to five paid subscriptions (regular or gift) are required to receive the reward. If a gift subscription is purchased, the reward is granted to the person who paid for the subscription. Renewing an existing subscription also counts.</li>



<li>The subscription must be to any streamer who is broadcasting in the Escape from Tarkov category at the time relevant to the campaign.</li>



<li>Rewards will be available only in PVP MODE.</li>



<li>The reward is issued only once per Twitch and game account, respectively.</li>



<li>Free subscriptions, including Amazon Prime, Bits, and similar, do not count within the framework of the campaign.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pokémon is in the midst of a huge popularity spike that will only get bigger next year with the 30th anniversary of the franchise, and finding the right holiday gifts for an avid Pokémon fan in 2025 can be tricky, given the sheer amount of options available.</p>



<p>Anyone outside of the Pokémon loop may find it difficult to tell a Charizard and a Pikachu apart, which is merely the tip of the iceberg, as the Pokémon franchise has gotten weird at times during almost three decades of history. Fear not, though, as Insider Gaming is here to help with a selection of the best holiday gifts 2025 for any Pokémon fan, young or old.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-pokemon-holiday-gifts-for-2025">Best Pokémon Holiday Gifts for 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-tcg-mega-evolutions-elite-trainer-box">Pokémon TCG Mega Evolutions Elite Trainer Box</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Pokémon TCG is now in the Mega Evolution era, and this Elite Trainer Box covers the first set in that run. Each ETB contains an exclusive promo, nine booster packs, card sleeves, and other TCG accessories. There are two designs available, featuring Gardevoir and Riolu, with separate promos in each.</p>

<h3 id="h-pokemon-tcg-mega-charizard-x-ex-ultra-premium-collection">Pokémon TCG: Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those looking for an extra boost for any Pokémon TCG collector, the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection is one of the most sought-after products released in recent years. The UPC contains two exclusive promo cards, 18 booster packs, card sleeves, a deck box, and a playmat, each featuring designs including Mega Charizard X.</p>







<hr>







<figure></figure>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most recent game to release in the franchise, mixing things up with new battle mechanics and an expansive open-world environment across Lumiose City. Available on both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, it’s the perfect time to buy with the Mega Dimension DLC releasing on December 10.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-eevee-evolutions-powera-enhanced-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-switch-2">Eevee Evolutions PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch/Switch 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Joy Cons on both the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 are not the most comfortable to use for extended gaming sessions, so the PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller is a good option—especially as this design is stacked with Eevee and its various evolutions, though there are also other designs available.</p>



<p>With up to 30 hours of charge, two mappable Advanced Gaming Buttons, and superior ergonomics for comfortable gaming, the PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller is a solid bet.</p>

Alternatively, there’s a Treetop Battle Playset, which is slightly more expensive.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-mega-pokemon-building-toys-set-kanto-region-pokedex">MEGA Pokémon Building Toys Set, Kanto Region Pokédex</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pokémon’s partnership with MEGA is coming to an end, with LEGO products arriving next year, so time is running out to get some of the best MEGA products available, including the Kanto Region Pokédex. The 322-piece build includes a light button, five interchangeable cards featuring popular Pokémon, and a display stand for those who want to showcase the build, rather than play with it.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-paldea-first-partner-plush-3-pack">Pokémon Paldea First Partner Plush 3 Pack</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>One of the hardest decisions in any Pokémon adventure is which partner to choose, but that tough choice is wiped away by the Paldea First Partner Plush 3 Pack, featuring 8-inch plushes of Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The perfect size for taking on any journey, or cuddling while tucked up in bed, the bundle offers great value for money.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="h-ultra-pro-pokemon-paldea-first-partner-gaming-bundle">Ultra PRO – Pokémon Paldea First Partner Gaming Bundle</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>For any Pokémon TCG collector, particularly those just starting out, the Ultra Pro Paldea First Partner Gaming Bundle is a must-have.

<hr>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-battle-academy-board-game">Pokémon Battle Academy Board Game</h3>



<figure></figure>
