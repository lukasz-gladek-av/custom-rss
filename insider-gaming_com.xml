<p>Techland released Dying Light: The Beast in September, and it became regarded as one of the gems of the ten-year-old franchise. It reintroduced Kyle Crane to the series, cast players into a gorgeous, dense world, and kick-started more games with something of a cliffhanger ending.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to a new job listing uncovered at the heart of Techland, it seems that the developer is already hard at work on the next Dying Light experience. The team is looking to expand, adding a Lead Online Game Designer to lean into a new ‘online experience in the Dying Light universe.’</p>







<h2 id="h-is-dying-light-3-coming-soon">Is Dying Light 3 Coming Soon?</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast was viewed by Techland as Dying Light 3, even if it didn’t adopt that moniker. The game, which is one of our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-review/">top-rated games of 2025</a>, was incredibly well-received by fans of the zombie-slashing franchise. The closing moments of the game reveal that more is incoming, but there’s no indication of <strong>when </strong>we’ll get another game.</p>



<p>It might not take <strong>that long</strong>, as Techland appears to have entered development on whatever might come next.</p>



<p>Whether that’s a full-fledged game or something of a spin-off, like many thought The Beast was, we just don’t know. From speaking to franchise director, Tymon Smektala, we know that there are stacks of ideas in the pipeline for Dying Light.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light/new-game-techland-job-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a> uncovered a job listing at Techland for a Lead Online Game Designer. Amongst other things, the listing said that the successful candidate will ‘define the framework and structure for a new online experience in the Dying Light franchise’.</p>



<p>Technically, every Dying Light game since the first surfaced in 2015 has been an online game, so there’s nothing new there, but the uttering of that very word, ‘new’, is enough to get fans salivating.</p>



<p>For now, we should stress again that nothing is confirmed until it’s confirmed, and this might be for nothing more than a small spin-off game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Adds ARC Raiders Cred Cap to Stop Hoarding Between Seasons]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cred-cap-between-seasons-embark/</link>
            <guid>1384909</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has deployed an ARC Raiders update that effectively changes the face of the game. It’s the Cold Snap update, and it adds a blanket of snow over the game, introduces the Flickering Flames event, and makes several quality-of-life improvements that players are already thankful for.</p>



<p>It also introduces a soft Cred cap that will prevent players from farming Feats to rack up silly amounts of Cred between seasons. This balancing mechanic means they can’t just insta-unlock an entire Raider Deck when it drops at the beginning of a new season.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-more-hoarding-cred-in-arc-raiders">No More Hoarding Cred in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>The latest bout of changes by Embark Studios in ARC Raiders has been welcomed with open arms. The Cold Snap update addresses some of the most critical issues in ARC Raiders, but it also introduces a wealth of additions, such as a festive-themed event, new map conditions, and more.</p>



<p>On December 26, ARC Raiders will get a new season, and that means an entirely fresh Raider Deck stocked full of exclusive cosmetics and other rewards. However, the majority of the player base has spent the last few weeks grinding Feats and racking up <strong>thousands </strong>of Cred points for their efforts.</p>



<p>This means that when the new Raider Deck drops, they’ll be able to waltz through it, unlocking everything in one sweep.</p>



<p>To combat this, Embark Studios has capped how much Cred you can earn, locking it to 800 maximum. That means that when you hit 800 Cred, you’ll not be able to earn a single coin more until you spend it.</p>



<p>That also means that, ahead of a new season, the maximum Cred you can ‘bank’ will be 800.</p>



<p>The team explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dev note: We decided to implement a cap so that players won’t be able to fully unlock new Raider Decks by accumulating Cred and added more items to Shani’s store to purchase using Cred. We believe that the Raider Decks offer a rewarding experience to enjoy while players engage with the game, and a large Cred wallet undermines this goal. We will not be removing Cred that has been accumulated before the introduction of the soft cap.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But Embark Studios has been the ultimate nice guy here. When you log into ARC Raiders, you’ll notice that whatever you had before <strong>has not </strong>been reduced to 800 to account for the cap. That will come into effect from the next season, which starts on December 26.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Update Allows You To Reset Your Skill Tree—For a Price]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-reset-skill-tree-after-update/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders players everywhere have been asking for a function to reset their skill trees since the game came out. Mostly, it was because they were working towards Security Breach before Embark Studios nerfed the ability, leaving them with stacks of skill points in a path they might not have otherwise picked.</p>



<p>Following the recent rollout of the Cold Snap update, Embark Studios has finally implemented a function that allows users to reset the skill points, but it comes with a fairly hefty cost.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-reset-your-skills-in-arc-raiders">How to Reset Your Skills in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you navigate to your Raider menu and check out your skills screen, you’ll see that there’s now a function to reset the paths you’ve chosen. With the press of a button, you can pull back all your assignments and restructure your build as you see fit, all without carrying out an Expedition.</p>



<p>This change comes with a sizeable cost.</p>



<p>You’ll need to pay 2,000 credits <strong>per skill</strong> to withdraw your entire build. Given that you can assign a maximum of 75 skill points in ARC Raiders, it’ll cost you 150,000 credits to respec your entire character.</p>



<p>At this point, that’s a drop in the water for some players. But for the more casual players or those who perhaps don’t loot as well as the average ARC Raiders fan, it’s a sizeable stack of coin.</p>



<p>But it now means that you can wipe your entire skill selection and build something entirely new, which is great news for anyone chasing the now-nerfed Security Breach perk. Once upon a time, it was the most broken perk in the game, but following a change weeks ago, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-nerf-security-breach-perk/">made much weaker</a> by Embark Studios in a move to balance the skill tree.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A Call of Duty leaker is making some big claims about the future of the franchise, specifically the 2027 version of the annual franchise.</p>



<p>According to TheGhostOfHope, developer Sledgehammer Games is planning some bigger changes for the game. Mainly in terms of what possible will be removed.</p>







<p><a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2000945365055394031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope claims</a> that Zombies is <strong>“currently still not planned to return”</strong> in the game. They also say that <strong>“omnimovement with no tac sprint is currently planned for the game.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding removing Zombies, TheGhostOfHope speculated about the possible reason.</p>



<p><strong>“I think the idea is that they don’t want to burn out Treyarch who is gonna come off [two] back-to-back games and they don’t want to have too much zombies content overall so that way 2028 is more hype,”</strong> they said while adding that they believe the omnimovement will be the Black Ops 6 version without the tactical spring and wall jump.</p>



<p>As far as what could be returning, it was said that Get High is coming back and that Pick 10 being brought back is <strong>“a big discussion happening.”</strong></p>



<p>As with any rumor or claim, please take the information with a grain of salt until it is either verified by Insider Gaming or confirmed by Activision or Sledgehammer Games. It’s also worth noting that TheGhostOfHope’s last claim regarding next year’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/infinity-ward-debunk-recent-modern-warfare-4-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared to be debunked</a> developer Infinity Ward. Of course, until the game is announced next year, everything is purely speculative.</p>
