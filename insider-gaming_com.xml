            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro was my go-to headset for the longest time, and it was also the pick of many of the world’s best esports pro players. That’s why I was elated when Razer revealed the Blackshark V3 Pro, the next generation of the award-winning headset, packed with upgraded technology but retaining the classic, flawless aesthetic that we all knew and loved.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro is out now and selling like hot cakes. In this review, I’m breaking down exactly why this headset is worth every penny of the somewhat expensive price tag.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-razer-blackshark-v3-pro-worth-269-99">Is the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro Worth $269.99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing this review, the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro had a price tag of $269.99, which might seem exorbitant to some. However, the technology that’s packed into this headset more than makes the tag worthwhile, and there’s a reason why the world’s best pro players, especially those in the Call of Duty space, rely on this device.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the fundamentals. This is a wireless ANC headset, which means that when you’re playing, you’re unencumbered by cables and you won’t hear a thing around you. You’re completely in the zone and loving life, and that’s what this headset is all about.</p>



<p>It uses Razer’s Hyperspeed technology to ensure you’re getting low-latency connections that deliver your audio as clearly and efficiently as possible, which is of the utmost importance for <strong>any gamer</strong>, as audio desync is a harrowing issue that prevents the pinnacle of performance being delivered.</p>



<p>If you’re playing as part of a team, you’ve got the Hyperclear, detachable boom mic, which has a fat pop filter to keep your vocals clean and your callouts succinct. I used the boom mic on a range of software to test it out, from OBS to Audacity, and from Discord to in-game voice chats, and I can confirm it’s just as clear as most desktop podcast microphones, which is <strong>nice</strong>.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro comes in a range of designs, from black to white, and from ‘esports green’ to a special-edition Counter-Strike 2 version. I’m a <strong>huge </strong>fan of the esports green variant, which is available exclusively from Razer, but for my review of this headset, I used the clean white version.</p>



<p>For this new generation of the Razer Blackshark headset, the tech titan has pumped new technology behind the cups. The extremely capable drivers have been tweaked to reduce harmonic distortion, the bass range has been improved, and the directional audio capabilities are second-to-none, thanks to the THX Spatial on-board mechanics.</p>



<p>Put simply, you’ll hear a foot scraping on the floor across the map and be able to pinpoint exactly where it came from.</p>



<p>It gets better, though.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro has <strong>quad mode</strong> connectivity, which means it can work with 2.4Ghz wireless bands, Bluetooth, USB inputs, <strong>or </strong>via a 3.5mm cable. The battery is also nuts, and without ANC turned on, you can get up to 70 hours of battery life. The only negative I have about the headset is that it could really do with a dock of some kind to make charging more ‘comfortable’ and seamless.</p>



<p>That’s why I love the Astro A50 Gen 5, after all.</p>



<p>Interchangeable faceplates, app control, customization through the Razer Synapse software, and incredible levels of comfort thanks to a low-weight profile and comfy cushioning all come together to make this one of the best headsets on the market right now for both casual and pro gamers.</p>



<p>Don’t sleep on the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Raiju V3 PRO Review—An Elite Alternative to Scuf and Battle Beaver]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/razer-raiju-v3-pro-review/</link>
            <guid>1368019</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re in the market for a ‘pro-grade’ controller and are considering a Scuf or a Battle Beaver, put those thoughts on hold. Instead, take a look at the Razer Raiju V3 Pro, an all-new device that’s customizable, capable, and created by the best technical minds at Razer, one of the most reputable gaming brands around.</p>



<p>In this Razer Raiju V3 Pro review, I’ll help you understand why this is one of the best alternatives to the eye-wateringly expensive pro controllers on the market, and why it’s definitely worth your investment.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-razer-raiju-v3-pro-worth-219-99">Is the Razer Raiju V3 Pro Worth $219.99?</h2>



<p>The Razer Raiju V3 Pro will set you back a pretty penny, but it’s worth every cent. I’ve been trialling this wonderful controller for a couple of weeks on <strong>both </strong>PlayStation and PC as I write this, and I have had a brilliant time. I’ve used it across Battlefield 6, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and ARC Raiders, and in every situation put before me, the controller has excelled.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the build.</p>



<p>The controller is bigger than your average Dualsense controller, but it uses a similar mapping in terms of thumbsticks and face buttons. It has the classic trackpad that you’ve learned to associate with PlayStation controllers, but the triggers and shoulder buttons are more reminiscent of an Xbox controller. It’s the perfect hybrid, in my eyes.</p>



<p>You’ve got two extra buttons alongside the shoulder inputs, and up to <strong>four </strong>tactile inputs on the back, all of which are hot-swappable and customizable in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>The thumbsticks are modular and can be swapped out just as quickly, and you get extras in the attractive carry pack that the controller comes in to suit your needs.</p>



<p>Additionally, almost every input on the controller is ‘mouse-click’ in build, the triggers come with stops that you can switch on and off to suit your game, and the entire thing is wrapped up in a comfortable, durable shell that looks great and feels nice in your hands.</p>



<p>It’s as premium as you can get, and it still comes in under the cost of a Scuf or a Battle Beaver.</p>



<p>But wait, <strong>there’s more!</strong></p>



<p>The Razer Raiju V3 Pro can be further adjusted with Razer’s Synapse software, which includes creating on-board profiles, setting actuation points, adjusting deadzones, remapping inputs, and so on.</p>



<p>If you want to use the controller wirelessly on a PS5, you’re covered. If you’d rather go wired on a PC, you can do that too – and you can switch between those inputs easily enough. The Razer Raiju V3 Pro is marketed as a ‘lag-free, esports-grade’ device, which means you have lightning-fast response times and super-low latency inputs.</p>



<p>It’s expensive, but that’s the point. It’s a premium controller that’ll suit the best pro players in the world, and it has been crafted in collaboration with those very competitors, especially in the Call of Duty space. It takes a while to get used to the inputs if you’ve never used a controller like this, but it’s well worth investing that time to seek those results in-game.</p>



<p>I can’t fault the Razer Raiju V3 Pro controller, and that’s rare for me when it comes to reviewing peripherals.</p>

<p>Any streamer or content creator needs to ensure they have all their required equipment fully charged and ready to go, which is where the KDD Headset Stand comes in perfectly. Equipped with 2 USB and 1 type-C charging port, it can be used to charge smartphones, tablets, headphones, controllers, and more, making it among the best gifts for streamers.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-overhead-camera-mount-with-ring-light">Overhead Camera Mount with Ring Light</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re thinking of doing top-down content, like pack openings or drawings, an overhead camera with a light is a must-have, and this has both in one.

<hr>



<h3 id="h-pqrqp-3-in-1-wireless-lavalier-microphone">PQRQP 3-in-1 Wireless Lavalier Microphone</h3>



<figure></figure>

Compatible with iPhone, Android, cameras, and more, it’s the perfect tool for content creating on the go.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-frigidaire-retro-9-can-personal-fridge">Frigidaire Retro 9-Can Personal Fridge</h3>

<hr>



<h3 id="h-neewer-collapsible-backdrop">Neewer Collapsible Backdrop</h3>

<p>A green screen might not be an immediate necessity but, once you start using it, you’ll never look the other way again. The Neewer Collapsible Backdrop has both green and blue screen, coming double-sided, and is easy to put up and store, all available for a decent price.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-elgato-4k-s-external-capture-card">Elgato 4K S External Capture Card</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A capture card is one of the most important items for any streamer or content creators, as it quickly captures all content from an external source, like a console, and connects it to PC and your stream. Without it, you’ll be limited on your options when streaming, and it should be one of the first things you pick up when you get started.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series Setting Possibly Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-setting-ancient-rome-report/</link>
            <guid>1367896</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The setting and time period of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series may have been revealed, according to a new report. Even more so, more information regarding the show’s development has emerged online.</p>



<p>Since 2007, the Assassin’s Creed series of games has been going rather strong, spanning eras of history with action-packed gameplay and gripping story. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ordered-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Netflix announced that it’s working with Ubisoft to develop a live-action Assassin’s Creed series. Multiple ones are apparently in the works, as revealed in the blog from July, but the biggest one just cast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actor Toby Wallace</a> as co-lead. Now, more information on <strong>the show’s setting has reportedly been revealed</strong>, and <strong>it’s one that fans have been asking for for a long time</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series-may-take-place-in-ancient-rome-according-to-new-report">Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series May Take Place in Ancient Rome, According to New Report</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report comes from <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-set-to-explore-ancient-rome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive from Nexus Point News</a>, which has previously leaked multiple game adaptations like God of War and Elden Ring. In the article, it mentions that sources have said what Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed’s setting will be: <strong>Ancient Rome</strong>. Specifically, <strong>the show is reportedly taking place between 54-68 AD</strong> during Emperor Nero’s reign. Both Nero and his mentor, Seneca, will be featured in the series. Filming is taking place in Italy, so it does line up there, if true. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the report says that Toby Wallace will be part of<strong> an ensemble cast</strong>, meaning there will be <strong>multiple leads</strong>. It’s important to note that <strong>Ubisoft and Netflix have not confirmed this news</strong>, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. Still, Ancient Rome has been asked for by fans for a long time. However, if true, it would mean players would likely not get to play in that time period like they’d hoped to. This would also mean that the show would feature an original story, which is a bit of a risky move. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see how the show shapes up.</p>







<p>What do you think of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed setting? Is Ancient Rome a good fit? If true, are you disappointed to not see it in the games? Is doing an original story worth it? Going with an ensemble cast?
