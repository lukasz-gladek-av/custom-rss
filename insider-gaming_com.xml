<p>If you’ve never played a Ninja Gaiden game before, you’re in for a torturous treat. The full Ninja Gaiden 4 trophy list is out, and we can tell you that it’s a simply brutal set of achievements and trophies if you’re seeking full completion—therapy session on standby.</p>



<p>Some things are certain with Ninja Gaiden games: Extreme difficulty, game-over screens for days, and a trophy list that will make you work harder than you ever have before. Unfortunately for you, we’ve already seen the list and can confirm that this is an all-timer for one obvious reason.</p>



<p>Read on for the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> trophy list.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-ninja-gaiden-4">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies In Ninja Gaiden 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Poor Ryu. Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There’s a grand total of 45 PlayStation Trophies for you to collect during your Ninja Gaiden 4 journey, and 44 Xbox Achievements if you’re on Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>From the Platinum Trophy on PlayStation to objectives offering small amounts of Gamerscore, there’s a lot to keep you occupied. Here’s a quick table showing you how the trophies are distributed throughout NG4.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Trophy Type</th><th data-align="center">Quantity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Platinum Trophy</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Gold Trophies</td><td data-align="center">3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Silver Trophies</td><td data-align="center">5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bronze Trophies</td><td data-align="center">36</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This is going to be a Platinum and full set of Gamerscore that few people on the planet will be able to get. Previous Ninja Gaiden games have asked something similar, and they are notoriously some of the hardest games in the world to fully complete.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a big deal for a lot of people. The franchise as a whole is one of the most iconic in the hack ‘n’ slash genre, and Ninja Gaiden is the first mainline game in 13 years—making the review embargo date a huge milestone for players itching to see what Ryu is up to this time.</p>



<p>We still have memories of being destroyed in 2004’s Ninja Gaiden growing up. As a youngster, that game was punishing, but it naturally increases your resolve and helps to reduce the tears experienced in later life via Souls games and other torturous franchises. But Ninja Gaiden’s carried a reputation for years for being ruthlessly difficult.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-disgusting-levels-of-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4 offers difficulty settings</a>, making it something almost anyone can hop into. Be warned, though, the standard difficulty is relentless, so let’s see if the gameplay, systems, and design make it all worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-review-embargo-date-explained">Ninja Gaiden 4 Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s not anger anyone, eh? Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to multiple sources, the Ninja Gaiden 4 review embargo lifts on October 20, and it’s alleged that the embargo time is 4 PM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, various outlets and content creators have indicated that the review embargo date is October 20. If you’re keeping up with Ninja Gaiden 4’s launch, you’ll know why this is so significant—it’s the day before the game’s official release date!</p>



<p>Game Informer has said to expect their review on October 20, and David Jagneaux of GamesBeat has also indicated an October 20 review embargo date. However, specific review time details have been outed by <a href="https://x.com/GoodGameKofi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@GoodGameKofi</a>.</p>



<p>The content creator said: “<strong>I completed Ninja GAIDEN 4 a couple of days ago. Currently cooking a video review dropping October 20th @ 7pm EST. Look out for it.”</strong></p>



<p>Now, it could be the case that video reviews arrive later than written reviews, or this could be the universal review embargo time for written and video content. Take this information with a pinch of salt, just in case. </p>



<p>At the very least, we should expect Ninja Giaden 4 reviews to start flooding in on October 20.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-review-scores-prediction">Ninja Gaiden 4 Review Scores Prediction</h2>



<p><strong>We think a low-80s score is probably likely for Ninja Gaiden 4, based on previous NG titles and how it’s been received so far.</strong></p>



<p>There feels like a million Ninja Gaiden games, from remakes to spin-offs. Let’s dissect recent Ninja Gaiden games via their Metacritic scores to see where we might stand.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 3 was a disaster, scoring 58/100. Older Ninja Gaiden games were in the low-to-mid 90s, whereas recent entries like Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Ragebound have comfortably been in the 80s. This is the first new mainline game in over a decade, and its reception at Gamescom has been positive. There have been some doubters and dissension, too, so we think an <strong>82 or an 83</strong> is a likely final score.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Ninja Gaiden 4 does <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-director-tomonobu-itagaki-has-passed-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former Team Ninja leader Tomonobu Itagaki</a> proud.</p>

Tell us what you’ve made of its gameplay so far through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Through a new post on the official Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the executive producer at Marvel Games, Danny Koo, spoke more about the upcoming PvE Zombies mode. The new Marvel Zombies-inspired mode lets players embody one of 5 playable characters —Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff, or The Punisher —as they face off against endless hordes of zombies. Surviving is the goal until you can test your might against the two bosses, Zombie Namor and Queen of the Dead. </p>



<p>To take on this new threat, the developers have also granted each of the five heroes new abilities. Jeff can charge through the hordes, Blade can slice and dice through the bouncing Moon Blades, Thor gets a persistent Awakened State to shock more zombies, and Magik is getting an unlimited Darkchild form. The post also included a sneak peek of the Marvel Rivals PvE Zombies mode gameplay, featuring the 5-hero squad being ambushed by zombies from every angle, but still holding their ground. </p>
