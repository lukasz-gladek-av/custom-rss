<p>In a new interview with HBO’s The Last Of Us Season 2 showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, it’s been revealed that the timeline will be slightly different from the games source material.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-creators-set-stage-dense-episodes-season-2-exclusive-8783868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Druckmann said that there’s from “deviations of where we place things” in terms of the shows timeline compared to that of the game because of how a show has its own challenges.</p>



<p>We certainly are going to mess around with time the way it was in the source material, but as Neil said, we messed around in ways that we felt were appropriate for the show,” Mazin continued. </p>



<p>Of course, it’s impossible to know exactly what Mazin and Druckmann are referring to here, but fans familiar with the second game will know that a considerable character death does occur. In theory, it would make sense to keep said character alive for as long as possible, especially because the showrunners want it to continue well past season 3.</p>

<p>“I think it’s pretty likely that our story will extend past a season 3,” Mazin says. “How far past? I can’t say. And that’s not to say that there are not other stories that could be told, but this story is the one that Neil and I are telling.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-last-of-us-season-2-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Season 2</a> will have seven episodes, with the showrunners promising “high-calorie, dense episodes.” Mazin went on to say that “each one of these episodes packs quite a wallop. You will not be bored.”</p>



<p>The Last of Us Season 2 is scheduled to release sometime in April 2025, but no exact release date has yet been given.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the show? What do you think the showrunners did to mess around with the The Last of Us Season 2 timeline?</p>
