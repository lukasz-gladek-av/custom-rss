<p>Escape from Tarkov has a new event in <strong>both </strong>PvE and PvP, and it’s called Duck Hunt. It’s part of the collaboration between Tarkov and Escape from Duckov, a parody extraction shooter that came out last year. In Duck Hunt, players must find 69 (nice) ducks spread <strong>all over Tarkov</strong>, with there being up to <strong>ten ducks </strong>per map.</p>



<p>Additionally, players have to find and hand in <strong>fifteen food items </strong>added as part of Duck Hunt. It’s no small task, but the rewards are pretty good. Below, we’ve outlined how to complete Duck Hunt in Escape from Tarkov and given you the best tips on where to find the ducks.</p>



<p><strong>NOTE: The list below of duck locations is being built as they’re discovered by the community. You can help by commenting the locations you’ve found ducks hiding in!</strong></p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-find-ducks-in-duck-hunt-tarkov">How to Find Ducks in Duck Hunt (Tarkov)</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s latest update has added Duck Hunt, a mission you can accept from Jaeger at any level, without any prerequisites. It’s the beating (quacking) heart of the crossover event with Escape from Duckov, and truth be told, it’s pretty simple.</p>



<p>Here’s the mission description from Jaeger:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Come on in, take a seat, kid. You’re just the right person for waht I’ve got in mind.</p>



<p>Not long ago, Partisan and I got into a disagreement. I said a strong fighter always pays attention to what’s going on around him and notices anything out of the ordinary. Partisan argued that it doesn’t work that way. We don’t usually argue for this long, but this time we couldn’t see eye to eye. So, we decided to put it to the test. That’s where you come in.</p>



<p>Partisan hid toy ducks all over Tarkov. If you manage to find all of them in about a week, I win. If you don’t, then he does. I’ll say this up front: you need to look for the ducks not just in the woods, but insane all kinds of buildings too. And one more thing: the very first duck is in the Customs offices. But if anyone asks, you figured that out yourself.</p>



<p>And also, I’ve heard rumors that someone found an undelivered shipment of duck paté. They say all the cans are intact and the expiration dates are fine. It’s been such a long time since I’ve had any decent paté. Bring me a few cans, would you?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And here are the individual objectives for Duck Hunt:</p>



<ul>
<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Customs (10)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Shoreline (10)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Factory (9)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on  Woods (10)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Ground Zero (10)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Interchange (10)</li>



<li>Locate and shoot down all the toy ducks on Reserve (10)</li>



<li>Hand over the item: Can of duck pate (15)</li>
</ul>



<p>To get the best chance possible of finding ducks in Escape from Tarkov for Duck Hunt, you’ll need to put on a good headset. The initial tell that they’re close by is a quacking sound, but aside from that, they’re pretty well hidden.</p>



<p>On Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1r0yrir/screenshot_duck_hunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new thread popped up</a> with users eagerly trying to dig through the earliest locations for ducks in Tarkov.</p>
