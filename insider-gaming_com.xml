<p>Epic Games recently unveiled Fortnite Ballistic, an all-new first-person shooter built into the game’s core platform. It’s a competitive shooter by nature, boasting both a ranked and unranked ecosystem, and it has been designed to mimic one of the best-known esports operating models in the world.</p>



<p>It’s arriving in early access on December 11 – but let’s talk about the game’s potential to disrupt the established Fortnite esports paradigm.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ballistic-will-change-the-fortnite-scene">Ballistic Will Change the Fortnite Scene</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite Ballistic</a> is a tactical shooter that borrows elements from Counter-Strike 2 and VALORANT.</p>



<p>Each game is split up into several rounds, and the model follows the traditional ‘attackers vs. defenders’ structure that we know from so many other games. In Ballistic, Attackers need to carry a Rift Point Device to one of two sites on the map and plant it while the defending team tries to prevent that from happening.</p>



<p>That’s as cut and dry as it gets in the esports world, and it’s a system mirrored by Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, and other games.</p>



<p>It’s a first-to-seven game, which means each series will be a lengthy one.</p>



<p>Like other titles, Fortnite Ballistic gives players the bare minimum when they start each match. They’ll have a Ranger Pistol and 800 credits, and they’ll need to manage their eco appropriately as the game unfolds, earning more credits for eliminating enemies and planting the Rift Point Device.</p>



<p>In many ways, this is the most cookie-cutter model possible, but in others, it could be a boon for the Fortnite esports ecosystem that has been sorely missing after many years of battle royale rotations.</p>



<p>In Ballistic, weapons and equipment have been tapered to a select few items, to keep things as balanced as possible. In place of abilities (like VALORANT), players can use ‘Flex Gadgets’ such as the Proximity Mine, Bubble Shield, and Recon Grenade to gain an edge over their opponents.</p>



<p>It sounds like a dream for competitive FPS fans, and the fact that it’s built in Fortnite – a free-to-play title – means that it’ll have a huge draw at launch on December 11. There will be a ranked and unranked offering for players to soak up, and new settings will be introduced to the game to address the addition of a first-person perspective.</p>



<p>It’s only launching with one map, but imagine what things will look like when there is a host of maps and more equipment to flick through. This could be a cultural shift for the Fortnite esports ecosystem.</p>

<p>Epic Games has lifted the lid on Fortnite Ballistic, an all-new first-person experience built <strong>inside </strong>Fortnite. It’s launching in early access on December 11 with both ranked and unranked modes. It’ll serve as another angle to the Fortnite competitive ecosystem that players have loved for many years, but this time, the perspective has been completely altered.</p>



<p>In a post on the Fortnite blog, it was revealed that Fortnite Ballistic will launch into early access with <strong>one map</strong> – Skyline 10. It’ll drop with a select assortment of weapons and items, and as the community explores the game, Epic will make the necessary adjustments.</p>



<p>The new perspective starts here.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-introducing-fortnite-ballistic">Introducing: Fortnite Ballistic</h2>



<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a no-build competitive shooter that utilises the Fortnite platform in a much more intense way. It’s a no-holds-barred, 5v5 first-person shooter that’s broken down by rounds. Players are free to use their presets from the core platform, which means they’ll be able to use outfits, wraps, sprays, emotes, and more in Ballistic.</p>



<p>When it drops on December 11, Fortnite Ballistic will be available on all platforms and regions where Fortnite is supported <strong>except </strong>South Korea and Russia, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post revealed</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here’s how it works:</p>



<p>To start the match, players are sorted into two teams, attacking and defending. The attackers will try to plant a device at site A or site B on the map, while the defenders try to defend said sites. It’s the most typical competitive operating model we know, and it’s replicated in the likes of Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, Counter-Strike, and VALORANT.</p>



<p>Continuing the CS/VALORANT vibe, players will start each round with a pistol and credits, and as they play, they’ll unlock <strong>more </strong>credits, and thus better weapons and equipment.</p>



<p>It’ll have ranked and unranked modes from the get-go.</p>
