<p>As one of Xbox’s 2025 lineup, Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds 2 continues the satirical capitalist space opera its original showcased. Now, as part of Gamescom Opening Night Live, a new trailer for the upcoming game, recently price-cut, was shown off and gives us a bit more about companions, as well as new gameplay.</p>



<p>A sequel to the 2019 Bethesda/Obsidian RPG, The Outer Worlds 2 looks to be bigger and better than what came before. With a new story, characters, and planets to explore, it’s October 29th release can’t come soon enough for some. Luckily, we now have some new looks at gameplay, alongside the companions you’ll meet on your journey.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer above, we get our first big look at companions, who’ll help you on your outer space quest. New faces like Tristian and Niles will aid you in combat and have exclusive quests in the story. The Outer Worlds had the same system, with the most popular of the bunch being Harvati, played by Ashly Burch. </p>



<p>The press surrounding The Outer Worlds 2 has been quite well, with many previews applauding <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-the-first-preview-ign-first">the game’s evolution</a> from the original. Even more so, it looks to be even more in-depth with Perks/Flaws, gunplay, and the choice system. However, the title was priced at $80, which made some frustrated with Microsoft and Bethesda. Fortunately, due to backlash, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-cuts-prices-of-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-holiday-xbox-games/">announced last month</a> that it would go down to $70.</p>



<p>With the title being a Day One release on Xbox Game Pass, all of Obsidian’s 2025 titles can be played on the service. Those two, Grounded 2 (which is in early access) and Avowed, all received high praise upon release. Plus, given the original’s vast accolades for Game of the Year in 2019, there’s no doubt The Outer Worlds 2 is prepping to be another slam dunk for Obsidian and Bethesda.</p>

<p>Each new Silent Hill f trailer becomes more uncomfortable to watch, and this means the game is doing its job. Gamescom 2025 gave us another look at Silent Hill f—the newest mainline release—and as you can imagine, you’ll have trouble sleeping tonight.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-announced-for-gamescom-2025-black-ops-7-hollow-knight-silksong-ea-fc-26-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Gamescom</a> games train is chugging along. Konami’s showing included a new look at Silent Hill f. Deemed beautiful and unsettling, the horror sequel moves to Japan, and the new trailer gives us a new glimpse into the unknown.</p>







<figure><figcaption>I feel for you, Hinako. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the trailer shown at Gamescom, Hinako’s distressing experience starts with a murder scene, with noise from a police scanner playing overhead. It’s followed by a mysterious stranger declaring their plans to take Hinako’s soul, with combat scene then shown against morbid figures.</p>



<p>Even more distressing, dialogue then plays telling Hinako it’s “time to say goodbye” and that she will “kill them with your own hands,” before a plea for her to “just die.” It’s certainly enough to keep you awake at night. </p>



<p>Konami has dropped the new trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill f</a>, which you can watch for yourself here.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Silent Hill f feels like a big departure from the Silent Hill 2 Remake in terms of setting and gameplay. Do you think the franchise needs to do this to evolve? Or should it have continued to stick to its pure Western horror roots? It’s an interesting debate, and one you can take to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Honor of Kings: World is a new open-world MMO by Tencent, and it just got an impressive new trailer at Gamescom 2025. </p>



<p>A vast game based on the MOBA of the same name, Honor of Kings: World is a new MMO for PC that will be set in a vast open world and aims to take on Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft as the next big massively multiplayer adventure. </p>



<p>Like other games in the genre, Honor of Kings: World will be a class-driven experience where the heroes must go on a quest to save the world from a terrifying fallen god who’s hellbent on destruction. The game also received a brand new trailer at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced/">Gamescom</a>, so let’s dig into it. </p>







<p>You can check out the new trailer below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer shows off the game’s impressive open world that looks set to rival some of the biggest we’ve ever seen in RPG or MMO games. </p>



<p>While <a href="https://honorofkingsworld.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Honor of Kings: World</a> faces stiff competition from more established MMOs such as Lost Ark, it’s based on an existing franchise that has a lot of players already on mobile, so it’s an exciting time to be a fan of the genre. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Developed by Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, Ninja Gaiden 4 takes place immediately after the events of Ninja Gaiden 3, where the player will take the role of Yakumo. According to the developers, Yakumo was introduced to the series to make Ninja Gaiden more approachable for new players. However, for longtime fans, Ryu Hayabusa will make a return, though most of the footage has solely been on Yakumo.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is scheduled to release on October 21, 2025, for the PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series S|X. It will also be available Day One on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
