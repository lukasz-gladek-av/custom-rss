<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally has an official release date. </p>



<p>After weeks and months of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-ally-x-release-date-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors and leaks</a>, it was officially confirmed on Wednesday that the Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally will launch on October 16. The announcement came during the official Xbox Gamescom stream.</p>



<p>What fans might be surprised to find out, however, was that only a release date was announced. What wasn’t confirmed was the price of the devices, at least at the time of publishing. Even in the <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1958159636370174153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official post on social media</a>, pricing wasn’t mentioned. </p>



<p>There are rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-and-asus-delay-xbox-ally-price-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">circulating on the floor in Cologne</a> regarding the price after it was leaked yet again that it will cost $549.99 for the Xbox Ally and $899.99 for the Xbox Ally X. However, it’s pure speculation at this time.</p>



<p>When official pricing information is announced, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft announcing the release date of the Xbox Ally but not the pricing? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>
