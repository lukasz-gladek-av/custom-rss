<p>We’d like to think that everyone regularly showers to keep clean and healthy. While you may be sitting down for long Battlefield 6 sessions, we should be keeping that shower active. Players are reportedly being told by Battlefield 6 itself to take a shower, with the keyword being ‘reportedly.’</p>



<p>It can be hard to take anything for granted at face value in 2025. The overwhelming influx of AI means that so much of what we see online is up for debate. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-ps4-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> is an excellent shooter, and it’s easy to lose yourself, as Eminem once told us. But you definitely shouldn’t miss your opportunity to go outside, touch some grass, and keep on top of your personal hygiene!</p>



<p>Allegedly, EA is reminding you that this is the case.</p>

<figure><figcaption>To stink or not to stink, that is the question. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>An image circulated on social media of a Battlefield 6 player’s screen featuring a simple message: “Take a shower.” They were allegedly banned for a “few hours” as a result.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the alleged Battlefield 6 in-game message in its entirety:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Take A Shower. You have been playing for 16 hours straight we cannot allow you to continue on Battlefield 6 servers. We have restricted your account for a few hours please take a break. We have an obligation to keep our players and community safe. This ban is only temporary polease try again soon.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This would be quite an unprecedented message from a developer to stop the community from enjoying their game. Still, because the image is out there, it’s raising questions about its legitimacy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-s-take-a-shower-screen-real-or-ai">Is Battlefield 6’s Take A Shower Screen Real Or AI?</h2>



<p><strong>We can’t officially confirm if the message is fake, but all signs and evidence point to the Take A Shower screen being a semi-convincing case of Photoshop or AI.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, we haven’t had a single session of Battlefield 6 for 16 hours or more. Officially, we can’t debunk this. But there are several factors that should reinforce that this isn’t a real image.</p>



<h3 id="h-grammar">Grammar</h3>



<p>Where do we even start with the grammar? There’s a random space before “You” begins the paragraph, there are missing commas galore, and the sentence’s construction feels very sloppy and inorganic.</p>



<h3 id="h-qr-code">QR Code</h3>



<p>Quite simply, the QR Code doesn’t work. That’s about as big a telltale sign as you need, really. Unless our device was malfunctioning when we tried to scan it, it highlights that this image probably isn’t real.</p>



<h3 id="h-restricted-button">Restricted Button</h3>



<p>We’ve allegedly been told about the ban, why it’s happened, and that you can’t play anymore. It makes sense to have a “Quit” button, so why would there be a “Restricted” option? It reeks of an AI prompt that hasn’t fully grasped the initial request.</p>



<p>Feel free to make up your mind on the Take A Shower Screen. We don’t advise this, but if you desperately need clarification, there’s an easy way to test this: Either play the game for over 16 hours, or keep it running for that time.</p>



<p>If you manage to do any of this, let us know. Send us a picture, or go to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, so we can solve this bizarre mystery once and for all!</p>
