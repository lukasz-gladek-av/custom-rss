<p>The next Resident Evil remake is coming within the next 18 months. </p>



<p>In a post on social media, NateTheHate reaffirmed that not only is Resident Evil Code: Veronica being remade, but that it’s “deep in development”. He then went on the mention when Capcom is targeting a release.</p>







<p>“Target of release is first half 2027,” <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2014767509803512263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard claims of Code: Veronica being remade. In fact, rumblings about the game have been going on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since at least 2024</a>. Rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest that the remake</a> of the 26-year-old game will be announced sometime this year ahead of the aforementioned 2027 launch.</p>







<p>Resident Evil Code: Veronica first launched in February 2000, exclusively for the Sega Dreamcast. After that console went under, the game was re-released as Resident Evil Code: Veronica X for the PlayStation 2 (2001) and Nintendo GameCube (2003). It even came to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. </p>
