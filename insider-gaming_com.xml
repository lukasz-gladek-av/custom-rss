<p>If you didn’t know, EA announced a while back that it was working on an open-world addition to the EA FC franchise. Recently, a new FC playtest has been underway, and it’s been revealed that it’s indeed for the open-world content. Gameplay footage has leaked and been shared already.</p>



<p>All publicity is good publicity. Yes, the EA FC open-world game mode playtest is supposed to be private, but the community is desperate to see what it looks like, what you can do, and how it plays. Internal documents have already revealed the expected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fcs-new-open-world-mode-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC open-world mode release window</a>, and there’s gameplay to keep you ticking over.</p>



<h2 id="h-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-leaks-early">EA FC Open World Gameplay Leaks Early</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even Cole agrees the footage is cold. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>There were rumors that an EA FC open-world mode would be akin to NBA 2K’s open-world hub. It would include fun mini-games and ways to interact with other players.</p>



<p>This seems to be the case. You can check out leaked videos and gameplay, especially through <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-fc-open-world-map-has-already-leaked-during-playtests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ, as they first reported that gameplay had leaked</a>. You can also find snippets across all forms of social media.</p>



<p>Check out the initial media here, but be warned, there’s every chance EA will have the content removed.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players can dip in and out of several mini-games, watch from the sidelines if needed, walk around, and talk to other users, and the initial maps look quite sizable. Rumor has it that there <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-open-world-will-have-several-maps-to-explore-based-on-major-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be several maps to explore based on major countries</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, a quick search on X, TikTok, and YouTube is bound to give you the footage you’re looking for. It’s certainly out there. EA is presumably doing its best to clamp down on leaked clips and have the gameplay footage removed. You might need to be quicker than Mbappe to see certain videos!</p>



<p>Does an open-world EA FC gameplay mode interest you? Should EA be concentrating its efforts on other areas of EA FC, such as Career Mode or Clubs? The place to dissect all of this and more is the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, which continues to grow each day.</p>

<p>The zombie horde returns to face off against players in Black Ops 7, and, as has become customary in the mode, there are a wealth of Perk-A-Colas available that assist in the battle to fend off the undead army.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches worldwide on November 14</a>, bringing a new campaign, complete with four-player co-op, multiplayer action, and Zombies, the latter of which will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expanded further with the addition of new maps</a> throughout the game’s lifespan.</p>



<p>Perk-A-Colas have long been a core part of the mechanics of Zombies in the Call of Duty franchise, and we’ve got all the details on what will be available to save up for in Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-perk-a-colas">All Black Ops 7 Perk-A-Colas</h2>

<p><strong>Black Ops 7 Zombies launches</strong> <strong>with 12 Perk-A-Colas available, 11 of which are returning to the franchise, with the other being brand new.</strong></p>



<p>Wisp Tea is the only new Perk-A-Cola added to Black Ops 7 Zombies at launch, with a unique benefit that summons a companion wisp after killing zombies. All other Perk-a-Colas in the game have featured in the franchise in the past, with the majority having been available in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Zombies will be regularly updated throughout the game’s lifespan, however, so new and returning Perk-A-Colas could come later down the line with seasonal updates.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the available Perk-A-Colas at launch in Black Ops 7 Zombies, along with a description of the bonus they provide.</p>
