<p>Veteran game developer Katsuhiro Harada has announced his departure from Bandai Namco after working on the Tekken franchise for 30 years. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tekken-8-producer-provides-a-character-breakdown-for-fahkumram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tekken franchise</a> has long been one of the pillars of the fighting game genre, and Katsuhiro Harada has been at the heart of it. His goodbye marks the end of an era for the Tekken, but the Tekken 8 team has been quick to shut down any fan concerns regarding the departure of their studio director.</p>

<p>Harada confirmed his departure in a statement shared online, explaining that the decision came after a period of personal and professional loss. He revealed that the “loss of several close friends” and watching senior colleagues retire or pass away pushed him to reflect deeply on “the time [he] has left as a creator.” After decades spent shaping the world, characters, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anna-williams-tekken-3-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legacy of Tekken</a>, he felt the moment was right to close this chapter.</p>



<p>His message also looked back on his early days at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-bandai-namco-partnership-billion-yen-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bandai Namco</a>, recalling humble beginnings at local Japanese arcade tournaments and tracing his journey through the studio’s growth and Tekken’s global rise. He thanked fans for their unwavering support and noted that he will share details about his future plans in due course.</p>

<p>In response to his announcement, the <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tekken development team</a> issued their own statement, assuring players that Harada’s departure will not impact Tekken 8’s ongoing development or post-launch roadmap. They emphasised their commitment to continuing the series “with the vision and spirit built by Harada-san,” promising to keep community feedback at the core of their approach as Tekken moves into its next era.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Rope Battles monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Coins, Diamonds and much more.</p>



<p>Rope Battles is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forge-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that sounds rather simple as players are placed in an intense combat arena where they use ropes, traps, items and whatever they can find to battle others. While it sounds like a rather easy game, players need to strategically master various rope techniques, timing, and special abilities to outmanoeuvre opponents. The main objective of the game is to create the ultimate rope fighter and battle against friends or other players to test your skills.</p>



<p>Progression in Rope Battles revolves around improving your fighter and collecting the game’s two main currencies: Coins and Diamonds. Like most Roblox games, they are the player’s main resources within the Rope Battles universe and allow them to improve their fighter by buying new ropes, items and more. And so, because earning coins (and diamonds) purely through playing can be slow, redeeming official codes is a major boost — codes give you free Coins, sometimes Diamonds, or even spins.</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Crash Bots is a fairly straightforward process with no prerequisite steps. However, for players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeeming Crash Bots codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Rope Battles on Roblox.</li>



<li>Click the Code button in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Enter a code into the pop-up text box.</li>



<li>Press Claim and enjoy your rewards.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-rope-battles-codes">How To Get More Rope Battles Codes</h2>



<p>Rope Battles codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the developer’s social media pages. That includes the Reworld Makers community on Roblox, which you’ll need to join to access some codes. However, keeping track of the various sources can be time-consuming, especially with no system in place to tell users when the codes expire.</p>



<p>Thus, we suggest bookmarking this guide in your browser, as we refresh it as soon as new Rope Battles codes are released and remove expired codes once they are no longer valid.</p>
