<p>Nvidia is making some major changes to its GeForce Now game streaming service, including putting a limit on how much people can play games on the service.</p>



<p>In a new post on the service’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Reddit page</a>, Nvidia revealed that next year will see limits of 100 hours per month to play games using GeForce Now subscription service. </p>



<p>The company says its to “continue providing exceptional quality and speed” as well as “shorter queue times”. This limit will be placed on Performance and Ultimate subscribers. The Performance plan gives players 1440p streaming, ray tracing, and six-hour play seassions for $9.99 per month. Ultimate ups the resolution to 4K 120 or 1080p 240 with ray tracing, HDR, DLSS 3, and eight-hour sessions for $19.99 per month.</p>



<p>Free subscribers, which only offers one-hour sessions and has ads, won’t have a monthly limit.</p>



<p>“This ample limit comfortably accommodates 94% of members, who typically enjoy the service well within this timeframe,” Nvidia said.</p>



<p>The company added that up to 15 hours of unused playtime will be rolled over to the next month. Think of it like the minutes rollover from old school cell phone plans.</p>



<p>At its max, players can have up to 115 hours of playtime available in a given month. Should you go over your threshold however, it’ll cost you. Nvidia says it will cost players $2.99 for 15 more hours per month on the Performance plan. Those on the Ultimate will get 15 hours at $5.99 for the month.</p>



<p>With the 100 limit starting in 2025, not everyone will be held to it right away. Nvidia says that those who are active paid members by December 31, 2024 won’t be affected by the changes until January 2026. That gives them an extra year of unlimited playtime.</p>



<p>Lastly, those with a Founders membership to will have unlimited playtime “for life”. Upgrading or changing their membership, however, will apply the new limits.</p>



<p>What do you think of the play time limits for Nvidia GeForce Now? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>It’s always nice to see someone giving Escape From Tarkov a run for its money in the extraction shooter space, and the free-to-play Arena Breakout: Infinite appears to be holding its own. There were some controversies initially, like with its monetization system, but the first-person shooter garnered a following and has held firm. Now, they’re about to launch Arena Breakout: Infinite Season 1, complete with a new map, new weapons, unique gameplay elements, and more!</p>

<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the launch of season one</a> before returning to Arena Breakout: Infinite, or if you haven’t stopped playing the extraction shooter but desire more content, you should know you don’t have to wait long. It’s out on November 20, and it’s said to be the most significant update to the game since its launch.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile’s minimum requirements will be increased to iOS 17/Android 13 or higher from November 14, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the latest <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1854249671994012087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a>, Warzone Mobile’s minimum specifications require devices with iOS 17/Android 13 or higher on a device with a GPU capable of bindless texturing. If players wish to receive updates and access to the latest game version for Season 1 and beyond, they must meet those requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All is not lost for Warzone Mobile players who don’t meet the minimum requirements. The developers have provided 6 months for players to transition to a new device. Players with older iOS and Android versions can play “version 3.10 for a limited time (approximately six months),” provided they were already on ver 3.10 before November 14.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warzone Mobile developers have stated that the minimum requirements had to be updated for future updates and integrations with the Call of Duty franchise. They are currently working to bring new shared features such as Omnimovement and connected content coming with BO6/WZ S1. </p>



<p>IPhone X and below do not support iOS 17; you will need an iPhone XS or higher to play the latest version of Warzone Mobile.

<p>Shift Up has just confirmed that Stellar Blade can take advantage of the PS5 Pro’s processing power. For those running the game on Sony’s latest iteration of the PlayStation 5, two new graphics presets can be found in the settings: Pro and Pro Max. Both of these prests introduce HFR, but Pro Max causes a noticeable frame rate drop.</p>

<h2 id="h-photo-mode-when">Photo Mode When?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1854524305813717406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media platforms</a>, Shift Up posted a comparison video showcasing the difference between PS5 and PS5 Pro Stellar Blade gameplay. It takes something of a trained eye to truly spot the difference, but it’s there – somewhere.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Of course, in the comments under these posts, fans were quick to demand an ETA for photo mode, which was announced recently by Shift Up and is on the way. It doesn’t have a date for when it’s going to be added to the game, but it’s one of the most highly anticipated features that fans are holding out for.</p>



<p>It should have been present when the game was released, but who am I to judge?</p>



<p>The team also revealed recently that the game’s first major DLC is on the way. In September, the team at Shift Up announced a Stellar Blade x Nier Automata crossover that will ‘bring post-apocalyptic universes colliding together’. </p>



<p>In April, when Stellar Blade was released, it topped the charts and shifted a million copies in just a few weeks, which isn’t bad for a new IP. It’s encouraging to see that Shift Up has plans to deliver more content, and this PR5 Pro Max upgrade is only the beginning.</p>

<p>Take-Two has two big releases coming up next year, GTA 6 and Borderlands 4, and the CEO has just confirmed that both titles will not be released close to each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick stated that they would not release GTA 6 and Borderlands 4 in the same period, even though they have similar release windows. When asked about this, Zelnick stated, “I think it’s safe to say that we wouldn’t, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that GTA 6 is scheduled to release in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall of 2025</a>, as confirmed during the latest earnings call, and Borderlands 4 has been announced for fiscal year 2026, which falls between April 1, 2025 and March 31, 2026. It is hard to figure out Take-Two’s release plans for both titles, but they could reserve 2025 for GTA 6 and let Borderlands 4 find its glory in 2026.&nbsp;We will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure. </p>



<p>In the same interview, Zelnick also acknowledged the Borderlands movie’s disappointing run; however, he added that<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-disappointing-but-helped-sell-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it helped sell more video games within the franchise</a>. Zelnick stated that they are still looking forward to more adaptations of their intellectual properties and have selectively licensed some of them. Currently, they have a deal pending on the ‘Bioshock’ adaptation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Red Dead Redemption series has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-series-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 92 million units</a>. Also, a new PGA Tour 2K title has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed for 2025</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-weapon-customization/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-weapon-customization-lets-you-add-a-shotgun-to-a-sniper-rifle.1029732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-weapon-customization/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Since the days of Army of Two, I’ve been a fan of weapon customization in video games. It’s satisfying to take a standard rifle or submachine gun, modify it to your liking, and make it a memorable weapon that remains with you throughout the story. In Stalker 2, weapon customization proves extensive, and you have many unique options—pistols, SMGs, sniper rifles, and even light machine guns.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-weapon-customization-like-in-stalker-2">What’s Weapon Customization Like in Stalker 2?</h2>



<p>Thanks to a recent gameplay trailer, ‘Smoking Barrels,’ we now better understand the weapon customization mechanics in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It appears GSC Game World borrowed plenty from past titles, including the weapon upgrade menu and mechanic, which is genuinely nice to see return. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl - Exclusive Smoking Barrels Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAz3_4uvG0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch above in its entirety, showcases several unique weapons found across the Zone, along with customization, upgrade mechanics, and even jam and maintenance gameplay. According to the studio, we must account for our weapon’s cleanliness, ballistics, physics, and even the ammunition type we bring to each encounter.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-stalker-2-weapons-that-we-know-so-far">All Stalker 2 Weapons That We Know So Far</h2>



<p>In all, there are 35 weapons in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, ranging from early-game handguns to late-game machine guns and launchers. You’ll likely wind up with a favorite. I have my eye on the OTs-02 Kiparis for close-range encounters and the AS VAL for everything else, but I know many will opt for the HK416 for its modularity and accuracy.</p>
