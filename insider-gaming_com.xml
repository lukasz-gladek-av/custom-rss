<p>Thunderful has announced its second restructuring in less than a year’s time. This time, it could see up to 100 people lose their jobs within the company.</p>



<p>The announcement came on Thursday via the <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s website</a>.</p>



<p>“This newly announced program follows the cost-saving measures introduced earlier this year, as well as the divestment of the Group’s distribution business to manage previously incurred net debt,” Thunderful said. “Whilst significant reductions in cost levels were achieved this year, revenue targets have not been met and the Group is still struggling with negative cash flow.”</p>



<p>This restructuring will see the company move focus to external publishing with third-party games. Thunderful says it will “reduce the Group´s fixed costs and allow for greater flexibility, enabling faster, diverse game releases by leveraging external talent and resources in a balanced manner, while still retaining some internal development capacity.”</p>



<p>“It is regrettable to announce a second restructuring of Thunderful in less than a year, but we unfortunately see no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group’s long-term sustainability and resilience,” Thunderful CEO Martin Walfisz said.</p>



<p>As part of the moves, somewhere between 80-100 people in and outside of Sweden will lose their jobs. Those in management and administration will also be impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>Thunderful expects to have one-time costs of $22.8M – $27.4M as part of separation costs after negotiating with unions. In total, however, they anticipate the job  cuts to improve the overall cash flow by $73M – $82.2M.</p>



<p>In 2024, there have been nearly 14,000 known jobs lost due to layoffs across more than 160 companies.</p>



<p>What do you think of the restructuring and layoffs at Thunderful? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Trading has been part of the Pokémon fabric and DNA since day one. It’s no surprise Trading is a huge topic of discussion in Pocket, and I’ve gathered the latest news and announcements to tell you everything we know about Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Trading mechanic.</p>



<p>Once you’ve opened many Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">packs</a> and reeled off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Picks</a>, your collection should look very full; but you’re also bound to have tons of duplicates. Getting extras of the same card is crucial when it comes to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-flair-in-pokemon-pocket-tcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flair</a> in Pokémon TCG Pocket, but it can become an annoyance too. There are so many Pokémon I love when I first pull but become irritated by when I see them for the 10th time—or twice in one pack!</p>



<p>You can swap duplicates in real life—one area where the physical edition of the Pokémon TCG differs from the virtual format. We know Trading is in Pokémon TCG Pocket, but questions are being asked about it daily, and I’ll answer them now.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-trade-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Can you Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let me Trade, please! Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You cannot Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket at present</strong> as the feature is currently locked behind a notice saying “<strong>Coming soon.</strong>” I think this part of the equation is quite self-explanatory. You can’t Trade, but The Pokémon Company has addressed the future of the mechanic.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket">When is Trading Coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>As announced by the <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP_JP/status/1856864629009363249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket X social media page</a>, “<strong>January 2025</strong>” is the official start period for Trading.</p>



<p>The post has been <a href="https://x.com/PokemonDealsTCG/status/1856820750529040857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">translated</a>, and says, “We are aiming to add a feature that allows certain cards to be Traded started in January 2025. We are gradually planning to expand the selection of cards that are able to be Traded.”</p>



<p>So, <strong>not all cards can be Traded on day one</strong>. Using my best judgment, I’d say all cards ranging between <strong>one and three diamonds</strong> are going to be eligible to Trade. It does mean EX cards and other mega-rare pulls—such as Full Arts—need to wait a bit longer. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, like many players, I find myself in the situation where I have completed most of the main Genetic Apex set, and I’m mainly missing the odd EX card, as well as Full Arts. The Pokémon Company likely doesn’t want so many people having every card already, and it encourages players to spend more money and open more packs in a bid to pull the rarest cards.</p>



<p>Also, don’t be surprised if <strong>Gold Crown cards are never made Tradeable in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</strong> We’ll update this as we learn more about the card criteria for Trading.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-trade-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The actual Trading process hasn’t been outlined yet, but we wager a similar system to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon GO</a> is likely to be employed: Direct, one-to-one Trading between connected players, and you need to have a certain amount of currency to do so.</p>



<p>Pokémon GO requires Stardust to Trade—with certain cards made untradable altogether—and I expect you probably need a certain amount of Shinedust to Trade in Pokémon Pocket. The amount likely depends on the rarity of the creature, and Trading may be limited to a certain amount per day. This is all conjecture for now, but I can’t imagine the system will drastically deviate from this theory.</p>

<p>When Obsidian announced Avowed’s delay <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-confirmed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out of November 2024</a> to February 2025, the reason given was that it gave the game time to breath on its own against what would’ve been fierce competition. While some fans didn’t believe that to be the case, Xbox head Phil Spencer once again claimed that the decision wasn’t because of the game’s quality.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a> (subscription needed), Spencer said that the company had so many games releasing that it just made sense to move Avowed. </p>

<p>“We can afford it when we have the Diablo expansion, then Black Ops, then Indy [and the Great Circle],” he said. “We didn’t move it because Obsidian needed the time. They’ll use the time.”</p>



<p>With the game now set to launch on February 18, Avowed will still face competition from games outside of the Microsoft umbrella such as Civilization 7, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Monster Hunter Wilds, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and more. Despite those other game’s releasing, it seems as though Avowed won’t see another delay based on Spencer’s comments.</p>



<p>Spencer added that discussions with Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty and the Game Pass team helped them spread out the releases of their games to where they see a fit.</p>



<p>When it launches, Avowed will be available exclusively on Xbox Series X|S and PC. The game will also be a day one release on Game Pass.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare%E2%80%99s-night-ops-update-coming-november-27.1036023/</guid>

<p>MADFINGER Games has just revealed an exclusive new trailer showcasing the long-awaited Night Ops update for Gray Zone Warfare. This monumental and major overhaul introduces a day-night cycle to the open-world tactical shooter, forever altering the course of combat and further proving that in Gray Zone Warfare, <strong>every move matters</strong>.</p>



<p>In the snapshot trailer, we get a glimpse at how the world of Lamang changes under a veil of darkness. From new equipment to combat the shadows to quests that can only be completed at night, Gray Zone Warfare players are preparing to eat well when the Night Ops update is released on November 27.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-continuous-improvement">Continuous Improvement</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024 to a very positive reception, despite there being some teething issues.</p>



<p>MADFINGER has been a stalwart force in tackling these issues, working hard to deliver a game that continuously improves and innovates, with community-led feedback sitting at the heart of everything the team does.</p>



<p>The Night Ops update has been on the cards for a couple of months, and following the release of a new teaser trailer, it has been revealed when that update will hit the ecosystem.</p>



<p>If you’re a Gray Zone Warfare fan eager to jump into some night-based activity, you won’t need to wait long. The Night Ops update will be released in Gray Zone Warfare on  November 27, which is also when MADFINGER will publish a full, feature-length trailer showcasing the impending changes.</p>



<p>I played Gray Zone Warfare as soon as hit early access this year and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-preview/">was blown away</a> by the depth of the game and the ambition of MADFINGER. I was then welcomed by the team at Gamescom to learn about these changes and to talk at length <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Marek Rabas</a>, the CEO of MADFINGER, about the future of extraction shooters.</p>



<p>If you’ve been enjoying Gray Zone Warfare, believe me when I say you’re not ready for Night Ops – it’s going to bring about a paradigm shift that’ll forever change how you play the game, but it’s <strong>all good things</strong>.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Night Ops? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A month after version 1.0 was released on PC and console, Undisputed has received its first post-launch update for all players. The update addresses a few key concerns from the community while developer Steel City Interactive continues to work on it’s planned December update. </p>



<p>Some of the key fixes in Update 1.1.3 include adjustments to Deontay Wilder’s stats for more fair online play, removeable of the critical stumble reaction, updated blocking, and more. You can check out the full patch notes from the update for yourself.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-undisputed-update-details">Undisputed Update Details</h2>



<ul>
<li>Changes to the block colliders to ensure that block functions as expected and the number of power punches that break through the block is greatly reduced.</li>



<li>Deontay Wilder’s stats have been reduced, and we’ve removed a trait. His power hooks should now be less impactful.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased max stamina cost of hooks and straights.</li>



<li>Increased the cost of power punches to both short-term and max stamina.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Introduced a threshold on the number of power punches that can be thrown within a single fight before the stamina cost per power punch is increased further.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased the stamina cost of pushing, which should reduce the amount of people spamming the push mechanic.</li>



<li>Temporarily removed the critical stumble reaction from the game as it was too punishing.</li>



<li>Reduced the effectiveness and chainability of hooks by further slowing them down when a fighter is gassed.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that would prevent players from moving if they entered flat-footed movement while fighting on the inside.</li>



<li>On Xbox and PC Steam: Ranked quitters should now receive a loss on their record, and the remaining player should receive a win. The fix for PlayStation is taking longer than we’d like and will hopefully be part of the December update.&nbsp;</li>
