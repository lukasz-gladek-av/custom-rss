</ul>



<p>To unlock Ranked Play in Black Ops 6, players will need to win 50 match-made multiplayer matches:&nbsp;</p>

<li>This ensures that players are experienced with multiplayer before they enter the mode and gives #TeamRICOCHET a historical match history to examine before an account enters Ranked Play&nbsp;</li>



<li>#TeamRICOCHET also utilizes its Replay Investigation Tool to monitor replays of top players as part of the investigation process&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Detection systems initially deployed at launch from #TeamRICOCHET to collect data to test for effectiveness will be activated to help flag accounts for action beginning with Season 01.&nbsp;</p>

<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4>Weapons</h4>



<p>Throughout the pre-season we have seen a steady and healthy variety of weapon usage. Most weapons sit quite closely in both performance and pick rate, with no weapons dominating in both areas. As such our first round of Season 01 tuning changes will not be introducing any major shifts to the current state of weapon balance, and instead focus on elevating some of the weapons at the bottom of the pack. We are also addressing feedback regarding Assault Rifle damage in Hardcore and completing our adjustments to the shotgun slug attachment.</p>



<p>Reminder: We’re using a new Weapon Damage Adjustments tables to identify post-patch damage changes when possible. Need an explainer?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes#explainweapondamagetables">Click here!</a></p>



<h5>All Weapons</h5>



<ul>
<li>Adjusted weapon motion while moving and changing stances to improve aiming feel and centering (especially with optics).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Hold Breath focus state will now be maintained while firing if applicable.</li>



<li>Improved Weapon depth of field settings when performing a Weapon Inspect.</li>
</ul>



<h5>Assault Rifles&nbsp;</h5>



<ul>
<li>We are increasing the damage values for some of our Assault Rifles to ensure that they kill in just one bullet in Hardcore modes. The headshot multiplier changes have either kept the bullets to kill with headshots the same or even improved them at some Min Damage Ranges.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-zombies">Zombies</h3>



<h4>Maps&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Terminus&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where defuse progress was sometimes not saved if the player stopped defusing during the Apocalypse Protocol Main Quest step.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where entering a Kazimir after completing the Main Quest would teleport the player to the boss arena and down them.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where loading into a saved game after unlocking the Pack-A-Punch machine could cause some doors to have inconsistent collision.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue during the Main Quest where connecting both Node Connectors at the same time would cause overlapping voice lines.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Changed the location of the Ammo Cache on the Seaside Path.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Liberty Falls&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updated the first Mangler whose arm is blown off to always drop a Mangler Cannon instead of only the first Mangler that spawns.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Resolved an issue where Blanchard would not be present during some dialogue.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4>Weapon Adjustments&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The recent changes to Assault Rifles in Zombies were an unintended carryover from a global weapon tuning pass. We do not intend to inherit all MP weapon tuning without looking at how it affects Zombies tuning as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have corrected this in this update, while also making a pass on increasing the damage performance of ARs in Zombies. All ARs have had their Pack-a-Punched base damage and overall critical damage increased. While you may see the word “decreased” in a few places, the performance for these weapons is still increased overall!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the HE-1 Launcher has gotten a buff to become more useful at stopping hordes of zombies. When Pack-a-Punched, it will now have more stock ammo and a larger explosion with more overall damage.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where camos were not being applied to Zombie Builds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to have 3 weapons.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where Wallbuy rarity would reset when loading into a save.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Elemental Pop&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where Elemental Pop would prevent normal Ammo Mod activations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Jugger-nog&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Turtle Shell Augment
<ul>
<li>Turtle Shell will now apply damage mitigation when being grabbed by an Amalgam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>PHD Flopper&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where diving onto an elevated or inclined surface, such as stairs or up a hill, would not activate the perk.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4>Challenges&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where Wall Buys would not progress the Prestige 8 Challenge Value Town.&nbsp;</li>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-100-hours-complete-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2: Haert of Chornobyl</a> arrives on November 20, marking the epic and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-gone-gold-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly anticipated</a> sequel to Stalker: Call of Pripyat. It’s one of the most exciting releases of 2024, arriving just in time before the end of the year.</p>



<p>The game brings an eerie atmosphere of unsettling survival, where ammo and resources are limited. Many are looking forward to taking on the challenge, but some are wondering if Stalker 2 will be available on PS5.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about whether Stalker 2 will be available on PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-stalker-2-be-on-ps5">Will Stalker 2 be on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Stalker 2 will not launch on PlayStation consoles</strong> and there are no details regarding the FPS game coming to PS5 in the future.</p>



<p>Stalker 2 will launch exclusively for Xbox Series X|S and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> via Windows. The game will launch on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-stalker-2-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass for PC and the Series X|S</a>. You can also purchase the game via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to GSC Game World.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The previous title, Call of Pripyat, was available on PlayStation 4, so there’s a chance that the game could eventually make its way over to PlayStation. However, there are no details regarding Stalker 2 making its way to Sony’s console just yet. </p>



<p>Many Xbox exclusive titles have eventually made their way to PlayStation such as Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush, so perhaps Stalker 2 will follow a similar trajectory and make its way to PS5 somewhere down the line.</p>



<p>If any new information is unearthed about Stalker 2’s availability on PlayStation, we’ll be sure to update this piece with the latest, so stay tuned. How do you feel about Stalker 2 being exclusive to Xbox and PC? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum</a>.</p>

<p>Citadelle des Morts will arrive in the <strong>mid-season update for Black Ops 6 Season 1</strong>. As the new season arrived on November 14, and seasons tend to last around 8 weeks, we expect the Season 1 Reloaded update to arrive on <strong>Thursday, December 12, 2024</strong>.</p>



<p>Take this with a pinch of salt, as this is just speculation and not an official release date. Once Treyarch confirm the date for the mid-season update, we’ll be sure to let you know exactly when the new Zombies map will be arriving.</p>

<h2 id="h-citadelle-des-morts-map-details">Citadelle des Morts map details</h2>



<p>Citadelle des Morts (Citadel of the Dead) is a <strong>round-based Black Ops 6 Zombies map that’s located in Europe</strong>, specifically the Principality of Avalon. It’s an <strong>abandoned medieval castle</strong> that is host to ghoulish horrors and hidden secrets. We don’t know many details, but from the teaser image, we expect the map to be fairly big.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, players will take control of the BO6 Zombies crew, <strong>Weaver, Maya, Carver, and Grey, directly after the events of Terminus</strong>.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time players have fought waves of the undead in a castle, as Black Ops 3 brought Der Eisendrache. Hopefully, Citadelle des Morts can live up to the setting, as Der Eisendrache is one of the most beloved maps of all time.</p>



<p>The new map also arrives alongside a new Perk, Wonder Weapon, Gobblegums, Augments, and enemy types.</p>
