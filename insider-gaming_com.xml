<p>A new claim states that Halo Studios plans to remake the original trilogy. </p>



<p>A couple of months ago, there was a leak about Halo Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-2-and-3-campaign-remakes-development-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaking the campaigns</a> for Halo 2 and Halo 3, with a mainline Halo 7 in development that will feature multiplayer. Now, another insider has reiterated these leaks, along with some additional details. </p>







<h2 id="h-halo-trilogy-remakes-reportedly-in-the-works-to-ensure-halo-s-new-era-doesn-t-fail">Halo Trilogy Remakes Reportedly in the Works to Ensure ‘Halo’s New Era Doesn’t Fail’</h2>



<p>The latest bit of information on the Halo Trilogy remakes comes through a new video by Rebs Gaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klr-B5pd_pE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. He first talks about the post by Halo leaks, which had mentioned Halo 2 and Halo 3 getting full campaign remakes. Rebs then discusses Dan Gniady joining Halo Studios as a lead game designer on a new project, which turned out to be the Halo CE Remake. Dan has also seemingly teased that the trilogy is being remade in his LinkedIn post, which reads, “Doing a game direction on a Halo Experience, Giving the Covenant back their bomb.” However, this is just speculation.</p>



<p>Rebs then points at another source that has mentioned Halo Trilogy Remakes, which is TechnicalHalo on <a href="https://x.com/TechnicalHalo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. Rebs talks about their post from 2024, which states that Halo Studios decided to resell the entire series rather than porting the Master Chief Collection to PlayStation for “a higher potential revenue,” and the plan was to remake Halo CE to Halo 3. Additionally, the leaker also stated that Halo 2 and 3 remakes will launch from the same game. </p>



<p>Rebs also did some digging of his own on the Halo Trilogy remake. He first spoke to a former Halo Studios dev, who revealed that the studio is indeed remaking the original games, but didn’t share more details due to an NDA. Another source confirmed the remakes, along with the reason why Halo Studios is remaking games rather than creating new experiences. </p>



<p>The source stated that Microsoft and Halo Studios want to ensure ‘Halo’s new era doesn’t fail,’ so they are playing it safe and avoiding risks. The teams want to avoid making another Halo game, which would draw heavy criticism from OG fans. Hence, they are playing it safe by remaking the original games, as “they can’t afford to fail again,” and the original Halo games were so successful that many fans still play them. </p>



<p>Rebs added that this statement doesn’t mean developers aren’t working on a new Halo project; there are different teams in the studio, with some working only on campaign remakes and others on the multiplayer project.</p>



<p>Readers should note that this information doesn’t come from an official source, so treat it with caution. Official confirmation about a Halo Trilogy remake will only come through the devs. </p>
