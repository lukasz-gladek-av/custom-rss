<p>Game Science has teased Black Myth: Wukong’s attendance during the Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom. Fans saw this reveal and instantly jumped to the assumption that Black Myth: Wukong DLC is inbound and about to be revealed. The time is right, and the game drops on Xbox just one day after the Opening Night Live show.</p>



<p>It has been almost a year to the day since Black Myth: Wukong was released, and fans are <strong>hungry </strong>for more content.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-myth-wukong-at-gamescom">Black Myth: Wukong at Gamescom</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the Game Science team behind 2024’s Black Myth: Wukong teased a reveal:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Destined Ones, GameScience will be joining this year’s Gamescom Opening Night Live. The show kicks off at 8:00 p.m. (CEST) on August 19, and we look forward to seeing you there.<a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1956174001128268031/photo/1"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The core belief within the community is that a grand expansion is incoming for the game that turned heads in August 2024 when it proved to be one of the most successful additions to an already dense lineup of Soulslike games.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The post went hand-in-hand with a charming image showing fearsome monsters, calligraphy, and some ethereal elements. In the comments under the post, a user translated the visible script:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The extraordinary is ordinary in this world; ‘gods and devils’ often wear respectable attire.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Strangely, there’s a date on the image of August 20, 2025, the <strong>day after </strong>the Opening Night Live reveal will be shown. This has fans believing that a shadowdrop of sorts will take place, with Game Science revealing that Black Myth: Wukong DLC will be available almost instantly after the show.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is officially my most highly anticipated game of 2025. I can’t wait for it to be released in September, and you can bet your last dollar I’ll be picking up the Deluxe Edition. With that being said, I thought I’d take some time to explain all the Dying Light: The Beast pre-order bonuses and rewards, as there are a few that you can unlock.</p>



<p>Let’s take a deep dive into Dying Light: The Beast and learn about the Hero of Harran bundle and all the digital content and cosmetics you get for pre-ordering Dying Light: The Beast</p>



<h2 id="h-every-dying-light-the-beast-pre-order-bonus">Every Dying Light: The Beast Pre-Order Bonus</h2>



<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast pre-order bonuses include the Hero of Harran bundle, which comes with an exclusive Ultimate Survivor outfit, crossbow, and vehicle skin.</strong></p>



<p>The Hero of Harran bundle shouldn’t be missed, and fans of the franchise would be remiss to skip over the content, even if it’s ‘only’ in-game cosmetics.</p>



<p>Here’s everything included in the Hero of Harran bundle:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ultimate Survivor outfit</li>



<li>Harran combat knife</li>



<li>In Jade’s Memory pistol</li>



<li>The Follower crossbow</li>



<li>Castor Woods Patrol vehicle</li>
</ul>



<p>All pre-orders for Dying Light: The Beast will earn the Hero of Harran bundle free of charge.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-deluxe-edition-of-dying-light-the-beast">What’s in the Deluxe Edition of Dying Light: The Beast</h2>



<p>While every pre-order of Dying Light: The Beast secures the Hero of Harran bundle, buying the Deluxe Edition grants you so much more. As this is a digital-first release, everything is in-game or available separately on a digital basis, but that doesn’t take away from the quality of what you’re getting.</p>



<p>Here’s everything included in Dying Light: The Beast Deluxe Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>Official soundtrack</li>



<li>Wallpaper pack</li>



<li>Castor Woods tourist map (digital)</li>



<li>Castor Woods prepper bundle:
<ul>
<li>Roadhog vehicle</li>



<li>Castor Woods prepper outfit</li>



<li>Survivalist SMG</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Base game</li>
</ul>



<p>The Deluxe Edition is just $10 more expensive than the standard version of Dying Light: The Beast, so it’s a bargain and a very easy buy for fans of the decade-old franchise.</p>



<p>What version of Dying Light: The Beast will you be buying? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast is one of the most highly anticipated titles of 2025, and it’s set to be released <strong>very soon</strong>. This open-world, zombie-slaying epic has been dubbed ‘Dying Light 3’ by Techland, and in many ways, this major title kickstarts the next generation of the series. In this guide, learn everything about the Dying Light: The Beast release date and platforms.</p>



<p>I’m hugely excited for Dying Light: The Beast, which marks an evolution from 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human in many ways. I’ve been a fan of the franchise since 2015’s Dying Light turned heads, and Techland has worked hard to make the series a shining gem of the zombie apocalypse niche ever since.</p>



<p>Read on to find out when Dying Light: The Beast is coming out and how much it’ll cost when it does.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-dying-light-the-beast-coming-out">When is Dying Light: The Beast Coming Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast will be released on September 19 on <strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></strong></p>



<p>The game was originally intended to be released on August 22, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-delayed/">a delay was needed</a> for Techland to fully polish the game and make it the best zombie-slashing adventure possible.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast started life as an expansion to Dying Light 2: Stay Human, but Techland realized it was too big for that and needed to flex as a standalone title. For this game, Roger Craig Smith (the original game’s lead voice actor) returned to play the role of Kyle Crane, a fan-favorite protagonist.</p>



<p>The Beast will now be a full-fledged game with all-new mechanics, upgraded visuals and effects, and an original story that brings to life the future of Dying Light.</p>



<h3 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-pricing-structure">Dying Light: The Beast Pricing Structure</h3>



<p>As Dying Light: The Beast has plenty of meat on the bones, it’s coming out with a premium price tag:</p>



<p><strong>Standard Edition </strong>– $59.99 / £59.99</p>



<p><strong>Deluxe Edition </strong>– $69.99 / £69.99</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-early-access-for-dying-light-the-beast">Is There Early Access for Dying Light: The Beast?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no way to access Dying Light: The Beast earlier than the global launch</strong>.</p>



<p>Techland has arranged a neat Deluxe Edition for Dying Light: The Beast, but the bonus content you get includes digital collectibles and in-game cosmetics; there is no way to get early access to The Beast.</p>

<p>Gamescom is almost here, and Xbox has published an extensive list of games that will be revealed or expanded on during the Xbox at Gamescom broadcast slate. This is made up of two streams that will take place between August 20 and August 21, with the team broadcasting a stack of trailers, panels, and reveals <strong>live from Gamescom</strong>.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve outlined every Xbox game coming to Gamescom to populate the stream schedule. Enjoy!</p>







<p>Here’s how the first day of Xbox at Gamescom will work:</p>

<h3 id="h-how-to-watch-xbox-gamescom-streams">How to Watch Xbox @ Gamescom Streams</h3>



<p>The best places to watch the Xbox streams broadcast from Gamescom will be YouTube and Twitch. Ensure you’re watching the official channels to have the best chance of unlocking any live rewards:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a></li>
</ul>



<p>I’m fully expecting more to appear during these broadcasts, titles that aren’t necessarily being touted ahead of the streams taking place. Every year, Xbox invests <strong>a lot </strong>in Gamescom, occupying a vast section of the show floor and putting on one hell of a show. They’d be remiss to not have a few surprises up their sleeves.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wuchang-update-censorship-bizarre/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-implodes-following-bizarre-1-5-%E2%80%98censorship%E2%80%99-update.1270788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has only been a few weeks since Wuchang: Fallen Feathers was released, adding yet another Soulslike to the increasingly expansive array of titles in the niche. In that time, Wuchang has suffered, being plagued by stability issues at launch and facing the wrath of gamers in thousands of negative reviews.</p>



<p>In the latest debacle, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers’ 1.5 update has rendered fans furious as developer Leenzee ‘censors’ various aspects of the game, applies a nasty retcon, and skews some of the title’s more challenging sequences.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-with-wuchang-s-1-5-update">What Happened With Wuchang’s 1.5 Update?</h2>



<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers isn’t a terrible game, but it doesn’t do too much to differentiate itself from the slew of Soulslike games drowning out the industry these days. That’s <strong>one reason </strong>why it earned some negativity at launch, but the UE5-related performance issues (particularly on PC) didn’t help the situation.</p>



<p>Recently, Leenzee released the 1.5 patch for Wuchang, causing chaos and disappointing fans worldwide.</p>



<p>With a single line in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498329191821869869?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full 1.5 patch notes</a>, Leenzee made waves:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Added dialogs for some NPCs to complete some plots. We will further optimize the exhaustion animations in the future to improve the plot performance.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eagle-eyed Wuchang fans dove into the game after the 1.5 patch and discovered what that meant. Following the update, certain bosses can’t be killed and enter a state of ‘exhaustion’ after being defeated. Some have been reworked with new voice lines that alter the story, and other enemies in certain sequences (such as Ming Dynasty soldiers) won’t attack you at all.</p>



<p>This has caused one key chapter that was previously very difficult to become a breeze, further disappointing sadomasochistic Soulslike fans. </p>



<p>The situation was exacerbated by mods on the official Wuchang subreddit reportedly deleting posts complaining about the 1.5 patch. This has naturally caused the review stats for Wuchang to fall into the red once again.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, user Lance McDonald expressed concerns about <strong>why </strong>these changes were made:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By the way, it isn’t the Chinese Government that forced these changes, WUCHANG is quite pro-government, it’s to please fringe groups of nationalists. I don’t really understand the details sadly.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">lmao Liu Wenxiu just stands around exhausted after the fight now, no dialogue . By the way, it isn't the Chinese Government that forced these changes, WUCHANG is quite pro-government, it's to please fringe groups of nationalists. I don't really understand the details sadly. <a href="https://t.co/QdjMZQbX8W">pic.twitter.com/QdjMZQbX8W</a></p>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1956007542284268001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>It’s relatively easy to predict that Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will start falling to the wayside now, and that this will forever be a mark on Leenzee’s reputation. This was the first outing for the studio, and it certainly isn’t how you’d want to make a name for yourself.</p>
