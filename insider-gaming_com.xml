<p>If you’ve been waiting to play Cities: Skylines 2 until it finally releases on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, you may just have to move on to something else. In a  new update posted on Wednesday, it doesn’t appear that Cities: Skylines 2 is anywhere close to releasing on console.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665875067?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new update</a> ahead of the franchise’s 10th birthday, developer Paradox Interactive said that the team at Colossal Order is making “steady progress” on the console version. They added that a “core focus” has been on performance and stability improvements for the game. That said, there is “more things” that need to be worked on in order to get the game to “the level of quality and the experience we want for you as our players.”</p>



<p>“We know many of you are eagerly awaiting the console release, but to set expectations clearly: we will not have a release before summer,” Paradox said. “We want to avoid any premature estimates and instead commit to providing you with reliable information when we’re closer to a launch-ready state.”</p>



<p>They closed the console-specific update saying that the goal remains the same, and that’s bringing Cities: Skylines 2 to console in the “best possible shape”.</p>



<p>Originally planned for a release in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-release-date-set-for-october-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2023</a> alongside the PC version, the console edition of the city builder was delayed to 2024 at the last minute. Since then, it has continued to see delays as the developers work around what has been said to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-delay-is-due-to-hardware-limitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware limitations</a>.</p>



<p>When do you think Cities: Skylines 2 will release on console? Let us know in the comments below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
