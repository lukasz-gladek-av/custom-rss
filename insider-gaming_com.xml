<p>On Tuesday, Sony launched its 30th Anniversary website for PlayStation. The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website goes through</a> the console’s history from the original PlayStation through the current PlayStation 5 (PS5). It also gave confirmation of an updated number on the best-selling video game console of all time, the PlayStation 2 (PS2).</p>



<p>According to Sony, the PS2 has sold over 160 million units  since its launch in 2000. Prior to this update, the last known sales total for the console was 158.3 million units.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>The sales include original versions of the console as well us various models, including the PS2 Slim that launched in 2004.</p>



<p>At 160 million units, the PS2 widens its gap as the best-selling console ever. Behind it in the home console space is the Nintendo Switch, which as sold 146 million units. If we were to add handheld systems to the total, the PS2 sits just just six million ahead of the 154.02 million units the Nintendo DS sold in its life cycle.</p>



<p>What made the system so popular were not only the games, but the console’s ability to play DVDs as well. An all-in-one system during a time when DVDs became the norm for movie and TV show purchases made for an enticing buy for players. Obviously, the move paid off. </p>



<p>As far as the current Sony console, the PS5, Sony says that it has sold over 65 million units in its four years on the market.</p>

<p>Despite its initially rocky launch, developer Creative Assembly stuck with Total War: Warhammer 3 since day one, unleashing bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, and brand-new content in the form of expansions and faction packs to expand upon the game’s core armies significantly. Well, the game’s about to grow larger. CA has announced the Omens of Destruction for Total War: Warhammer 3, featuring three new playable Legendary Lords, one each for Khorne, Ogre Kingdoms, and the Orcs.</p>

<iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER III - Omens of Destruction Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83chO9NuWAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The three new Legendary Lords include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gorbad </strong>– Orcs</li>



<li><strong>Golgfag </strong>– Ogre Kingdoms</li>



<li><strong>Skulltaker </strong>– Khorne</li>
</ul>



<p>The three new pieces of DLC will launch simultaneously on December 12. While the price tag is currently unknown, going by past Legendary Lord DLC, we suspect each pack will cost $8.99 apiece. A bundle containing all three will be available for approximately $23, with a slight discount for packaging them together.</p>



<p>Alongside the new DLC, we’ll receive update 6.0 for Total War: Warhammer 3, and the 100th Legendary Lord, Arbaal the Undefeated, a champion of Khorne, utterly free as part of the update. </p>
