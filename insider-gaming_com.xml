<p>You didn’t read the title wrong. A new live-action reboot of Resident Evil is being made. Let that sink in. After several disastrous attempts, it looks like the franchise will finally get a respectable movie. At least that’s what the names involved in the project indicate.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/resident-evil-reboot-zach-cregger-1236117563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the production of the movie will be handled by Constantin Film and PlayStation Productions. PlayStation’s involvement took many people by surprise, after all, this is a Capcom IP.</p>



<p>The project will be written and directed by Zach Cregger. Shay Hatten, who worked on John Wick 4 and Army of the Dead, is co-writer. Cregger is known for Barbarian, a great horror movie. His next film, Weapons, also a horror film, was very successful with test audiences, which explains all the hype surrounding the director.</p>



<p>At the moment, four companies are in a bidding war to secure the rights to the film. According to THR, Netflix and Warner Bros. are leading the bidding.</p>



<p>According to THR’s sources, Cregger already has a vision for the project. He plans to make a horror movie that takes the franchise back to the tone of the first games, released in the 90s. Back then, the games had a strong survival horror vibe. It was a very different approach, without action elements embedded in recent games.</p>

<p>We’ve reached the stage where everyone is already accepting, but an extra confirmation doesn’t hurt.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Danny Peña</a>/Gamertag Radio, Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, talked about various topics and, among them, the brand’s strategy of launching its exclusives on more platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-xbox-games-will-become-multiplaform">More Xbox games will become multiplaform</h2>



<p>It was during this conversation that Phil confirmed that more Xbox games will be coming to PlayStation, the rival platform. If you read our articles, you already know which games are coming to PS5 in 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking about the first-party titles, Phil said (via <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1882965755546788339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Shinobi602</a>): ”<em>We love our platform and our hardware but we’re not going to put walls up where people can engage with the great games our studios are building(…)our games will show up in more places, no doubt!</em>“</p>

On Xbox first party games:

“We love our platform and our hardware but we’re not going to put walls up where people can engage with the great games our studios are building(…)our games will show up in more places, no…</span></p></article></div>



<h2 id="h-why-buy-an-xbox">Why buy an Xbox?</h2>



<p>Listening to the Xbox CEO’s justification, the hosts asked him why gamers should buy an Xbox console since the company seems to be moving away from the concept of exclusives altogether. Phil said:</p>



<p>“<em>I want people to pick hardware based on the capabilities of that hardware and the choices that they want to make about where they want to play. We want our hardware to win based on the capabilities that we have(…)hardware critical and fundamental to what Xbox is – not trying to gatekeep the games off different places</em>“</p>



<h2 id="h-a-magical-year-in-the-making">A magical year in the making</h2>



<p>Like it or not, this is a new era for Xbox. The company’s 2025 promises to be one of the best years in Xbox history, if not the best. With Avowed, DOOM: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, The Outer Worlds 2, and perhaps Fable, the players will be very busy throughout the year.</p>



<p>At the Xbox Developer Direct held this week, we discovered that Xbox Games Publishing is responsible for publishing Ninja Gaiden 4, a game that promises to put the franchise back on top.</p>
