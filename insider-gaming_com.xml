<p>The release of Hollow Knight: Silksong is a glorious day, but not if you’re a PS5 gamer. Whereas every other available platform got the launch of Silksong bang on the projected start time, PlayStation 5 users have been left out in the cold, wondering why they can’t download Silksong.</p>



<p>I’m a PS5 player, and I can’t download <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. I waited as patiently as all of you for the launch date and time. Once the hour struck, I dove onto the PS Store to buy and download the game—that’s a lie, I was on and tried <em>before </em>this, but still. PlayStation 5 players have been unable to pre-purchase and download Silksong, ready for its inevitable launch.</p>



<p>This didn’t seem too bad, as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-file-sizes-playstation-xbox-switch-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong file sizes</a> suggest it’s not the heftiest game to download. However, the community can’t download Silksong on PS5, so let’s dive into the latest.</p>

<p><strong>Neither PlayStation nor Team Cherry has explained why PS5 is the only storefront where you can’t purchase Hollow Knight: Silksong right now, and the best guess is due to an error on the store or the server being backed up with customers.</strong></p>



<p>Let me be clear, I’m doing some digging and trying to find out why this is happening as we speak. There hasn’t been a single word from PlayStation or the developer about any miscommunication regarding Silksong’s launch on PS5. However, the fact remains that no one can buy and download Silksong on PS5.</p>



<p>There’s also a chance this could be due to the influx of traffic with hundreds of thousands of players presumably trying to buy the anticipated indie game—myself included.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-hollow-knight-silksong-will-work-on-ps5">Do We Know When Hollow Knight: Silksong Will Work On PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>There seems to be no workaround for Hollow Knight: Silksong not working on PS5<strong> at the moment, </strong>and it’s up in the air as to when it will be available to buy on PS5.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Consider this guide a live page you should keep refreshing,</strong> as I’m monitoring the situation intensely. You can take my word for it, as I also want to download Silksong. So keep checking back. Fingers crossed we get an update from <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a> or PlayStation, or the store page suddenly works.</p>

<p>We know that Hollow Knight: Silksong is a much bigger game than its predecessor. The original game’s file sizes were quite small, but now that Silksong is out, we’ve learned that Team Cherry has done an immense job minimizing the strain on storage.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong came out of the blocks hotter than the sun. The successor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-beat-hollow-knight-all-time-peak-player-count-in-15-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beat the original Hollow Knight’s all-time peak player count in just 15 minutes</a>. This is a miracle when you consider that many people couldn’t download the game due to Silksong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-xbox-eshop-offline-downloads/">taking Steam, Xbox, and Nintendo’s eShop offline</a> due to demand!</p>



<p>If you haven’t had a chance to download it yet, we have all the file sizes for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-file-sizes-are-very-generous">Hollow Knight: Silksong File Sizes Are Very Generous</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s here. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong requires <strong>7.56 GB on PC</strong>, <strong>4 GB on PlayStation 4</strong>, <strong>2.5 GB on PlayStation 5</strong>, <strong>8.01 GB on Xbox</strong>, <strong>2.6 GB on the Nintendo Switch 1</strong>, and a further <strong>4 GB on Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>I think it’s safe to say you probably don’t need to delete any games to make room for Silksong! We’ve been through every available storefront and found these file sizes for ourselves—you know these are accurate and what you should bear in mind.</p>



<p>I did initially worry when the developer mentioned the size and scope of the game. However, Silksong doesn’t have to process anywhere near as much stuff as a AAA open-world game would, for example. Expect super silky (see what I did there?) performance across the board.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-beat-hollow-knight-all-time-peak-player-count-in-15-minutes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-beat-original%E2%80%99s-all-time-peak-player-count-in-just-15-minutes.1288833/</guid>

<p>It shouldn’t be a surprise to see Hollow Knight: Silksong absolutely smash it within minutes of its launch. This is exactly what happened as the game’s anticipated launch saw huge player numbers come in and help Silksong destroy Hollow Knight 2017’s peak player count.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight has retained legendary status for nearly a decade. However, the torch has well and truly been passed to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Within minutes of the sequel going live, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-xbox-eshop-offline-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong single-handedly took down Steam, Xbox, and the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>



<p>Silksong’s player count and peak numbers were very big, very quickly.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-peak-reaches-100-000-players-in-half-an-hour">Hollow Knight: Silksong Peak Reaches 100,000 Players In Half An Hour</h2>



<figure><figcaption>That didn’t take long. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Hollow Knight (as of writing) achieved a more than respectable all-time peak of 72,916, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. Many indie games would kill for numbers like this, and it’s a big reason why the sequel has been so in demand.</p>



<p>Within minutes of Silksong being available to download, its peak player count eclipsed the OG Hollow Knight. As I’m writing this story now, Silksong’s all-time peak stands at an incredible <strong>100,374</strong> players!</p>



<p>With people still at work, waking up around the world, and the weekend still to come, expect this number to be smashed, and Silksong to reach an even bigger player count. There’s simply no telling what Silksong is going to achieve.</p>



<p>Is Hollow Knight: Silksong a lock for Game of the Year contention? How many copies is it going to sell, and how many people are going to play Silksong? There’s so much to pack, so leave a comment below, and share all your thoughts through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
