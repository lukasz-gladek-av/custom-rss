<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows offers a dual-protagonist system that presents the player with freedom of choice. Do you want to be the heavy-set warrior, Yasuke, or do you want to be the lithe and agile shinboi, Naoe? Both characters have unique abilities and loadouts, but which of them can be considered <strong>the best character </strong>in Assassin’s Creed Shadows to play as?</p>



<p>Read on to understand these characters and learn which of them is the best protagonist in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-vs-naoe-which-character-is-best">Yasuke vs Naoe – Which Character is Best?</h2>



<p>It’s mostly a subjective debate when it comes to determining which of the two Assassin’s Creed Shadows protagonists is the best.</p>



<p>If you prefer decimating your enemies with heavy attacks, you’ll probably pick Yasuke. If you’re more of a stealthy player who relies on shadows and subterfuge to achieve your goals, you’ll prefer Naoe.</p>



<p>Here are the advantages and disadvantages of both characters in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p><strong>Yasuke</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>High health pool</li>



<li>Incredibly powerful attacks</li>



<li>Can use a bow and teppo (gun)</li>



<li>Can easily dispatch even the toughest enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very slow, cumbersome parkour abilities</li>



<li>Tougher to remain hidden, almost impossible in some circumstances</li>



<li>No eagle vision or hidden blade</li>



<li>Attacks are typically slower and require more planning</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Naoe</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very fast and a fantastic parkour artist</li>



<li>Uses shinobi tools like smoke grenades, grapple hooks, and distraction mechanics to go unseen</li>



<li>Uses a wide range of melee weapons, most of which are designed around speed</li>



<li>Can assassinate enemies and use eagle vision to spot and mark enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Low health pool that is a challenge against tough enemies</li>



<li>Limited ranged weapons; can only use Kunai and Shuriken</li>



<li>Less physically dominating and won’t scare enemies as easily</li>
</ul>



<p>In general, I think that Assassin’s Creed fans will gravitate much more readily to Naoe, who represents the creed and what the series stands for. In truth, you’ll be splitting your time between both. However, after around 30 hours in the game at the time of writing, I can honestly and openly say that I’ve preferred my time spent with Naoe.</p>



<p>She’s much faster and more agile, and her parkour abilities are the best the franchise has ever seen. Her skillset makes her incredibly fluid, and the stealth factor with Naoe is off the charts. The only time I actively switch to Yasuke is if I’ve tried to win a fight with Naoe and have lost – if that’s the case, I bring in the hulking samurai to tackle the tougher enemies.</p>



<p>From a cosmetic perspective, I also enjoy Naoe’s outfits more. They’re better suited to the assassin lifestyle, but that’s not to take away from Yasuke’s incredible armour sets.</p>



<p>That’s which character I think is best in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but feel free to let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-play-as-yasuke-in-assassins-creed-shadows/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, there is a dual-protagonist system similar to the one found in 2016’s Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate. It’s just as fluid, and you can switch between characters at the press of a button. However, the hulking samurai figure of Yasuke isn’t immediately available, but this guide will answer when you play as him in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Read on to find out when and how to unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but be prepared to put in the work.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-do-you-unlock-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">When Do You Unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</h2>



<p>In the opening of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you get to control Yasuke for just a few minutes – but that’s enough to see what he can do. Naturally, you’d want to return to the role of the masterful warrior as soon as possible, but that’s not how this game works.</p>



<p>You’ll need to play as Naoe for several hours before you can unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows – around 8 to 10 hours into the game. That’s how long it took me to get to a point where I could play as Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and that was by following the campaign and ticking off a few side quests along the way.</p>



<p>There’s a key turning point in the story – which I won’t reveal – that makes Yasuke available for open-world play. Once you’ve unlocked him, he remains around permanently, and you’ll be able to switch between him and Naoe relatively easily.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-yasuke-an-assassin">Is Yasuke an Assassin?</h2>



<p>It’s obvious right off the bat that Yasuke isn’t a traditional assassin. This isn’t a spoiler, as this has been revealed in the run-up to the game’s release, but Yasuke is a samurai warrior with ties to Oda Nobunaga. Naoe is the ‘shinobi’ character with ties to the assassins as we know them, but Yasuke doesn’t fit that bill at all.</p>



<p>He’s clumsy when it comes to parkour, and he doesn’t have eagle vision or a hidden blade, so he’s not a typical assassin.</p>
