            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s shares have plummeted by over 30% today after news of a major restructuring broke. </p>



<p>Ubisoft recently announced a significant restructuring that will focus on a new operating model emphasizing&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures and games-as-a-service (GaaS) experiences</a>. This news has evidently affected the company’s stock, leading to a considerable drop in share value today.</p>











<p>As revealed on <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/UBI:EPA?sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyk4Gd_56SAxVsXmwGHf2pLt8Q3ecFKAN6BAghEAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Finance</a>, Ubisoft’s shares have decreased by 33.78% today (as of the time of writing). The day began with a share price of 5.26 EUR, which has now fallen to 4.44 EUR. Over the past six months, the shares have declined by more than 50%.</p>



<p>The drop comes immediately after the announcement of an organizational, operational, and portfolio reset, which led to the cancellation of highly anticipated titles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, among others. The restructuring has also led to the closure of multiple studios and layoffs across the organization. </p>



<p>Ubisoft’s new operating model now features a decentralised structure with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Creative Houses</a>, each divided by distinctive genres. The goal is to make the company “a more gamer-centric organization, structured around creative genres.”</p>



<p>Additionally, their new model will be supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, which includes “accelerated investments in player-facing Generative AI.”</p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s exclusive report</a> reveals that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has survived the latest round of project cancellations. Additionally, the restructure has likely led to the Black Flag remake being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed by up to one year</a>.

<p>The world of Hytale continues to get bigger and better, pushed by regular updates from Hypixel Studios and modders around the world, the latter of whom have revealed work on a significant collab.</p>



<p>Along with the reveal of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-update-2-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second major update</a> following Hytale’s early access launch, modders have revealed some early work of plans to bring Pokémon into the game, and it looks fantastic.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-modders-adding-pokemon">Hytale Modders Adding Pokémon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gotta catch ’em all. Image via Pokefind on X</figcaption></figure>



<p>A teaser showcase of completed work from the Pokéfind team was <a href="https://x.com/PokeFindMC/status/2013976180232192067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a>, revealing models for the Kanto starters and their complete evolution lines, featuring the likes of Blastoise, Charizard, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur.</p>



<p>Pokéfind has already found a home in Minecraft, offering a variety of experiences, including a Pokémon Survival mode, a custom-built Pokémon region, Pokémon Skyblock, and Pokéwars, and the plans are to offer similar experiences in Hytale.</p>



<p>The social media post stated the team behind the mod is “beyond excited” to bring Pokéfind into Hytale, teasing that “big updates” are coming.</p>



<p>No timeline has been shared for when players will be able to jump into the game, and, due to licensing, it’s unlikely the mod will be available on official channels like Curseforge. Instead, additional steps are likely to be required to access the game.</p>



<p>Pokéfind is easy to play on Minecraft, however, so there shouldn’t be any issues for players jumping into the mod when it is made available, and you can keep an eye on the team’s progression in development by following the social media account.</p>

<p>Hypergryph has revealed that Arknights Endfield’s PayPal channel is undergoing maintenance, as reports about hacks have started emerging from players. </p>



<p>The latest free-to-play, sci-fi gacha, action RPG by Hypergryph and Gryphline, Arknights Endfield, released today for PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile devices. However, it seems a significant issue has arisen on launch day, with players complaining that their PayPal accounts are being used to make unauthorised purchases. </p>











<p>Players across <a href="https://x.com/Unreal_Dreamer/status/2014193328430952555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) are reporting hacks involving PayPal purchases in Arknights: Endfield. A user named <a href="https://x.com/Naruvt0/status/2014217652751983045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Naru</a> has shared information about unauthorized transactions made on a victim’s PayPal account, all linked to Gryph Frontier PTE. LTD. The charges appear in multiple currencies, including USD, JPY, CAD, and EURO, and victims are being charged multiple times for a single purchase.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The official Arknights Endfield <a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account has announced that they are currently conducting temporary maintenance on the PayPal payment channel due to reports of issues. Players are advised to use alternative payment methods during this time. The account has also stated that “transactions involving abnormal item delivery or payment deductions will be addressed accordingly.” However, many players in the comments are still expressing concerns about unauthorized purchases.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Complete Highguard Trophy List—How To Get All Achievements & Trophies]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/</link>
            <guid>1412785</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Up until launch, there’s been a mystery surrounding Highguard, but some of the best information surrounding the game came from an unlikely place. The full trophy list has been revealed for Highguard, and it looks like there’s going to be a lot to unpack. </p>



<p>When it was revealed as the final game at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Game Awards</a>, it’s fair to say that people were underwhelmed to see another free-to-play hero-shooter. However, it’s been developed by some of the masterminds behind Apex Legends and Titanfall, so it deserves a fair chance in the spotlight.</p>







<p>If you’re planning on giving Highguard a chance, here’s the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-list-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy list</a> you can work on completing during the raids. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-highguard-trophies-amp-achievements">All Highguard Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll be doing a lot of shooting. Image via Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Judging by the Trophy list, it doesn’t seem like you’ll need to sink an overwhelming amount of time into Highguard to 100% it. </strong></p>



<p>Considering it’s a multiplayer shooter, you’ll need to perform certain feats during an online match, but there’s nothing outrageous that demands an elite calibre of skill. A lot of them simply need you to complete matches—that shouldn’t be too hard, right?</p>







<p>That’s enough preamble, though. Here’s the complete Highguard Trophy list from start to finish.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Breach! Image via Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard has 33 PlayStation Trophies and 32 Xbox Achievements for you to earn.</strong></p>



<p>As usual, PlayStation has one extra Trophy thanks to its ever-coveted Platinum Trophy, which sadly aren’t available to you Xbox gamers out there. But there’s still a healthy batch of Achievements to grind towards, and none of them seem too intensive. Get them all done, and your Gamerscore should rise by a fair amount. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t sit still in Hytale before something else changes! Hytale’s founder promised constant improvements, and Update 2 brings new gameplay mechanics, dozens of fixes, and so much more in its January patch notes.</p>



<p>Hytale’s popularity remains strong in its early weeks. This is being helped by the game’s frequent updates and patch notes. Initial changes included adding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-dinosaurs-hytale-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dinosaurs</a>, for example. Hytale Update 2 is another fairly hefty proposition, and there’s much to look forward to and discuss.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-update-2-release-date">Hytale Update 2 Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>Hytale founder Simon Collins-Laflamme has said Update 2 is arriving “this weekend,” which means it’ll drop between January 23 and January 25.</strong></p>



<p>To add to this, he’s already confirmed that “Update 3 is already in the works,” and the grind never stops!”<a href="https://hytale.fandom.com/wiki/Simon_Collins-Laflamme#articleComments"></a></p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-changes-in-hytale-update-2">Biggest Changes In Hytale Update 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hunt down the void. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pickaxe progression and Mining have been reworked, and new Magic is being added to Hytale, along with a host of cosmetic and customization changes. There are also tons of gameplay fixes, balance tweaks, and overall QOL improvements across visual and audio.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a fairly meaty update that targets all aspects of Hytale. Obviously, the standout aspects of Update 2 are the physical gameplay flourishes. New magic will sharpen up and broaden the action, making it even more fun.</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme recently revealed he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-founder-unhappy-with-games-mining-outlines-thousands-of-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t happy with the state of the game’s Mining</a>, which is why it’s not a surprise to see how it’s been changed in Update 2: “Pickaxe progression reworked: mining speed now scales with pickaxe quality.”</p>



<h2 id="h-all-hytale-update-2-patch-notes">All Hytale Update 2 Patch Notes</h2>

<p>Highguard’s Trophy List has surfaced online, revealing the most information about the game we have received yet, including mechanics, game modes, and more.</p>



<p>The upcoming free-to-play, PvP raid shooter by Wildlight Entertainment, Highguard, was revealed during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2026</a>, with a brand new flashy trailer. However, since then, the game’s marketing has been almost nonexistent, with virtually no information revealed 4 days before its release. Interestingly, the Highguard Trophy List is doing the job for them. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-trophy-list-reveals-brand-new-details">Highguard Trophy List Reveals Brand New Details </h2>



<p>There is a wealth of information contained in Highguard’s Trophy List, which was discovered on <a href="https://www.exophase.com/game/highguard-psn/trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Exophase</a>. This list covers various aspects of the game, including mechanics, game systems, characters, and more. It mentions features such as Shieldbreakers, Domesplitter, Revivals, Enemy Orbs, Wall Breaking, and Generators. Additionally, the list includes the names of certain weapons, like the BigRig LMG. Furthermore, it highlights other items, including chests, Rare &amp; Legendary items, and more.</p>



<p>The trophy list also goes through all the different types of Wardens in the game, including Assault Warden, Defensive Warden, Recon Warden, Support Warden, and Destruction Warden. Interested readers can check out Insider Gaming’s Highguard Trophy guide <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>Highguard has some big names attached to it, with the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall working on the title. However, even though the game is set to release on January 26, 2026, the game’s official YouTube channel has just one video: the reveal trailer shown at The Game Awards. Players have been waiting for more information on the title, but it seems the trophy list might have to suffice until release. </p>







<p>In other news, Highguard developers did not pay for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the spot at The Game Awards finale</a>. Additionally, some players suspect that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-dead-on-arrival-gamers-fear-a-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title could flop</a>.

<p>The next star of Fortnite Festival may have been uncovered by dataminers, suggesting that the Pink Pony Club could be on it’s way to the game.</p>



<p>Season 12 in Fortnite, starring LISA, is heading toward a conclusion, having been in the game since November 2025, and the end date of February 5 is right around the corner. Now, it appears her successor has been uncovered.</p>







<h2 id="h-chappell-roan-potentially-coming-to-fortnite">Chappell Roan Potentially Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pink Pony Club. Image via Itsmeleaky on X</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hints that Chappel Roan is coming to Fortnite have been uncovered by <a href="https://x.com/itsmeleaky/status/2014267037674013053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Itsmeleaky on X</a>, who uncovered items in the games files that hint towards the pop star entering the fray.</p>



<p>A microphone and drumset have been discovered in Fortnite’s files, but the biggest hint ofall comes from a significant makeover to the beloved Fortnite llama, which appears to have been inducted into the Pink Pony Club.</p>



<p>The design of the llama looks extremely close to the horse that Chappel Roan has utilized in her concerts around the world, and is therefore a direct hint at the collab.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/2014267385348284507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, who shared the image, added that the collab was not confirmed, and, while the items were found in files, the headliner for the next season of Fortnite Festival could be changed.</p>



<p>If Chappell Roan were to star as the headliner of the next Fortnite Festival season, she would add to the library of Jam Tracks in the game, which already includes hits The Giver, Hot to Go, and Good Luck, Babe!</p>







<hr>



<p>Would Chappell Roan be a good choice for the headliner in the next Fortnite Festival season? Share your thoughts in the Insider Gaming Discord.</p>
