<p>God of War Sons of Sparta is one of 2026’s biggest and best shocks without question. A new GOW game is a shock, but if you want to know how much it is first, or if it’s on disc, this guide has all the answers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026 Sony</a> State of Play had no right to drop bombshell after bombshell. If you thought the news that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Remake Trilogy</a> is coming was big, a shadow-dropped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Sons of Sparta</a> was a Cronos-sized surprise</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-on-disc-physical-edition-explained">Can You Buy God of War Sons of Sparta On Disc? Physical Edition, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Like a fever dream. Credit to Santa Monica Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>God of War Sons of Sparta is currently a digital-only game, meaning you can buy it from the PlayStation Store on PS5 and nowhere else.</strong></p>



<p>This is likely a case of shocking everyone with an impromptu shadow drop first, accumulating millions in sales and copies sold, then giving the game a second lease of life later down the line with a physical copy.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s hard to shadow drop a game on disc, making digital the only logical and viable solution. You can buy either God of War Sons of Sparta Standard Edition or Digital Deluxe Edition to complement your virtual game collection.</p>



<p>The latter comes with several benefits, including in-game items, a digital artbook, soundtrack, and PlayStation Avatar: A fine gift from the Gods of Olympus.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta">How Much is God of War Sons of Sparta?</h2>



<p><strong>God of War Sons of Sparta is $29.99 through the US PlayStation Store or £24.99 in the UK.</strong></p>



<p>For a brand-new God of War game with premium polish, this is a pretty decent price tag. Attaching the God of War brand to anything in 2026 could warrant a hefty price tag, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/santa-monica-studio/" id="87635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Santa Monica</a> and Sony have been quite generous here.</p>

</ul>



<p>Furthermore, if you want to stump up a bit more Gold, the Digital Deluxe Edition is $39.99 USD or £32.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta is available starting today. This game is the long-awaited 2.5D Metroidvania-style game. It was the final game announced during the Sony State of Play, and the big announcement was that it’s available today.</p>



<p>The trailer for the shadow-dropped game came after an announcement that the original God of War Trilogy is being remade. That, however, is a long way away as the game is in the early stages of development. To make up for that, the long-rumored Metroidvania God of War is playable now.</p>



<p>Called “God of War: Sons of Sparta,” it tells Kratos’s origin story. Long before he was a God of War, he was a Spartan. There were brief action shots, clips of major enemy battles, and more. The legendary saga begins here.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-future-of-the-god-of-war-franchise">The Future of the God of War Franchise</h2>



<p>Not only is Kratos a video game legend, but his story is coming to television: Prime Video has ordered a series with Ryan Hurst, best known for his work in Sons of Anarchy, who will star as the Spartan. That series will also feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-casts-thor-and-odin-in-god-of-war/" id="172954">Mandy Patinkin and more.</a></p>



<p>The show will be largely based on the franchise’s newer games. Sons of Sparta is a brand new title, taking it all back to the beginning. It is <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA28997_00-SONSOFSPARTAPS50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available now for $29.99.</a></p>

<p>PlayStation State of Play came with a very big announcement, revealing the remake of the original God of War trilogy. </p>



<p>PlayStation players have been eagerly awaiting news about the God of War franchise since the release of Ragnarok. Today, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors</a> about a new 2D God of War game were confirmed. Additionally, Santa Monica Studio took it a step further by allowing players to revisit the adventure rooted in Greek mythology.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-confirmed-to-be-in-active-development">God of War Trilogy Remake Confirmed to Be in Active Development</h2>



<p>During the PlayStation State of Play event today, we received a very unexpected announcement: a confirmation of the God of War Trilogy Remake. The announcement was followed by TC Carson, the original voice actor for Kratos, who revealed that the Remake is in active development. However, it is still in its early stages, and it will be a long time before we receive another update on the title. But when they come, they have promised it’s going to be a big reveal. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Along with the remake, the 2D title God of War: Sons of Sparta was also announced, set in Kratos’ youth. The title also features TC Carson, who will be playing the adult version of Kratos and narrating the story. The title features hand-drawn pixel animation and a host of new creatures inspired by Greek Mythology. What’s more, the title has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadowdropped</a> today, and with Standard and Deluxe editions available for purchase now. </p>
