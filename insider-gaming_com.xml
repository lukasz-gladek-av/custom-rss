            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Blue Prince’s publisher has spoken out against sudden allegations of using Generative AI in the title. The news comes after Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had its wins at the Indie Game Awards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revoked due to using AI-generated elements</a>.</p>



<p>Generative AI usage in video games has been a hot topic for quite some time. Just recently, Larian Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to using Gen AI</a> for pre-production purposes and many were displeased with the Baldur’s Gate 3 developer. The conversation on whether it’s ethical or not has been a huge debate, so it only went bigger when The Indie Game Awards revoked Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 of its wins for Best Independent Game and Best Debut Indie Game. The winner of the Best Independent Game then became Blue Prince, a puzzle rogue-like and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of 2025’s best-reviewed titles</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, allegations of Dogubomb, the creator, using Generative AI in Blue Prince appeared out of nowhere. It went big when The Escapist called out the company in <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news-indie-game-awards-clair-obscur/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a since-edited article</a>. Now, the publisher and developer have spoken up about the allegations.</p>

The game was built and crafted with full human instinct by Tonda Ros <a href="https://twitter.com/dogubomb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dogubomb</a> &amp; his team.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/RawFury/status/2002748999388844330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement from publisher Raw Fury</a>, the studio defends Blue Prince and its developer, Dogubomb. In particular, it responds to the claims that the game used Generative AI during development. The studio posted on social media the following:</p>



<p>“<strong>For people that need confirmation:&nbsp;There is no AI used in Blue Prince</strong>,” says the statement. “<strong>The game was built and crafted with full human instinct by Tonda Ros (Dogubomb) &amp; his team. It is the result of eight years of development, fuelled by imagination and creativity, and we are extremely proud of what Tonda has achieved.</strong>“</p>



<p>With The Indie Game Awards, the criteria was that no game would use AI, and developers had to verify it in order to be considered. The allegations of Blue Prince using it were baseless, as the article had no evidence to back it up. The crackdown on AI usage in games will likely be ever-present come 2026. Whatever the case, it’s a shame one of 2025’s best titles had to deal with the allegations, especially after a big win.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PIONER Roadmap Reveals Ambitious Few Months Ahead]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-roadmap-revealed-ambitious-few-months/</link>
            <guid>1389892</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GFA Games recently unveiled a new roadmap for PIONER following the game’s entering early access on December 16. The post-apocalyptic MMO has started to slowly turn heads on account of how much potential it has wrapped up in a package that’s already evolving.</p>



<p>It’s GFA Games’ first project as a collective, and if the new roadmap is anything to go by, it has a bright immediate future; the long-term prospects are yet to be estimated.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-to-pioner-in-2026">What’s Coming to PIONER in 2026?</h2>



<p>In a roadmap published on social media, the team at GFA Games unveiled what’s coming next for PIONER.</p>



<p>Launched into early access on December 16, PIONER presents players with a gritty, STALKER-inspired rendition of a Soviet-era island, torn apart by cataclysms, anomalies, and bloodthirsty factions. It’s an open-ended, open-world title that has scores of content to uncover and explore, and despite being in early access, it’s pretty well optimized.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re excited to present the PIONER Early Access roadmap for Q1 2026.</p><p>What’s coming:</p><p>– A New Year event featuring a wide variety of themed items;<br>– New story quests, raids, PvP maps, and more <a href="https://t.co/VBP5GOBZ0q">pic.twitter.com/VBP5GOBZ0q</a></p></div>— PIONER (@PionerGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PionerGame/status/2002061384939618385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Here’s what’s coming in Q1 2026 for PIONER, and in the final days of 2025:</p>



<p><strong>December</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Year Event at Wandering Pass</li>



<li>New World Event</li>



<li>New Themed Items</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>January</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Main Story Quest</li>



<li>New World Events</li>



<li>New Raid Mission</li>



<li>New PvP Map</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Main Story Quest</li>



<li>New World Events</li>



<li>TBC</li>



<li>TBC</li>
</ul>



<p>In <strong>March</strong>, the game will get a ‘big update’, the team has teased.</p>



<p>PIONER is ambitious, especially for the size of the studio behind it and the nature of its launch. It obviously takes a lot from other titles, but the delivery feels unique and populated enough to be very enjoyable.</p>



<p>Feedback on Steam is mixed at present, and the stock so far has been collated from just 1,000 reviews. Many of the positive reviews have stressed the fact that this is an early access title and ‘shouldn’t be expected to be perfect’, which is what most of the negative reviews are focusing on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Riot Games has announced that the teams participating in the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour collectively received over $105 million, marking one of the most financially significant seasons in the game’s relatively short history. VALORANT debuted in the esports space in 2020 and has been steadily growing ever since.</p>



<p>Riot shared the information in an annual competitive recap that revealed a whopping $86 million had been generated through in-game item sales during this year’s tournaments.</p>







<h2 id="h-valorant-hit-milestones-in-2025">VALORANT Hit Milestones in 2025</h2>



<p>The recent recap published by Riot Games revealed stunning revenue that directly lined the pockets of VALORANT teams in 2025, but it went further than that. For instance, VALORANT Masters Bangkok, a tournament that ran from February to March this year, hit a viewership record in the game’s vertical.</p>



<p>From September to October, VALORANT Champs played out in Paris, and one of the most dramatic grand final showdowns in recent memory took place. These events helped boost those coffers immeasurably.</p>



<p>As stated, $86 million of that $105 million cap came from in-game cosmetics, including the yearly Champions Collection. This supersized bundle nearly <strong>doubled </strong>the revenue produced by similar bundles released in 2024. </p>



<p>Fan participation across the broader ecosystem also reached new heights. The Game Changers Pick’Em feature surpassed two million entries. That record is indicative of the growing popularity of the progressive space in VALORANT, which fans <strong>love</strong>.</p>



<p>Those eager to explore their individual performance through 2025 can do so by checking the <a href="https://flashback.playvalorant.com/en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VALORANT Flashback platform</a>. It’s a neat feature created by Riot Games that allows users a visual glimpse at their stats this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fnatic, one of the oldest esports organizations in Europe, is reportedly evaluating a sale that would come with a whopping $100 million price tag. In a report shared late last week, it was suggested that multiple parties are interested in securing the brand, and Fnatic has brought in a consultancy firm to engage investors.</p>



<p>Potential buyers are said to include companies across a broad array of verticals, including traditional sports, media, and entertainment.</p>







<h2 id="h-fnatic-wants-a-full-acquisition">Fnatic Wants a Full Acquisition</h2>



<p>In early reports, it has been suggested that some serious investors are eyeing up Fnatic, one of the most iconic brands in the modern esports space. Fnatic boasts a legacy that few organizations can attest to, and despite having recent drops in revenue, the company is still bursting with potential.</p>



<p>Historically, the organization has been one of the first labels in esports to innovate and expand beyond mere competition. In 2016, the company launched Fnatic Gear, a high-end peripherals division, which went on to sell <strong>one million units </strong>before the brand was sold to Sony’s INZONE label.</p>



<p>It should be stressed that $100 million is one hell of a target. In recent years, esports organizations have been bought and sold for far less, despite being valued internally with much higher price points.</p>



<p>For instance, Luminosity was sold in 2025 for just over $3 million, and FaZe Clan was valued at just $18 million in 2023. The latter organization once peaked with a valuation of $725 million, but the tumultuousness of the company proved too volatile in too short a time.</p>



<p>Analysts have argued that if any organization can command that tag, it’s Fnatic.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield fans are up in arms again about a suspected AI design used in the new ‘Windchill’ cosmetics bundle. In recent hours, eagle-eyed gamers discovered telling signs tied to a sticker in this bundle, and all indications point to it being a faulty generative AI creation.</p>



<p>Fans on social media platforms were running rampant, trying to burn the game to the ground. For some, it’s a minor issue, but for others, it’s indicative of that much bigger problem creeping across the games industry.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-ai-sticker-scandal-runs-wild">Battlefield 6 AI Sticker Scandal Runs Wild</h2>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield subreddit</a>, a user shared an image of the new Windchill bundle, revealing a <strong>player card sticker </strong>that stinks of flawed generative AI design. The image showcases a soldier within a snowflake, wielding an M4A1, but there are clear indications that it’s <strong>most likely </strong>created by AI.</p>



<p>The M4A1 in question has two obvious barrels, one above the other. It also seems to have two handguards, which is hardly the most common feature in the world of firearms.</p>



<p>Here’s a zoomed-in shot of the player card sticker:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Users were quick to flock to social posts, stating that this isn’t the only example of something that <strong>looks like </strong>generative AI in Battlefield 6. In social circles, the comments were damning. One user wrote, ‘Just the fact they didn’t catch that before releasing shows how little they are trying.’</p>



<p>Another said, ‘They got your money, so they don’t care about which hill you choose to die on.’</p>



<p>One user condemned the wider use of AI, ‘AI art is generated based on stolen artwork and takes jobs away from real artists.’ Another echoed that sentiment: ‘I didn’t pay for AI garbage. EA pay your f***ing artists!’</p>



<p>In similar news, the world’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/">first game created 100% with AI</a> recently launched a playable demo, and it went as well as you could expect.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-22-925/</link>
            <guid>1389694</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re kicking off the <strong>official </strong>festive week with the NYT Connections solutions and hints that you need to get the job done! Today’s puzzle is the first in a few that will lead you up to the big day and beyond, so be sure to scroll down as soon as needed to uncover today’s answers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-22">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 22)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #925:</p>



<ul>
<li>RUSH</li>



<li>PIN</li>



<li>PLAYING</li>



<li>LATER</li>



<li>GREETING</li>



<li>CYA</li>



<li>RASH</li>



<li>COMING</li>



<li>WAVE</li>



<li>BUSINESS</li>



<li>FUTURE</li>



<li>BROW</li>



<li>WHIT</li>



<li>FOLLOWING</li>



<li>MEMBERSHIP</li>



<li>SURGE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>They’re all about a sudden <strong>increase in amount or intensity</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em><strong>All imply ‘not yet’ — something ahead in time</strong></em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Which of these words show up <strong>in your wallet, on your desk, or at a game table</strong>?</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are colors that feel like they’re <strong>missing something</strong></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 22:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-22-925">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 22 (#925)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– RASH, RUSH, SURGE, WAVE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COMING, FOLLOWING, FUTURE, LATER</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BUSINESS, GREETING, MEMBERSHIP, PLAYING</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BROW, CYA, PIN, WHIT</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
