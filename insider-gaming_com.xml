<p>Great Scott, it looks like Back to the Future is coming to Fortnite Chapter 7! Furthermore, players will be able to ride in style in the franchise’s iconic DeLorean sooner than later.</p>







<p>The upcoming Chapter 7 of Fortnite has been highly anticipated by fans for quite a bit. After a rather successful season, which featured The Simpsons, it seems the nostalgia factor is getting turned up now. Chapter 7 is starting with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Kill Bill collaboration</a>, which sees Uma Thurman’s The Bride duel against assassin Yuki. However, the ode to classic cinema isn’t over, as an iconic car from a legendary franchise is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-pass-leaks-reveal-back-to-the-future-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially driving its way</a> to the live-service game.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-delorean-from-back-to-the-future-coming-to-fortnite-on-november-29th">The DeLorean from Back to the Future Coming to Fortnite on November 29th</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Amazing to see a whole new generation get to experience the DeLorean in the upcoming  <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Fortnite</a> Chapter 7💥 </p><p>The HYPE is real!</p><p>Fortnite has always been innovative and ahead of the pack with its digital V-Bucks ecosystem and arguably the most culturally relevant game of this… <a href="https://t.co/bFmpat6r1X">pic.twitter.com/bFmpat6r1X</a></p></div>— DeLorean Labs 🏎️🔥 (@DeLoreanlabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeLoreanlabs/status/1992590960539120080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DeLoreanlabs/status/1992590960539120080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from DeLorean Labs</a>, the company showed off a first look at the in-game version of the DeLorean. It looks like it comes from a picture from <a href="https://x.com/BATPLAY47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BatPlay47</a>, known for his Fortnite leaks. The Fortnite version of the car looks almost identical to the one used in Back to the Future, as well as the real-life counterpart. In addition, it will come out on November 29th, 2025, the same day as Chapter 7.</p>



<p>For those who don’t know, the Back to the Future movies, which were released in the latter half of the 1980s, used the DeLorean as a plot device. With upgrades from Doc Brown, the vehicle could travel through time at light speed, sending him and Marty McFly to different periods like the Wild West and the future. While it is also a notable car brand, the avid popularity of the movies made it a household name, still to this day. With the collab, perhaps we’ll see Marty and Doc join as playable skins? We’ll have to wait and see what’s in store for Chapter 7.</p>







<p>What do you think of the DeLorean in Fortnite? Excited to try it out? Hope to see more Back to the Future in the game?
