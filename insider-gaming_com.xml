<p>The usual array of questions is being thrown at Mewgenics, as a Steam title. This includes wondering about its Steam Deck compatibility and if the game supports PlayStation and/or Xbox controller support.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mewgenics/" id="170919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewgenics</a> needs to be enjoyed in any way possible. The cuddly yet catastrophically grim and violent cat-oriented strategy title has wowed everyone since its February 10 release, and if you’re looking to play it on Steam, controller support could be a sticking point.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A fun time to be had. Credit to Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mewgenics has complete PlayStation and Xbox controller support, and this has been verified and confirmed by its official Steam store listing.</strong></p>



<p>Good news: If you want to play Mewgenics with a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S controller (or something adjacent), you can.</p>

</ul>



<p>There’s always an iffy element of can you/can’t you with games on Steam, even if they’re only available to buy on the platform. Some are only usable with a mouse and keyboard, as the configuration is easier to manage.</p>



<p>However, if you check the Mewgenics <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> page, you’ll clearly see a box in the right column saying ‘Full Controller Support,’ with <strong>Xbox Controllers</strong> and <strong>PlayStation Controllers</strong> listed, too.</p>



<p>Connecting a controller is easy, as you can do it either directly through a USB cable and looking for the device, or manually setting it up by connecting the controller and computer system using Bluetooth.</p>



<p>It’s as easy as training a cat, sort of.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-mewgenics-steam-deck-verified">Is Mewgenics Steam Deck Verified?</h2>



<p><strong>Steam Decks are compatible with Mewgenics, meaning you can play using your Steam console if you want.</strong></p>



<p>A little bonus question answered for you: Steam Deck verification is A-ok for Mewgenics!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mewgenics-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewgenics Release Date Countdown &amp; Exact Start Times</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Again, you’d think it would be self-explanatory, but not all games have Steam Deck support. Mewgenics does, and that’s all that meowtters for this query.</p>



<p>Check out the Steam compatibility evaluation:</p>



<p>“Valve’s testing indicates that Mewgenics is <strong>Verified </strong>on Steam Deck. This game is fully functional on Steam Deck, and works great with built-in controls and display.”</p>



<p>It’s always good to get the IG community’s thoughts on things like this: Do you prefer using a controller for Steam games? Or are you part of the PC master race who settle for nothing less than a mouse and keyboard?

<p>The director of Pokémon Pokopia has revealed how many hours players would spend in the game and that experiences await after the end credits. </p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-announced-for-2026-nintendo-switch-2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the Switch 2 during the Pokémon Presents showcase last year. Since then, we have received the March 4 release date for the title and a new trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-trailer-reveals-new-pikachu-snorlax-variants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featuring Pikachu and Snorlax variants</a>. Also, a leak has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaks-confirm-pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalyptic-fan-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed the theory</a> about Pokémon Pokopia taking place in a post-apocalyptic world.Now, the developers have finally revealed some new information about the upcoming title. </p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-pokopia-will-be-about-20-40-hours-long">Pokémon Pokopia Will be About 20-40 Hours Long</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://in.ign.com/pokemon-pokopia/252940/news/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-dire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Pokémon Pokopia director Takuto Edagawa discussed the gameplay hours for the upcoming title and the experiences after the end credits. Edagawa explained that the title’s motive is “typically not to go to the end roll [credits].” The concept is to craft a world where you can spend your time with Pokémon. </p>



<p>However, on average, the title is expected to take 20 to 40 hours, though it really depends on how players approach it. Players will have “more things to experience after the end roll [credits].” The director believes players will be encouraged and motivated to keep playing the game after the end credits. Do you want more content, or does 20 to 40 hours seem enough? </p>
