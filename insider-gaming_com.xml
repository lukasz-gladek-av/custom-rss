<p>Jurassic World Evolution is roaring onto the scene and, if you fancy yourself as being better at managing prehistoric dinosaurs than John Hammond, it’s the perfect game for you—and we’ve got the details on the Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 21</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 makes it a trilogy for Frontier Developments, with major additions being the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-baby-dinosaurs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">baby dinosaurs</a> and modular building—two features that have starred in sister titles Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo.</p>



<p>With the title landing in a packed release schedule for games, it’s understandable to wonder if a Game Pass subscription can save you some cash, and we’ve got all the details on whether it’s being added to the service.</p>

<p><strong>No, Jurassic World Evolution 3 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when the title releases on October 21.</strong></p>



<p>Although we’re yet to see a full reveal of the titles coming to Game Pass in October, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first wave of releases not covering the entire month</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not expected to be among the other additions coming later this month.</p>



<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not a first-party Xbox title, which would have resulted in automatic inclusion in the service, so any announcement of the title featuring in the catalog would have come well in advance.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-jurassic-world-evolution-3-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Jurassic World Evolution 3 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no news about Jurassic World Evolution 3 coming to Xbox Game Pass in the future, although history suggests it’s likely to occur at some point.</strong></p>



<p>Jurassic World Evolution 2 is <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass/games#all_all_ultimate_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently available on the service</a>, having featured several times in the past, while the original game has also had extended spells in the subscription service.</p>



<p>Other Frontier Development titles, including Planet Coaster, have also appeared on the service in the past. However, Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster 2 are yet to appear on the service, and it’s likely they would make an appearance first before Jurassic World Evolution 3—although that’s not guaranteed.</p>



<p>If we are to see Jurassic World Evolution 3 join the playlist, it will likely be a fairly decent period of time in the future.</p>
