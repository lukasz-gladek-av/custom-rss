<p>Doom: The Dark Ages just got a new patch, Update 2.2, and the notes bring up some bug fixes and Steam Deck verification.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, Doom: The Dark Ages brought the rip and tear of past titles to Medieval times. Reviews called the game a bloody good time, besting the previous Doom Eternal. While it wasn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-steam-player-count-is-the-lowest-of-the-reboot-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as popular as others</a>, it remains one of 2025’s best shooters. Luckily, there’s more to enjoy thanks to Update 2.2, which releases today.</p>



<p>The patch, releasing on all platforms, aims to fix many bugs and Quality of Life (QoL) issues. Furthermore, Doom: The Dark Ages is now Steam Deck Verified, so the game can be played successfully on the portable console. More additions include adjustments to The Ripatorium and tuning of the Brink of Death system.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Could Sony’s MLB The Show franchise be making its way to PC? Rumors are circulating that the nearly 20-year-old series is set to release on the platform, thanks to a recently discovered job posting.</p>



<p>Sony San Diego Studios is looking for a Senior Graphics PC Programmer to work on a “AAA PC Title”. There are no other details about what this game could be, as the rest of the posting goes into what the role will involve, such as optimizing the game for real-time graphics on the system, as well as optimizing their PC engine. </p>



<p>While the job may be for a different IP, the fact that Sony San Diego hasn’t released a non-MLB title since 2017 has led to many speculating about the future of the series. The last game releases from the studio that wasn’t baseball came in 2017 when both StarBlood Arena and Drawn to Death were launched.</p>



<p>Since then, they’ve primarily been an MLB The Show studio, including releasing the series on Xbox platforms starting in 2021. The game even made its way to the Nintendo Switch in 2022. The latest installment, MLB The Show 25, was released for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>As far as MLB games available for PC, the last AAA baseball game released for the platform was MLB 2K12 in 2012.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony San Diego for comment on the job posting and whether it was for MLB The Show or a new IP coming to PC. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article and shared on social media.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is here and launched with over half a dozen game modes such as Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush, and Domination. But just because there are plenty of options for players right now, it doesn’t mean that EA isn’t working on bringing more game modes to Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>According to data obtained by Insider Gaming, there are six more game modes possibly joining Battlefield 6 at some point in the near future. The strings were found in the multiplayer files of the game. The lines read:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Raid/Mode/MUT_Raid </li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Payload/Mode/MUT_Payload </li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Sabotage/Mode/MUT_Sabotage</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/SquadShootout/Mode/MUT_SquadShootout</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Strikepoint/Mode/MUT_Strikepoint</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/TankHunt/Mode/MUT_TankHunt</li>
</ul>



<p>As mentioned in Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous coverage on Naval Combat</a>, “Glacier” is the codename for Battlefield 6. Looking at the strings found shows modes called “Raid”, “Payload”, “Sabotage”, “Squad Shootout”, “Strikepoint”, and “TankHunt”. </p>



<p>Two modes that players know are coming on October 28 are Strikepoint and Sabotage. Strikepoint is planned to launch on October 28 alongside the release of Battlefield 6 Season 1: Rogue Ops. Sabatage will come on November 18 as part of Season 1: California Resistance. </p>



<p>Other modes found in the data haven’t been mentioned or confirmed by EA as of writing. Still, with them already in the files, it could be only a matter of time before more details are made public as new seasons get announced. Either way, it’s something to keep an eye on in the coming weeks and months.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has been out for just a few days, and it’s one of the most well-reviewed games in the series since 2016’s Battlefield 1. In his review of the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill says</a> that the game’s multiplayer offering is “enough of a redemption that you should consider picking it up” and that there’s “plenty of juice in the tank”.</p>



<p>Which possible game mode would you be most excited to see should it come to Battlefield 6? Leave your thoughts down in the comments below, and&nbsp;join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A day after its release, Netflix’s Splinter Cell Deathwatch has been renewed for a second season.</p>



<p>The animated series, developed by John Wick’s Derek Kolstad, takes the iconic Splinter Cell in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-trailer-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whole new direction</a>. The show continues the story of the game’s protagonist, Sam Fisher, with The Wolverine’s Liev Schreiber donning the night vision goggles. The Netflix animated series released yesterday and received decent scores across the board. Now, at IGN Fan Fest, creator Derek Kolstad revealed that things are already in motion for a new season.</p>



<h2 id="h-splinter-cell-deathwatch-season-two-full-into-production-at-netflix">Splinter Cell: Deathwatch Season Two “Full Into Production” at Netflix</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In a message from Derek Kolstad at <a href="https://youtu.be/MWjJW1d4KGQ?si=h2mYex9FfEIVjHvi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN Fan Fest</a>, the creator revealed that season two of Splinter Cell: Deathwatch has been greenlit. Furthermore, the show is already full into production, though it’s too soon to say when fans can expect to return to the world. In the message, the John Wick creator states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>”We’ve got a Season Two coming your way,” Kolstad <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/splinter-cell-deathwatch-exclusive-season-2-announcement-ign-fall-fan-fest-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said to IGN</a>. “We don’t [have a release date yet]. And being new to animation, I know how long it takes. But we are fully into preproduction and everyone is super excited about where we go next.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also announced that the show’s second season will offer a much larger-scale story. Even still, Kolstad promises that the action will continue to be as big and bold as before. The first season ended pretty climactically, so fans are anxious to know how things will go after. While it may not be for a while, at least we now know it won’t be long before we see Sam Fisher again, though not in game form.</p>
