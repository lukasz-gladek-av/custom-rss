<p>The Esports World Cup is shaping up to return to Riyadh this summer, and it has just been confirmed that it’ll feature a monumental prize pool worth <strong>$70 million</strong>. This is a new all-time high for the esports industry, topping the record set by the Esports World Cup Foundation with last year’s $60 million prize pool.</p>



<p>It was stated by the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation, Ralf Reichert, that the team wanted to have ‘room for growth’, and the only way was well and truly <strong>up </strong>this year. This prize pool includes a staggering $7 million prize reserved for <strong>one organisation </strong>that tops the Club Championship.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-in">All In</h2>



<p>The Esports World Cup is, by sheer scope, the biggest competitive gaming event in human history. It features a full line-up of the most popular esports titles in the world, and it takes place over two-months in the heart of Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>It’s lavish, it’s opulent, and it’s designed to be the grandest spectacle the gaming world has ever seen.</p>



<p>Everything from the event’s opening ceremony to how trophies are awarded is bursting with pantomime and innovation. Last year’s event saw losing teams hand over their ‘piece’ of the trophy to the winning team to crush in a hydraulic press. That’s intense.</p>



<p>In a statement, the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation explained what represents the pinnacle of the event:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you look at the Esports World Cup, the Club Championship is what holds it together.</p>



<p>On the one hand it’s fantastic that we have all of these games and can bring them together at one point in time, which is unique, then the Club Championship is what makes it a story and wraps it together. We don’t consider it as a side element but at the very heart and centre of the Esports World Cup. Naturally, this should have the highest prize money.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full list of games appearing at the Esports World Cup in 2025 is nothing short of incredible. From Tekken 8 to Call of Duty and from Rocket League to League of Legends, there’s a spot and a show for everyone. Even Chess is set to appear, as is Rainbow Six Siege X and Rennsport.</p>



<p>It’s a veritable feast of competitive gaming action, and you can follow it all here at Insider Gaming.</p>

<p>The release date for Mafia: The Old Country has seemingly been revealed in a blog post published on Steam a short while ago. It looks as though the game will be released on August 8, 2025 – previously, the game only had a ‘window’ of 2025.</p>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country was first teased in August at the Gamescom Opening Night Live ceremony, with a fuller trailer dropping in December 2024 at The Game Awards. Take-Two could have a stacked release slate lined up now, with Mafia: The Old Country, Borderlands 4, and GTA 6 all dropping within mere months of each other.</p>

<p>The post that was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999?l=latam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published on Steam</a> mentions that the developers are hosting a live stream at PAX on May 8. They’ll be talking about the past, present, and future of the franchise, which spans a whopping 23 years.</p>



<p>At the base of the post, it reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country is available August 8, 2025. Pre-order now for PlayStation®5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, and stay tuned to the&nbsp;official&nbsp;Mafia&nbsp;website&nbsp;for more information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1910450426740088833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">videotechuk_</a> on Twitter)</p>



<p>This is the first indication we’ve had of a solid release date for Mafia: The Old Country. Until now, we’ve been working with a broad window of ‘2025’, which is as vague as it gets.</p>



<p>In Mafia: The Old Country, players will explore the very origins of the organised crime network in Sicily. It’s a journey back in time to the early 1900s, and it promises to be brutal, intriguing, and stunning as a game. It’s being pieced together by Hanger 13, the team that worked on Mafia III, Mafia: Definitive Edition, and TopSpin 2K25.</p>



<p>One of those games is not like the other.</p>



<p>This highly anticipated game will be the first new entry in the series since 2016’s Mafia III turned heads, and I, for one, cannot wait.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-know-about-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-announcement-release-period-more.1161237/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-announcement-release-period-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After years of speculation, all signs point to The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake coming soon, so here is everything you need to know about the leaked announcement and release period. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-release-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda</a> and 2K Games partnered to create <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/virtuos-unannounced-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion</a>, which was released in 2006. The fourth installment in the series is often considered one of the greatest games ever made. In saying that, it is almost overshadowed by its successor, The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim, which is one of the best-selling games of all time and went on to receive several remasters. </p>



<p>As fans wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-6-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, Bethesda reportedly has plans to remind fans just how special the fourth game in the series is. </p>







<figure><figcaption>The Elder Scrolls gameplay has come a long way since 2006. Image via Bethesda </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion hasn’t officially been confirmed by Bethesda.</strong> </p>



<p>Rumors originated in 2022 when a remake or remaster of Oblivion first popped up during the FTC investigation into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The game was expected to be released during the 2022 fiscal year. </p>



<p>When that date passed, the project resurfaced again in December 2024, as rumors <span>suggested</span> Virtuos was developing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake on Unreal Engine 5</a>, which was further believed to be included in January’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Direct</a>, which came and went without an announcement. </p>



<p>No official announcement hasn’t stopped rumors from intensifying. </p>







<p><strong>No, The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion has no official release date</strong>.</p>



<p>However, Giant Bomb’s <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ifsfg5XFuRI&amp;t=14s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb</a> revealed, “I have been told it’s going to shadow drop at any moment this month.”  </p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with the term, a shadow drop is immediately releasing a game without any previous announcement or confirmed release date. </p>



<p>Shadow-dropping a game of this magnitude would be a surprise. Still, it isn’t something Bethesda hasn’t done before: Bethesda’s former studio, Tango Gameworks, shadow-dropped Hi-Fi Rush in January 20203. </p>



<p>The marketing strategy ultimately failed, as Grubb claimed in April 2023 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-microsoft-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a> “didn’t make the money it needed to make.” </p>



<p>Despite the game receiving positive reviews, the lack of marketing might have resulted in lackluster sales, and Tango Gameworks was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-microsoft-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to shut down</a> in May 20024. </p>



<p>That reportedly hasn’t scared Bethesda from trying the shadow drop strategy again. </p>







<p><strong>Bethesda has a proven track record of producing successful remasters, so fans should feel confident with The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake. </strong></p>



<p>In 2016, The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim Special Edition contained all three DLC add-ons with a graphical upgrade. In 2017, Bethesda brought Skyrim to VR with a new title and released an Anniversary Edition of the beloved game in 2021 with additional Creation Club content. </p>



<p>Based on that, fans should expect The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake to include the Knights of the Nine&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shivering Isles expansions and a much-needed visual overhaul. </p>



<hr>



<p>The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion isn’t the only remake reportedly coming soon. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-complete-ps-store-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last of Us Complete Edition</a> is now available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-animated-playstation-backgrounds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-seemingly-teased-by-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 9 remake</a> was recently teased. </p>
