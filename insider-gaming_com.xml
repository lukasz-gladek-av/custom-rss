<p>PerriKaryal surfaced at DreamHack Stockholm, and for a few minutes, she sat down with Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky to discuss the origins, and more importantly, the future of her <strong>thing</strong>. For a while, Perri has been creating top-tier content by using an EEG device that translates her brain activity into game-based inputs.</p>



<p>In the last few months, she has beaten Elden Ring’s hardest boss using nothing but her brainwaves, and recently, she tried to master FPS titles using her EEG-powered abilities. At DreamHack, she spoke about where it all goes from here.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-and-more-complicated">‘More and More Complicated’</h2>



<p>As if it didn’t sound impressive enough, Perri endeavours to make her ‘mind control’ gaming efforts more complex. While speaking to Jake Lucky at DreamHack Stockholm, she explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Currently, I’m just trying to get more and more complicated, so doing things like World of Warcraftg with all of these different inputs and finding ways to do that. I’m combining multiple EEGs, literally wearing more than one at the same time, to keep adding more and more commands.</p>



<p>I’m trying to play games just with mind control. Currently, I use mind control for buttons on a virtual Xbox controller, but then gyro and eye-tracking for the joysticks, and I’m trying to completely banish that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Perri explained to Jake that her next conquest is a psychic-only Pokémon run using <strong>just </strong>mind control.</p>



<p>On the topic of the tech ever making it into the mainstream, Perri – who has a Master’s in Psychology – admitted that the technology is a little archaic and inaccurate, but the next step could involve <strong>implants</strong>. In the vein of Musk’s Neuralink technology, an implant would circumvent the need to wear multiple devices to use your brainwaves to play games.</p>



<p>The immediate future, Perri hopes, looks positive for the development of this technology. Jake asked her where she thinks this will go in the next ‘decade-plus’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think just building super, super immersive gaming rigs, but then also for everything. Recently, I controlled robot arms with mind control, which was very cool. Hopefully, it gets to the stage where it can help people with accessibility issues. Currently, the tech is so hard to use that it’s not really a viable solution.</p>



<p>If it can get to the stage where it’s actually helpful, and super immersive, and then you can create games that are around it. I think the possibilities are infinite.</p>



<p>The sky’s the limit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DreamHack Stockholm is wrapping up today, but there are plenty of tidbits to be extracted from the many creators and pro players in attendance. In an exclusive interview, Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky and Hunter Grooms sat down with Siarhei ‘Bogur’ Alekau, one of the most popular and prolific personalities in the Overwatch space.</p>



<p>With the opportunity to talk transparently about the hero shooter scene, Bogur was more than happy to divulge his opinions about the future of these games, talking specifically about Deadlock.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-deadlock-will-100-surpass-overwatch">Deadlock Will ‘100%’ Surpass Overwatch</h2>



<p>Bogur has racked up hundreds of thousands of followers and scored some unique achievements in the Overwatch space, but that doesn’t mean he’s in love with the game.</p>



<p>In an interview with Gaming World Media at DreamHack Stockholm, Bogur spoke frankly about competing titles, suggesting that Overwatch players can’t ever break away entirely to play something else:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think Overwatch players have Stockholm Syndrome, because they’re going to say they’ll quit and they’re going to say they’re going to play another game, but they always come back. I think Marvel Rivals is the closest competitor to Overwatch, because Deadlock is so different.</p>



<p>I think all of these games are fun. I think I’m just really happy that I can finally play another game but Overwatch, because for the last six years, if the meta was stale, I had no choice but to play Overwatch, because my audience wouldn’t transition well into League or something else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With competing titles surfacing, like Valve’s Deadlock, there are now legitimate contenders to tackle Overwatch’s leading position. Bogur believes that if Valve can deliver on the developing title, it will take over. When asked if he thinks Deadlock will surpass Overwatch, Bogur said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, 100% – if they do it right. I think a lot of people are saying Deadlock is dying and it’s really tilting because the game isn’t even out yet.</p>



<p>I think long-term, there’s going to be a moment where it blows up, and all of these streamers, that have like 1k, 2k, or pro players that have like 10k, 20k viewers… It’s the same with Overwatch when it was coming out. </p>



<p>The same thing is going to happen with Deadlock because they’re updating it, they’re making changes, they’re taking risks, and they’re really keen on listening to the community and just making the best experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When asked if he still has faith in the developers, Bogur spoke kindly about Blizzard, but he admitted that he’s only still playing it because he has ‘nothing better to play’. Like many hero shooter fans, he’s waiting for Deadlock to fully materialise before he jumps over, but his short-term vision is locked in tightly on Marvel Rivals.</p>

<p>Team Falcons has just lifted the inaugural Overwatch Champions Series trophy at DreamHack Stockholm. The win followed an intense bracket that saw Team Falcons push forcefully past Twisted Minds, NTMR, and Crazy Raccoon – the team’s nemesis – to make it to the grand final.</p>



<p>In the closing series of the tournament, Team Falcons faced off once again, for a final time, against Crazy Raccoon, shutting down the round with a 4 – 1 finish that led the team to the lion’s share of the prize and the first OWCS trophy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unexpected-ending">Unexpected Ending</h2>



<p>Crazy Raccoon was the favourite going into the final bracket at the Overwatch Champions Series World Final, but Team Falcons proved to be a thorn in the team’s side.</p>



<p>This season, which was the first for the OWCS since the collapse of the Overwatch League, Crazy Raccoon and Team Falcons clashed on more than a dozen occasions, and in almost every face-off, it was CR that walked away victorious. When it mattered most, the team failed to clutch up, with Team Falcons quite literally saving the best until last.</p>



<p>In consecutive rounds, Team Falcons secured a record of 7 – 1 against Crazy Raccoon, putting to rest a year of coming in second post to the team.</p>



<p>Crazy Raccoon only entered the Overwatch scene earlier this year, while Team Falcons has been battling for a while to make a name for itself in the space. This win will go down well with the fans, who just days ago were celebrating Team Falcons securing the Esports Organisation of the Year award at The Esports Awards.</p>



<p>Going into the 2025 season, Blizzard has lined up several major changes that fans have responded to quite nicely. Are you looking forward to the next year of competitive Overwatch? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
