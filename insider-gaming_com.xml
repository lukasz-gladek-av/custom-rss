<p>Dead Space creator Glen Schofield has said that the team tried to pitch Dead Space 4 earlier this year, but the publisher was not interested.</p>



<p>The news came from a live stream by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU5PrEr1HjM&amp;t=5476s&amp;ab_channel=DanAllenGaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dan Allen Gaming</a> a few weeks ago, where he sat down with Dead Space creators Glen Schofield, Bret Robbins, and Cristopher Stone.</p>



<p>“We tried actually, the three of us, to [pitch] Dead Space 4, said Schofield. “I mean, we’re talking this year [that they pitched Dead Space 4]”, he continued. In response, Allen replied, “And what they didn’t budge?”</p>



<p>“Well, we didn’t go too deep; they just said we’re not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah, and we respected their opinion,” replied Schofield. He finished on the topic with “We have some ideas,” with the trio all saying they would return for a Dead Space 4. </p>



<p>The last game in the Dead Space series to be released was Dead Space 3 in 2013, with the original Dead Space receiving a remake by Motive Studio in 2022. </p>



<p>Since the Dead Space IP stopped with its game in 2023, Schofield released The Callisto Protocol in 2022 with his new studio Striking Distance Studios, which was considered a spiritual successor to the Dead Space series. The game failed to meet Krafton’s sales expectations of five million units, lowering their expectations to two million.</p>



<p>As for if we’ll ever see another Dead Space, it remains to be seen, but for now, it looks like its creators are all on board with jumping ship to EA if the project gets greenlit.</p>

<p>VALORANT coach Christine “potter” Chi has signed a three-year contract extension with Evil Geniuses. With the deal signed, potter will be under contract with Evil Geniuses through at least the 2027 season.</p>



<p>Evil Geniuses has officially completed its roster in the final days of 2024, gearing up for the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour season in the Americas league.</p>

<p>Potter signed a three-year, “max-length” contract with Evil Geniuses through 2027. The only other coach in VCT Americas with a contract through 2027, per <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRmmWiBmMMD43m5VtZq54nKlmj0ZtythsA1qCpegwx-iRptx2HEsG0T3cQlG1r2AIiKxBWnaurJZQ9Q/pubhtml#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Global Contract Database</a>, is 100 Thieves’ Anthony “Zikz” Gray. Zikz, a long-time coach in League of Legends who switched to VALORANT, was potter’s assistant coach during EG’s unexpected world championship run in 2023. The assistant coach for EG last year, Mike “pho” Panza, has also returned for the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Evil Geniuses CEO Chris DeAppolonio, in a press release today, called potter the “lynchpin” of EG’s VALORANT program, . “There’s no one else I’d want at the helm. With Potter’s leadership and passion, EG will always contend for the VALORANT World Championship.”</p>



<p>The re-signing of potter completes EG’s offseason ahead of the start of the 2025 season. The team opted to re-sign returning players Derrek “Derrek” Ha, Nicholas “NaturE” Garrison and Phat “Supamen” Le. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-geniuses-sign-yay-and-icy-to-complete-2025-valorant-roster/">Two new additions in Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker and Jacob “icy” Lange</a> were announced Friday. Excluding icy, who was on the team’s reserve roster at the time, potter is the only remaining name from the 2023 Champions roster.</p>



<p>The full field of 12 teams in VCT Americas all made changes to their starting rosters during this offseason period.</p>



<p>How do you think potter and Evil Geniuses stack up against other VALORANT teams heading into VCT 2025? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
