<p>Valve is back in the “console” business. The Washington-based company has officially announced its next-gen Steam Machine to the world.</p>



<p>Known internally as “Fremont”, this new console has been rumored for a long time. This summer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benchmarks for the device</a> even appeared on Geekbench.</p>











<p>This isn’t the first time Steam has tried the standalone box. Back in 2015, the first generation of Steam Machines were released, but they didn’t perform too well and were quickly discontinued. </p>

<p>Rockstar is facing legal troubles due to recent firings, with the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) taking matters into their own hands. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the GTA 6 developer recently fired employees for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giving out company secrets</a>. The fired workers then arranged a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-workers-protest-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protest</a> outside Take-Two’s London office with IWGB, claiming they were fired “in a blatant act of union busting”. Now, IWGB has issued a legal claim against Rockstar for the recent firings. </p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-due-to-alleged-union-busting">Rockstar Hit With Legal Claim Due to Alleged Union Busting</h2>



<p>In a legal statement shared with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the IWGB reveals that they are representing employees who Rockstar Games recently fired. IWGB believes that they were dismissed in circumstances that “amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity.” The statement adds that despite IGWB attempting to meet Rockstar and “resolve the matter through negotiation”, the latter has refused to meet and “persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful.”</p>



<p>Therefore, IWGB has “issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants.” The president of IWGB, Alex Marshall, added that they are confident that this is a case of “plain and simple union busting” and they will “mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers.” </p>



<p>The statement added that “Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law.” Marshall concluded, stating that “this case stands as a warning to any employer in the games industry and beyond who thinks they are able to act with impunity against organised workers – we will not be intimidated.”</p>

<p>Embark Studios has lifted the lid a little further on the North Line update, which kicks off tomorrow. Over the next few days, players will be challenged with a new Community Event, called ‘Breaking New Ground’. In this event, the Raiders will need to contribute crafting materials to collectively fuel the push into the new map, Stella Montis.</p>



<p>The faster the Raiders complete the challenge, the sooner the new map will be unlocked, Embark Studios has confirmed.</p>







<h2 id="h-breaking-new-ground-comes-to-arc-raiders-tomorrow">Breaking New Ground Comes to ARC Raiders Tomorrow</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has a new community event that effectively kickstarts the North Line update, dropping tomorrow on all platforms. This update will see the game’s first new map arrive in Stella Montis, a cold and sterile facility dug deep into the mountains above all the other maps.</p>



<p>The update also ushers in two new ARC enemies, the Matriarch and the Shredder. It has been said that the Matriarch makes the Queen look friendly, and the Shredder poses a challenge in tight environments.</p>



<p>For Breaking New Ground, players need to contribute the following to the collective effort:</p>



<ul>
<li>Metal Parts</li>



<li>Fabric</li>



<li>Chemicals</li>



<li>Rubber Parts</li>



<li>Plastic Parts</li>
</ul>



<p>This event also introduces Merits, a new currency type that ‘will fuel the next phase of progression’. Once the tunnel leading to Stella Montis has been opened up, Staking Our Claim, a new progression path, will open.</p>







<p>Embark Studios has also confirmed that new gameplay items and weapons are being added to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/arc-raiders-loaded-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> with the North Line update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New legendary weapon</li>



<li>Three new mines</li>



<li>Two new grenades</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders’ post-launch roadmap starts here and unravels further in December with the Cold Snap update, which in turn brings about the Flickering Flames event.</p>



<p>It’s also when players will have the first opportunity to reset their accounts, <strong>and </strong>it’s when snow blankets the game.</p>

<p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble is an upcoming free-to-play multiplayer arena shooter, releasing for iOS and Android devices soon. </p>



<p>Insomniac’s Ratchet &amp; Clank has been lying dormant since 2023; the only update we have received since then is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ratchet-and-clank-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC port for Rift Apart</a>. However, things won’t remain stagnant for too long, as a new title has been announced, but this time it’s for a completely new platform: iOS and Android devices. </p>
