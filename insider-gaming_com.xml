<p>Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé says he’s surprised that Microsoft hasn’t released more Xbox games for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In an interview with The Game Business, Reggie discussed Xbox’s third-party strategy and admitted he expected to see far more crossover between the two platforms by now.</p>







<p><strong>“I’m surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective,”</strong> <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">Fils-Aimé sa</a><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">i</a><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">d</a>. <strong>“Certainly, some games could easily be ported over to Switch 2. And I’m surprised that we haven’t seen more of that.”</strong></p>



<p>Fils-Aimé went on to say he thought Xbox would have announced several new titles ahead of the holidays.</p>



<p><strong>“I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday,”</strong> he said.<strong> “All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement. And I’m surprised it hasn’t happened.”</strong></p>



<p>Currently, Microsoft has released Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 on the Switch 2 with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle set to come sometime in 2026. Aside from that, however, there hasn’t been any other first-party port or new released announced for Nintendo’s latest console. </p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-says-they-want-to-support-the-switch-2">Xbox Says They Want To Support The Switch 2</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, just after the Switch 2 was announced, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said that he wants to support the Switch 2. He even went as far to say that Nintendo has been a “great partner” for Xbox.</p>







<p><strong>“I’m really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them,”</strong> Spencer said at the time. “<strong>And getting the support from them for our franchises, I think, is an important part of our future.”</strong></p>



<p>While many expect more first party Xbox games to make their way to the Switch 2, when it happens remains anyone’s guess. In the meantime, all fans can do is hope.</p>

<p>The Game Awards continue to grow, and have a new broadcast partner to show for it. Show creator and host Geoff Keighly announced on Tuesday that The Game Awards 2025 will stream on Amazon Prime Video for the first time.</p>



<p>In addition to being on Prime, The Game Awards will continue to stream on YouTube, Twitch, and other platforms. </p>







<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/game-awards-streaming-amazon-prime-video-twitch-1236574939/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> about the news, Keighly said that the fact it’s an additional platform instead of a replacement makes it a “really exciting” addition for the show.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve had lots of conversations with people over the years, and we’re like, there’s no way, there’s no world where we could ever really take the show off YouTube and Twitch — where it was born back in 2014,” </strong>he said.</p>



<p>Keighly also said that despite being on a large platform like Prime Video, it won’t change how the show is produced and air. He also said that Amazon was receptive about a non-exclusive deal with the show.</p>



<p><strong>“It’s important people know it doesn’t change our show at all,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re still making the same show. I came out of a life of working on television networks. And you had television folks that would give opinions and things on what you want the show to be. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“This is still The Game Awards. It’s the exact same show. They’re really just another distribution outlet, and they’re really letting us build the show the way we always do. We’re not changing anything about the show to accommodate a new platform.”</strong></p>







<p>As mentioned, The Game Awards 2025 will air on Twitch and YouTube like always. On Twitch, however, another first will happen as the show will air in 2K. There will also be Twitch Drops for those watching on the platform.</p>



<p>Are you going to watch The Game Awards on Amazon Prime Video this year, or stick with a traditional platform like YouTube or Twitch?

<p>Players already knew that Rogue and Gambit are coming to Marvel Rivals Season 5, but a new trailer has made it official. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 5 is something players have been looking forward to a lot, especially after knowing which two characters will be taking the center stage in the new season. Rogue and Gambit were already revealed through several leaks and an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ad-rogue-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertisement on TikTok</a>. Now, players have received an official trailer, providing a background for the upcoming season’s plot. </p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-rogue-and-gambit-revealed-through-new-trailer">Marvel Rivals Rogue and Gambit Revealed Through New Trailer</h2>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1987913327197016501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) for Marvel Rivals teased yesterday that something new was coming with an invitation to Rogue and Gambit’s wedding. This invitation was followed by a new trailer, where we see the duo gearing up to tie the knot; however, their plans are met with an unforeseen roadblock as a timestream entanglement tears their world apart before Gambit and Rogue can say “I do” on Krakoa. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>However, Gambit will not let this go so easily and will set forth on a “daring cosmic heist to steal the universe’s rarest ring – and win back the moment time itself stole from them.” The new trailer offers no gameplay details or abilities for the upcoming characters; instead, it features a cinematic video that primarily sets up the narrative for the next season, “Love is a Battlefield”. Marvel Rivals Season 5 is set to release on November 14, 2025, and we can expect to receive more details about the two characters leading up to this date. </p>







<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals’ PvE Zombies mode helped provide <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-steam-player-count-spike-pve-mode-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major player spike on Steam</a> recently. Additionally, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delay-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to late 2026</a>.
