<p>Use these Roblox Survive Wave Z monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Scrap and much more.</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the classic multiplayer Call Of Duty game mode Zombies? If so, Survive Wave Z is going to be right up your alley, and you need to check out this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-ants-empire-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> wave defence experience immediately. As the name of the game suggests, players are tasked with defending and surviving against endless waves of enemies, with the end goal being to survive Wave Z, which is considered the last one. There is a wide variety of weapons and other items that the players can use in their mission to survive, but not all of them will be available for use at the start of the game.</p>







<p>As is the case with most games of this genre, unlocking powerful weapons required a massive amount of grinding, and for players who are new to the game, acquiring some of these can seem like a pipe dream. That’s where these codes can come to the players’ aid. They provide free rewards to the players, including key resources like Scrap, making it a key part of the game. Redeeming these codes will help players get ahead of the competition and progress through the levels faster than they otherwise would be able to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Roblox game codes are often released by the developers through the game’s official Discord server, through the Roblox game page, or on their social media pages. However, tracking all of these regularly can be a hassle, and that’s where this article can be a lifesaver. We update this page with new codes as soon as they drop, so we recommend that all players bookmark this page to not miss out on any free rewards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion has soared onto the scene, with the beat ’em up title boasting an impressive roster of characters, including several that are locked behind progression.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review-a-cosmic-blast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming review of Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, a ‘Great’ verdict of the game was issued, with the title attracting praise for providing chaotic gameplay in a good way, with a perfect balance of depth to keep players engaged, but not overwhelmed, in the vintage beat ’em up.</p>



<p>If you’re diving into Marvel Cosmic Invasion but want to know how to unlock a specific character, or are wondering who there is to choose from on the roster, this guide has all the crucial details.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-marvel-cosmic-invasion-characters-amp-how-to-unlock">All Marvel Cosmic Invasion Characters &amp; How to Unlock</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Locked. Image via Tribute Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 15 playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion, four of which are locked behind specific requirements in progression.</strong></p>



<p>The base roster in Marvel Cosmic Invasion is kind, with 11 characters unlocked by default, including fan-favorites like Captain America, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Rocket Raccoon.</p>



<p>However, Jean Grey/Phoenix, Venom, Phyla-Vell, and Silver Surfer must be unlocked by completing specified missions, which require exploring several areas of the game as split paths present themselves regularly. Due to this, you won’t be able to unlock all the characters immediately, and will have to backtrack at some points.</p>



<p>The challenge of unlocking the restricted characters is not difficult, however, as you only need to complete the specified levels, and don’t need to achieve any particular objectives, though this means potentially venturing out of your way to the four individual levels containing the locked characters.</p>



<p>The full list of playable characters in Marvel Cosmic Invasion and how to unlock them is shown in the table below.</p>

<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 won every award imaginable when it came out, as did The Witcher 3 years before it. It makes sense that CD Projekt Red wants to create the most successful sequel possible, and acquiring one of BG3’s senior devs is a good way to do this.</p>



<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher if you want <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-dev-doesnt-know-how-to-top-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> to have any hopes of living up to the reputation of the third game. Cyberpunk 2077 battled to become a huge success in the end, but it required a lot of hard work. The Witcher 4 will be equally as difficult, but it can get off to a better start than CP 2077. One way to do that is by bringing in a Larian Studios artist.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-4-adds-baldur-s-gate-3-senior-cinematic-dev">The Witcher 4 Adds Baldur’s Gate 3 Senior Cinematic Dev</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Treasure what you have today, because it may be gone tomorrow. Credit to Larian Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Felix Pedulla worked at Larian Studios for six years, starting as a cinematic artist before becoming a senior cinematic artist.</p>







<p>They helped Baldur’s Gate 3 to become one of the most celebrated and successful game releases of the last few years. That journey recently came to an end when Pedulla announced a new career move on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fedulla_newjob-careergrowth-gamingindustry-activity-7401304661347172352-uP_M?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACUuJ-8BNA69V1_ApZijzm0QdBNPNFJlEnA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>“After an incredible and frankly wild six-year ride with the amazing team at Larian Studios, a new chapter begins. I’m so grateful for every chaotic, creative, and unforgettable moment we shared. We made some serious magic together, and I’ll forever cherish the lessons and memories. A huge thank you to all my incredible colleagues and friends I made.</p><p>As one adventure ends, another begins! I am absolutely thrilled to announce that I’m joining the legendary team at CD Projekt Red as a Senior Cinematic Designer! The opportunity to contribute to one of the most ambitious studios in the industry is a dream come true. Time to trade in my Baldur’s Gate dice for some Polish steel and get to work crafting some epic cutscenes.”</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>It was nice to see so many of the replies being Larian Studios devs, sad to see the artist go. Interestingly, this news comes only a handful of weeks after it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s lead gameplay designer</a> also joined CD Projekt Red. The team is obviously keen to recruit and house the best developers in the world to create one of the most anticipated RPGs of all time.</p>

<p>A Fortnite artist has hit back at suggestions that some art in Chapter 7 Season 1 is AI-generated, proving their work on a piece of artwork.</p>



<p>Fortnite kicked off Chapter 7 in style with the Zero Point live event, marking the end of the last Chapter, attracting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-featured-over-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million players</a>, but social media was soon awash with claims that AI created some artwork and assets used in Chapter 7 Season 1, despite a lack of proof.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-artist-proves-their-work-was-not-ai-generated">Fortnite Artist Proves Their Work Was Not AI-Generated</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Proof. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As posted by the likes of <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1995684089945620483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HypeX</a>, Fortnite artist Sean Dove revealed he was behind the Marty McFly Spray in the game that some have accused of being created by AI, showing his work on the image.</p>



<p>Dove explained the process of his work, particularly the background featuring clocks, where he “grabbed some clocks off image search, collaged them, and halftoned them.”</p>



<p>He admitted that “the numbers are bad” and that it was “entirely possible” he grabbed an AI clock when gathering images, but, nevertheless, the work was done by him.</p>



<p>Although this doesn’t quite end the AI debate surrounding Fortnite, as there are plenty of accusations revolving around other images found in the game, it does show evidence that one of the most prominent pieces of art, which is available as a Spray in the Battle Pass, is not AI-generated.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Epic Games regarding the accusations of AI artwork being used in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 and is waiting for a response.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fans have been trying to uncover the identity of a mysterious Game Awards Statue</a>. On November 29, The Game Awards show host and creator Geoff Keighley posted on X saying: “regal.inspiring.thickness.” The message was accompanied by a statue, which was later revealed to be close to the venue.</p>







<p>God of War has been one of the biggest suggestions heading into the show, and Cory Balrog has responded.</p>

<p>Gaming content creator and streamer Luke Stephens had a surprise visitor pop up in their chat during a stream, none other than God of War director Cory Balrog.</p>







<p>Balrog has worked extensively on the GOW franchise since 2005 and worked their way up at Santa Monica Studio, becoming the main director for the 2018 reboot and Ragnarok. Stephens’ chat was talking about the Game Awards statue, and Balrog had a quick message to address one of the many suggested games:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“no, it’s not gow.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So there you have it, if you see the statue appear during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> livestream, you might be disappointed to learn that it’s not God of War related.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It doesn’t mean the series will be absent altogether. The long-rumored <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Metroidvania game</a> has been outed for a possible TGA 2025 appearance, and it would be fun to see.</p>



<p>No one seems to know, but what do you think the statue means for The Game Awards 2025? Any ideas which game it’s referring to or highlighting?

<p>Epic Games has significantly nerfed the XP gain across various modes in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, making the grind to complete the Battle Pass much longer.</p>



<p>Fortnite brought an end to Chapter 6 with the huge Zero Point live event, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-featured-over-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million players tuned in</a> to watch the defeat of the Dark Presence, and Chapter 7 Season 1 began soon after—but players have quickly noticed a major reduction in the XP awarded.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-xp-nerfed-for-chapter-7-season-1">Fortnite XP Nerfed For Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>

<p>Posting on Twitter, FNBRUnderground shared details about the drop in XP gain in the new Chapter, which includes reduced rewards for completing Battle Royale Weekly Quests.</p>



<p>Weekly Quests now provide 134k XP, down from 170k XP in Chapter 6 Season 4, but the biggest drop of all comes in Save The World Endurance, with 188,300 XP available compared to 392,200 XP last season.</p>



<p>Playtime XP in LEGO Fortnite and Creative Maps has also been reduced, with LEGO Fortnite now providing 1,550 XP, down from 2,250, and Creative Maps dishing out 1,750 XP compared to 2,300 XP last season.</p>



<p>Epic Games has not detailed exactly why there has been such a major falloff in XP in Chapter 7 Season 1, but the main theory among players is that it has been reduced due to the longer length of the season, but that doesn’t quite add up.</p>



<p>As revealed by the current Battle Pass, Chapter 7 Season 1 in Fortnite is due to end on March 4, 2026, although this is a Wednesday and could therefore be adjusted slightly to align with Epic Games’ traditional release schedule.</p>



<p>That puts the length of the season at 95 days, which, although longer than Chapter 6 Season 4, the last full-length season in Fortnite, it isn’t too much different, given that the season lasted 85 days.</p>



<p>Fortnite does seem to be offering more quests to complete this season, though, and is encouraging players to jump into a variety of modes by locking some Battle Pass content behind tasks in the likes of Reload.</p>

<p>It’s not often that any game gets a new peak player count years after release, and it’s even rarer when it happens to a driving simulation title <strong>thirteen years </strong>after hitting the market. That’s what happened recently with Euro Truck Simulator 2, which skyrocketed on Steam to reach a new peak player count years after its release in October 2012.</p>



<p>On Steam, Euro Truck Simulator 2 soared to 72,678 concurrent players, all because of two new DLC packs that took players to the Nordics.</p>







<h2 id="h-euro-truck-simulator-2-reaches-new-heights">Euro Truck Simulator 2 Reaches New Heights</h2>



<p>Euro Truck Simulator 2 has always been one of the most popular driving sims, with some players going to extreme lengths to replicate a truck cab in their gaming room to immerse themselves in the hyper-realistic driving experience fully.</p>



<p>Days ago, SCS Software released two new pieces of DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2, Nordic Horizons and the Forest Machinery expansion. The former takes players to the gorgeous, rural vistas of Scandinavia, presenting them with mountainside roads, forest tracks, and scenic drives around lakes and fjords.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the expansion:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>SCS Software has made leaps and bounds with Euro Truck Simulator 2 over the years, constantly adding new locations and ways to explore the game through a staggering array of expansions.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Steam</a>, users can invest in the Euro Truck Simulator 2 <strong>Ultimate Edition bundle </strong>to secure the base game and a whopping 34 expansions and pieces of DLC. This includes Greece, France, Italy, the Balkans, and of course, Scandinavia.</p>



<p>The game has remained a consistent hit since 2012, generating ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ reviews to make Euro Truck Simulator 2 one of the top-rated titles on Steam.</p>
