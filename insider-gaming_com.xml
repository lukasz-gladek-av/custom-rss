<p>The original PowerWash Simulator game was highly enjoyed by many, but will PowerWash Simulator 2 add splitscreen functionality?</p>



<p>There are many reasons to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-and-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look forward to the sequel</a> if you loved the first game, but it’s always nice to see how games like this improve over what came before.</p>



<p>Here is your answer to whether PowerWash Simulator 2 has splitscreen or not, and a general look at how multiplayer works.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-splitscreen">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have Splitscreen?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes, PowerWash Simulator 2 has splitscreen functionality. You and one other person can play the game from the same screen as you work together to clean up various levels.</strong></p>



<p>This is actually a pretty big development, considering that the original <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator game</a> did not have any local multiplayer, only online.</p>



<p>Often these days, video games are going out of their way to remove local multiplayer opportunities. In some cases, this comes down to the performance taking a noticeable dip when the game tries to run two instances at the same time. Hopefully, the splitscreen in PowerWash Simulator 2 isn’t anything that will cause massive frame drops or other issues.</p>



<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 adding dedicated local multiplayer support may actually be one of the reasons that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game isn’t on older hardware</a>. There’s a possibility that the development team was so focused on making sure the splitscreen experience was as smooth as possible that they wanted to make sure only the current generation consoles could run it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-powerwash-simulator-2">How Many People Can Play PowerWash Simulator 2?</h2>



<p><strong>While two people can play PowerWash Simulator 2 in splitscreen, the career mode has been expanded to four players at a time, with free play holding up to six players at once.</strong></p>



<p>These are some pretty notable increases over the original game. The first game only allowed two people to play the career mode together, and in that, only the host was able to save their progress and got a much better reward payout than the joined friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, this time around, all players who join career mode will share all of the progress updates as the host, which allows them to bring their upgrades and unlocked levels into their own save.</p>



<p>Futurlab has definitely taken a big interest in making sure that multiplayer in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-revealed-with-new-announcement-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> has been improved over the original game. Changes like these are much more friendly to players who want to enjoy the game with others and make it so no one is being left behind just for the “crime” of helping their friend.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Discord Denies Recent Claims About 1.5TB Of Data Being Stolen]]></title>

<p>Discord has denied that the party responsible for the recent security breach against the company has the data it claims to have. </p>



<p>On Wednesday, the group claiming responsibility for the hack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/discord-hackers-claim-to-have-1-5tb-of-age-verification-photos/">said that it had gained access</a> to over 1.5TB of data, including over 2 million age-verification photos. In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, Discord said that not only is the number not true, but it’s not even close. </p>



<p>Discord spokesperson Nu Wexler&nbsp;tells Insider Gaming that it has identified around 70,000 users “that may have had government ID photos exposed.” The public claims by the group, they say, are all being done as a means to extort the company.</p>



<p>The full statement from Discord is as follows:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Following&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">last week’s announcement</a>&nbsp;about a security incident involving a third-party customer service provider, we want to address inaccurate claims by those responsible that are circulating online.&nbsp;First, as stated in our blog post, this was&nbsp;not&nbsp;a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord. Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government-ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review&nbsp;<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041820932-Help-I-m-old-enough-to-use-Discord-in-my-country-but-I-got-locked-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">age-related appeals</a>. Third, we will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All affected users globally have been contacted and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities, and external security experts. We’ve secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The incident that involved lost data took place in late September and was addressed on October 3 by the company. At the time, the company said that information such as Discord usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and “limited” billing information was compromised. </p>
