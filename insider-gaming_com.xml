<p>The most expensive Counter-Strike skins ever have some massive price tags associated with them. Since the introduction of in-game cosmetics to CS:GO year ago, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-cs2-skin-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">value of this skin economy</a> has steadily grown, thanks to factors like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gambling</a> and the 2023 announcement of Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<p>The Counter-Strike skin economy is so large that it’s not contained to just the official Steam community market. Dozens of sites allow players to buy and sell skins. A few uniquely rare skins have fetched a very pretty penny, but one holds the record for selling for the most amount of money.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-most-expensive-cs-go-skin-ever-sold">The Most Expensive CS:GO Skin Ever Sold</h2>



<p>The most expensive purchase of a CS:GO skin ever occurred in April 2023, just a few weeks after Valve announced CS2. This announcement caused a spike in both renewed interest in the franchise as well as skin prices, leading to what appears to be the biggest purchase ever.</p>



<p>ZipeLCS, a long-time skin trader and co-owner of the Danish organization ECSTATIC, <a href="https://x.com/zipelCS/status/1647582159245385729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that they had sold <strong>a StatTrak Case Hardened “Blue Gem” AK-47 with four Katowice 2014 Titan Holo stickers for roughly $400,000.</strong> The transaction also included a Case Hardened “Blue Gem” Karambit knife that sold for an additional $100,000, roughly.</p>



<p>But what makes this AK valued at around $400,000?</p>



<ul>
<li>Case Hardened skins are more valuable if there’s more blue. The Case Hardened AK above features a “Blue Gem” 661 pattern, which gives it an incredibly rare shiny blue pattern.</li>



<li>It’s in Minimal Wear condition (second best next to Factory New).</li>



<li>The four Katowice 2014 Titan Holo stickers, the <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/top-20-most-expensive-csgo-stickers-in-history-1361385/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most rare and expensive Counter-Strike stickers</a>, were valued at roughly $60,000 each.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-the-most-expensive-cs2-skin-ever-sold">The Most Expensive CS2 Skin Ever Sold</h2>



<p>Just this past year, <strong>a StatTrak Case Hardened Factory New AK-47 with the 661 pattern was <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/counter-strike-2s-most-expensive-skin-sells-for-jaw-dropping-1-million-2762918/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> sold for more than $1 million</strong>, according to Dexerto. The seller claims to have rejected “multiple” offers at $1 million, placing the exact buy amount at somewhere between $1 million and $1.5 million.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While this AK appears to be the most expensive skin ever sold, it’s not the highest price ever listed for a skin. <strong>One player <a href="https://afkgaming.com/csgo/news/extremely-rare-csgo-knife-allegedly-costs-more-than-12-million-euros" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered to pay $1.5 million</a> in Bitcoin for a one-of-a-kind Factory New Case Hardened “Blue Gem” Karambit knife</strong>. For context, the one that sold for $100,000 above was Well-Worn. However, the owner of the skin was “not interested” and said that the offer was too low.</p>



<p>What’s the most you’d ever spend on a skin? And will the one-of-a-kind Factory New Case Hardened “Blue Gem” Karambit skin ever be sold?

<p>Marvel Rivals has confirmed that The Fantastic 4 will arrive for the game soon. A trailer will be released on January 6 at 8:00 AM PST / 16:00 UTC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The official Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1874863266318762195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) has posted an image of the Fantastic 4, which includes Mr. Fantastic, The Human Torch, The Thing, and Invisible Woman. Interestingly, the image also features H.E.R.B.I.E, the team’s robotic friend, who has many players wondering whether he will be available as a playable character in the title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players already had an idea that members of the Fantastic 4 would be arriving for Marvel Rivals soon, with leaks of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-human-torch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Torch</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Thing</a> surfacing online recently, detailing their abilities and skills. Now we know for sure that the whole family, including Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, and H.E.R.B.I.E, will be making their way to the hero shooter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-unveils-ultron-as-upcoming-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultron</a>, one of the characters that has leaked much before, hasn’t received an official confirmation yet. A recent leak also claimed that characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-claims-deadpool-and-more-are-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool, Emma Frost, Modok</a>, and more will be making their way to the game soon. Additionally, details about Marvel Rivals <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loot boxes were uncovered through recent leaks</a>. &nbsp;</p>
