<p>Get ready to take over the career of the “Best in the World” CM Punk in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming reported several weeks ago that CM Punk, the WWE 2K26 cover star, was planned to be the focal point of this year’s WWE 2K Showcase. Now, 2K has confirmed the news and is giving fans a deep dive into what to expect this year and the different paths to unlock all Showcase content.</p>







<h2 id="h-get-punked-in-wwe-2k26-showcase">Get Punked in WWE 2K26 Showcase</h2>



<p>WWE 2K not only released a written <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report</a> on the forthcoming mode, but also a new trailer narrated by the current WWE World Heavyweight Champion, who breaks down how players can relive his history in some matches and rewrite it in others.</p>



<p>The mode, taking a page from last year’s Showcase, kicks off with a match from this year’s WrestleMania, putting players in the middle of the action between Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns, and CM Punk. Other historical bouts include John Cena, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, The Undertaker, Brock Lesnar, and more. Check out the full list of historical matches below:</p>



<ul>
<li>CM Punk vs. JBL, SummerSlam 2008</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Rey Mysterio, Armageddon 2008</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Randy Orton, WrestleMania 27</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Undertaker, WrestleMania 29</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. John Cena, RAW Feb. 2013</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. The Rock, Elimination Chamber 2013</li>



<li>CM Punk vs Brock Lesnar, SummerSlam 2013</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre, Bad Blood 2024</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Seth Freakin’ Rollins, RAW Jan. 2025</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Seth Freakin’ Rollins vs. Roman Reigns, WrestleMania 41</li>
</ul>



<p>There are also three announced “Fantasy Warfare” scenarios. One match sees CM Punk take on Steve Austin. Another sees CM Punk facing off against Eddie Guerrero. The last sees CM Punk teaming up with his wife, AJ Lee, to do battle with The Miz and Maryse. These all take place in a fantasy arena called the “CM Punkvillion.”</p>



<p>Lastly, there are the what-if scenarios. These include matches that ask questions such as “What if CM Punk never left WWE in 2014?” and “What if certain rivalries went differently?”</p>

<h2>Players Can Choose to Run the Gauntlet Instead</h2>



<p>For anyone who wants to unlock all the content associated with WWE 2K26’s Showcase mode, players can simply run the Gauntlet instead. In this mode, you can choose either CM Punk or AJ Lee and try to beat 20 consecutive opponents. In any case, there is a wealth of content to be unlocked.</p>



<p>Speaking of unlockables, this year’s game introduces a new Ringside Pass system. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/" id="175166">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s second season officially launches on February 17, and the action is headed to Germany.</p>



<p>The news was announced via the official drop of a gameplay trailer on February 10. However, the trailer had leaked earlier, revealing that the action centers on the seizure of Hagental Airbase in Bravia.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-launches-with-new-map">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Launches With New Map</h2>



<p>Two maps will launch next season. The first of which is called “Contaminated.” <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA previously stated</a> that the map size falls between Eastwood and Mirak Valley and is comparable to classic Battlefield maps such as St. Quentin Scar from Battlefield 1 or Arras from Battlefield 5. The map is also supposedly designed to specifically address time-to-action concerns.</p>



<p>In the same blog post, EA tells fans that Golmud Railway, a popular map from Battlefield 4, is being rebuilt for modern Battlefield and will be available in a future season.</p>







<h2>Battlefield 6 Has Been a Financial Success</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of 2025. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-ea-sales/">EA’s NET bookings increased</a> 38% year over year, driven by the success of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Despite this strong start, player numbers have declined due to a lack of post-launch content. Perhaps the launch of season 2 can turn that around.</p>

<p>Launching on February 13, Elsa Bloodstone will join the action as a Duelist. The news was announced in a social media video presented by GuangGuang from the development team.</p>

<h2 id="h-changes-to-the-team-up-abilities-in-marvel-rivals">Changes to the Team-Up Abilities in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>The Team-Up Ability changes see the exit of the Fantastic Four Team-Up Ability. In its place, the Invisible Woman will partner with Doctor Strange for the new Psionic Mayhem team-up. Elsa Bloodstone is added to Mr. Pool’s Interdimensional Toy Box Team-Up. </p>



<p>Bloodstone will team with Deadpool for a new attack that forces enemies to hear Deadpool’s non-stop talking.</p>



<p>The Thing has been added to Hulk’s Gamma Charge Team-Up, and Mr. Fantastic joins the Rocket Network team-up with Rocket Raccoon and Star-Lord.</p>
