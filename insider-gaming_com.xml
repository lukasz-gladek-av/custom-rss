<p>Mecha BREAK is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-popular-demos-from-steam-next-fest-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attracting far more players</a> than any other demo at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Next Fest</a>, and those players have to decide which Striker (or mech) to unlock first. It takes a while to unlock all of the Mecha BREAK Strikers through the progression system, so knowing what the best ones are beforehand can make the task much easier.</p>



<p>After you complete the tutorial, you’ll have the default Striker Alysnes unlocked already. Once you’ve completed a few matches and some introductory tasks, you should have enough Matrix Credits to unlock these must-have Strikers in Mecha BREAK. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-interview-mecha-break-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The game’s creator Kris Kwok may not be able to pick favorites</a>, but we can.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-strikers-to-unlock-in-mecha-break">Best Strikers to Unlock in Mecha BREAK</h2>



<h3 id="h-tricera">Tricera</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Tricera only costs 3,200 Matrix Credits, a relative steal considering the cost of other Strikers and given how valuable he is. An Ultra-Heavy Defender, Tricera comes equipped with two sets of gatling guns, and its greatest strength is its unreal defensive capabilities. Its gatling guns can be fired at the same time, shredding opponent armor. Tricera can also transform into a nearly impenetrable turret mode, in which it can also deploy drones that heal itself and friendly units around it. When a defender is needed to hold down an objective in 6v6, there’s arguably no better option early on Tricera.</p>



<h3 id="h-welkin">Welkin</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>In contrast to the defensive capabilities of Tricera, Welkin is a melee offensive dynamo, costing 6,800 Matrix Credits to unlock. Equipped with a sick battle axe that bypasses enemy armor, Welkin’s signature ability is a stasis field that locks enemies in with you and a drone that deals additional damage and stagger. It e also has two smoke fields to get him out of tricky situations: a Jamming field that destroys enemy drones and blinds enemies facing you, and a Defense field that blocks and reduces incoming Energy damage. Close the distance on an enemy, pop the stasis field, and let the Axe go to work </p>



<h3 id="h-hurricane">Hurricane</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hurricane, another Ultra-Heavy Defender that costs 9,600 Matrix Credits, excels in creating areas that enemies will steer clear from. Its defensive field creates a large barrier that it and allies can take shelter in, and it can deploy Decoy Drones and Turret Drones to harass enemies. Hurricane’s primary fire Energy Blaster is worth charging up, as it deals continuous Area and Energy damage and will absolutely melt light attackers.</p>



<h3 id="h-skyraider">Skyraider</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Skyraider, a Medium Attacker that costs 45,000 Matrix Credits, is the perfect blend of firepower and mobility, and is worth saving up for. While standing, its Autocannon and Missile deal massive amounts of damage, with a Jamming Missile that allows for blocking damage and escape potential. Once it switches to its Aerial Assault form, it can dodge missiles or lock-ons, and utilize a Missile Dispenser that can target up to 12 different units. Skyraider is great for clearing out teamfights in 6v6, and is overall a strong choice in Mashmak extraction matches.</p>

<p>If you’re a Call of Duty fan who has yet to upgrade to a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, it looks like you’ll be able to still keep your old system for at least another year. According to a new report, Call of Duty 2025 is in development for last gen PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>



<p>The claim was first reported by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1895228195471007981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a> on Thursday night. Insider Gaming sources have since been able to corroborate the report that the game is in development for those platforms. Whether it actually releases on them is something that sources couldn’t confirm just yet.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-media-s-fault">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-medias-fault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman Canceled And Is It The Games Media’s Fault?</a></h6>



<p>In addition to the plans for the game to remain on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, CharlieIntel speculates that the 13-year-old systems might be a reason why Warzone doesn’t have “two big maps at the same time”.</p>



<p>As far as why the game could continue on last-gen consoles, it likely has to do with the popularity on those platforms. Still, it has fans on social media split about the decision.</p>



<p>“Studios having to support 12 year old hardware is bad for the industry and holds back the full potential for games,” <a href="https://x.com/xSERP3NT/status/1895230590129185239" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user said</a>. “It’s time to move on.”</p>



<p>Said another: “Crazy but not surprising. Still a ton of ppl on there, and the game scales to low end hardware, [and the] game engine can even play on phones now as we saw with warzone mobile.”</p>
