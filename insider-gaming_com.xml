<p>Microsoft is a powerhouse of the gaming industry, and that much is certain. Most of that value has come from lucrative acquisitions that the company has made over the years, such as the snapping up of ZeniMax Media and, more recently, Activision Blizzard King. In a recent financial report, it was stressed that the tech titan now owns 20 franchises that have each exceeded <strong>$1 BILLION </strong>in revenue.</p>



<p>The ‘Annual Report 2024’ that was published by the firm recently outlines just how staggering Microsoft’s gaming portfolio has been – and continues to be. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-over-time">Over Time</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that many of the franchises Microsoft is referring to are decades old and have pieced together their lifetime revenue over <strong>many years</strong>. For instance, Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, Gears of War, Diablo, and Halo. Microsoft has little in the way of new IP under that umbrella, and even the gem of the collection – Call of Duty – was acquired after being on the market for more than 20 years.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/static-files/2e135de7-7104-4bca-b2c4-e584199eabeb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snippet from the financial update</a> that was dug up <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/101314/xbox-has-20-video-game-franchises-that-have-earned-1-billion/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by TweakTown</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. </p>



<p>We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue—from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love—where, when, and how they want.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The financial update gassed up the Xbox Game Pass subscription service to no end, singing the praises of the paid-for platform that boasts ‘over 400 first- and third-party console and PC titles’. It’s not the be-all and end-all, though – the ecosystem’s cloud gaming platform was also spotlighted, even if competition is running rampant.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a dog-eat-dog world, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>This year, Microsoft’s gaming revenue increased by 39% – $6 billion – thanks to growth in Xbox content and services, it was revealed. Microsoft is putting a lot of faith in the recent ABK acquisition to further bolster growth going forward: <em>‘The acquisition will accelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming.’</em></p>



<p>What’s your favourite Microsoft-backed franchise that has made more than $1 billion in its lifetime? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Undisputed, the first boxing game to be a smash hit in more than a decade, has just passed one million sales. It entered early access last year but was released in full on October 11, being scooped up and praised by boxing fans worldwide. In a recent interview, one of the founders of the developer, Steel City Interactive, spoke about this milestone and what’s coming next.</p>



<p>Esports has always been on the table for Undisputed, and it’s about time to realise that vision.;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-opportunities">New Opportunities</h2>



<p>The esports industry is dominated by shooters, MOBA games, and the FGC. Typically, sports-based titles aren’t all that popular where esports are concerned, and that’s mostly because the real-world examples of these sports are there and readily available. It’s not possible to watch <strong>real-world shootouts </strong>unfold on a competitive level now, is it?</p>



<p>Despite that, Steel City Interactive is ready and willing to make Undisputed one of the next best esports games.</p>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/undisputed-hit-an-indie-made-boxing-game-featuring-real-fighters-has-just-sold-1m-copies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Ash Habib, one of Steel City’s founders, spoke about the competitive future of Undisputed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Esports was part of the original vision for the game. </p>



<p>I didn’t want the esport element to feel like a bolt-on or something that needed doing separately. With that in mind, we partnered with the WBC, where there will be an esport element where you can actually win a physical WBC belt, given by Mauricio Sulaimán, who is the president himself. So esports is in our plans, and will form a big part of Undisputed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, we sat down with Ash Habib to learn about the ins and outs of this marvellous new boxing game that has been turning heads for years.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>One million sales are just the start for Undisputed. If the game can generate a popular enough esports ecosystem, it’ll be in a league of its own, as there’s nothing else to compete with it at present.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Surgent Studios Unveils Tales of Kenzera: Project Uso]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-tales-of-kenzera-uso/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-tales-of-kenzera-uso/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Surgent Studios, the creator behind Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, has unveiled Project Uso, the next game in the multimedia universe pioneered by the creative mind of Abubakar Salim. In a release issued by Surgent today, it was confirmed that Project Uso will be ‘darker and more visceral than our debut game.’</p>



<p>It’s a return to Kenzera but in a completely alternate aesthetic. Project Uso will be centred around a ‘vampiric android’ that’s designed to house the spirits of the deceased. It’s set to be a crossover between a choice-driven RPG and an ‘electrifying’ beat-em-up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-next-chapter">The Next Chapter</h2>



<p>Recently, Surgent Studios was in the news following the revelation that the games branch of the firm had been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-studios-game-division-redundancies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put on notice of potential redundancy</a>. This news came amid financial struggles and a lack of funding for future projects – including Project Uso.</p>



<p>The press release published by Surgent Studios to mark the announcement of Project Uso bore that message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Surgent Studios has developed a fully-functional prototype of PROJECT USO and is actively seeking a partner to bring it to life.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a statement attached to the press release, Surgent’s founder, Abubakar Salim, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Project Uso is set to be darker and more visceral than our debut game. Where ZAU is about dealing with death in a healthy way, USO is about letting your fear of death consume you. Inspiration struck following the birth of my daughter, when I grappled with a crisis of identity as I took on the role of parent for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Similarly, the concept for Tales of Kenzera: ZAU came about when Salim was wrestling with the untimely loss of his father and trying desperately to figure out how to cope with the grief that followed.</p>



<p>In Uso, players will assume control of a unique RPG system created by Surgent. They’ll have ‘the powers of an android and a god at their disposal’, given that the protagonist houses the spirit of Eshu, ‘the god of chaos’. </p>



<p>At first blush, it sounds a little deeper than ZAU in terms of gameplay mechanics, and the choice-based features should add a little more variety and replayability, whereas ZAU was much more linear and one-track. Project Uso is also set ‘decades’ after ZAU, so the world is much more advanced.</p>



<p>Here’s hoping Surgent manages to find a partner to help produce Project Uso.</p>
