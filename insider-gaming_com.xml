<p>That isn’t some fictional, dystopian headline; this is where we’re at right now in gaming peripheral technology. At CES 2026, HyperX and Neurable revealed a collaboration that has given way to an AI-powered, sensor-fitted <strong>neurotechnological gaming headset.</strong> It uses ‘non-invasive sensors’ to read brainwaves and encourage gamers to boost their performance.</p>



<p>The combination of HyperX’s peripheral technology and Neurable’s cognitive monitoring solutions endeavours to give players insights into their real-time brain performance and reduce their reaction times.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260105973259/en/Neurable-Introduces-Neurotechnology-Powered-Gaming-Wearable-Headset-With-HyperX?utm_source=neurable&amp;utm_medium=newsroom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> detailing everything you’d want to know about the HyperX x Neurable gaming headset, some telling tidbits of data were handed out. It was claimed that testing participants resulted in an ‘improved reaction time’ of around 43 milliseconds on average, a number that was made ‘even more pronounced’ by testing the headset with pro esports players.</p>



<p>The CEO of Neurable, Ramses Alcaide, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>HyperX allows us to bring neurotechnology to gamers at a scale we’ve never been able to reach before.</p>



<p>We look forward to the excitement of this strategic relationship, which represents a promising future of gaming, one where understanding your mind becomes as natural as understanding your mechanics. By making brain-computer interfaces (BCI) intuitive and invisible inside the tools players already use, we’re proving that neuroscience can meaningfully elevate performance and transform the way people play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HP’s Josephine Tan echoed the sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve always been about empowering power players with the best technology to play, and now with our strategic collaboration with Neurable, we look forward to giving more insight into how one’s cognitive skills and focus impacts their gameplay to ultimately make them as competitive as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not clear when the HyperX x Neurable headset will make it to market, and it hasn’t been suggested how much such a device would cost.</p>
