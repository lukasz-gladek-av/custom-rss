<p>Master Chief’s voice actor has stated that ‘big news’ is going to arrive during the Halo World Championships, scheduled for October 24. </p>



<p>Several new developments about Halo have surfaced recently. We recently saw a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-studios-veteran-leaves-company-with-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">17-year veteran leave the company</a> with an ominous message. We also saw reports that the Halo CE Remake is being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-developed by a Virtuos Studio</a>. Now, teasers about the Halo World Championship have surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-some-big-news-arriving-at-the-halo-world-championships-in-seattle">Some Big News Arriving at the Halo World Championships in Seattle</h2>



<p>Through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/SteveDownes117/status/1978153135890702578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes teased an announcement for Halo World Championships. He first informed fans that he will be present at the Halo World Championships in Seattle, which is scheduled for October 24 and 25. The juicy part came towards the end of the tweet, where Downes teased “PS: BIG NEWS A’COMIN!!” with eye ball emojis. </p>

<p>We already know that a Halo has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-studios-new-deep-dive-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive scheduled for October 24</a>, as announced on the Halo World Championship blog. We still do not know the timing of this main-stage event, but its live stream has been confirmed. The developers stated earlier that their new entry will be revealed this year —so is that what Steve Downes is teasing, or is it something even bigger? Players will have to wait and see to know for sure. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release is one month away, and the game’s Steam presence is building up energy as the date comes ever closer. It was revealed earlier today by Battlestate Games that Escape from Tarkov now has over 500,000 wishlist spots on Steam, which brings the game one step closer to hitting a successful launch window on the platform.</p>



<p>It marks the first time in history that the core Escape from Tarkov experience will be available on a platform <strong>outside </strong>Battlestate Games’ proprietary launcher and storefront. The post from BSG also confirmed that you can now link your Battlestate Games account to your Steam profile.</p>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-coming-to-steam-soon">Tarkov is Coming to Steam Soon</h2>



<p>It comes as no surprise to learn that Escape from Tarkov has managed to hit 500,000+ wishlists just a couple of weeks after going live on Steam. For a decade, it has been a spearhead extraction shooter that has risen to popularity and sat at the top of the table since 2020.</p>



<p>That’s when the game experienced a boom, attracting hundreds of thousands of players and becoming a staple shooter ever since.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Battlestate Games confirmed that users will need to <strong>own a copy of the game on Steam </strong>to be able to play Tarkov on Steam. That means that if you’ve already purchased a copy of Escape from Tarkov from Battlestate Games, you <strong>won’t </strong>automatically qualify for a copy on Steam when it launches.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Get ready — the release is coming! Mark your calendars for November 15!</p><p>Over 500,000 players have already added Escape from Tarkov to their wishlist: <a href="https://t.co/SgITbg3eGM">https://t.co/SgITbg3eGM</a><br>Thank you for your trust and support!</p><p>You can now link your existing Battlestate Games account to your… <a href="https://t.co/IgzTMnPRLJ">pic.twitter.com/IgzTMnPRLJ</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1978418639540777244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Many are sceptical about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">impending 1.0 release</a> of Escape from Tarkov, as some feel that the game ‘isn’t 1.0 ready’. The version of the game being played now <strong>is not </strong>the version we’ll have when that time comes next month.</p>



<p>Further, there’s quite a bit of negativity surrounding the Steam launch, with naysayers claiming that Battlestate will suffer under the weight of refunds when people buy the game through Steam and lean on the platform’s lenient refund policy to kick it back to Battlestate. </p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be released in full on November 15. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re picking it up on Steam.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Review: Mighty Multiplayer with a Forgettable Campaign]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-review-mighty-multiplayer-with-a-forgettable-campaign.1325281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is the culmination of years of work from several studios flying the Electronic Arts banner. It was seen as a potential resurgence for the series after the lacklustre delivery of 2021’s Battlefield 2042 (and the divisive launch of Battlefield 5 in 2018).</p>



<p>In the run-up to the release of Battlefield 6, players had their expectations stoked by an immensely successful beta period, bolstered by the introduction of Battlefield Labs. The full game is finally in the open, and millions of players are diving head over heels into what is a mixed offering: a magnificent multiplayer platform marred by a pretty catastrophic campaign portion.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Battlefield 6 review.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-dire-campaign-is-carried-by-the-multiplayer-modes">Battlefield 6’s Dire Campaign is Carried by the Multiplayer Modes</h2>



<p>I said many a time before the launch of Battlefield 6 that I was hugely excited to get my hands on the new campaign, given that Battlefield 2042 <strong>didn’t have one</strong>. I love a Battlefield campaign, as in the last decade, they’ve been focused on authentic replications of emotional battles, telling a story beyond the run-and-gun traditions of games like Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Sadly, that’s not what we received in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 campaign is hindered by poor storytelling, a predictable theme, shallow objectives, and a lack of any entertaining depth. It’s a simple thing that can be completed in a few hours, and even hunting for collectables adds almost nothing to the game’s meatiness – or <em>lack of</em>.</p>



<p>It plunges players into the action and doesn’t ever slow down, but the only redeeming feature of the campaign is that there’s plenty to shoot at. It’s a mundane, thoughtless thing that almost always has you pushing through an extremely linear area, gunning down endless sorties of enemies, while heading to a simple objective.</p>



<figure><figcaption>They’re no Bad Company, that’s for sure</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best part of the campaign is a single mission that gives players a semi-open environment to traverse, allowing them a little choice and spreading them further than the linear missions do.</p>



<p>And my <strong>word</strong>, those linear missions <strong>are linear. </strong>If you deviate from your path by a few inches, you’ll be given a timer prompt and ordered back into the fight.</p>



<p>I ultimately found the visuals to be a bit dated, the AI to not have much of a clue, and the gameplay loop seemed like an afterthought. Pick up weapons, gun down enemies, and move to objectives. That’s it.</p>



<p>Look at last year’s Call of Duty offering, Black Ops 6. In that, players had a variety of missions that presented them with sabotage, subterfuge, exploration, and multiple perspectives. The most diversity you get in Battlefield 6 is when you’re thrust into the command of a tank for all of about five minutes.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-battlefield-6-multiplayer-redeems-the-entire-project">The Battlefield 6 Multiplayer Redeems The Entire Project</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is back in the multiplayer aspect, that’s for sure. I strayed from Battlefield with the launch of 2042, opting instead to stick with older titles like Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 5. What has been presented in Battlefield 6 is something phenomenal, and I’m having <strong>a blast</strong>.</p>



<p>From the ground up, Battlefield 6’s multiplayer is a return to form for the series. It’s a cry back to bygone days of the ‘peak’ era represented by Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, and everything from the maps on offer to the spread of classic and new modes has me thoroughly entertained.</p>



<p>There are a few gripes, sure. The TTK feels out of balance, there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-glitches-exploits-ea-working-overtime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than a few glitches</a>, and levelling up weapons is <strong>a grind</strong>, which is why so many XP farms have popped up across Battlefield Portal. But even with all that being said, I’m still having a great time in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Most of my gameplay loop has seen me occupy my time in Breakthrough. I’m a veteran Rush player, and Breakthrough gives me the same vibes while also offering better area control, rather than sitting next to a single MCOM station. I can’t complain about the game’s mechanics, and I haven’t had too many issues with the maps (except for Sobek…).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>I’m loving the open class system, which allows me to level up my weapons across whatever role I want to play. That’s how I play; I adjust to the scenario presented to me and adapt on the fly. If I’m playing as a support gunner and want to switch to an engineer role to tackle vehicles that have shown up, I should be able to keep grinding the same primary weapon – <strong>and I can</strong>.</p>



<p>Even though I no longer have the reflexes or gunny to dominate at Battlefield, I’m having fun in Battlefield 6. It’s a satisfying multiplayer platform that accommodates all kinds of play styles, and it’s highly customizable and considerate. I’ve also played and installed Battlefield 6 on the new ROG Xbox Ally X, and it runs like a dream on there, too.</p>



<p>The only thing I’ve not ventured into is Portal, because I’m led to believe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/">it’s jam-packed with XP farms</a>, and that’s not my kind of thing.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion-don-t-buy-battlefield-6-for-the-campaign">Conclusion: Don’t Buy Battlefield 6 For The Campaign</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 isn’t at all worth it for just the single-player offering, but the multiplayer is enough of a redemption that you should consider picking it up. There’s plenty of juice in the tank where the multiplayer platform is concerned, and Electronic Arts’ studios will keep it plugged full of content for a while. The first season starts before the month is out.</p>



<p>Also, the free-to-play battle royale component is incoming, so if you don’t appreciate either the multiplayer <strong>or </strong>the campaign, you can give that a go and enjoy Battlefield 6 from some perspective without worrying about spending a penny.</p>



<p>I’m more inclined to give Battlefield 6 a higher score when looking at the project holistically, as I feel that multiplayer should have much more weighting than the campaign in a series like this. As Battlefield 6 has a stellar multiplayer platform, I’ll be generous.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-great">Verdict: 4/5 – ‘Great’</h2>

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A continues on the modern trend of Pokémon titles with a huge amount of character customization options, which we’ve explained in full in this guide.</p>



<p>The first big Pokémon launch on Nintendo Switch 2, though it also remains available on the original console, Legends: Z-A follows on from the success of Legends: Arceus and makes a big change to battle mechanics.</p>



<p>There’s also a huge amount of character customization options in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which we’ve broken down in this guide, including covering details on any gender-locked options.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Lots to consider. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</strong> <strong>has a wide array of character customization options, giving you control over your full look and physical features, alongside a host of fashion choices.</strong></p>



<p>Initial character customization in the game covers the general set-up, including choosing a gender, hairstyle, skin tone, eye color, and make-up. Similar to Scarlet and Violet, your physical features are not permanent and can be adjusted in future in any way you choose, aside from skin tone.</p>



<p>In addition to flat hair colors that players have become used to, further customization options include color blocking and balayage. </p>



<p>When exploring Lumiose City, plenty of shops are available to purchase new clothes to shake-up your look, while others are unlocked through story progression and side quests.</p>



<p>We’ve listed all of the available character customization options below, split into physical options and cosmetic options.</p>



<p><strong>Physical Character Customization Options</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Gender</li>



<li>Eye Shape</li>



<li>Eye Color</li>



<li>Eyelash Shape</li>



<li>Eyelash Color</li>



<li>Eyebrow Shape</li>



<li>Eyebrow Color</li>



<li>Beauty Spot</li>



<li>Freckles</li>



<li>Dark Circles</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cosmetic Character Customization Options</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Hairstyle</li>



<li>Hair Color</li>



<li>Tops</li>



<li>Bottoms</li>



<li>Hats</li>



<li>Glasses</li>



<li>Gloves</li>



<li>Socks</li>



<li>Shoes</li>



<li>Jewelry</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>No, there is no customization in Legends: Z-A locked by gender, giving you full freedom in character creation.</strong></p>



<p>Hairstyles are uni-sex, and can be used for either gender, while other customization options like make-up and clothing is also freely available to fit any character. This includes skirts, blouses, and dresses.</p>



<p>This shouldn’t be too surprising, as the change was first made to the franchise with Scarlet and Violet unlocking all clothing and customization options, and should remain the norm for the franchise moving forwards.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X Review—A Powerhouse of Portable Gaming]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review%E2%80%94a-powerhouse-of-portable-gaming.1325215/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is a phenomenal piece of equipment that has a high price tag and a stunning specification, proving once again why ASUS sits at the top of the table in the handheld gaming market. I’ve been trialling a ROG Xbox Ally X for some time, and I’m happy to report that it has ticked all my boxes when it comes to gaming on the go.</p>



<p>Being a veteran of the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X units, I was always going to invest in an Xbox Ally X, but I underestimated how effective the evolution of this device would be. This is a winning handheld that suits me down to the ground, and in this ROG Xbox Ally X review, I’ll help you understand why it’s worth every penny.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-different-from-the-original-rog-ally-x">Is The ROG Xbox Ally X Different from the Original ROG Ally X?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The shell is better, has a custom print, the UI is upgraded, and the buttons have been enhanced.</figcaption></figure>







<p>On paper, it might seem like the core difference is just the name, with the addition of ‘Xbox’ being slipped into the branding. In actuality, things go beyond that, and the ROG Xbox Ally X represents <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rog-xbox-ally-vs-rog-xbox-ally-x-differences-price-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a sizeable overhaul</a> compared to the original Ally X.</p>



<p>The biggest difference is that the ROG Xbox Ally X has an upgraded processor, featuring the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme, compared to the original device’s AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme. This results in more processing power and smoother gameplay, and multitasking.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the memory (24 GB), storage (1 TB), screen (1080p, 120Hz IPS panel), and battery (80Whrs) are all the same.</p>



<p>I’m a <strong>huge </strong>fan of the biggest cosmetic and ergonomic changes to land with the ROG Xbox Ally X. The new device has a shell that might look strange at the beginning, but is actually much more tactile, comfortable, and sensible than the original shell.</p>



<p>It has more of a ‘grip’ built into the shell, and it accommodates larger shoulder and trigger buttons to suit all hand sizes. This grip makes it much more feasible to play games like first-person shooters. For example, I was playing Battlefield 6 on the ROG Xbox Ally X and found that I was almost as capable as I would have been using a traditional controller input.</p>



<p>Other improvements I noticed that aren’t necessarily on paper are the lower operating temperature, even at load, the quieter fans, and what sounds to me like better audio output.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-perform">How Does the ROG Xbox Ally X Perform?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even a brand-new game like Battlefield 6 ran well on the ROG Xbox Ally X</figcaption></figure>







<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X ticked every box for me, as I’ve already said. I ran it through its paces with a series of games, both old and new, and every time, the device left me thoroughly impressed. I played everything from Fallout 4 (2015) to Battlefield 6 (2025). </p>



<p>I spent hours enjoying PowerWash Simulator, and even did what I’d done on the previous ROG Ally X, installing Escape from Tarkov and using the onboard Armory Crate software to remap my inputs to make it playable on a controller.</p>



<p>At every step of the way, the Xbox Ally X kept me entertained. With the 80Wh battery, you can get a few hours of gameplay out of the device, depending on the game you play and the processing level you pick (Silent, Performance, or Turbo). The ports for charging and audio inputs are nicely located, the buttons are responsive and full-sized, and the unit doesn’t weigh so much that it introduces fatigue.</p>



<p>I was wondering how the Xbox integrations would work, and I’m pleased to report that they’re not disruptive or pointless. They’re practical and make it feel more like a gaming handheld than a Windows 11 PC shrunk into a smaller shell.</p>



<p>If I have one gripe, it’s that ASUS strangely switched around the pause/select/Armory Crate/library buttons compared to the Ally X, which meant I was always pressing the wrong button when I tried pausing my game.</p>



<p>At the press of a button, you can open the Xbox Game Bar, fully customizable with widgets. With another press, you’re in the aggregated library function that collates all your games into one place, regardless of launcher or storefront. Using the Xbox UI is a much more welcoming and user-friendly experience than relying on the Windows 11 interface, and even that feels better than ever.</p>



<p>For example, I always had a problem with <strong>typing </strong>on the Ally X, and bringing up the keyboard often felt fiddly and frustrating. With the Xbox Ally X, that’s not the case, and the tweaks applied on a software level are tangible.</p>



<p>This is a phenomenal handheld, and when fused with Xbox, players open up remote play (with Xbox Series consoles) and cloud gaming potential like never before.</p>



<p>It charges quickly, has expandable memory, a lightning-fast processor, and it looks gorgeous on a stand. The RGB touches are neat (again), the glass and frame have survived a few drop tests, and there are plenty of accessories on the market you can use to customize your ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>Sure, it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-pre-order-rog-xbox-ally-rog-xbox-ally-x-us-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has a price tag</a> of an eye-watering $999 (or £799), but in my opinion, it’s worth every penny. If you travel a lot, game on the go, or simply want something smaller to curl up with in bed as the cold winter nights creep in, you’ll want to invest in an ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>To me, this is the best gaming handheld on the market, bar none.</p>
