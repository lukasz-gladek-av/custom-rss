<p>MachineGames posted a new 15th anniversary picture and, in it, showcases a new yet-to-be-announced game.</p>



<p>For 15 years, MachineGames has been crafting some of the best action FPS on the market. From the Nazi-killing bloodbath of Wolfenstein to the historic adventures of Indiana Jones, the team are masters of the craft. With last year’s release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-hands-on-previews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, fans have been waiting to see what’s next from the studio. Fortunately, we now know it is working on something new, thanks to a new celebratory post.</p>



<h2 id="h-machinegames-15th-anniversary-poster-shows-mysterious-next-game">MachineGames’ 15th Anniversary Poster Shows Mysterious Next Game</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/machinegames/status/1976685867235164308?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Twitter/X post</a>, MachineGames revealed a poster celebrating the studio’s 15th anniversary. All of the newest titles, like Wolfenstein: The New Order and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, are there. However, next to Indy is a blocked off box with a question mark. Seeing as Great Circle was the most recent, it seems MachinesGames is hinting it’s currently working on the studio’s next new title. Furthermore, as it’s on the 15th anniversary poster, we could find out what it is before the end of the year.</p>



<p>As for what the next game could be, it’s likely it’ll be either a new Wolfenstein or Indiana Jones. For Wolfenstein, the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/machinegames-new-wolfenstein-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed interest</a> in returning to the series in a recent documentary. With Indiana Jones, the massive success and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-indiana-jones-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push from Disney</a> may have the team invigorated to pick up his whip sooner than later. Still, it could be an entirely new project or IP, seeing as MachineGames has been doing franchise titles for a bit. Either way, it’s clear the studio is almost ready to share it’s next title and, if it’s anything like the others, it’s one to watch out for.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see what MachineGames’ new title is? What do you hope the new game will be? Wolfenstein? Indiana Jones? Something new for its anniversary?

<p>Battlefield 6 has launched, and its all-time player peak on Steam keeps rising by the second, with the number sitting at over 700k at the time of writing, surpassing Call of Duty’s record. </p>



<p>The anticipation for Battlefield 6’s launch has been at an all-time high since the open-beta weekends, where players flocked in huge numbers. However, the beta had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-betas-smaller-maps-were-intentional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smaller maps</a> and fewer features to try out. The full version of BF6 has been released right now, and players are pouring in by the thousands.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-all-time-steam-peak-surpasses-700k-within-the-first-hour">Battlefield 6 All-Time Steam Peak Surpasses 700k Within the First Hour</h2>



<p>As spotted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Battlefield 6’s all-time Steam peak concurrent number sits at 704,005 at the time of writing, and the number keeps going higher every time you refresh the page. That’s not all, Battlefield 6’s launch numbers on Steam have also beaten Call of Duty’s all-time peak, which stands at 491,670. </p>



<p>The game has additionally beaten its all-time peak from the open beta weekends, which sat at 521,000. Moreover, it is just Friday; a whole weekend remains, so the number could go even higher as the days go on. </p>



<p>For those who haven’t checked out the title, Battlefield 6 brings back iconic all-out warfare, where players can wage war with infantry and vehicle combat, including fighter jets, tanks, and more. The game features tactical destruction, where players destroy their surroundings to gain a tactical advantage over their opponents. The title also introduces the new Kinesthetic Combat System, a global-scale campaign, several multiplayer modes, the massive sandbox mode, Portal, and an upcoming battle royale mode. </p>



<p>In other news, the developers of Battlefield 6 have confirmed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not use generative AI</a>. Also, players are already making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-community-is-already-making-star-wars-ships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars ships</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a> in the game’s Portal mode.
