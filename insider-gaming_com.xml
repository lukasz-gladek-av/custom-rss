<p>Wildlight Entertainment’s Highguard has officially been released to the public after a long month of waiting. The multiplayer FPS is available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple platforms</a>, but it’s not always guaranteed that these systems can play alongside one another.</p>



<p>For an online game like Highguard, the matter of crossplay is an important one. Some fans out there will want to raid together with their friends, but if it’s platform-exclusive, that can put a serious dent in their plans.</p>







<p>If you’re unsure of what platform to download Highguard on and whether crossplay will be an issue, then read on: Insider Gaming has all the details you’ll need.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-crossplay">Does Highguard Have Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Breaking down those platform walls. Image via Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Highguard does have Crossplay across all platforms, allowing you to team up with friends across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</strong></p>



<p>Gone are the days when everyone had to play games on the same platform, as it’s common courtesy that multiplayer titles offer crossplay across all platforms—or at least as many as possible. </p>



<p>Highguard is no different, and it should prove to be a great feature going forward to get as many onto the newly-released shooter as possible. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-cross-progression">Does Highguard Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Your noble steed. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, cross-progression remains unconfirmed for Highguard, meaning your progress will probably be limited to one platform. </strong></p>



<p>That makes choosing your starting platform especially important. You won’t want to unlock cosmetics and gear for your Wardens, only to lose them if you decide to play somewhere else. </p>







<p>This could easily change in the future, as it has done for plenty of other titles in the past. If you’re hoping for a cross-progression announcement for Highguard, look nowhere else than Insider Gaming, as this article will be updated as soon as anything changes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Roadmap Reveals An Entire Year of Content Plans]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/</link>
            <guid>1416637</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wildlight Entertainment has officially released Highguard, a ‘new breed of shooter’, and by all accounts, it’s doing pretty well for itself. It follows a month of radio silence after the game was unveiled at The Game Awards in December. Earlier today, the team at Wildlight shared a massive, one-year-long roadmap packed with seven episodes of content.</p>



<p>The post-launch spree looks great on the surface, but time will tell if the player counts remain high enough for the delivery to matter. For now, there’s enough meat on the bones to get prospective fans very excited about what’s coming.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-2026-roadmap-has-content-drops-every-month">Highguard 2026 Roadmap Has Content Drops Every Month</h2>



<p>The surprising thing about Highguard’s 2026 roadmap is that there’s a content drop planned <strong>every single month</strong>. This isn’t the most standard approach for live-service games, but Wildlight obviously has immense stock in what it has created to reveal so much, so early. We’ve got content stacked in the pipeline way up until December.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It all begins with the game’s launch, but the second episode of content will hit in just <strong>two weeks</strong>. It’ll bring a new Warden (read: hero character), a fresh map, <strong>Ranked Mode</strong>, and a new mount, expanding on the bear, horse, and panther that already exist. The second part of that episode will drop in March, bringing a new <strong>base</strong> and a raid tool.</p>



<p>The difference between a map and a base? A Base is what you defend <strong>on </strong>the map, selecting it from a lineup of options when the match kicks off. This is the end zone of a match, and it’s the ultimate objective. The ‘map’ is the environment upon which you play… Simple?</p>



<p>Highguard’s roadmap expands further throughout the year.</p>



<p>There’s a new Warden coming every second month, as well as new bases, following that same launch pattern. We’ll get new maps in Highguard in June and October, and a special, limited-time mode is in the book for July. October and December yield ‘surprise’ events, and in terms of equipment, players can expect a hefty assortment to arrive as the year unfolds.</p>



<p>For instance, a new <strong>weapon </strong>will be added to Highguard in April, June, August, and October, while new <strong>amulets </strong>will appear in May, July, September, and November. Mods will be added in April, June, August, October, and December, and a new <strong>raid tool </strong>is coming in March <strong>only</strong>.</p>



<p>New loot items will be published in Highguard in May and September.</p>



<p>Oh, and all the content is <strong>entirely free</strong>.</p>



<p>This is a pretty dense roadmap, but time will tell how the delivery of it fares.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard File Sizes On PS5, Xbox Series X|S & PC—How Much Space Does Highguard Need?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-file-sizes-ps5-xbox-pc/</link>
            <guid>1416631</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s here, Highguard is out. The electric and innovative first-person shooter is raiding bases all over PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. If you plan to download the game, check out the Highguard file sizes.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-times-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> has gone from being the quietest and most unmarketed shooter in history to one of the most intriguing shooters of 2026. Backed by a team of world-class devs, Highguard exudes a premium vibe. You’d think it would be optimized with lower file sizes, and this would be good for all hard drives.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-file-size-on-playstation-5-explained">Highguard File Size On PlayStation 5, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Good memory. Image via Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard only requires 20.13 GB for its initial file size on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>We can’t believe it as much as you can. A brand-new, fast-moving online shooter only requiring 20 GB at launch? It’s unheard of, and it’s magnificent. More games need to be better optimized at launch, and communities shouldn’t have to choose between certain games on limited storage space.</p>



<p>PS5 owners, get downloading, and forget about deleting games to have Highguard on your console.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-file-size-on-xbox-series-x-s-explained">Highguard File Size On Xbox Series X|S, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The Xbox file size for Highguard is 21.09 GB, keeping in line with the PlayStation.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox just can’t catch a break, can it? PlayStation is even winning in terms of Highguard optimization! Only joking, but this is more good news overall. Highguard is a supreme spectacle, and if this only requires 21 GB on a powerful Xbox Series X|S, then other games probably need to take a look in the mirror.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-file-size-on-pc-amp-steam-explained">Highguard File Size On PC &amp; Steam, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>PC and Steam users need a measly 20.65 GB of space to have Highguard installed.</strong></p>



<p>That’s pretty much a big tick for all three platforms. 20 GB or so is needed for Highguard at launch. Obviously, more content will be added down the line, and the initial file size will increase. For now, enjoy the first-person shooter taking up a tiny chunk of storage space.</p>



<p>Are you happy with Highaurd’s file size across major platforms? Do we need to get away from the days of 50-100 GB games sapping precious storage space? It’s mostly rhetorical, but still let the IG community know your thoughts on this through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop/</link>
            <guid>1416568</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been an usual couple of months for Wildlight Entertainment’s Highguard, mostly in part to the constant abuse the game has recieved for its lack of marketing since its The Game Awards announcement.</p>



<p>But now, we know why.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop">It was Meant to be a Shadowdrop</h2>



<p>During a behind-the-scenes presentation with press and creators, Vice President of Product and Publishing Jason Torfin and Lead Designer Mohammed Alavi sat down with attendees of the event to answer questions. </p>



<p>As expected, one of the main questions was around the games marketing, or should we say lack thereof, and that’ss because the game was always intended to follow a similar release to Apex Legends; a shadowdrop. However, sometime in 2025, The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley put a spanner in the works because he was stoked for the game and wanted to reveal it.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – Complete Highguard Trophy L</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/">ist—How To Get All Achievements &amp; Trophies<br></a></strong><br>Speaking at the event (thanks <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/01/26/highguard-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>) on the original plans, Tofin said, “I think the fact that we’re independent and that we’re smart with how we run our business and build our team means that we have those luxuries. We’re not beholden to shareholders or any sort of other corporate shenanigans, and it allows us to have that sort of confidence. And from the get-go, you can’t bank on commercial success right out of the gate. If you do that, you’re probably going to fail most of the time.”</p>







<p>“And that’s why we were going to shadow drop.” he said “Let the game speak for itself. It was always the plan. And then, you know, Geoff came in the past year and he played the game. I mean, he really liked it and he was stoked. And we had an opportunity and we decided, okay, we can make a trailer that would be in our shadow-drop. And so the one we put there [at The Game Awards] was the one that would be the first thing you saw in the shadow-drop, followed by twenty-five minutes of other context. And unfortunately, that trailer wasn’t meant to be the thing to ‘educate’.” </p>

</p></figure>



<p>So, there you have it. Highguard’s marketing wasn’t bad persay, it just changed on a whim and kind of shot themselves in the foot for a couple of months.</p>



<p>It explains why past rumours said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard wasn’t a paid placement</a>, despite it being the show’s last trailer (something traditionally reserved for the absolute best stuff). It simply was because Geoff Keighley liked it… Case closed!</p>



<p>Whether it means the game is good or not is another story… I guess only time will tell!</p>
