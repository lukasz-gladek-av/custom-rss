            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite has a staggeringly long list of skins introduced over the years, ranging from original creations to huge collabs, and some have become extremely rare heading into 2026 after a long wait for a return to the Item Shop.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has selected eight of the rarest skins that Epic Games should have near the top of the list to return at some point in 2026, so keep an eye in the Item Shop for these appearances.</p>







<h2 id="h-rarest-fortnite-skins-that-need-to-return">Rarest Fortnite Skins That Need to Return</h2>



<h3 id="h-travis-scott">Travis Scott</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Heavily-requested. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>There seems to be murmurs of Travis Scott’s long-awaited return to the Item Shop every month, but fans are still waiting for the Icon Series Outfit to return, a wait that has gone beyond 2,000 days.</p>



<p>August 2020 was the last time that the Travis Scott skin was available in Fortnite, an audaciously long time for such an iconic look and community-requested skin, but there’s high hopes that 2026 is the year of a return.</p>



<h3 id="h-kratos">Kratos</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Pray to the Gods. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Kratos Gaming Legends Series Outfit is regularly cited among the favorites that players are desperate to see return to the Item Shop, but the God of War giant has not made an appearance since March 2021.</p>



<p>2026 is a huge year for the God of War franchise, with murmurs of the next game in the series due to release on PlayStation in the window, and filming for the Amazon TV series set to begin, so it’s the perfect time for Kratos to return.</p>



<h3 id="h-reflex">Reflex</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Strange absence. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although perhaps not as eye-catching as some of the other skins on this list, particularly with the huge collabs waiting to be seen, the absence of the Reflex outfit from the Item Shop is staggering, and it stands as one of the rarest skins in all of Fortnite.</p>



<p>The Reflex skin last appeared in March 2019, which was only it’s second appearance in the Item Shop after an initial release in November 2018, and those limited appearances have made the outfit extremely rare.</p>



<h3 id="h-mike-lowrey">Mike Lowrey</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Bad Boys. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>An iconic face from the Bad Boys franchise, Mike Lowrey was initially introduced in Chapter 2, Season 7 in 2021, and made several appearances in the Item Shop that year, but has not appeared since.</p>



<p>All of the appearances of the Mike Lowrey outfit in the Item Shop came in the release year, but a reapparance of the collab skin could be on the agenda for 2026 as discussions about a new movie continue to ramp up.</p>



<h3 id="h-marcus-fenix">Marcus Fenix</h3>



<figure><figcaption>E-Day. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another Icon of the Gaming Series, the Marcus Fenix skin, quite frankly, has to return in 2026, in a year that is set to be huge for the Gears of War franchise with the release of Gears of War: E-Day, a prequel title set 15 years before the original game.</p>



<p>Themed around the older version of the beloved character seen in the latter games of the franchise, there could be scope for a new skin to tie into E-Day in 2026 but, even so, the existing Marcus Fenix skin needs to appear, with the last occurence in the Item Shop coming in December 2022.</p>



<h3 id="h-aloy">Aloy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Horizon. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s a bit of a trend existing for collabs in the Gaming Icon Series not appearing in the Item Shop regularly, which also extends to Aloy, the face of PlayStation’s Horizon franchise. Compared to others on the list, a last appearance in March 2023 pales, but it’s still too long of a wait for an iconic look.</p>



<p>The future of the Horizon franchise looks promising, with the next game in the series surely on the cards alongside a big Hollywood adaptation, and Sony may be holding off for future releases before allowing Aloy to feature again.</p>



<h3 id="h-lebron-james">LeBron James</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The King. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most famous sports players to have ever lived, LeBron James’ Fortnite skin has not been available since April 2023, and the return is eagerly anticipated due a different approach for the skin that provides unlockable cosmetics.</p>



<p>Purchasing the skin unlocks a series of Quests to complete, with two additional styles, giving players more bang for their V-Bucks when compared to other skins.</p>



<h3 id="h-leon-s-kennedy">Leon S. Kennedy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Permanent Resident. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>The iconic face of the Resident Evil franchise surely has to return in 2026, right? Given there’s a big release around the corner for the series in February, heavily rumored to have another appearance from Leon himself, it would be the perfect time for the skin to return.</p>



<p>Players have not been able to purchase the Leon S. Kennedy skin in Fortnite since April 2023, just a month after its initial release in March of the same year.</p>

<p>For years, fans of the high-octane gun-fu franchise, John Wick, have been crying out for a decent game tied to the series. The nature of the film franchise almost writes itself as a video game, but despite a couple of low-budget titles, nothing has really emerged in the space.</p>



<p>During a recent earnings call, Lionsgate Chairman Adam Fogelson confirmed that a ‘AAA John Wick game’ is in development and will be officially announced soon. He also mentioned that a new ‘SAW’ game is also incoming, the first since 2010’s SAW II: Flesh and Blood.</p>







<h2 id="h-john-wick-game-could-be-coming-soon">John Wick Game Could Be Coming Soon</h2>



<p>The recent earnings call at Lionsgate gave way to a solid revelation, and soon, we’ll have an official announcement of an all-new John Wick game <strong>and </strong>a SAW project. In a snippet pulled from the earnings call, Adam Fogelson, Chairman at Lionsgate, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities. around John Wick and Saw and some others that we’ll be announcing soon.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/aaa-john-wick-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>It was further mentioned that Lionsgate has acknowledged the ‘increased interest’ fans have in adaptations of the popular franchises under its belt, like <strong>John Wick</strong>.</p>



<p>What’s not clear is what a John Wick AAA game could look like. It’s up in the air, and fans are eagerly debating the possibilities, such as an extension of John Wick’s story, played out by Keanu Reeves, or a unique, original story that allows players to create their own diehard assassin character.</p>



<p>Being frank, it’s most likely the latter possibility, as this would allow the developers much more creative freedom, both in terms of the story and the setting.</p>



<p>Fans then set about pulling apart the rest of Lionsgate’s line-up, surmising what other IP could be yanked into the video game world. One concept saw The Hunger Games emerge as an all-new battle royale game or a dystopian, post-apocalyptic epic of sorts.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 ROM Keys Leak Raises Jailbreaking Concerns]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-rom-keys-leak-jailbreaking-concerns-claim/</link>
            <guid>1395730</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recent claims have surfaced on social media suggesting that PlayStation 5’s ‘ROM keys’ have been obtained and leaked online. If the claims are accurate, it means that jailbreakers will now have a cakewalk of a time busting into the console’s operating systems. This has been reported as an ‘unpatchable issue’ that brings users one step closer to securing jailbroken PS5 consoles.</p>



<p>Later posts in the social space suggested that a new exploit surfaced tied to Star Wars Racer Revenge. The limited edition disc for the game is reportedly the trigger for the leak, but the technology behind it all is pretty complex.</p>







<h2 id="h-has-ps5-been-jailbroken">Has PS5 Been Jailbroken?</h2>



<p>On January 2, claims started surfacing online suggesting dire implications for Sony. It was said that PS5 ROM keys had been leaked online, presenting a major and irreversible security concern for the brand. As explained in an article penned by The Cybersec Guru:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the final hours of 2025, reports began flooding the internet that the&nbsp;<strong>PlayStation 5 ROM Keys</strong>—the deepest, most protected layer of the console’s security architecture—have been leaked.</p>



<p>This is not a kernel exploit that can be patched with a firmware update. This is the hardware root of trust. And it is out in the wild.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The leak has allegedly uncovered the BootROM code for the PlayStation 5, specifically the disc-based version of the console. As The Cybersec Guru <a href="https://thecybersecguru.com/news/ps5-rom-keys-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a>, ‘If you have the keys to the BootROM, you effectively own the hardware.’</p>



<p>On socials, some of the biggest names in the console modding and jailbreaking scene emerged to corroborate the leak. One user by the name of Gezine gave some technical context to the situation:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>mast1core based on disc game CUSA03474<br>This was the 12.00 dup exploit that was teased.</p><p>Will release code after polishing more.</p><p>Happy new year scene <a href="https://t.co/mskPXHQQ0b">pic.twitter.com/mskPXHQQ0b</a></p></div>— Gezine (@gezine_dev) <a href="https://twitter.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>From what we know, the potential leak of the PS5 ROMs doesn’t mean that jailbroken consoles will start popping up online, as there are other security thresholds for jailbreakers to contend with, but this certainly is a foot in the door.</p>



<p>At the time of publishing, no publicly accessible repository appears to contain the leaked code or data, and neither Sony nor the PlayStation brand channels have addressed the claims.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splitgate Has Fumbled Again and Failed to Secure Any Traction Following ‘Rebrand’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-failed-secure-traction-fumbled-again/</link>
            <guid>1395721</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splitgate has had a rough couple of years. From the support ending on the more successful first title to the second game launching amid a wave of controversies, the problems for 1047 Games and their portal-toting shooter began very early on. Following a catastrophic downfall, the team ‘relaunched’ Splitgate 2 under a new identity, but that too has proven to be a failure.</p>



<p>What was once dubbed the game that would ‘make FPS great again’ has been reduced to a title on life support. Only a few hundred people are playing on some platforms, nobody is interested in watching the game on streaming sites, and the sentiments are lower than ever.</p>







<h2 id="h-splitgate-arena-reloaded-is-collapsing">Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is Collapsing</h2>



<p>On December 17, 1047 Games released Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, a rebrand of Splitgate 2, which was initially released in June to a disappointing reception and several damning scandals.</p>



<p>In July, Splitgate 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/">pulled back to beta</a> as player counts imploded. The game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-analysis-condemns-tone-deaf-influencer-campaign/">creator-backed marketing</a> campaign was criticized, insanely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-drops-fans-concerned-microtransactions/">expensive microtransactions</a> surfaced, and two rounds of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developer-holds-another-round-of-layoffs/">layoffs were held</a> in just six weeks.</p>



<p>Following a series of tests, 1047 Games revealed that Splitgate 2 would be overhauled with a fresh identity, becoming known as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. The relaunch of the game pulled in a few thousand players at best on some platforms, but any traction that was secured has already dissipated.</p>



<p>It’s impossible to know how well the game is doing on console platforms, but we can extrapolate based on the data we <strong>do </strong>have.</p>



<p>On Steam, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded hit 2,297 players on December 17 when the rebrand hit. At the time of publishing, only 390 players were exploring Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on Steam.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>While some of the more recent reviews stressed positivity about the changes applied to the game, the underlying concept is one of ‘too little, too late’.</p>



<p>Additionally, the game boasted a viewer count of just 134 users on Twitch at the time of writing. That’s a mighty comedown from the all-time high of 138,110 viewers. Put simply, nobody is interested in watching <strong>or </strong>playing Splitgate: Arena Reloaded.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#936)—Clues and Answers for Friday, January 2]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-2-936/</link>
            <guid>1395718</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>How has your 2026 started? We’re only one day in, but hopefully things have kicked off how you wanted them to. There’s plenty of year ahead, but as always, it begins with you smashing another NYT Connections puzzle! Today, I’m here with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions you need to get your day started the right way.</p>



<p>Read on to find out today’s answers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-2">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 2)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #936:</p>



<ul>
<li>HIVE</li>



<li>ROUTINE</li>



<li>RECORD</li>



<li>NUMBER</li>



<li>LOG</li>



<li>STANDARD</li>



<li>BIT</li>



<li>JOT</li>



<li>QUASH</li>



<li>BAR</li>



<li>NOTE</li>



<li>EEK</li>



<li>METRIC</li>



<li>GAG</li>



<li>ALE</li>



<li>EXAMPLE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of <strong>quick ways to capture information</strong>, whether you’re scribbling something down, keeping track of events, or making a brief reminder for later. Each word here is something you might <strong>produce</strong> when you’re trying to preserve a thought or detail.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – These are all words you’d use to describe a <strong>comic performer’s signature move</strong>, the little recurring bits that make their act recognizable. Whether it’s a short joke, a recurring segment, or a whole comedic persona, each term fits into the world of <strong>stage routines and comedic gimmicks</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>This set is all about <strong>measuring against a reference point</strong>. These words describe the things we use to judge quality, performance, or expectations — the <strong>yardsticks</strong> that define what’s typical, acceptable, or exemplary</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each of these looks strange at first glance, but imagine a <strong>common vegetable with its first letter chopped off</strong>. Once you mentally restore that missing initial, the original produce item becomes obvious.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 2:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-january-2-936">NYT Connections Answers for Today, January 2 (#936)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– JOT, LOG, NOTE, RECORD</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BIT, GAG, NUMBER, ROUTINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BAR, EXAMPLE, METRIC, STANDARD</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
