<p>Fallout New Vegas and Horizon Zero Dawn lead writer John Gonzalez has announced he will be retuning to Obsidian after 14 years. </p>



<p>The announcement came via his LinkedIn profile, where he was quick to shoot down impending rumours of Fallout New Vegas 2, by simply saying, “No, it’s not Fallout: New Vegas 2.”</p>



<p>As for what Gonzalez is working on remains to be seen and could ride on the success of the studios next two upcoming games, Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2. If tremendously successful, he could be working on a future sequel.</p>



<p>However, Obsidian Entertainment has also released some stellar games in the past few years, including Pentiment, Pillars of Eternity, and Grounded, so he could also be working on a sequel to those, or a new IP entirely. But for now, all we know if that he’s not working on New Vegas 2… Apparently.</p>



<p>What do you think Gonzalez is working on? Would you like to see a Fallout: New Vegas 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Far Cry: New Dawn, the 2019 post-apocalyptic title, is getting a 60 FPS update on both Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 platforms. Fans of the franchise were quick to point out how ‘random’ the update is, with some stressing that other Ubisoft titles are in sore need of similar attention from the developer.</p>



<p>It was recently confirmed that on February 4, Far Cry: New Dawn will land on the Game Pass subscription service, which could go some way to explaining the performance upgrade.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-smoother-is-better">Smoother is Better</h2>



<p>It has taken six years, but Ubisoft is finally getting around to upgrading one of the most underrated Far Cry games ever made.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the franchise, and New Dawn was a welcome addition to the series. Given that I love anything rooted in a post-apocalyptic environment, it made sense that New Dawn spoke to me quite nicely. </p>



<p>It’s set in the aftermath of Far Cry 5, which sees the player plunged into a bunker as nuclear war erupts across the world. What emerges after the bombs have fallen is something incredible – a world taken over by nature, roving bandit gangs, and settlements of survivors trying to get by.</p>



<p>It’s far outside the standard expectations of the Far Cry series, and it’s a twist on the post-apocalyptic vibe like no other. This isn’t a drab, woeful world like the ones portrayed in Fallout or Metro, for instance. It’s bursting with colour, representing an oversaturated take on the end of the world.</p>



<p>The 60 FPS upgrade on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 is a welcome thing, and it might be enough to pull me back in for another loop around the game when it lands on Game Pass next week.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1885437595527557264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft announced</a> that ‘this wasn’t how (they) planned’ to reveal the upgrade. They had to cut off ‘FPS Boost’ on Xbox consoles to roll out the change, and assuming that players would notice that, they were forced to make the announcement early.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98overwatch-is-dead-and-gone%E2%80%99-ninja-thinks-marvel-rivals-has-killed-the-competition.1097709/</guid>

<p>As Marvel Rivals has gone from strength to strength, the game’s main competitor – Overwatch – has floundered. Since being released by NetEase in December, Marvel Rivals has taken the gaming world by storm, racking up tens of millions of players and sitting proudly atop social and streaming charts worldwide.</p>



<p>Overwatch 2 is struggling by comparison. From concerns about the game’s player count to the lack of meaningful updates, the hero shooter that once stood atop the genre is imploding.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-overwatch-2-launch-was-abysmal">‘The Overwatch 2 Launch Was Abysmal’</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, Ninja broke down the state of play for Marvel Rivals and Overwatch. He stressed that Overwatch 2 has been in a pit since it was released in October 2022, which is accurate. It was seen by many as being ‘Overwatch 1.5’, and even a pivot to a free-to-play operating model didn’t do much to revive the game’s prospects.</p>



<p>He referenced the Overwatch 2 launch being ‘abysmal’ and then went in against the game, stressing that Marvel Rivals is taking over right now.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Overwatch is dead and gone.</p>



<p>It’s so unfortunate. Here’s the thing — first off, they already have a new map coming, which is incredible. Second, they have so much lore and so many heroes and villains and anti-heroes that they have enough for updates for the next ten years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hero shooter space is booming right now. Marvel Rivals is in a league of its own, but fans of the genre are still enjoying and anticipating the imminent arrival of Valve’s Deadlock, which has received global praise from some of the biggest streamers in the business.</p>



<p>VALORANT, a hero shooter with a serious esports ecosystem, is also enjoying rampant growth and popularity.</p>

<p>The Halo Championship Series is back for another season through 2025, and recently, Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) revealed the full schedule, format, and team breakdown for the year ahead. There’s a stacked roadmap for the HCS 2025 circuit, including four Major events and a $1 million world championship tournament.</p>

<p>The Halo Championship Series 2025 schedule is comprised of two ‘splits’, each one containing two Major tournaments:</p>



<p><strong>Split 1</strong></p>

<p>On March 29, FaZe Kaysan will be hosting a one-day invitational LAN with a $50,000 prize pool to help kick off events and pull viewership into the HCS 2025 ecosystem. This event will feature the talents of FaZe Clan, OpTic Gaming, Shopify Rebellion, and Spacestation. </p>



<h2 id="h-hcs-2025-teams">HCS 2025 Teams</h2>



<p>This year has seen a shake-up in the teams competing in the HCS. Recently, the likes of Sentinels and Quadrant withdrew from the Halo Championship Series, leaving TSM and Shopify Rebellion to step up into the fight.</p>

<p>Techland recently surfaced all over social media to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. In 2015, the first game was released, introducing a high-octane, intense zombie-slaying title to the world, and it quickly became known as one of the best games in the genre. In 2022, Techland followed up with Dying Light 2: Stay Human, a live-service title that’s going strong today.</p>



<p>As part of the celebration, the team at Techland published a video packed with stats, including a juicy one – <strong>45 million players </strong>have been through the Dying Light universe since 2015.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-populated">Populated</h2>



<p>In a promotional video posted on social media, Techland revealed that across two games, more than 45 million players have entered the Dying Light universe.</p>



<p>Collectively, they’ve played 1.1 billion hours of Dying Light and have killed more than 75 billion zombies – ‘9 times the world population’. By utilising the franchise’s fluid and advanced movement mechanics, players have made the equivalent of <strong>41 trips to the sun and back </strong>on foot.</p>



<p>Dying Light is well known for its aggressive and visceral combat engine, and with that in mind, more than 20.3 billion zombies have been beheaded by players in the last decade. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Since the release of the original Dying Light, we have been blessed with the best fans in the world. So it’s only right that we recognize you. Watch our summary video that shows off all the craziest feats you have achieved in those 10 years!

</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DyingLight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DyingLight</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DyingLight2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DyingLight2</a></p></article></div>







<p>There’s plenty more to come this year. In the summer, players will get their hands on Dying Light: The Beast, a standalone title that sees the return of Kyle Crane, played by Roger Craig Smith. I had the pleasure of catching up with the iconic actor at Gamescom 2024, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/">we spoke about his role</a> in the upcoming open-world zombie game.</p>



<p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Dying Light, Techland has rolled out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/">a series of events and special offers</a> across the universe, present in both Dying Light and Dying Light 2.</p>

<p>The Carolina Royal Ravens have had an unexpected start to the 2025 Call of Duty League season. The squad has put up some impressive numbers since day dot, floating around the top of the CDL standings and knocking the biggest teams in the business down a peg. It all started with a 3 – 0 win over Atlanta FaZe, a feat that any team hadn’t achieved for more than 500 days.</p>



<p>However, FaZe retaliated with a win against the Ravens in the GF of the first CDL Minor. At the Madrid Major, which is unfolding now, the Royal Ravens have kicked off a dominant run through the elimination bracket, after being pushed down into the depths by the LA Thieves.</p>

<p>In the opening round of the elimination bracket, the Carolina Royal Ravens decimated the Vegas Falcons, producing a 3 – 0 scoreline that included a dramatic reverse sweep in the round of Search. Many have praised the Falcons for their resilience, but the lack of mental composure during much-needed clutch moments is becoming an issue.</p>



<p>Following that round, the Royal Ravens soared onwards, clashing with OpTic Texas, previously the favourite to win the Madrid Major. OpTic managed to close out just one map – the opening Hardpoint. That was as close as close could be, with the scoreline settling at 248 – 250 in Carolina’s favour.</p>



<p>From there, it was a sweep for the Royal Ravens, with the remaining maps including a 3 – 0 wash over OpTic Texas on Protocol Control.</p>



<p>There were concerns about the resilience of the Carolina Royal Ravens following the opening loss against LAT. It was revealed that Reece ‘Vivid’ Drost has an eye injury that he’s dealing with, but regardless of that, he has been frying in-game.</p>



<p>The Royal Ravens will now need to contend with the likes of Toronto Ultra or Atlanta FaZe, two formidable teams that have had a brilliant season thus far. It took a while for Atlanta FaZe to get the wheels turning, but the squad now sits on a solid win streak of nine matches – including a win at the first CDL Minor.</p>



<p>It’s anyone’s game right now, and the $150,000 grand prize is lying in wait for whoever has the talent to secure it.</p>
