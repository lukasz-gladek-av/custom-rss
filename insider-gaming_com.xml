            <title><![CDATA[CS2 Transfer Market ‘Out of Control’, apEX Declares]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-transfer-market-out-of-control/</link>
            <guid>1404724</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Vitality’s award-winning IGL, Dan ‘apEX’ Madesclaire, has voiced <strong>strong concerns </strong>about the state of the Counter-Strike 2 transfer market. He has argued that the current pricing climate has made roster changes (especially meaningful ones) almost <strong>impossible </strong>for most organizations in the space.</p>



<p>In the wake of the HLTV Award Show, during which apEX secured an award for IGL of the Year, he suggested that even the biggest organizations in Counter-Strike are being priced out of making key moves.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-the-counter-strike-market">What’s Wrong with the Counter-Strike Market?</h2>



<p>According to apEX, the financial expectations around player buyouts have reached a critical point. Even well-funded organizations can’t engage, and teams that want to ‘shake things up’ simply can’t. They’re backing off because quotes are ‘completely unrealistic’.</p>



<p>He also stated that the Counter-Strike esports ecosystem doesn’t generate enough revenue to justify skyrocketing buyout demands that have surged in the last year.</p>



<p>Here’s the full quote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>So many teams wanted to make a change, I guess, but they couldn’t. The transfer market is crazy. The prices are “What the f**k is going on?” In CS, we don’t make enough money to make changes, all those prizes are crazy. That’s why we hear nothing from NAVI, no MOUZ as well, who wanted to shuffle, I’m pretty sure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/75019-apex-cs2-transfer-market-is-crazy-the-prices-are-on-what-the-f-k-is-going-on-level" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escore</a> for the quote</em>)</p>



<p>ApEX explained that the quiet offseason and the lack of transfers can be attributed specifically to this issue.</p>



<p>The looming shadow over the market remains Team Falcons, the Saudi-backed organization that has the largest coffers in the esports world. In the last few years, the company has soared in the competitive gaming space, buying out killer squads in multiple games.</p>



<p>But even Team Falcons neglected to make any changes during the winter freeze. If Team Falcons is hesitating, then the pricing issue must be <strong>extreme</strong>.</p>



<p>ApEX’s comments reflect the growing concern amongst players that the CS2 transfer market is overheating. If buyout quotes continue to rise faster than team revenues do on a comparative scale, the top organizations willbe forced to delay or abandon roster plans and rebuilds.</p>

<p>EA has announced that it is delaying the start of Battlefield 6 Season 2.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s official subreddit, EA revealed that Season 2 for both Battlefield 6 and Battlefield REDSEC will now start on February 17. Originally, the next season was expected to begin on January 21.</p>







<p><strong>“During our ongoing development, we’ve continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2,” </strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1qbv6tf/battlefield_6_and_redsec_season_1_january_update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA said</a> in their statement.</p>



<p>They continued: <strong>“Season 1 will be extended past its in-game end date of January 20, and we will launch Season 2 on February 17. The Season 1 extension update to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will be released on January 20, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season 1 Battle Pass until the start date of Season 2.</strong>“</p>







<p>With this delay, EA is giving players a new “Frostfire Bonus Path” starting on January 27. This new path includes new customization rewards along with XP boosts. Free rewards from the path include Hardware XP Boost, a Vehicle Skin and player card customization items. Those with the Battle Pass can get a new weapon package and career XP boost. </p>



<p><strong>“Unlike previous Bonus Paths, all Bonus Path Points for the Frostfire Bonus Path are earned through Weekly Challenges; there are no Bonus Challenges associated with this Bonus Path.,”</strong> EA says.</p>
