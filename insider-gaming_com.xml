<p>Escape from Tarkov fans are neck-deep in the Labyrinth, an all-new map added as a surprise during the latest in-game event. It has been dubbed one of the best things Battlestate Games has ever done, and despite it being an insane challenge, it has pleased a vast portion of the player base.</p>



<p>Following the successful rollout of the Labyrinth event, the next major Escape from Tarkov change could be something very different and <strong>seriously </strong>drastic. It doesn’t <strong>seem like </strong>it could be an April Fool’s joke, either.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bold-changes">Bold Changes</h2>



<p>On the Tarkov community forum, user ‘my89user’ made a suggestion a week ago about <a href="https://tarkov.community/posts/2407/boss-spawn-rotation-and-hot-loot-rotation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">how bosses and loot could work</a>. They proposed a rotating schedule that would see certain maps adopt a 100% boss spawn rate for a few days before rotating to the next map, and so on.</p>



<p>They also proposed that ‘hot loot’ map rotations could be introduced as well. Each week, a designated map would have a 50% increased loot pool for high-value items.</p>



<p>By doing this, the hope is that certain maps become targets for players more focused on PvP and high XP runs, while other maps would quiet down and offer a lower chance of running into bosses and geared players.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the ‘Lead of Game Design’ accepted the suggestion as ‘Planned’ and said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Good idea, I think we will do it after the ‘Labyrinth’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The suggestion had secured 441 votes before it was accepted by the team at Battlestate Games, and the feedback was mostly positive.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is in a tentative place right now. It’s no big secret that the game still has an issue with cheaters, but the Labyrinth event has been such a rampant success that players have overlooked that for the time being.</p>



<p>In a couple of months, we’ll likely be shaping up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">next <strong>wipe</strong> in Tarkov</a>. That doesn’t affect me, though, as I’m a PvE main… Yes, <em>I know</em>.</p>



<p>Do you think this change would be a win in Escape from Tarkov? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, the CEO of the developer behind Helldivers 2 sat down to talk about the last year of success, growth, and the struggles that the game went through to hit lofty peaks. Arrowhead had a tumultuous year in 2024, and from a stint of review bombing to being nominated for prestigious awards, it was nothing short of an intense twelve months.</p>



<p>It was revealed by Shams Jorjani, the CEO of Arrowhead, that an influx of ‘unintended’ players from so many different communities left the team scratching their heads over how to respond.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-different-voices-screaming">‘Different Voices Screaming’</h2>



<p>During a chat with The Game Business’ Christropher Dring, Shams Jorjani walked through the last year at Arrowhead. He stepped in to secure the CEO role less than a year ago, picking up the position when things were looking awry for Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>He explained that it was thanks to a constant stream of meaningful updates that the paltry user score of 19% was able to flip entirely to 94% in a matter of weeks. Eventually, Helldivers 2 became one of the most popular and awarded games of 2024.</p>



<p>One interesting tidbit came when Jorjani was talking about the audience that gravitated towards Helldivers 2 and how diverse it was. I can’t say for sure where he got his numbers from, but he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We did not make Helldivers for <strong>six million Call of Duty players</strong>. We absolutely didn’t. But six million Call of Duty players bought our game. And they are interested in different things compared to, say, the audience that comes from Escape From Tarkov or Arma, which were some of our more influential games.</p>



<p>The summer of pain, or whatever we want to call it, was painful in part because it was hard for us to reconcile how to stay true to the studio fundamentals, while dealing with the business realities of having <strong>so many different voices screaming at us</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Helldivers 2 turned out to be a strong success for Arrowhead, even if it took one heck of a journey to get there. In January, it was confirmed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dev-next-game-concept/">concept for the next game</a> for the studio was being fleshed out, but nobody knows what that’ll look like.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zenimax-union-vote-authorizes-strike-against-microsoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ZeniMax Workers United, a union representing over 300 quality assurance workers in both Maryland and Texas, have voted to authorize a strike against the company. </p>



<p>In an announcement on Tuesday, it was revealed that nearly 95% of votes were in favor of authorization.</p>



<div><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A Microsoft spokesperson has provided the following statement to Insider Gaming regarding the strike authorization vote: </p><p><em><strong>“Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love. We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable&nbsp;resolution that acknowledges the teams’&nbsp;contributions. </strong></em></p><p>“<em><strong>There&nbsp;has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table.&nbsp;We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair — if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid&nbsp;model&nbsp;of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations.”&nbsp;</strong></em></p></div>



<p>According to the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> announcing the authorization, members of the union say that the decision comes as negotiations between Microsoft, ZeniMax, and the union fail to make any meaningful progress into its second year. Specifically, return to office mandates along with “underpayment” are causing friction between the groups.</p>



<p>“Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” ZeniMax Workers United-CWA Local 6215 Member and Senior QA Tester Zachary Armstrong said via release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.”</p>



<p>Union member and Associate QA Tester Aubrey Litchfield added: “Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?”</p>



<p>It’s important to note that the union isn’t officially going on strike. What the authorization vote means is that should negotiations continue to move forward without progress, the union can call a strike without another vote.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft and ZeniMax for comment on the negotiations. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>
