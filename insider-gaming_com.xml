<p>Battlefield 6 Classes dictate how you approach every match. The franchise has notoriously stuck by the same few Classes throughout the years. EA’s early work on Classes for the 2025 Battlefield sequel has been revealed, and each one favors a particular playstyle.</p>



<p>The Class system has always helped Battlefield stand out from its competition. Whereas Call of Duty allows users to create bespoke loadouts—usually factoring in the best meta gear and equipment—Battlefield is more restrictive. DICE gives the community a small handful of Classes to pick, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> looks to be much the same in 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs test</a> is an early pre-Alpha designed to test the game’s foundations. But <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked gameplay footage</a> has already shed light on the direction the full Battlefield 6 release is heading.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-class-in-battlefield-6-revealed-so-far">Every Class in Battlefield 6 Revealed so far</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is it the same Classes again? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Leaked Battlefield 6 Labs footage reveals four familiar Classes: Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon.</strong></p>



<p>Like the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield</a> 2042 image I’ve posted above shows, Battlefield 6 looks to be a continuation of the popular Classes. Apart from Battlefield 1—which had Assault, Medic, Support, Scout, Pilot &amp; Tanker, Cavalry, and Elite Classes—most Battlefield games use the same Classes.</p>



<p>As we’ve covered, the Battlefield Labs pre-Alpha has already leaked. In-match gameplay footage clearly shows you can choose from Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon. This doesn’t mean these are the final Classes though: Everything is subject to change between a pre-Alpha and a full release.</p>



<h3 id="h-assault">Assault</h3>



<p>This is your typical Battlefield, on-foot infantry with automatic weapons designed to eliminate the opposition at close-to-medium distances. They get stuck in, offer limited healing properties, and are an all-round killer.</p>



<h3 id="h-engineer">Engineer</h3>



<p>An Engineer gets stuck into the technical and mechanical side of things. Repairing ally vehicles, sabotaging enemy vehicles, and using a full breadth of equipment to be as impactful as any other role.</p>



<h3 id="h-support">Support</h3>



<p>Your Support are your healers, the fastidious individuals scurrying around the Battlefield resupplying and restocking teammates. They can also hinder the enemy team with their unique equipment and are very important.</p>



<h3 id="h-recon">Recon</h3>



<p>If you prefer to engage at long distances, pick off enemies, and remain unseen, Recon is the way for you. The role is known for Sniper Rifles and players capable of highlighting and identifying threats for the rest of their team.</p>



<hr>



<p>There’s plenty of time between now and the full Battlefield 6 release. We know Battlefield Labs is a testing ground and nothing more. We’ll have to wait and see, but are you happy to see Battlefield 6 stick to the same four Classes? Or should the shooter be more ambitious?</p>
