<p>Embark Studios has delayed the upcoming next part of the ARC Raiders’ Expedition Project. The Expedition, which now opens a few days later, will give you new items but practically wipe out your progress.</p>



<p>One of 2025’s hottest games has been the extraction shooter ARC Raiders. Made by Embark Studios (The Finals), the shooter has been quite popular with players and streamers. From peace pacts to all-out war, the title has already topped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-searched-game-2025-drop-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most-searched games</a> on Google and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-map-visit-25-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consistently broken player records</a> on Steam. On the roadmap, it was teased that the next expedition departure would be announced. Now, Embark Studios has revealed more info on the next Expedition, including a two-day delay.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-expedition-project-now-starts-december-17th-launching-december-22nd">ARC Raiders Expedition Project Now Starts December 17th, Launching December 22nd.</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>After a minor delay in the tunnels, the Expedition departure window will open on Dec 17; this is your Raider’s chance to roll out in the Caravan you’ve built and leave the Rust Belt behind.<br>Prepare to start a fresh new adventure with a brand new Raider, and…</p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1997350326311989689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog</a> on the ARC Raiders site, Embark Studios revealed that the next Expedition won’t start its window on December 15th as planned. Instead, the Expedition window will last from December 17th to the 22nd. Now, instead of players leaving on December 20th, the 22nd is now when those who signed up will depart The Rust Belt on their Caravan.</p>



<p>While the details of the Expedition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-have-optional-progression-wipes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are known</a>, the blog mentions some information regarding it. For one, player progress will be wiped, which includes blueprints, skill tree, level, stash, workshop, and crafting abilities. However, permanent upgrades like more inventory slots, XP boosts, and skill points will be included. It is a big choice to go on the Expedition, but seeing how ARC Raiders has shaped up to be since release, it does seem like a risk worth taking.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Duct Tape Challenge monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Pets, Potions and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you a fan of racing games with a quirky side? If so, Duct Tape Challenge is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-death-ball-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that will definitely be worth your time. Despite being a car-related game on paper, Duct Tape Challenge offers an alternate experience to players, with the main objective being to tear through multiple layers of duct tape. Players must upgrade their cars to make them faster and give them more destructive power, as the number of layers destroyed determines how many coins they earn at the end of the run.&nbsp;</p>







<p>These coins can be used for various things within the game, including upgrading cars, buying pets, stat multipliers and a lot more. These rewards encourage players to keep grinding and beat their personal bests, as the power spikes from even the smallest of upgrades are clear to see. Although simply playing through the game will give players the resources they need to progress, using redeem codes can be a good way to get ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-duct-tape-challenge-codes">Expired Duct Tape Challenge Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired Duct Tape Challenge codes. However, considering the popularity the game has garnered in recent months, new codes are likely to be released. When new codes drop, old ones tend to expire, and when that happens, this section of the article will be updated to reflect as such.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New codes are usually released through the game’s official Discord server, or sometimes through the developers’ socials as well. However, keeping track of these can be a hassle, especially considering that players are not notified when a code expires. That’s where this page can be a lifesaver, as we update this article as soon as any new codes drop. Bookmark this page to never miss out on any free rewards again.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Skybound Game Studios, the gaming subsidiary of Robert Kirkman’s Skybound Entertainment, is facing a sizeable lawsuit filed by iam8bit. This lawsuit alleges fraud, a breach of contract, and theft of original designs, and it was taken to the LA Superior Court for consideration.</p>



<p>The filing claims that Skybound has failed to explain financial discrepancies logged over the years of the partnership between the two firms, amongst other things. This has left iam8bit to file a considerable claim against Skybound.</p>







<h2 id="h-skybound-faces-allegations-of-financial-misconduct">Skybound Faces Allegations of Financial Misconduct</h2>



<p>Skybound Game Studios and iam8bit entered into a partnership in April 2021, and according to the complaint, Skybound has always failed to deliver monthly financial reports as agreed and has added ‘millions of dollars in fake line items’ to expense reports.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/iam8bit-is-suing-skybound-game-studios-alleging-fraud-and-theft-of-designs-000822886.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was explained</a> that an impartial auditor was introduced to the debate, and even then, Skybound couldn’t explain the finances.</p>



<p>Beyond financial woes, iam8bit has accused Skybound Games of cutting it out of a deal related to Stray, the dystopian indie smash hit that launched on PlayStation in 2022. It was claimed that Skybound used original designs created by iam8bit for promotional purposes to secure a separate deal for a Nintendo Switch release of the game.</p>



<p>It has been argued that Skybound has exploited trade secrets while scalping iam8bit’s creative output for marketing purposes.</p>



<p>This leaves iam8bit’s legal team to seek monetary damages, some kind of punitive reform, and compensation for legal fees.</p>



<p>Skybound Games has refused to comment on the lawsuit thus far.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/furia-budapest-perfect-push-secure-playoffs/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FURIA has stormed into the playoffs of the StarLadder Budapest Major, completing a flawless 3-0 run through the tournament’s third stage to cement their dominance over rivals G2 in Hungary. Heading into the series, the head-to-head between the two was locked at 3-3, but FURIA shattered that ratio with a decisive 2-0 win.</p>



<p>It was an intense series that left FURIA one step closer to lifting the trophy in Budapest.</p>



<p>The predictions don’t end with this article, though. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"></a></figure>







<h2 id="h-furia-in-the-fight-for-first">FURIA in the Fight for First</h2>



<p>The opening map in the series, Inferno, provided FURIA with early leverage, as the team secured a commanding 13-5 win over G2. It was a shock-and-awe mission for FURIA, with FalleN and YEKINDAR putting out multi-kills that left G2 flailing in the wind for much of the map.</p>



<p>Overpass came next, and again, FURIA was swinging around the map with reckless abandon. Even a brief respite provided by SunPayus with a clean pistol clapback wasn’t enough to recover those lost rounds.</p>



<p>In a post-match statement, Sid ‘sidde’ Macedo explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We were still deciding if we would full buy or not. I knew we needed a pause to organize our ideas, and FalleN came up with a very good plan of playing off the stacks, playing with numbers, and playing with smokes. Everyone contributed, and I’m glad I called the pause to bring it together.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This victory effectively breaks the deadlock with G2 and extends FURIA’s dominant streak at the Budapest Major in Hungary. The Brazilian side scooped trophies going into the Major, and now they’re looking to add another to that cabinet.</p>
