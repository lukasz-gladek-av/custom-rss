<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta has the worst rating on Metacritic out of all the games from the God of War franchise. </p>



<p>The new 2D Metroidvania God of War title was shadowdropped during the latest PlayStation State of Play event. Since then, we have also seen the series’ original creator share harsh comments about the title. Now that the review numbers have popped up, it doesn’t seem to be performing well compared to the others. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-rating-falls-under-70">God of War: Sons of Sparta Rating Falls Under 70</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/god-of-war/new-god-of-war-game-sons-of-spartas-early-metacritic-score-places-it-as-the-worst-in-the-series-with-even-the-divisive-ascension-over-10-points-higher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, if you head to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/search/god%20of%20war/?page=1&amp;category=13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MetaCritic.com</a> and search for ratings for all God of War games, it is pretty evident that Sons of Sparta is falling short. The 2018 God of War and Ragnarok are at the very top, both with a score of 94. Additionally, all the titles from the Greek Trilogy also score above 90. What’s more, the PSP instalments, Ghost of Sparta and Chains of Olympus, are also considerably higher rated than the recently released game. </p>



<p>The worst-rated God of War game to date was God of War: Ascension, with a score of 80. However, Sons of Sparta falls even further with its score coming in at 69, which has a 69 rating based on critic reviews and a 6.6 score based on user reviews. Insider Gaming has also reviewed Sons of Sparta, giving it a score of 7 and calling it “a pretty good game that will cater more toward God of War fans than Metroidvania enthusiasts seeking the next big thing.

<p>A new announcement revealed that Replaced’s release date has been delayed by over a month to April 2026. </p>



<p>Sad Cat Studios has delayed Replaced a couple of times over the past two years. The first one was back in 2024, where it was pushed to 2025 to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/replaced-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meet high standards</a>.” Then it was delayed again in August 2025, when the developers stated that players would have to wait until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/replaced-delayed-spring-2026-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring 2026</a>. Now, a new delay announcement has arrived. </p>







<h2 id="h-replaced-now-arrives-april-14">Replaced Now Arrives April 14</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://x.com/sadcatstudios/status/2024127330285736398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> by Sad Cat Studios states that, after “a lot of back and forth,” the developers have decided to delay Replaced’s release to April 14, over a month later than the previously announced March 12. The developers have stated that the game is “technically finished,” but they need a few more weeks to polish, stabilize, and make the final version more true to the vision they shared before. </p>



<p>The developers also spoke about the Steam Demo for the game, which was nerve-wracking for them at first, but it provided them with more insight through comments and other player feedback. This feedback is being used to make the final tweaks to the game. Sad Cat Studios has also emphasised that it is a small team working on its first game and has poured everything it has into this project. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new video has emerged showcasing a Rainbow Six Siege exploit that can take over your entire screen. </p>



<p>The developers of Rainbow Six Siege recently revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-year-11-roadmap-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 11 roadmap</a>, which features “more Siege, more often”. As we wait for the R6 Invitational to end, players have spotted a new exploit that can completely block the player’s field of view. Learn more about it below. </p>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-exploit-uses-charlie-kirk-image-for-screen-disruption">Rainbow Six Exploit Uses Charlie Kirk Image for Screen Disruption</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege player Bikini Bodhi has posted a new video on their official <a href="https://x.com/BikiniBodhi/status/2023840148581216684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), showcasing the image exploit. In the video, we see Bodhi running and talking to his team when he is suddenly flashed with an image of Charlie Kirk’s face swapped with IShowSpeed. The image takes over Bodhi’s entire screen, making it a massive disadvantage for the player. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the comments section, Bodi was asked whether this was a new cheat or a stream thing. He responded that this is not a cheat but an exploit, where the player can link their name to an image. This image can then pop up and cover the opponent’s entire screen, leaving them in the dark. </p>



<p>This is not the first time Rainbow Six Siege players have been experiencing full-screen disruptions caused by image pop-ups. Back in 2022, players were seeing lewd and gore-filled images popping up that were blocking almost the entire screen. </p>



<p>In other news, Solid Snake has been unveiled for Rainbow Six Siege’s ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation Silent Hunt</a>.’ Additionally, the game’s creative director has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-creative-director-stepping-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his role</a>.

<p>Pokémon fans have plenty to enjoy in 2026 with the franchise’s 30th anniversary, including the Pokémon Go Tour Kalos event that takes place right after Pokémon Day.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a>‘s annual tour event places focus on a specific region in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> history, and the Kalos tour follows on from a return to Lumiose City in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" id="2273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. As always, the event features the debut of new Pokémon and Shiny forms, so there is plenty to enjoy.</p>



<p>For all the details on when the Pokémon Go Tour Kalos takes place, and the exact times you will be able to play, Insider Gaming has everything you need to know.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">When is The Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shiny addition. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos starts on February 28 and runs until March 1, with millions of players across the world uniting to participate.</strong></p>



<p>Following in-person events in Los Angeles and Tainan, Go Tour Kalos is available virtually for all players worldwide, with both free and premium offerings.</p>



<p>The event puts Pokémon X and Y, which introduced the Kalos region, in the limelight, but there are also debuts from other regions. Mega Victreebell and Mega Malamar, both of which made their debut in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, are both available for the first time during the event.</p>



<p>Additionally, Shiny Diancie makes its Pokémon Go debut, alongside two special Pikachu variants wearing Calem’s hat or Serena’s hat. Both Pikachu variants have an increased chance of appearing in their Shiny form, along with the Kalos starter trio: Froakie, Chespin, and Fennekin.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-start-time-for-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">What is the Start Time For Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos begins at 10 AM local time on Saturday, February 28. The staggered release means players in Australia and the Oceania region will be the first to enjoy the new content.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike other platforms and games, there’s no way to change your region in Pokémon Go to access the content earlier than your scheduled release time. While there are some spoofing options available, they are against the Pokémon Go terms of service and could result in your account being banned.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-end-time-for-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">What is The End Time For Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos ends at 6 PM local time on Sunday, March 1. Again, the staggered release means players in the Oceania region see the event conclude earliest, while those in the Pacific will finish later.</strong></p>



<p>As already mentioned, there’s no way to change your region in Pokémon Go to give yourself more time to enjoy Go Tour Kalos, and it’s highly recommended that you don’t try to find a workaround.</p>
