            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-already-beaten-battlefield-6-analyst/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-has-already-beaten-battlefield-6-and-it%E2%80%99s-because-of-%E2%80%98autopilot-purchasing%E2%80%99-analyst-says.1281459/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite comments suggesting that Battlefield 6 will ‘boot stomp’ Call of Duty this year, many believe the impending conflict between Black Ops 7 and EA’s new Battlefield title has already been decided. In a recent report published as part of the Alinea Analytics newsletter, it was suggested that Black Ops 7 will outsell Battlefield because of consumer habits and nothing more.</p>



<p>The report spoke of ‘autopilot purchasing’, with Call of Duty fans buying the new release year in, year out, even if they’re displeased with the offering. That’s why Battlefield 6 won’t ‘win’ this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-battlefield-6-beat-call-of-duty">Can Battlefield 6 Beat Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>The recent <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Insight newsletter</a> discussed whether Battlefield 6 could stand firm as a ‘COD killer’, a term that has been lobbied a lot in recent years. Once upon a time, XDefiant was poised as a COD killer, and we all know how that went…</p>



<p>Alinea’s expert analysts pulled a number out of the hat, revealing that 60% of beta-based wishlisters of Battlefield 6 have played a Call of Duty game on Steam, which is a damning enough number right out the gate. The team admitted that Battlefield 6 could do better than any other game in franchise history, but it still won’t be enough to topple Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Rhys Elliott of Alinea put it perfectly in the report:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>COD<strong>&nbsp;is still dominant despite all this</strong>. Its core audience still loves the game and buys it every damn year. And that isn’t going to change just because&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;is rad and tracking incredibly well.</p>



<p>For many gamers,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;is an annual ritual. Tens of millions of players, many of them casual gamers, buy the newest&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>&nbsp;every year without hesitation. This “autopilot purchasing” habit is decades deep, and breaking it requires more than one awesome&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>&nbsp;release.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elliott went on to explain ‘that&nbsp;<strong>players will buy it even if they complain about it</strong>.’ It also doesn’t help Battlefield’s situation that Black Ops 7 is guaranteed to be a day-one title on the Xbox Game Pass subscription service. When Black Ops 6 was released on Game Pass last year, it was the single biggest day for new subscriptions on the platform.</p>



<p>I’m of the standpoint that Battlefield 6 <strong>doesn’t need to beat Black Ops 7. </strong>I’m more than comfortable with both games existing alongside each other, and even Battlefield’s developers stressed the same thing. They serve unique demographics in a few ways, and I’ll play both and make my mind up later as to which I prefer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atari-secures-rights-to-five-ubisoft-ips-including-an-underrated-post-apocalyptic-gem.1281450/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently announced that Atari has formed a strategic IP agreement with Ubisoft to revitalize <strong>five forgotten games</strong>. The deal was inked recently, and it was confirmed that Atari will re-release these games under the new publishing arm that the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atari-revive-infogrames/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought back to life</a> in April 2024.</p>



<p>The five games now owned by Atari will likely provide a nostalgia hit for Ubisoft fans.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-ubisoft-games-does-atari-own">What Ubisoft Games Does Atari Own?</h2>



<p>Atari has secured the IP rights for five <strong>Ubisoft </strong>games:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cold Fear (2005)</li>



<li>I Am Alive (2012)</li>



<li>Child of Eden (2011)</li>



<li>Grow Home (2015)</li>



<li>Grow Up (2016)</li>
</ul>



<p>I’m particularly excited about I Am Alive, a 2012 blink-and-you’ll-miss-it post-apocalyptic survival game pieced together primarily by Ubisoft Shanghai and Darkworks, a studio that also worked on Cold Fear, which sadly closed its doors in 2011.</p>



<p>I Am Alive wasn’t an award-winning game by any means, but it offered players a perspective of a shattered world with a moral lens overlay. It took a whopping seven years to develop the game, and when it was done, it offered just a few hours of gameplay on a digital-only release.</p>



<p>I’ve always been eager for a follow-up to I Am Alive, which I feel is a criminally underrated game. Here’s a trailer for the title:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a> on the new IP deal, Ubisoft’s Deborah Papiernik, VP of New Business, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Millions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for long time players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time.</p>



<p>Atari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, we’re excited to see how they’ll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the sentiment was Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft and Atari both have a legacy of crafting worlds that players can fall in love with — games that resonate with generations of players not just for how they played, but for how they made us feel.</p>



<p>We’re excited to reintroduce these titles while also exploring ways to expand and evolve these franchises.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports is back with NHL 26, the latest installment of the long-running hockey franchise. As with any new release, NHL 26 features a number of trophies and achievements to unlock for all of the completionist who’ll boot up the game. </p>



<p>When it comes to sports games, earning achievements is a bit different than story-focused titles. These games reward you for winning games and championships, completing tasks in various game modes, scoring certain types of goals, and more.  </p>



<p>So, without any more delay, let’s get into everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-nhl-26-trophy-and-achievement">How To Get Every NHL 26 Trophy And Achievement</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In total, there are 49 trophies and achievements to earn in NHL 26. The challenges range from winning a Champions Hockey League trophy in Be A Pro to simply assigning a scout to the CHL in Franchise mode. If you want to 100% the game, you’ll have to play every mode in the game, including online modes like World of Chel and Hockey Ultimate Team.</p>



<p>You can check out all of the trophies and how to earn them below courtesy of <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/36114-nhl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN Profiles</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-nhl-26-secret-trophies">NHL 26 Secret Trophies</h2>



<p>Unlike fellow EA Sports title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-madden-26-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>, NHL 26 has no secret trophies to unlock this year. All 49 of the achievements can be seen when you load up the game on Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-nhl-26">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In NHL 26?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 49 trophies and achievements to unlock in NHL 26.</strong></p>



<p>Looking further shows that there are 34 bronze trophies, 12 silver, two gold, and one platinum trophy to unlock. Compared to NHL 25, there are two less total trophies and achievements this time around. There are four less bronze trophies, but two more silver.</p>



<p>As far as unlocking them is concerned, they are all pretty straight forward. Most can be done in various single-player modes. Others, however, require you to play online against other players such as winning a Ones Eliminator Tournament in the World of Chel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Return to Silent Hill, a film adaptation of Silent Hill 2, has released the first teaser. The film, which hits theaters on January 23rd, 2026, looks to capture the magic of the iconic sequel. We had seen glimpses before last year during Silent Hill Transmission, but nothing concrete. </p>



<p>The film comes from director Christophe Gans, who did the original Silent Hill film in 2006. Last we had heard about Return to Silent Hill, it got its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-comes-to-theaters-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official release date of January</a>, but no pictures or footage came of it. Regardless, we now have our first look at the upcoming adaptation, and it looks rather interesting.</p>



<h2 id="h-return-to-silent-hill-brings-silent-hill-2-to-life-in-film">Return to Silent Hill Brings Silent Hill 2 To Life in Film</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Return to Silent Hill - Official Teaser Trailer (2025) Jeremy Irvine, Hannah Emily Anderson" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eej34Jw7woA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, shown above, we get a brief glimpse into the world of Return to Silent Hill. As the film is an adaptation of Silent Hill 2 (though the trailer doesn’t seem to indicate that), the plot remains the same. Protagonist James Sunderland, played by Jeremy Irvine, goes to the eerie town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his recently deceased wife, Laura. What follows is a bit too spoilery, but it does involve grotesque monsters and, of course, the iconic Pyramid Head. It looks like it may not be a direct adaptation, as there are a few things not from the games in it. However, it is a teaser, so expect more of a concrete plot come the full trailer.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 is widely regarded as one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-silent-hill-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scariest games of the generation</a>. Last year, Bloober Team and Konami released a remake of the game, which was heavily praised and was up for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/495868/2024-award-winners-game-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dozens of awards</a>. Now, the Silent Hill series is readying the next generation with Silent Hill f, releasing on September 25th, 2025. Following that will be Bloober Team’s return with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-silent-hill-remake-development-bloober-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a remake of Silent Hill</a>, announced earlier this year.
