<p>Use these Invincible Showdown monthly redeem codes for November 2025&nbsp; to get plenty of free cash and other items, allowing you to buy more powerful characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Invincible Showdown is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-heads-please-codes/">Roblox</a> fighting game inspired by the popular animated superhero TV series, Invincible. The game features all of the characters from the show, offering an added level of immersion to fans of both the show and Roblox. With realistic-looking abilities and deadly finishers involved, the combat gameplay of the game is one of the main reasons why it’s so highly rated. Players can also acquire and upgrade new abilities and skills in the game, which means that making cash as quickly as possible is of utmost importance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s exactly where these Invincible Showdown codes will be of aid. These can be used by anyone, irrespective of how far into the game they are, so players are urged to make use of all of them immediately, before they eventually expire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, there is only one Invinvible Showdown code that has expired. However, as and when new codes are released, the older ones could be withdrawn. This makes the timely use of codes crucial to maximising the possible output. Here’s the expired code:</p>

<p>Unlike many popular Roblox games today, redeeming codes in Invincible Showdown requires players to complete an additional step by following Invincibly Group and liking the game on Roblox. Once that’s done, though, it’s as simple as navigating through the menus of the game and inputting one of the active codes into the text box that pops up. For players who may be new to the Roblox environment, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeem Invincible Showdown codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Follow Invincibly Group on Roblox and like the game</li>



<li>Launch Roblox and open up Invincible Showdown</li>



<li>Click the ‘Rewards’ button on the right side</li>



<li>Click the ‘Codes’ button</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem Code’ button to receive your rewards</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-invincible-showdown-codes">How To Get More Invincible Showdown Codes</h2>



<p>New Invincible Showdown codes are usually released during updates or special events, mostly through the game’s official Discord server or Roblox game page. However, tracking these multiple times a month can be a hassle. Instead, we recommend that all users keep this page bookmarked, as we update it with new information as soon as any codes are dropped by the developers, making it the most efficient way for players to get the latest codes.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-881-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-saturday-november-8.1347649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the weekend, but don’t feel like you can relax until you’ve completed today’s NYT Connections puzzle! I’ve got the solutions and NYT Connections hints you need to dominate today’s puzzle, which happens to be pretty tricky. Before you roll into your weekend, scroll down and get the answers I know you’re looking for.</p>



<p>NYT Connections hints await!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-8">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 8)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #881:</p>



<ul>
<li>SIGN</li>



<li>SPY</li>



<li>STOP</li>



<li>ROBOT</li>



<li>SEAL</li>



<li>BODY</li>



<li>DELIVER</li>



<li>PRESENT</li>



<li>BEAM</li>



<li>PLUG</li>



<li>PROGRAMMING</li>



<li>CHING</li>



<li>GIVE</li>



<li>SPOKEN</li>



<li>CLOSE</li>



<li>PRONOUNCE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These all suggest <strong>obstructing or closing</strong> something</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each word implies <strong>offering or stating something publicly</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all <strong>forms or systems of communication</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each of these can follow <strong>“I” </strong>to form a phrase</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 8.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-8-881">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 8 (#881)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CLOSE, PLUG, SEAL, STOP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DELIVER, GIVE, PRESENT, PRONOUNCE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BODY, PROGRAMMING, SIGN, SPOKEN</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BEAM, CHING, ROBOT, SPY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Silent Hill 2 finally has a release date for when it’s coming to Xbox Series X|S, and it comes from an early update on the Microsoft Store.</p>



<p>Though the listing has seemingly been removed, it’s been revealed—h/t <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/silent-hill-2-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">True Achievements</a> for finding it first—that Silent Hill 2 will launch on Xbox on Friday, November 21, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who’ve been following, an Xbox launch has <a href="http://long been rumor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long been rumored</a> and expected. Talk even picked up more steam when the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/">officially rated for Xbox</a> by the ESRB on October 31, meaning that a launch wasn’t going to be far off. </p>



<p>Looking at the store listing, it says the game is optimized for both the Xbox Series X and Series S. It will also release for the console and PC via the Microsoft Store. However, there’s no official mention of it being a play anywhere title.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Silent Hill 2 Microsoft Store Listing (Credit: True Achievements)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Silent Hill 2 first launched on PlayStation 5 (PS5) and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024. The deal for the game to be console exclusive on the PS5 was for a year, which expired early last month. As of writing, the game has a “generally favorable” rating of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">86 on Metacritic</a> from 105 reviews while the user score is even higher at 9.1 from 3,998 user ratings.</p>



<p>In addition to Xbox, there have also been rumors that it will be released on the Nintendo Switch 2. Whether it happens on the same date as Xbox remains to be seen, but it’s clear that those without a PC or PS5 will be getting to play the remake from Bloober Team in the very near future.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting, though, that neither Konami nor Bloober Team have officially announced anything yet.</p>



<p>Now that we seemingly have a release date, will you pick up Silent Hill 2 on Xbox? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down in the comments and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Halo Infinite Ending Support, Moving onto ‘Multiple Projects’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/halo-infinite-ending-support-moving-onto-multiple-projects/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-infinite-ending-support-moving-onto-%E2%80%98multiple-projects%E2%80%99.1347568/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Halo Infinite is ending after four years of updates, confirms Halo Studios. However, it seems the company is putting the teams on multiple new Halo projects, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.</p>



<p>The Halo franchise has been at the forefront of the FPS genre since its debut in 2001 on Xbox. With several entries, the series has become synonymous with gamers alike for its epic space setting and thrilling gunplay. With the 30th anniversary coming up, Halo Studios is going all in, starting with the recently-revealed Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of 2001’s Combat Evolved. Unfortunately, the most recent title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-halo-qa-tester-blames-microsofts-policies-for-halo-infinite-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Infinite</a>, is ending production, but it will lead to new projects in the works.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-studios-stopping-updates-for-halo-infinite-to-support-other-games">Halo Studios Stopping Updates for Halo Infinite to Support Other Games</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to 343 Industries</figcaption></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post from Halo Studios</a>, the team announced that <strong>Halo Infinite’s newest update</strong>, Operation: Infinite, <strong>will be its last major one</strong>. The update, set to go live on November 18th, 2025, will include new armor, maps, challenges, and 2x XP. Unfortunately, it’s the final one for the game, as, in the blog, the team states,</p>



<p>“<strong>With multiple Halo titles in development, we’ll need our whole team’s combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us</strong>,” the blog reads. “<strong>While we remain committed to supporting&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>&nbsp;on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned</strong>.”</p>



<p>Fortunately, it seems the Halo Infinite team is shifting to help on other Halo games currently in the works. We only know of one, Halo: Campaign Evolved, so <strong>this does confirm more is in development at Halo Studios</strong>. There are rumors that a live-service Halo game is planning to release in 2026, so perhaps it’s one of the titles it’s working on. Of course, one can also assume the next mainline entry is in production, though no confirmation has been made for either project.</p>



<p>What do you think of Halo Infinite ending support? Are you excited to see what Halo Studios has in store? What game do you hope is next? Mainline? Multiplayer? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>
