<p>Two major changes to Overwatch are coming in Season 15 of the long-running hero shooter from Blizzard: the debut of gameplay perks and the return of loot boxes. Billed as the “boldest gameplay evolution yet,” perks let players level up their hero abilities with new effects mid-match.</p>



<p>Check out the full details on all the <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24177197/overwatch-2-spotlight-a-new-era-of-innovation-and-excitement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new changes</a> coming to Overwatch in Season 15 below.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-s-biggest-content-change-arguably-since-the-sequel">Overwatch’s Biggest Content Change Arguably Since the Sequel</h2>



<p>The new perk system allows player to upgrade their hero’s kit during a match by earning level experience. Players can earn level experience by getting kills, dealing damage, and healing. The perks are similar to Reality Augments in Fortnite: when a player unlocks the ability to get a perk, they can use their controls to select one of the two options. If a player switches heroes during a match, their hero level will reset, but they will earn experience faster. Players can equip three perks per match: two Minor perks, and one Major perk.</p>



<p>In addition to the new perks system, Season 15 will re-introduce loot boxes. Players will be able to earn loot boxes from weekly and event rewards, as well as one Legendary loot box from the free battle pass, and two more from the Premium pass. A Rare or better item will drop in every box, an Epic item is guaranteed within five consecutive boxes, and a Legendary it guaranteed within 20 consecutive boxes. If an item you already own is in the box, it will re-roll it with an item of the same rarity.</p>

<p>If you’re only going to be married to Marvel Rivals on Valentine’s Day, then the perfect costume bundle will be there for you if no one else will be. The 60th Wedding Anniversary Combo Bundle is releasing on February 14, featuring wedding outfits for both Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman.</p>



<p>Somewhere, Namor is crying, but you can’t tell because he’s underwater.</p>



<h2 id="h-mister-fantastic-amp-invisible-woman-celebrate-their-anniversary-in-marvel-rivals">Mister Fantastic &amp; Invisible Woman Celebrate Their Anniversary in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Inspired by The Life Fantastic series and the 2005 Wedding Special comic, the new costumes in Marvel Rivals celebrate the 60th wedding anniversary of Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman. Both members of the Fantastic Four look their best in a stunning tuxedo and gorgeous wedding dress.</p>



<p>According to Marvel Rivals insider Miller Ross, both costumes will be <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1889706032676348258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">permanent additions</a> to the store. Each outfit can be bought on its own for 2,200 units, and includes the costume, an MVP animation, a nameplate, a spray, and an emote. The bundle that combines both of them is surely the better value, as you get both costumes and all the add-ons for just 2,800 units.</p>



<p>However, players also have the chance to pick up the bundle for free, by playing quickmatch at the same time and on the same server as a popular streamer. Streamers like Nadeshot, Emiru, and TimTheTatman <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/events/20250212/40956_1211432.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are all participating</a> from February 12 to 13.</p>



<p>In-game purchases like costumes and battle passes have been the focal point of revenue for the free-to-play game. While no official numbers have been released, Chinese outlet Gamelook <a href="http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2025/01/562110/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a> back in January that the game has pulled in “around 1 billion Yuan,” or around $136 million USD. This figure can be attributed to its large player base and consumer-friendly seasonal content plan, with developer NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">committing to the release of two new heroes each month</a>.</p>
