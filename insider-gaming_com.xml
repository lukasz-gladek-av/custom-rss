<p>When asked about the sequel in a recent interview, the director of ‘A Minecraft Movie’ stated, “It seems like there’s already talk about it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>During an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/minecraft-movie-sequel-plans-director-jared-hess-jack-black-jason-momoa-1236362421/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/live-action-movies/minecraft-movie-director-says-sequel-will-without-a-doubt-feature-fan-favorite-character-alex-alongside-jack-blacks-steve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess was asked how he would deal with a sequel for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest-ever opening-day video game movie</a>. Hess stated that the team enjoyed creating this movie; however, the game world is so expansive that “there were so many things” they couldn’t tap into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hess added that he “would have a blast doing the sequel” for the Minecraft movie before stating that he is excited because “it seems like there’s already talk about it happening.” The director added that it would be a lot of fun to dive back into this world, and the audience is also seemingly going ”wild” for their post-credits scene, which hints towards a potential sequel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hess already has a plan for the characters he will focus on in the sequel. <strong>Spoilers Ahead</strong> for those who haven’t watched the movie, as this references the post-credits scene.</p>



<p>In the post-credits scene of A Minecraft Movie, they teased Alex, an iconic character from the game’s universe. Hess has stated that “it’s Steve (Black) and Alex, and so that’s the one that we will be bringing to the table without a doubt” for the sequel.</p>

<p>The road to Room 46 is reached through one of several gaming platforms. Two of them are the PlayStation and Xbox, and we’re here today to let you know if Blue Prince’s journey can be explored as part of an Xbox Game Pass or PS Plus subscription.</p>



<p>Blue Prince is a game that wasn’t known by many at one point, but loved by those who did. It topped many early GOTY lists, and now that reviews are in, its Metacritic score is cause for some serious eyebrow raising. As of April 2025, Blue Prince is the highest-rated game of the year ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-2-hardcore-mode-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-split-fiction-laser-hell-secret-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>Its mind-bending series of rooms and puzzles is cause for serious applause. It revolutionized the roguelike genre—like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gdc-awards-balatro-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a> did in 2024—to create a masterpiece. I don’t blame you if you’re eager not to miss out, so let’s check its Game Pass and PS Plus status. </p>
