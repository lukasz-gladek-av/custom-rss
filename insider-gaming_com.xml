<p>Rod Fergusson, who has served as general manager (GM) of Diablo for the last five years, is leaving Blizzard.</p>



<p>He announced the news via social media on Friday afternoon.</p>



<p><strong>“After five years of driving the Diablo franchise forward with four big launches, it’s time for me to step away from Blizzard/Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what’s next,”</strong> Fergusson <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rodfergusson.bsky.social/post/3lvvud767y223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in his post.</a> <strong>“The teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead. I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together and looking forward to what comes next for Diablo, and for me.”</strong></p>



<p>Fergusson joined Blizzard in 2020 after spending years working on the Gears of War franchise at The Coalition under Xbox and Epic Games previously.</p>



<p>After the move was announced, Blizzard president <a href="https://x.com/Joh_Burg/status/1953884570316943653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Johanna Faries said</a>, <strong>“Guiding a franchise like Diablo takes rare talent, vision, and collaboration. Thank you, Rod, for bringing all of those in spades. Sanctuary’s future is brighter because of the impact you’ve had!”</strong></p>



<p>Xbox head Phil Spencer added: <strong>“You brought strength, hellfire, and vision to one of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Playing Diablo IV with you was a blast—thanks for everything you gave to the game and the community.”</strong></p>



<p>As of publishing, no replacement has been named nor was a reason given for Fergusson’s departure.</p>

<p>Hideo Kojima’s ‘spiritual successor’ to Metal Gear Solid (if Death Stranding 2 isn’t already that) has been floating around for a while, but beyond the name, we don’t know anything else about it. It’s named Physint, and it’s an all-new action espionage title, just like Metal Gear Solid was (and remains to be).</p>



<p>It’s set to be another cinematic epic from Kojima, further blurring the lines between cinematic production and traditional video game development. However, in a recent interview, the man himself confirmed he’s working solo at the moment.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-alone">All Alone</h2>



<p>Fans of Hideo Kojima’s work are nothing short of excited about the creator’s imminent return to the action espionage space, a decade after he left Konami and turned his back on Metal Gear Solid. It was a few days ago that he was grilled on the MGS series, and when asked if he plans to play the Snake Eater remake, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he just laughed</a>.</p>



<p>The expectation is that Physint, whatever form it takes, will emerge on whatever comes next for PlayStation, which right now is looking like the PlayStation 6. Did you really expect another naming convention to pop up?</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Indie Wire</a>, Hideo Kojima explained the lay of the land with Physint, mentioning that he’s working on a solo bid at the moment. It wasn’t much, but it was something:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;(I’m) also doing ‘Physint’ all by myself because that’s at the conceptual stage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He’s planning Physint alongside the ongoing development of OD and the post-launch support of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which dropped just a few weeks ago and has been turning heads ever since.</p>



<p>The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, and the single step here is good old Hideo, using that raw brain power to create a concept that only he can concoct.</p>



<p>Do you have high hopes for Kojima’s return to action espionage games? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
