<p>The full list of nominees for the 2026 Grammys was announced on Friday, and that includes the category dedicated to video games and interactive media. This will be the fourth year that the award for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media will be given after it was introduced for the 2023 awards.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/2026-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">year’s nominees include</a> games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Star Wars Outlaws, and even Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>You may be asking, “How is Helldivers 2 nominated?” Well, that’s because of the timing of nominations and when soundtracks were actually released. The soundtrack for Helldivers 2 <a href="https://milanrecords.com/out-now-helldivers-2-original-game-soundtrack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was officially released</a> on September 20, 2024. To be eligible for the 2026 Grammys, the soundtrack had to be released between August 31, 2024, and August 30, 2025. </p>



<p>The 68th annual Grammy Awards takes place on February 1, 2026. You can check out the five games up for the award below.</p>







<p>Of this year’s nominees, only two were from games that originally released during the nomination window. Helldivers 2’s eligibility was already covered above, but what about Avatar and Star Wars Outlaws? That’s pretty simple, as well, because they were for story expansions that released within the required timeframe.</p>



<p>The full nomination list is:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – Secrets of the Spire</strong>: Pinar Toprak, composer</li>



<li><strong>Helldivers 2</strong>: Wilbert Roget, II, composer</li>



<li><strong>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</strong>: Gordy Haab, composer</li>



<li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card &amp; A Pirate’s Fortune</strong>: Cody Matthew Johnson &amp; Wilbert Roget, II, composers</li>



<li><strong>Sword of the Sea</strong>: Austin Wintory, composer</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned, this will be the fourth year in a row for the Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media. In 2023, <strong>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok by Stephanie Economou</strong> took home the first award after beating out Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Call of Duty Vanguard, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and Old World.</p>



<p>In 2024, it was <strong>Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab winning for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong>. Other nominees that year included Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, and Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical. </p>



<p>Last year, <strong>Winifred Phillips won for Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</strong>. Wizardry beat out Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and Star Wars Outlaws.</p>

<p>Amazon’s Mass Effect series won’t be an adaptation of the original Commander Shepherd trilogy, confirms BioWare and EA. Even more so, it’ll be an original story set after Mass Effect 3.</p>



<p>The Mass Effect series has rightly become the premier narrative-driven game and a must-play for any gamer. Despite an okay third entry, the first two games are some of the best RPGs on the market, even after almost two decades. The last entry in the series, Mass Effect Andromeda, didn’t meet fan expectations, so any new project is welcome. Last year, Amazon announced that it would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-tv-series-officially-in-development-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be making a Mass Effect TV series</a> for Prime Video. Now, we know a bit more about the direction they are going, and it’s an interesting one.</p>



<h2 id="h-mass-effect-tv-show-set-after-the-original-trilogy">Mass Effect TV Show Set After The Original Trilogy</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As part of N7 Day, celebrating the USS Normandy in the game, <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog was posted</a> on the official Mass Effect site. Series executive producer Mike Gamble spoke at length about the future of the series. While no updates on the new Mass Effect were shared outside of that it’s in production, the Amazon show was talked about. In the piece, he states,</p>



<p>“<strong>The writers room is going strong, and we’ve got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game</strong>,” Gamble says in the blog. “<strong>The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe’s timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won’t be a retread of Commander Shepard’s story – because after all … that’s YOUR story, isn’t it?</strong>”</p>



<p>As Gamble said, the show is <strong>now in the writing stage</strong> and will, surprisingly, <strong>not adapt the original trilogy</strong>. This means that, more than likely, Commander Shepard and the Normandy crew will not be in attendance. However, despite being an original story, it will take place <strong>after the events of Mass Effect 3</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to what ending may be canon is unknown, but it’ll be interesting to see how it goes. Mass Effect is a space opera, so it does translate well into a show akin to Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek. As a fan, I’m excited to see what’s in store, especially since it’ll be a brand new adventure.</p>



<p>What do you think about Amazon’s Mass Effect not adapting the original trilogy? Would you’ve liked to see Commander Shepard and crew in live-action? Do you think the show will work with an original story?
