<p>Oblivion Remastered started leaking online on April 15, alongside exclusive details that uncovered a Deluxe Edition and other key elements. One concern fans of the Elder Scrolls franchise had was centered around the platforms that Oblivion Remastered would be released on (whenever it is released), prompting the question, ‘Is Oblivion Remastered coming to PS5?’</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-the-oblivion-remake-be-on-ps5">Will The Oblivion Remake Be on PS5?</h2>



<p>It’s yet to be confirmed by Bethesda Game Studios or Microsoft, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-leak-new-images-deluxe-edition-upgrades-remastered/">per the latest leaks</a>, Oblivion Remastered will be released on PlayStation 5 as well as on Xbox and PC.</p>



<p>It’s most likely coming to the Game Pass subscription service, but again, that’s not confirmed at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Oblivion Remastered was originally thought to be an Oblivion remake, but the leaks revealed that’s not the case. It looks fantastic from what we’ve seen, but it’s not a top-to-bottom rebuild of the entire game, which means many original elements will still exist.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s supposed to be an overhaul that adjusts combat, stealth, and archery mechanics, as well as making the game feel more ‘modern’ in general.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-oblivion-remastered-coming-out">When is Oblivion Remastered Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Presently, the leading rumours have claimed that Oblivion Remastered will be released after April 21, most likely on April 24. These rumours are to be taken with a pinch of salt as they’re unconfirmed at present, but notable insiders have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remake-release-next-week-claimed/">corroborated the reports</a>.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known if Oblivion Remastered will be an all-digital product or if there will be physical copies, but in my experience, it’s a safe bet to lean towards the former. I can’t imagine this will be released in physical form. </p>



<p>Do you intend to pick up a copy of Oblivion Remastered on PS5 when it’s released? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Minutes ago, images were uploaded and circulated on social media showcasing alleged shots of Oblivion ‘Remastered’ – <strong>not </strong>Oblivion ‘Remake’. In the images, we see side-by-side comparisons, which help to uncover how much of an evolution the game will be. The details that have appeared online also suggest a Deluxe Edition is on the way.</p>



<p>The game is still expected to be shadowdropped by Bethesda and Virtuous next week, after April 21. That claim was recently backed up by Jeff Grubb, who has reportedly heard from separate sources that we’re just days away from the Oblivion Remastered release.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-oblivion-remastered-not-remade">Oblivion Remastered, Not Remade</h2>



<p>In images that surfaced <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/#post-138553332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first on Resetera</a>, eagle-eyed gamers got a first glimpse at Oblivion Remastered. They were taken from a Virtuous website, which also let slip that the project has been in development as a collaboration between Virtuous and both Bethesda Dallas and Bethesda Rockville.</p>



<p>The site further noted that Oblivion Remastered will be released on PC, Xbox, <strong>and </strong>PlayStation 5. The latter platform was never part of the rumours, and it was believed that it would be coming <strong>only </strong>to Xbox and PC.</p>



<p>A further leak revealed cover art and an advertisement for the Deluxe Edition of Oblivion Remastered. In this special edition, players can get access to extra items, such as horse armour and exclusive weapons.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered images were just found in the Virtuous website files!</span></p></article></div>







<p>More images were later revealed on social media:</p>











<p>For several weeks, rumours have been circulating regarding the release of Oblivion Remastered, which has long been thought of as an Oblivion remake. These are the first images we’ve seen of the project, which should be in our hands or on our consoles within a week.</p>



<p>What do you think about Oblivion Remastered? Let me know in the comments if you’re going to pick a copy up.</p>

<p>A Schedule 1 player has discovered a new property in the game, and it seems like the perfect place for players to show off their wealth.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/schedule-1-new-property-discovered-for-future-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, a Schedule 1 player has discovered a brand new property within the game called The Manor. The upcoming property could be the biggest yet, sporting four bedrooms on the first floor and two large reception rooms on the ground floor. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jvy0d1/the_manor_will_be_purchasable_for_50000_in_a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a> also features a glitched image showing the price of The Manor, which is set at $50,000; however, this could change when it is released for the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-could-be-getting-the-ultimate-flex-property">Schedule 1 Could be Getting the ‘Ultimate Flex’ Property</h2>



<p>The Manor seems like the ultimate flex purchase for Schedule 1, perfect for letting the people know that your drug dealing escapades have led you to the creme de la creme of society, and you are finally earning the big bucks. The price of the Manor is the same as the game’s current most expensive property, The Warehouse. Many players are hoping that this property’s price will increase to at least $100,000 when it arrives, which will make it more of a challenge.</p>



<p>Schedule 1’s The Manor property is also the most scenic property in the game right now. It is essentially a large mansion built on top of a hill. It looks over one of the game’s regions and has forest cover. It is an excellent location for the players to relax while their drug-dealing operation runs rampant across different regions. However, players should know that the developer hasn’t officially confirmed the new property.</p>

<p>Barely two weeks after A Minecraft Movie was released, a sequel was demanded by the rabid fanbase. It honors the franchise and brings Minecraft to life in ways never thought possible, and if a sequel does happen, you’d have to think it would be as big a smash hit.</p>



<p>Jack Black, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jason-momoa-promotes-minecraft-movie-by-saying-he-doesnt-let-his-kids-play-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Momoa</a>, and co. had the difficult task of bringing to life one of the most successful franchises of all time. Minecraft has earned billions from game sales, merchandise, and much more. But A Minecraft Movie is a different beast. It hasn’t disappointed moviegoers who helped the movie earn over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$300 million in its first weekend</a>.</p>



<p>Its success has grown daily, fueling speculation of a successor. We’ve got the latest on a new movie, and whether this is becoming a fully fledged film franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-minecraft-movie-2-sequel-status-explained">Will There Be A Minecraft Movie 2? Sequel Status Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I feel for you, buddy. Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to an interview, plans for A Minecraft Movie sequel are “imminent.”</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/warner-bros-mike-de-luca-pam-abdy-courage-in-face-of-brutal-press-coverage-1236366618/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> interviewed Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy from Warner Bros. about the future of A Minecraft Movie and the potential for a sequel. When queried about the plans for a Minecraft sequel, De Luca had this to say: <strong>“Imminently. The ink might not be dry on the deals yet, but imminently.”</strong></p>



<p>This comes days after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film’s director, Jared Hess, said</a>: “He would have a blast doing the sequel.” He said there were many ideas and concepts they couldn’t fit into this film, so it makes for a sequel to follow and to include a lot more of the source material that didn’t make the cut the first time around.</p>



<p>An imminent sequel is hardly a surprise given the overwhelming success of A Minecraft Movie.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-a-minecraft-movie-2-sequel-be-about">What Could A Minecraft Movie 2 Sequel be About?</h2>



<p><strong>There are still many new characters, enemies, and ideas that could be introduced in A Minecraft Movie 2 Sequel, but the end of the original film gives away some big details.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Spoiler Alert—I’m about to briefly discuss what happens after the credits roll in A Minecraft Movie. You have been warned.</strong></p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-minecraft-movie-runtime-explained-does-it-have-a-post-credits-scene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-credits cutscene to prolong its runtime</a>. In it, Steve turns up at a house with the hope of going into the attic. We find out the house belongs to a person named Alex—who Minecraft fans will instantly recognize.</p>



<p>We don’t know if this is a mini one-off for Alex or if they could feature heavily in a sequel. We’ll have to wait and see!</p>

<p>We hope you’re enjoying A Minecraft Movie, and listening to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disclaimer about not throwing popcorn</a>.
