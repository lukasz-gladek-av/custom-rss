            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is one of the biggest games of 2025 by far, boasting a massive player base, a stunning delivery, and the promise of plenty more content to come. It’s an electrifying extraction adventure that millions of people have bought into, and it’s challenging the likes of Escape from Tarkov with<strong> ease</strong>.</p>



<p>However, regardless of how good ARC Raiders is, there are still plenty of features players want to see added in 2026. What follows below are the <strong>7 </strong>features that we want to see added to ARC Raiders in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-7-arc-raiders-changes-we-want-to-see">7 ARC Raiders Changes We Want to See</h2>



<h3 id="h-pve-servers-or-modes">PvE Servers or Modes</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fighting other players in ARC Raiders is a core part of the central gameplay experience, but it would be nice if there were also a PvE-exclusive mode or server selection that users could jump into to have an ‘easier ride’. For some, PvP is too punishing and stressful, and it would be great if Embark Studios could accommodate those players with their own ‘ecosystem’.</p>



<p>If Escape from Tarkov can muster up a PvE mode, then ARC Raiders should be able to do it too.</p>



<h3 id="h-better-outfit-customization">Better Outfit Customization</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders has a stunning array of outfits, but they’re just that, <strong>outfits</strong>. It would be brilliant if players could cherry-pick parts of outfits to equip on their character, rather than throwing on something whole and mostly static. What if I love the helmet on one outfit but think it would go better with a jacket on another outfit?</p>



<p>It would likely be hard to implement as the outfits are intricately designed one by one, but some kind of transmog feature in ARC Raiders would be great.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-maps">New Maps</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is an obvious one, but we want to see more maps in ARC Raiders in 2026. The game has a neat assortment of maps already, but there’s a world of potential out there. It’s a known fact that Embark Studios plans to add plenty more, but it’s not just about getting new maps; it’s about getting <strong>quality maps </strong>that are a wonder to explore.</p>



<p>The first new map, released in November 2025, was Stella Montis, and it proved to be a die-hard PvP map with tight quarters and narrow sightlines.</p>



<h3 id="h-item-insurance">Item Insurance</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In some extraction games, <strong>item insurance </strong>is a core mechanic that allows you to recoup some losses when you’re killed in action. In ARC Raiders, that’s not a feature. If you die in the field, your equipment will be lost forever. The only difference to that rule is when you’re killed by a cheater, Embark Studios will refund your equipment.</p>



<p>If they can do it for cheaters, then surely they can implement a mechanic that allows users to insure their items, so if they die in a raid, they get their loadout back after a few hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-less-punishing-stamina-mechanics">Less Punishing Stamina Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The stamina mechanics in ARC Raiders are a bane for many players. They’re too strict in many ways, and when your stamina bar empties while you’re running away from an engagement, you’ll find that you almost stop dead on the spot, unable to move. In a desperate situation, it’s far too unrealistic, and it leaves players feeling frustrated quite often.</p>



<p>Even when you’ve maximized your stamina-focused skill points, it still feels as though your stamina bar empties too quickly. Better stamina mechanics would make for a new feature in ARC Raiders in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-expedition-adjustments">Expedition Adjustments</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Expedition Project is the optional wipe mechanic in ARC Raiders, and it allows players to donate stacks of resources to escape Speranza into the great beyond. Once they’ve done that, they’ll be left with a new and fresh character, ready to go again. However, the requirements for completing an Expedition Project are pretty insane.</p>



<p>To get the maximum rewards possible from completing an Extraction Project, you need to have a stash value (coins included) of <strong>five million</strong>. It feels inaccessible for the more casual gamers who will be left out in the cold when they realize they won’t gain much from their Expedition Project.</p>



<h3 id="h-more-achievements">More Achievements</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders has a fine assortment of achievements and trophies, but they’re far too easy to unlock just by exploring the game and ticking a few boxes. As the game is a live-service title that’s set to evolve over a number of years, it would be good to see more achievements surface with the successive updates that hit the game.</p>



<p>This keeps completionists occupied and able to enjoy the game more. If you play ARC Raiders for around 50 hours and see all there is to see, it’s a fair chance you’ll have almost unlocked all the achievements.</p>







<p>What would you like to see added to ARC Raiders in the next year or so? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When is Hytale Early Access Coming Out? 1.0 Release Date, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The revived Hytale project also comes with an early access release date. Hypixel Studios is hard at work on the casual sandbox title, and it needs a lot of rigorous testing before it can be officially launched to the public.</p>



<p>One of 2025’s coolest moments was the announcement that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was back</a>. OG founder Simon Collins-Laflamme managed to reclaim the rights to the game, and work began to restore and improve upon a 4-year-old build. This means there is a <em>lot</em> to do, much work to carry out, making early access a necessity for Hytale.</p>



<p>If you want to get involved, play, and contribute to its ongoing development, you should buy and play Hytale early access.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-early-access-release-date">Hytale Early Access Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Children of the corn. Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can start playing Hytale early access from January 13, 2026, and it’s available to pre-purchase right now.</strong></p>



<p>It’s been quite a hasty turnaround for Hytale’s fortunes. It was only mid-November when Hypixel Studio—led by Collins-Laflamme—let the world know that development resumed. Soon after, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC performance &amp; system requirements were revealed</a>, and now we’re already talking about early access starting.</p>



<p>Early access sounds like a must for Hytale, and you might want to get used to this fact.</p>







<h2 id="h-do-we-know-hytale-s-full-release-date">Do We Know Hytale’s Full Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You would not want these with your chips. Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Founder and creator Simon Collins-Laflamme has confirmed that the full 1.0 launch won’t be happening for “at least a few years.”</strong></p>



<p>Hytale will be a 10-year project for the team, and will not use investors, publishers, or any other external source of funding. This is a tight-knit team working hard on a pure passion project to realise the game that was thought dead not long ago.</p>



<p>In a Hytale <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a>, the game’s full launch was addressed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Early access duration:</strong>&nbsp;Expected to last at least a few years; no rush to 1.0.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no pulling the wool over an early access patron’s eyes here; the developer is giving Hytale Escape From Tarkov-levels of early access to ensure it’s as ready as can be come the 1.0 release. Hypixel Studios has ample time to craft the perfect sandbox experience and execute its vision.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege Servers Shut Down After Massive Hack]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-hack-servers-shut-down-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>1393009</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a massive hack, Ubisoft has temporarily shut down the servers for Rainbow Six Siege and its marketplace on all platforms. The hack resulted in players getting multiple developer-only skins, billions of credits, and, in some cases, a ban.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has been one of Ubisoft’s most successful outings in the multiplayer field. Filling stadiums with fans for eSports competitions and multiple updates make it still a popular title. However, <a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2004901721336590703?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports of a possible hacking</a> arose this morning, with players being banned and seeing multiple messages of server-wide bans spelling out lyrics and controversial statements. In addition, some recieved rare and developer-only skins for characters and billions of in-game credits, amounting to tens of thousands of dollars. Now, Ubisoft has spoked up about it, resulting in a temporary server shutdown.</p>







<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-siege-temporarily-shut-down-on-all-platforms-after-incident-claims-ubisoft">Rainbow Six Siege Temporarily Shut Down on All Platforms After ‘Incident’, Claims Ubisoft</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>While fans saw the damage of the hack prior, Ubisoft started to investigate the ‘incident’ before, an hour later, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004943312390926740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcing a shutdown of the servers</a> for Rainbow Six Siege and the Marketplace. Fans did note that the company <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">did not claim</a> it was a hack, which undermines the potentially harmful situation. Regardless, it’s unclear how long the shutdown will be in effect and who/what may have been responsible.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for Ubisoft, as discussed before, the damages are quite large, with players getting billions of credits and rare skins, all in-game purchases. Hacks in the gaming scene <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-hacking-incident-reveals-major-security-flaw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aren’t too common</a> and, sadly, the Rainbow Six Siege one is quite harmful. It couldn’t have come at a worse time, as many are on Holiday break and now have time to play. However, given the circumstances, it may be for the best, as it’s unclear the extent of the hack and how it’ll affect players.</p>

<p>2025 was a massive year for Xbox Game Pass members, who not only got to play the Game of the Year for 2025, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, but also a mix of bag of some really exciting titles, including Hollow Knight: Silksong, Ninja Gaiden 4, and many more.

<p>Like all subscription services, Xbox Game Pass offers a vast selection of games for players to try each month, and it usually offers more than other services. A lot of these titles are Day One releases as well, with Game Pass adding all Xbox Game Studios published games to the library on release day. Check out Insider Gaming’s top picks for Xbox Game Pass 2025 Games below. </p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-xbox-game-pass-games-released-in-2025">Top 10 Xbox Game Pass Games Released in 2025</h2>

The game also received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-major-free-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major free update</a> recently. </p>



<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</h3>

<p>The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered is a remaster of Bethesda’s 2006 hit title, featuring visual and gameplay enhancements for current-gen systems.

<h3 id="h-rematch">Rematch</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rematch is a brand-new soccer/football title developed by the developers of Sifu. It features a unique take on games inspired by this sport, skipping team-based gameplay for single-player control. The perspective’s changed too; you play in third person, controlling just one character in a 5v5 match. Your individual skill and your ability to be a team player matter most in this title. Players are also able to pull off signature moves that only the best football athletes can perform.</p>



<h3 id="h-south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>In South of Midnight, players take on the role of Hazel, a Weaver who is a magical restorer of broken bonds and spirits. The game is set in a fantastical world inspired by Southern folklore, featuring its myths and creatures. As the protagonist, Hazel will confront dangerous creatures while uncovering secrets about her family. The players also have to rescue Hazel’s mother, save her hometown, and use her ancient power to restore creatures and uncover the traumas that consume them in this action-adventure.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</h3>

<h3 id="h-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-nbsp-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 +&nbsp;4</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a fan of skating games or are just looking to get into one, then this could be your go-to. It features everything players loved from the previous games, with everything enhanced for current-gen systems, along with new skaters, parks, tricks, and music. It also features cross-platform multiplayer, expanded Create-A-Skater and Create-A-Park modes, and simple-to-learn controls. </p>



<h3 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-nbsp">Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong was arguably the most anticipated game of 2025 and also one of the best indie games to come out this year. It also won the best action-adventure award at The Game Awards 2025, beating nominees like Death Stranding 2, Ghost of Yotei, and more. You get to play as the lethal hunter Hornet, who was kidnapped and taken to an unfamiliar world. You will be tasked to fight against some serious enemies, unearth huge secrets of your past, discover new powers, and more, all while ascending to this kingdom’s peak. The developers have also announced a new DLC for 2026 called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-expansion-sea-of-sorrow-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Sorrow</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-nbsp">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7&nbsp;</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 may not be the most popular title on this list, but it is currently the newest Call of Duty game available to Game Pass members at no additional cost. Set in the year 2035, players can engage in a single-player or co-op campaign. The game features a variety of multiplayer maps and introduces an upgraded omnimovement system. Additionally, it brings back Treyarch’s classic round-based Zombies mode.</p>



<h3 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 marks the return of the popular high-speed combat franchise. It builds upon the “philosophy with the stylish, dynamic action gameplay of PlatinumGames”, providing visually pleasing combat blended with ninja techniques that can be used to unleash destruction on your enemies. The game is set in a near-future Tokyo cursed by an endless rain of miasma, where you play as the young ninja prodigy, Yakumo, who has to fight cybernetic ninja soldiers and otherworldly creatures while reconciling his destiny with legendary Ryu Hayabusa. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gamings-best-shooter-game-of-the-year-2025/</link>
            <guid>1392937</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 wasn’t incredible for new shooters, in all honesty. There’s still a lot of reliance on existing live-service shooters, but the year did manage to throw up some amazing new highlights. Insider Gaming has identified one shooter that stood above the rest in 2025.</p>



<p>Between first-person shooters and third-person shooters, there’s a lot to feast on. 2025 might have been dominated by action-adventure games and indie darlings, but the gaming community is still being treated to AAA shooters capable of delivering immense action and gunplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a>‘s 2025 shooter of the year might cause some debate, but there’s plenty of cause to agree.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-shooter-game-of-2025-winner-battlefield-6">Best Shooter Game Of 2025 Winner—Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boom, headshot! Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 was considered the point of no return for EA and the iconic shooter. Battlefield 2042 did almost irreparable damage to the Battlefield name, and if BF 6 didn’t completely deliver, it was probably over. Thankfully, Battlefield 6 is a gargantuan first-person shooter that reminds us all why players crave an alternative to standard point-and-aim shooters.</p>



<p>Yes, the campaign is underwhelming and fairly forgettable, if not worth a brief jaunt to warm you up for the online multiplayer. Everyone knows this is where Battlefield thrives. Some maps could be a tiny bit bigger, but this will come with time. It does mean you get the most intense and exhilarating action around you: Whether it’s the majesty and splendor or vehicles crashing bullets and shells on metal, a jet soaring overhead straight out of bounds because no one knows how to fly them, or the earth-shaking destruction of a crumbling building.</p>



<p>There’s a reason why Best Audio Design at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> went to Battlefield 6. There’s absolutely no title in history that captures the second-by-second thrill of war. It was tough to see if we’d ever get another strong BF game again, and with the addition of RedSec’s Battle Royale and free content, EA has delivered the full package.</p>

<p>This was a close one, in all honesty. ARC Raiders has been the viral shooter sensation of 2025. Initial reactions to playtests were very positive, almost too positive. Embark Studios shrugged off suggestions that the initial hype couldn’t continue, and the October 30 launch was an instant hit.</p>



<p>Two months after launch and ARC Raiders was still hitting well above six figures in player count. The extraction shooter gained a reputation as a friendly addition to the merciless genre—Escape From Tarkov and Gray Zone Warfare are no free lunch—and might be the most accessible extraction shooter around.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders did create a new genre</a>.</p>







<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>

<p>DOOM is in a weird spot at the moment. The 2016 reboot was phenomenal, and it’s a matter of taste if you prefer DOOM: Eternal’s parkour-centric elements. One thing most agree on is that DOOM: The Dark Ages is a slight step back from the pair—but it’s still a brutal and bombastic affair. The Dark Ages’ prequel aesthetic and decision to lean more heavily into the story and cutscenes are hit and miss. DOOM isn’t one of the most celebrated shooter franchises ever because of its narrative storytelling, let’s face it.</p>



<p>But the core gameplay remains punchy and powerful. The parry mechanic and Saw Shield add nice variation; on the other hand, the dragon sequences are gimmicky and unnecessary, and in trying to change too much, some of DOOM 2016’s implicity has been lost. Still,  you’re assured a breathless ride, and fingers crossed the next DOOM reins in the creativity a smidge.</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>

<p>Whereas Borderlands 4 throws a lot of new ideas at the wall, and mostly scores. The open-world design works, and you can find unopened cans of chaos around every corner. The template remains unchanged: Four Vault Hunters to choose from with different abilities, saving the world, finding vaults, and collecting enough guns to use on the fire for Winter!</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how Borderlands 4 fared at launch had Gearbox released the game in a fully working state. The performance issues destroyed the game’s chances of ubiquitous fanfare from all corners. Borderlands 4 shows that Gearbox has more ideas up its sleeves—the Grapple Hook and jetpacks are fun—and even more is needed if the next game is to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break 100 million units</a>.</p>



<p>Did any shooter that’s not Battlefield 6 get your vote for best shooter of 2025? Is it something that didn’t even make it onto our list, like a certain Black Ops 7?
