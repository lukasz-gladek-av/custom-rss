            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1 has just received a new Steam beta update, which adds a rival cartel, the Benzies Family, along with some additional content. </p>



<p>Players have been patiently waiting for a new Schedule 1 content update for some time now, and it has finally arrived. The developer hosted a community vote in June, where they asked players what content they wanted in the next update: Rival Cartel, Police Expansion, or Shrooms. Everyone wanted a rival cartel. </p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-welcomes-the-benzies-family-cartel-in-the-new-update">Schedule 1 Welcomes the Benzies Family Cartel in the New Update</h2>



<p>The game’s cartel update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">version 0.4.0</a>, is now available through the Steam beta branch of Schedule 1. The developer had expected to release this update last month, but underestimated the work required to complete it. At the same time, they have been working simultaneously on official Steam Deck Support and the Console Port for Schedule 1, which is scheduled to arrive later this year. Let’s get into the new update below. </p>



<h4 id="h-schedule-1-rival-cartel-features-and-interactions">Schedule 1 Rival Cartel Features and Interactions</h4>



<p>Benzies Family is the new powerful rival cartel that can be found in Schedule 1’s Hyland point. Players will be able to encounter them after unlocking a few customers at Westville. </p>



<p>The interactions with the Benzies’ family include cartel-player deals when both are trusted, ambushes, dealer robberies, dead drop theft, and cartel-customer deals. Seems like the cartel can be helpful when truced and painful when not. </p>



<h4 id="h-new-schedule-1-property-the-manor">New Schedule 1 Property: ‘The Manor’</h4>



<p>Next is Schedule 1’s new purchasable property, the Hyland Manor. However, to purchase this property, players must first complete the Benzies family storyline. Many might recall that a few months ago, a player <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-player-has-stumbled-upon-a-potential-upcoming-property/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> a brand-new property in the game called ‘The Manor’ (see the similarities there?). Moreover, this was by far the largest property in the game, featuring four bedrooms on the first floor and two spacious reception rooms on the ground floor.</p>



<h4 id="h-new-schedule-1-weapons-vehicles-cosmetics-and-more">New Schedule 1 Weapons, Vehicles, Cosmetics, and More</h4>



<ul>
<li>That’s not all, the latest update includes a pump shotgun and shotgun shells to use with it. </li>



<li>A new vehicle called ‘Hotbox’ has been added, which is very much on brand. </li>



<li>Regarding cosmetics, three new hairstyles have been added: close buzzcut, Tony, and long slicked back. </li>



<li>Three new commands have been added: ‘setgravitymultiplier’, ‘setregionunlocked’, and ‘forcesleep’. </li>



<li>Lastly, players will find more loading screen hints after this update. </li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-schedule-1-tweaks-and-improvements">Schedule 1 Tweaks and Improvements  </h4>



<p>Several changes have been made to improve the gameplay experience. </p>



<ul>
<li>Players will now find that each region has a ‘cartel influence’ level associated with it; you must bring that down to progress to the new region. </li>



<li>Players can now view the dialogue of other players talking to NPCs in multiplayer. </li>



<li>Deals will be cancelled when the assigned dealer is dead/unconscious. </li>



<li>Unconscious NPCs that are dropped in the ocean will be killed. </li>



<li>Dead/unconscious NPCs and police can be pickpocketed. </li>



<li>Once a customer is attacked, they will not place any orders with the player for 72 hours. </li>



<li>The braking properties of all vehicles have been adjusted.</li>



<li>Non-police NPCs have been given ranged weapons. </li>



<li>Police and NPCs can now “ometimes predict future target position instead of pathing directly to the target.”</li>



<li>Flashlight brightness has been adjusted. </li>



<li>Several minor scripts have been refactored. </li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Fixed various mislabellings in employee tutorial quests.</li>



<li>Fixed two light beams being visible when the flashlight is equipped.</li>



<li>Fixed scuffed NPC ragdoll LODs/culling.</li>



<li>Fixed some missing walls at Hyland Medical.</li>



<li>Fixed third-person recoil animation for the M1911 and Revolver.</li>



<li>Fixed the networth calculator algorithm, which did not factor in some item quantities.</li>



<li>Fixed vehicle impacts doing too much damage to NPCs.</li>



<li>Fixed some missing fonts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-is-getting-graffiti-soon">Schedule 1 is Getting Graffiti Soon</h2>



<p>The developer for Schedule 1 posted a new video on <a href="https://x.com/Tyler_TVGS/status/1955953753426944131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), stating that graffiti could be included in the next beta patch or the one after. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jurassic-park-survival-will-feature-landmarks-%E2%80%98fans-wish-they-saw%E2%80%99-in-original-movie.1270023/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Jurassic Park: Survival is bringing fans back to the beloved location of Isla Nubar, and, while there will be many familiar environments to explore, it will also feature landmarks “fans wish they saw” in the original movie.</p>



<p>Developed by Saber Interactive, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-park-survival-details-on-new-characters-more-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jurassic Park: Survival</a> takes place a day after the events in the 1993 movie and is being perfectly handcrafted to replicate the scenes we all know and love.</p>



<p>There’s more to experience, however, with locations to explore that were discussed for the Steven Spielberg movie but eventually not featured, and now fans will have an opportunity to delve deeper into the lore of the movie.</p>



<h2 id="h-jurassic-park-survival-offers-more-isla-nubar-exploration">Jurassic Park: Survival Offers More Isla Nubar Exploration</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Iconic moments. Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a behind-the-scenes featurette published on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4eXQMah9C4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, Universal products and experiences executive producer John Melchior listed facilities, buildings, attractions under construction, and a hotel under construction as areas that can be explored.</p>



<p>He describes the environments as being something that “fans wish they saw” in the original movie, elements that were talked about in the movie and lore, but, until now, not physically conceived.</p>



<p>SVP of franchise management at Universal Pictures Shayne Mifsud added that the game “gives you more time to be able to explore new locations.”</p>



<p>Those wanting a trip down memory lane won’t be disappointed, though, as Melchior detailed the immense process of recreating the iconic environments from the movie down to the exact positions of props.</p>



<p>“We go through room by room, level by level, looking at every possible resource from archives, the film, production reels, production blueprints, to make sure every prop is in the same place.”</p>



<p>One of the memorable locations that players will be thrust into is the infamous kitchen scene while being hunted by raptors, which will put players in the exact situation that Lex and Tim did over 30 years ago.</p>



<p>Jurassic Park: Survival’s release window has not yet been announced, though we know the title will be released on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/game-pass-makes-developers-wage-slaves-former-playstation-boss-says/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-pass-makes-developers-%E2%80%98wage-slaves%E2%80%99-former-playstation-boss-says.1270020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A former PlayStation Boss has commented on Game Pass, stating that it isn’t inspiring for game developers and makes them “wage slaves.” </p>



<p>Game Pass is Xbox’s premium subscription service, providing console, PC, and cloud players with access to a library of games for a fee. Every month, waves of new games are added to the service, ranging from large-scale AAA to solo indie titles. However, many have wondered whether putting your games on subscription services like Game Pass can be profitable for developers, and the former PlayStation boss has weighed in on the topic. </p>



<h2 id="h-game-pass-is-not-creating-value">Game Pass is ‘Not Creating Value’</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-one-i-dont-know-if-games-are-recession-proof" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameIndustry.Biz</a>, former Sony Worldwide Studios chairman Shawn Layden spoke candidly about Game Pass as a service. Layden first said that there are many debates about Game Pass profitability, but that’s “not the right question to ask.” Companies can do all kinds of financial jiggery-pokery for any sort of corporate service to make it look profitable.” The real question here would be, is Game Pass “healthy for the developer”? </p>



<p>Layden elaborates that the subscription model of Game Pass makes developers essentially “wage slaves”. The service is “not creating value” by putting the game in the marketplace, hoping that it does well, and then profit sharing and overages. According to Layden, it’s more like “You pay me X dollars an hour, I built you a game, here, go put it on your servers.” He concluded, stating he doesn’t think Game Pass is “really inspiring for game developers”. </p>



<p><span>In other news, the Xbox Game Pass&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-for-august-2025/" target="_blank">wave 1 for August 2025</a></span>&nbsp;has been revealed, and it includes Assassin’s Creed Mirage. Additionally, Sarah Bond has joined the board of directors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sarah-bond-xbox-expertise-tyson-foods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at Tyson Foods</a> while retaining her position at Xbox. Do you agree with the former PlayStation boss stating Game Pass makes developers “wage slaves”?

            <title><![CDATA[Lords of the Fallen 2 Will Be Revealed During Gamescom]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-revealed-during-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lords-of-the-fallen-2-will-be-revealed-during-gamescom.1269978/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been announced (kind of) that Lords of the Fallen 2, an assumed follow-up to 2023’s Lords of the Fallen, will be revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase. Not much is known about the sequel, but in a bizarre twist, the developer’s CEO confirmed the impending announcement after Geoff Keighley teased it on social media.</p>



<p>While the Lords of the Fallen release in 2023 didn’t move mountains, subsequent updates polished the game up quite nicely to make it a pretty strong Soulslike with an innovative core concept.</p>



<h2 id="h-lords-of-the-fallen-2-coming-soon">Lords of the Fallen 2 – Coming Soon</h2>



<p>On social media, Geoff Keighley, the host of the Opening Night Live showcase, posted a reference to a new game being revealed at next week’s show. It was an image of a ‘II’ graphic, seemingly drawn in blood, with the caption ‘Blood Will Spill’.</p>



<p>From what Geoff said, it seems as though the trailer will be the first thing to play at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live show.</p>



<p>Shortly after Keighley posted his teaser, the CEO at CI Games, Marek Tyminski, shared the image and simply wrote: ‘Lords of the Fallen II’.</p>



<p>That’s it – the most basic announcement I’ve ever seen for a new game.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In 2023, I had the pleasure of being one of the first people in the UK to play Lords of the Fallen. In my subsequent preview, I wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Lords of the Fallen is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most impressive games I’ve played in recent years. As I explored this dark, twisted universe that’s split between two parallel words, I found myself sucked in and desperate to progress through the game despite its challenges – and there were plenty of those.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s possible we might even get a release date for Lords of the Fallen 2, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-new-details/">it was confirmed recently</a> that it’ll be dropping in 2026.</p>



<p>In this world populated so heavily by Soulslike games, what’s one more? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you’re looking forward to Lords of the Fallen 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-open-beta-weekend-2-goes-live-and-instantly-hits-huge-player-counts.1269975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is back for more with a new Open Beta event, with this one running from August 14 to 17 and opening up new maps and modes for players worldwide. The hype surrounding EA’s next big shooter is unparalleled, and as soon as the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 event kicked off, hundreds of thousands of players flooded the platform.</p>



<p>On Steam alone, more than 300,000 users poured into Battlefield 6, which continues to impress fans both old and new.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end">When Does The Battlefield 6 Beta End?</h2>



<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta is set to run until August 17, at which point it’ll be shut down, and any findings produced will be used by Electronic Arts’ studios to finesse the intense and destructive first-person shooter. The full game will be released on October 10, which seems like an age away when the anticipation for this game is <strong>so high</strong>.</p>



<p>When the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 kicked off today, it caused the player count on Steam to immediately swell beyond 300,000 concurrent users. While some dropped because of the pesky DLSS issue that has surfaced, the count stayed pretty strong, and going into the weekend, it could rival the record secured by the game last week.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Last weekend, during the first Open Beta phase, Battlefield 6 secured a peak player count of 517,000 users, beating every Call of Duty game ever hosted on Steam. It also hit more than 800,000 viewers on Twitch, effortlessly walking over every Call of Duty game bar Warzone.</p>



<p>In other Battlefield news, it has been claimed by a prominent dataminer that Battlefield 2042 is about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-update-surprisingly-big-soon/">to get a massive update</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[4 Best Defensive Playbooks in Madden 26]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/4-best-defensive-playbooks-in-madden-26/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/4-best-defensive-playbooks-in-madden-26.1269945/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The rapidly approaching new NFL season also means a new Madden game to enjoy, with Madden 26 now available. While all eyes may be on your offense, having a strong defense is crucial, so we’ve selected some of the best defensive playbooks.</p>



<p>Regardless of your game mode of choice, defensive playbooks are vital for success in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-review-a-mixed-bag-of-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden 26</a>, even if you’ve settled into a strong offensive output using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-offensive-playbooks-madden-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best offensive playbooks</a> in the game. </p>



<p>Rather than sifting through all the teams to find the right defensive playbook for you, however, we can make things much easier by pointing you in the direction of the best defensive playbooks Madden 26 has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-defensive-playbooks-in-madden-26">Best Defensive Playbooks in Madden 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rock solid. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</h3>



<p>With a variety of strong formations, the Green Bay Packers’ defensive playbook is a solid choice, particularly when you’re just starting to get to grips with <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>. With 4-3 and 4-6 formations included, it’s great for defending against both the running and passing game.</p>



<p>One of the biggest strengths, however, is the variety of Nickel approaches, putting your Linebackers pretty much anywhere you want them to. This allows for regular pressure on any opposition quarterback, forcing opposing players into mistakes.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</h3>



<p>Another option for any player who wants their defensive setup to be highly versatile is the New England Patriots defensive playbook, which includes 3-4, 4-3, and 4-4 formations. If you’re new to Madden 26, it’s another solid option to get you started while you get a feel for the game.</p>



<p>There’s also decent Nickel and Dime options, the latter being some of the best formations in the game. Essentially, the Patriots playbook fits into pretty much every category you’d want it to, ticking off all the boxes.</p>



<h3 id="h-kansas-city-chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</h3>



<p>The strong 4-2-5 formation choices in the Kansas City Chiefs defensive playbook is great for defending against the passing game and, surprisingly, there’s still an abundance of Blitz options to put pressure on the opposing quarterback and halting the running game.</p>



<p>You’ll need to call upon your cornerbacks for a lot of these Blitzes, however, but with an abundance of deep coverage, it shouldn’t leave you too exposed. Once you get used to things, it can be a really effective playbook option.</p>



<h3 id="h-detroit-lions">Detroit Lions</h3>



<p>The 3-3 formation is a fan-favorite in the Madden series and the Detroit Lions rely heavily on this setup in their defensive playbook. You’ll have more than enough options to call upon and, while it might not stand out at first glance, I highly recommend trying it out.</p>



<p>Other options include 4-3 and 3-4 formations, as well as Nickel and Dime, but, in truth, it’s fairly limited in that capacity. If the 3-3 is your calling though, look no further.</p>
