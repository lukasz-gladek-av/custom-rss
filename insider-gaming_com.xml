<p>According to the numbers provided in Take-Two Interactive’s latest earnings release, Red Dead Redemption 2 has become the fourth best-selling game of all time in terms of units sold. </p>



<p>Rockstar Games dominates the gaming industry, a fact widely acknowledged due to the developer’s remarkable portfolio. However, they have outdone themselves this time around by having not one, but two games in the best-selling titles of all time list: Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-has-sold-over-79-million-units-surpassing-mario-kart-8">Red Dead Redemption 2 Has Sold Over 79 Million Units, Surpassing Mario Kart 8</h2>



<p>As revealed during Take-Two’s latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/2b782ec8-e583-4f7b-a213-86f2d1dbce40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings call</a>, Red Dead Redemption 2 has surpassed 79 million units, and the series has sold a total of 106 million units globally. Moreover, analyst data reveals that RDR2 has been the “best-selling title of the past 7 years in the US based on dollar sales.” Additionally, Red Dead Online comes free with every copy of Red Dead Redemption 2, and a standalone online version was also released in 2020.</p>



<p>Mario Kart 8 was previously at the fourth spot for best-selling games of all time (units sold), with the title pushing 78.02 million copies across the Wii U and Nintendo Switch. Now Red Dead Redemption 2 has taken its place, and the only games ahead of it are Wii Sports with 82.9 million units (bundled with Wii U consoles), Grand Theft Auto 5 with over 220 million units sold-in to date, and in the first spot, we have Minecraft with over 350 million sold.</p>



<p>In other news, Red Dead Redemption 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-doubted-budget-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met with skepticism</a> due to budget and timeline issues. Additionally, GTA 6’s delay <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-delay-could-impact-halo-remake-gears-e-day-next-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could impact games</a> like Halo Remake, Gears E-Day, and the next Call of Duty.

<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is releasing digitally on the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 4, 2025. </p>



<p>Mario Kart is the franchise that has dominated Nintendo’s consoles in the racing genre for the longest time, with the latest entry to the franchise, Mario Kart World, already nearing 10 million units. However, a new competitor is entering this space, and it will make its grand debut on the platform next month. </p>

Moreover, players who already own the Switch version can purchase the upgrade pack for the latest console. The Switch 2 version of Sonic Racing CrossWorlds will offer players improved graphics resolution and higher frame rates. The release date for the physical version has not been revealed; however, we do know it will use a game card. </p>

Additionally, if the upgrade pack is purchased from 8:00 AM on December 4, 2025, to 7:59 AM on December 11, 2025 (UTC+8), it will cost half the price. </p>



<p>Furthermore, suppose players are looking to purchase the the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Season Pass at a discounted price. In that case, they can do so by purchasing both Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Digital Deluxe Edition for Nintendo Switch, which includes the base game, season pass, and upgrade pack. Also, saved data can be transferred from Switch 1 to Switch 2. </p>

<p>Zombies returns in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and there’s plenty to sink your teeth into, including the main quest that advances the story and provides a bunch of easter eggs.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, and Zombies is a huge part of the launch, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several maps planned</a>, the return of Dead Ops Arcade, and plenty more teases.</p>



<p>For those wanting to dive immediately into the main quest in Black Ops 7, we’ve got all the details on when you can get your journey started.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-black-ops-7-zombies-main-quest-launch">When Does The Black Ops 7 Zombies Main Quest Launch?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Waiting. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The main quest in Black Ops 7 Zombies will be available from 10 AM PT on Friday, November 14.</strong></p>



<p>This release is over 12 hours after the main release of Black Ops 7, so you will have to wait a little longer once you jump into the game for the main quest to go live.</p>



<p>Additionally, Directed Mode will not be available at launch or when the main quest goes live. Instead, Directed Mode will land at the start of Season 01 later in the year.</p>



<p>The table below shows the release times for the main quest in Black Ops 7 Zombies in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">3 AM – Nov. 15</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zombies-before-the-main-quest-launch">Can You Play Zombies Before The Main Quest Launch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Zombies will be fully playable as soon as Black Ops 7 launches, and you don’t need to wait for the main quest launch to jump into the mode.</strong></p>



<p>However, many secrets will be locked at this stage, likely meaning you won’t have full access to all the available Wonder Weapons, and other Easter Eggs won’t be live.</p>



<p>You will be able to play the mode and level up your account, however, which is required to access features like Research, and Zombies will remain a great place to gain the XP needed to push through the early player levels in Call of Duty.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It seems like PlayStation 5 players can look forward to Los Santos once more, as GTA 5 is reportedly coming back to PS Plus in November 2025. This is likely to offset any disappointment over the newest GTA 6 delay.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games is having an interesting time as of late. Take-Two delivered the news we were all dreading on November 6 by declaring that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 was delayed to November 2026</a>. This led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-second-delay-stock-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two’s stock price dropping by 10%</a>, leaving the community in tatters. PlayStation is allegedly trying to appease the handful of people who haven’t played GTA yet by making GTA 5 a PS Plus game again.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-5-makes-its-triumphant-return-to-ps-plus">GTA 5 Makes Its Triumphant Return To PS Plus</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hi again, Trevor. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We divert to the ever-reliable billbil-kun over at <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dealabs</a> for their exclusive GTA PS Plus story.</p>



<p>According to billbil-kun:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Based on our recent investigations, we can say that&nbsp;Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;will be one of the new titles that will be added to the PS Plus game catalog. Rockstar Games’ cult classic game is set to be available&nbsp;from November 18, 2025&nbsp;for all PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not the GTA you want to see on PlayStation Plus, we know that (we feel the pain, too), but it’s at least something to keep us ticking over for another agonizing, painful 12 months of waiting and twiddling our thumbs.</p>



<p>Just as a reminder, you must have one of PS Plus’s more expensive tiers to download and play GTA 5. The Essentials tier misses out, and this is vital information for potential GTA 5 players.</p>



<p>Like before, don’t expect Grand Theft Auto 5 to be on PS Plus forever either. This will be for a limited duration—presumably a few months—so make the most of a new playthrough or some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-now-included-with-gta-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a> shenanigans to kill time.</p>



<p>This is a fairly moot question at this point, but what do you make of the GTA 6 delay? Would you rather Rockstar release it when they are 100% sure it’s ready? Or debut it sooner, and release lots of patches soon after?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The gaming world is reeling from the announcement that Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed to November 2026, and the latest GTA 6 delay could have repercussions for a host of other releases.</p>



<p>Rockstar Games announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 would be delayed until November 19</a>, almost six months on from the previously stated May release, extending the long wait for the latest entry in the beloved series.</p>



<p>While gamers around the world are expressing concerns that this still might not be the final release date, developers across the globe will also have to deal with a major reshuffle in the calendar, and it could be Microsoft that is impacted the most.</p>



<h2 id="h-fall-2026-shaping-up-to-be-huge-with-gta-6-delay">Fall 2026 Shaping Up To Be Huge With GTA 6 Delay</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Repercussions. Image via Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/DMC_Ryan/status/1986543677095960746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey</a>, Microsoft has some major releases that are likely to drop in the Fall 2026 window, including Halo: Campaign Evolved, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brings the franchise to PlayStation</a>, Gears of War: E-Day, Fable, and the 2026 instalment of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Though the Fall 2026 window is spread out and has several months to release titles, it’s also one of the busiest periods for gaming with a host of regular annual releases deploying in that period, including the likes of EA Sports’ Madden and EA FC.</p>



<p>Adding GTA 6 to the mix could cause problems, as no developer will want to go head-to-head with one of the biggest gaming releases of all time, as it would almost certainly impact sales.</p>



<p>These issues are not exclusive to Microsoft, however, as PlayStation, Nintendo, and developers across the world will also be tussling with the new calendar.</p>



<p>Marvel’s Wolverine, for example, is slated for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch in late 2026</a>, while it’s widely expected that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenth generation of Pokémon</a> will debut in Q4 2026 as part of the 30th anniversary celebrations.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gaime-review-lightgun-system/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/g%E2%80%99aim%E2%80%99e-review%E2%80%94the-most-accessible-lightgun-system-in-20-years.1346638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>What if I told you that from opening up your G’AIM’E package, you could play an upgraded version of the original Time Crisis and have it set up and ready to go within five minutes? The lost art of lightgun gaming can now be accessed in less time than it takes to wade through a live-service game’s endless oppressive microtransaction screens.</p>



<p>Speaking of screens, did you know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gaime-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G’AIM’E</a> is playable on any modern-day TV (LCD, OLED, etc) up to 150″? You no longer have to squint to make out your nearest pixel on a tiny CRT setup. G’AIM’E is the latest name attempting to bridge the divide between a bygone era and the restoration of lightgun shootouts to the mainstream at an affordable price with much-needed ease of accessibility.</p>



<p>G’AIM’E gets a lot of this right, and I think it’s comfortably the most accessible lightgun system on the market. It does misfire slightly, but not much. Let me explain in our G’AIM’E review.</p>



<h2 id="h-g-aim-e-review">G’AIM’E Review</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Finding the balance is key. Credit to G’AIM’E</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tassei Denki has been producing video-game peripheral devices for years. So leaping to a contemporary lightgun product wasn’t beyond the realms of possibility. But how do you market and make an age-old medium relevant again? By celebrating the 30th anniversary of arguably the famous lightgun shooter ever—<strong>Time Crisis</strong>—and pushing it to the forefront of EVERYTHING.</p>



<p>Each G’AIM’E package is centered around Namco’s 1995 classic, with the logo emblazoned on the consoles, collectibles, and guns. The basic edition includes a custom G’AIM’E lightgun, a mini-console with a redone-from-the-ground-up flashier emulated version of Time Crisis installed, a power cable, a HDMI cable, and a setup guide.</p>



<p>The Premium version has all of this and adds three more games to the console (<strong>Point Blank, Steel Gunner, and Steel Gunner 2</strong>), a pedal, and a Time Crisis Pin badge. Whereas the super-duper Ultimate pack includes everything so far, and throws in a second gun for two-player gaming, an AC Adapter, and a Time Crisis Diorama Stand.</p>



<p>For the purposes of this Insider Gaming G’AIM’E review, <strong>I was fortunate enough to test out the Ultimate edition</strong>. The collectibles do sit lovely with my other memorabilia, but you’re here to know if it’s worth dropping a lot of money on plastic guns, pedals, and piranhas—Where are my Point Blank fans at!</p>

<p>I removed everything from the box, undid all the packaging, hooked up the mini-console and guns, and I had eyes on Richard Miller within minutes. Calibration was ridiculously easy, and the provided setup instructions are more crystal clear than a Time Crisis “Danger” prompt.</p>



<p>My 65″ OLED TV required me to be at the maximum distance from the TV, and I followed those instructions. After countless hours across all four games, <strong>my experience was extremely enjoyable, but not perfect</strong>. I want to sit here and tell you everything was inch-perfect, every shot felt like it was where I was aiming, there wasn’t a hint of a delay in my bullets, and any mistakes were through human error (which many of them probably were, and I have a lot of improving to do).</p>



<p>As sophisticated as the AI tracker and camera are, I think there are going to be times when you can’t be as accurate as you’d like. Is it a dealbreaker? Not even close. As I said, it was fleeting moments. I was so impressed with the tracker’s ability to refocus under different circumstances. I pointed the gun well away from the screen, I adjusted my distance before returning to the original spot, and I even had someone walk in front of the gun. All mini-experiments to test the AI’s capabilities, and it’s remarkable how consistently it remembers the original position and gauges proximity and the complexities and changes in the environment.</p>



<p>I’d say the main drawback of an AI-based algorithm over infrared is more noticeable during the moments when you need utmost precision: Enemies hiding behind walls and cover with only a few pixels for you to hit, or the trembling-inducing task of needing to shoot a single leaf or apple with one shot in Point Blank. </p>



<p>In fact, any of Point Blank’s one-shot or limited-ammo mini-games can crank up an already pressure-cooker environment!</p>



<p>If you calibrate everything correctly and optimize your setup and surroundings, you’ll have a ball as you start blasting at everything. The guns feel great, and <strong>the pedal is a genius enhancement, enriching an already homely arcade experience</strong>. The guns don’t rocket back and forth with recoil technology. Instead, there’s an optional haptic feedback-based vibration that kicks in with every shot. </p>



<p>I’m absolutely fine with this, and you can still feel the rush of every shot pulsating through your wrist, traveling up and tapping into the brain’s pleasure senses. Again, G’AIM’E is advertised as “plug and play,” and it does everything it says.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-smart-selection">A Smart Selection</h2>

<p>G’AIM’E has collaborated with Bandai Namco to deliver a “Custom licensed version of TIME CRISIS™, faithfully recreated from the original arcade ROM to give you a new and unique arcade experience!” per the official <a href="https://www.mygaime.com/product-tcgun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">G’AIM’E</a> site. You have to hand it to the team as <strong>Time Crisis plays and runs beautifully</strong>. It looks and feels crispier than last night’s pizza, air-fried to perfection. Its constant peek and cover gameplay was revolutionary at the time, and you traverse three full acts of escalating, endlessly replayable combat scenarios.</p>



<p>It’s not the case for most people, but the Point Plank addition is what piqued my interest in G’AIM’E. I grew up playing it at home; <strong>it was <em>my </em>Time Crisis</strong>. I’ve shot so many flying meteors, flaming torches, UFOs, and skeletons that I get real-life PTSD at carnival games. It’s a bunch of quickfire, target-based mini-games using (sometimes protecting) the mecurial duo of Dr. Dan and Dr. Don. It’s so addictive, it’s just as much fun as it was in 1994, and it’s still <em>so </em>hard!</p>



<p>Again, Point Blank is for Premium and Ultimate owners, as is Steel Gunner 1 &amp; 2. While I don’t think you’ll log as many hours in these as Time Crisis or Point Blank, they round out a neat little collection, which brings me to my other concern—longevity and price. Taking off my nostalgia glasses and putting on my critical hat, let’s look at this objectively. Time Crisis takes about 20 minutes to complete, Steel Gunner 1 and 2 playthroughs are about the same, and a quick volley of 16 Point Blank mini-games (17 with the firework finale) is over in roughly 10-15 minutes.</p>



<p>Time Crisis and Point Blank aren’t the home console versions, meaning the Special Mode—which I think is cooler than the main story, as it changes your route depending on your speed and accuracy—isn’t available for Time Crisis. On the other hand, Point Blank is missing all the extra Party and Story Mode features. These would’ve added to the overall package and replayability, but I understand this probably wasn’t possible due to licensing issues. Your mileage with the G’AIM’E packages will vary.</p>



<p>The Basic edition is <strong>$99.99/£99.99</strong>, Premium is <strong>$149.99/£149.99</strong>, and Ultimate costs <strong>$199.99/£199.99</strong>. Paying just under $100 for what is a 20-minute game won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. I think Premium and Ultimate are the way to go, and hand on heart, I probably would’ve opted for Ultimate myself because of the extra gun, as you can play Point Blank and the Steel Gunner games with a friend. It’s been confirmed that each mini-console can’t add new games, meaning any further game expansions will likely require another box and another purchase.</p>



<h2 id="h-g-aim-e-review-verdict">G’AIM’E Review Verdict</h2>



<p>To reiterate, other third-party lightguns and configurations exist—as do expensive cabinets—but this is easily the most accessible and sophisticated lightgun setup in the world. Plug, play, and enjoy pew-pew paradise. I recommend a Premium or Ultimate edition, as you get the best of everything this way. Time Crisis is lightgun heritage, and Point Blank is a timeless classic that you can replay over and over. Old school CRT-enthusiasts might raise an eyebrow at the mostly-solid AI tech, and the price point is definitely worth a conversation.</p>



<p>But at the end of the day, G’AIM’E is exactly what I have been crying out for: A quick and convenient way to enjoy legendary lightgun gaming.</p>
