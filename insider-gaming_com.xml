            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We may have gotten our first look at Noah Centineo’s Ken in the upcoming Street Fighter film. Last week, we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-photo-teases-wwe-superstar-cody-rhodes-as-guile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a shadowy glimpse</a> at Cody Rhodes’ Guile on set. While we didn’t see much outside his lore-accurate hair, it was enough for fans to go crazy. Now, a new picture, thanks to Noah Centineo’s social media, shows us what his Ken may look like.</p>



<p>Legendary’s Street Fighter, directed by Kitao Sakurai (Bad Trip, Twisted Metal), started filming earlier this month. After it announced the loaded cast, including Warrior’s Andrew Koji as Ryu, Aquaman’s Jason Momoa as Blanka, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-has-reportedly-lined-up-chun-li-balrog-actors/">50 Cent as Balrog</a>, many were cautiously optimistic about the adaptation. While no official release date is set yet, it’s not stopping some teases on set on social media, like with Noah Centineo.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In a new photo from the Black Adam actor, Noah Centineo shows off his muscles in his trailer. We can also see that his hair, unknown if real or fake, is down and dyed yellow. To further confirm it’s Ken, Centineo captioned the post “Road brawler”, which is a cheeky hint at the title Street Fighter. Considering how Ken looks in the games, he does seem to resemble the American-born rival of Ryu rather well. </p>



<p>Of course, it’s one thing to look the part and another to act it out. Though considering Centineo’s burgeoning action career with The Recruit, he may be a perfect fit for Ken Masters. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see if more set photos regarding Street Fighter will be seen as they film in Australia. The fighting franchise is no stranger to adaptations, but many are hopeful that Legendary’s take will succeed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Demonschool Delayed to November Due To Silksong]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/demonschool-delayed-november-silksong/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/demonschool-delayed-to-november-due-to-silksong.1280115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Demonschool, which was planned to release September 3rd, 2025, has now been delayed, due in part to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. The indie RPG from Necrosoft Games, has been hotly anticipated since 2022, and was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fazy1L9KXFQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to drop next week</a>, with codes for the title already given to press. </p>



<p>Despite that, the game won’t come out at that time for a number of reasons, including one rather large one.</p>



<p>If you haven’t heard of Demonschool, it is a strategy RPG more in line with Persona 1 and 2 than newer ones. Still, the game has been in development for quite a bit and garnered attention for its 2D graphics and fun gameplay. Unfortunately, it looks like fans won’t be able to get to play it next week as anticipated.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-s-surprise-release-gets-blame-for-demonschool-s-delay">Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Surprise Release Gets Blame for Demonschool’s Delay</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Demonschool release date trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a press release from publisher Ysbyrd Games, the team announced Demonschool’s sudden delay from September 3rd to November 19th. As to why it’s now two months out, it says that Hollow Knight: Silksong is to blame. Via the official press release, it states:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025, on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game. Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that&nbsp;Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;will launch just one day after our planned release for&nbsp;Demonschool.</p>



<p>We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for&nbsp;Demonschool&nbsp;is our main goal. Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red. If the September period is going to be&nbsp;Silksong’s&nbsp;moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give&nbsp;Demonschool&nbsp;its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Demonschool already gave out codes for PC reviewers, so now they’ll have plenty of time to play the title. Still, this is the fourth game to vacate its spot due to Hollow Knight: Silksong’s surprise release. While it may not all have to do with Silksong, it’s certainly proven to be an issue for some. </p>



<p>Are you sad about Demonschool’s delay to November 19th? Will more games get delayed because of Silksong? Let us know in the comments and on the forums.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>REPLACED has been delayed yet again, though its new window is more promising. After a troubled development, as the team was located near the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, there is a bit more hope for the game’s future.</p>



<p>The game, created by indie team Sad Cat Studios, is a cyberpunk action platformer. Rendered in a 2.5D style, REPLACED has been highly anticipated by many since its 2021 reveal. Fortunately, while it won’t come out in 2025, the team has shared some good news on when we will.</p>



<h2 id="h-replaced-eyes-spring-2026-release-with-new-development-update-final-trailer-this-year">REPLACED Eyes Spring 2026 Release With New Development Update, Final Trailer This Year</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoyEkQePA4">video from IGN</a>, the team at Sad Cat Studios and publisher Thunderful Games goes over many of the improvements since the last update. REPLACED, according to the team, is close to finishing production, but won’t make the planned 2025 release date. Instead, they announced at the end of the video that the game will launch in Spring 2026. </p>



<p>In a statement from game director Yura Zhdanovich, provided via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/replaced-delayed-to-spring-2026">a press release</a>, he says, </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We know that our community is incredibly excited to play&nbsp;<em>REPLACED</em>&nbsp;and it’s no secret that it’s taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all—we apologize for that,” states Zhdanovich. “We’ve always been trying to do what’s right for the project, which in turn, means delivering to you a truly special experience. The good news is that we now are very close to finishing production and&nbsp;<em>REPLACED</em>&nbsp;will be coming to PC and&nbsp;Xbox Series X|S&nbsp;in spring 2026.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While no exact date was mentioned, the video does state that the final trailer will premiere later this year. Therefore, it won’t be long before we know when the game will arrive. Given that it will also release on Xbox Game Pass, many are sure to join in on the cyberpunk fun that awaits.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Many Developers Still Don’t Have Nintendo Switch 2 Dev Kits]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/many-developers-still-don%E2%80%99t-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits.1279998/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been out of nearly three months, and it’s been one of the fasted-selling consoles ever since it’s June 5 release. And while Nintendo has released games for it and some third party ports are coming, there is still an issue with other developers not being able to get their games onto the new platform due to a lack of dev kits.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of Digital Foundry’s Direct Weekly show, John Linneman&nbsp;and Oliver Mackenzie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=504s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke about what talks were like</a> at Gamescom in Cologne. Part of those talks were about Nintendo not sending Switch 2 dev kits to a number of developers, including some AAA studios.</p>



<p><strong>“Nintendo seems to be almost discouraging Switch 2 development to some degree, where I’ve spoken with plenty of developers where they were either told that their game, they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility,” </strong>Linneman said. <strong>“There’s a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits. We talked to&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of devs at Gamescom this year and so many of them said the same things. They want to ship on Switch 2. They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware. It’s really difficult right now.”</strong></p>



<p>From there, Mackenzie added that he had heard “through the grapevine” and from talking to others that there were “some weird exclusions with some big developers struggling to get kits for games.”</p>



<p><strong>“And there were some weird inclusions as well, like some indies were included which is nice to see,”</strong> Mackenzie said. <strong>“But like there’s that campfire game you know the kind of camera campfire game and they’re getting kits and some big developers on the other hand who developed like AAA stuff aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits.”</strong></p>



<p>None of the studios who haven’t been able to get Switch 2 dev kits were mentioned, but they might be able to be guessed, especially if you want to dig into some larger studios without newer games announced for the platform. That said, fans will have to wait and see how third-party support grows on the console in the coming months and years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Festival Season 10 Adds Gorillaz, New Cosmetics]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-10-gorillaz-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite Festival has revealed the featured artist for Season 10: Gorillaz. The rhythmic game mode, part of Fortnite’s game launcher, has been going strong since December 2023. Every season brings a new artist, like Billie Eilish, Sabrina Carpenter, and last season’s Bruno Mars. Now, we have confirmation on who is headlining it next with Gorillaz.</p>



<p>The London-based pop band has been going strong since 1998. With 12 Grammy nominations, including one win for Best Pop Collaboration, Gorillaz is no stranger to the limelight. It also helps that the band is fictional, having fake animated bandmates, adding notoriety to their name. They are a natural fit for Fortnite, but that’s not all that’s being added, come it’s rather soon release.</p>



<h2 id="h-gorillaz-headlines-season-10-of-fortnite-festival-starting-august-26th">Gorillaz Headlines Season 10 of Fortnite Festival Starting August 26th</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/gorillaz-enter-a-new-universe-as-fortnite-festival-season-10-icons?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> from Fortnite/Epic Games, Season 10 of Fortnite Festival will launch tomorrow, August 26th. All four band members, Noodle, 2D, Russell, and Murdoc, will be available as Outfits. Noodle and 2D both come with their own Back Blings and weapons and are available until the end of Season 10. In addition, the iconic track “Clint Eastwood” will release onto the shop as a Jam Track. Of course, a new Main Stage has been added, now made to look straight out of a Gorillaz music video.</p>



<p>Patch notes for Fortnite Festival were also revealed in the post. The updates fix some UI issues, as well as sorting in the Main Stage Music Library. The full patch notes can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adding “Good” notes so that it’s clearer in the UI when you’re just short of “Perfect.” (Hitting a note slightly too early or slightly too late.)
<ul>
<li>You’ll have the option to disable the “Good” visual feedback in the settings.&nbsp;<strong>(Settings &gt; Game &gt; Festival)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Adjusting the design of lift notes so that it’s easier to tell when to press and when to let go.
<ul>
<li>You’ll have the option to disable this new design (“Lift Notes Connectors”) in the settings.&nbsp;<strong>(Settings &gt; Game &gt; Festival)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>In the Main Stage Music Library, you’ll be able to sort by&nbsp;<strong>Song Duration</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Song Intensity</strong>.</li>



<li>You’ll be able to&nbsp;<strong>strum</strong>&nbsp;during the tune-up process, making it easier to test and calibrate your guitar controller.</li>
</ul>
