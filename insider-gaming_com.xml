The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Resident Evil Requiem Open World? All Rumors, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-open-world/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With many franchises going open-world when they weren’t before, leaks and rumors indicated that Resident Evil Requiem would follow the herd and make Grace and Leon’s adventure an open-world affair.</p>



<p>Not a single <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> game has ever gone fully open-world. The series has largely stuck to a rigid linearity and occasionally dabbled in semi-open worlds with deeper, interconnected areas to form a larger map.</p>



<p>It was thought that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem </a>might be the one to break the chain.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-resident-evil-requiem-an-open-world-game">Is Resident Evil Requiem An Open-World Game?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem is most definitely not an open-world game, as Leon and Grace’s respective gameplay sections are chopped-up chunks, with different areas being separated by loading screens, scripted events, and more.</strong></p>



<p>If you love the trademark Resi formula for level design, you won’t be disappointed with Requiem.</p>

</ul>



<p>There’s a Spencer Mansion-like hub area where you’ll spend a few hours or more solving puzzles, finding items, and locating keys for locked doors and rooms. There are linear action sequences, even more condensed locales with new puzzles and mechanics, and that’s how it goes for the duration of Resident Evil Requiem.</p>



<p>It’s anything but a seamless open-world design.</p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-9-open-world-rumors-explained">Resident Evil 9 Open World Rumors, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Leaks and rumors in the build-up to Resident Evil Requiem’s launch suggested the game would be open-world, and Resident Evil 9’s director later confirmed this to be true. While he clarified that the proposed rumors were worked on, he made it clear that the plans didn’t get very far.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming covered the news a while back that the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-online-open-world-rumors-were-true/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem online open-world rumors were true</a>.’</p>



<p>Director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed Capcom had tinkered with open-world and online multiplayer elements, featuring multiple players taking on Raid-esque Zombies.</p>

</ul>



<p>However, the team quickly distanced Requiem from these ideas for one simple reason: It’s not something “fans wanted to see or play.”</p>



<p>The wait goes on for an open-world Resident Evil game, and to be honest, it’s not something the franchise is crying out for. That’s IG’s opinion, so let us know if you disagree and you want to see what an open-world Resi title looks like.

<p>The Roulette table located in the Parlor in Resident Evil Requiem seems to be nothing more than just a novelty distraction you can interact with, but it’s actually a little Easter Egg with a fun reward. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> loves filling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> games with secrets. So no one should be surprised that while you’re trying to deal with a homicidal Chef zombie and a creature the size of an entire room, the developer wants you to uncover the mystery of the Roulette table!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-win-at-roulette-in-resident-evil-9">How To Win At Roulette In Resident Evil 9</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Spin the wheel. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to shoot either 7, 15, or 29 on the Roulette table with your gun, then spin the Roulette wheel; if your number comes up, you officially beat the Easter Egg.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/organless-corpse-walkthrough-resident-evil-requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Organless Corpse Walkthrough In Resident Evil Requiem</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Before a full explanation, here’s the method:</p>



<ol>
<li>First, <strong>ensure that you save</strong> (or the game has auto-saved) before attempting this, so you don’t waste ammo.</li>



<li>Head to the <strong>Parlor </strong>in the Care Center’s West Wing.</li>



<li>Approach the Roulette table.</li>



<li>Using any weapon (ideally a Pistol), shoot either <strong>Red 7, Black 15, or Black 29</strong> once, on the main part of the Roulette table—not on the wheel!</li>



<li>An audio cue should occur to indicate you’ve done this correctly.</li>



<li><strong>Do not shoot any other numbers once you’ve shot one of the outlined numbers</strong>.</li>



<li>Spin the Roulette wheel.</li>



<li>If it lands on the number you shot, you win.</li>



<li>If the wrong number comes up, you need to repeat steps 4-7 until your number comes up.</li>
</ol>



<p>The most important instruction is to save before attempting this. You have a 1 in 3 chance of your number coming up, but basic maths suggests you could be <em>very </em>unlucky and burn through vital bullets. If you waste so much as one bullet, feel free to reload your most recent save and head back to the Parlor.</p>



<p>7, 15, and 29 are the only numbers that can come up. In our experience, 15 seemed to come up the most, but again, it’s probably through coincidence more than an objective value swaying the odds.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-you-get-for-beating-roulette-easter-egg-puzzle-in-resident-evil-requiem">What Do You Get For Beating Roulette Easter Egg Puzzle In Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p><strong>If you shoot one of the three numbers on the table and it comes up on the wheel, you will be rewarded with an Antique Coin in Resident Evil 9.</strong></p>



<p>The Care Center’s Parlor has four items for you to exchange Antique Coins for: Two steroid injections, an inventory upgrade, and an upgrade for the Blood Collector.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bar-lounge-safe-resident-evil-requiem-combination-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Open Bar &amp; Lounge Safe In Resident Evil Requiem</a></li>
</ul>



<p>But you need more coins for later on, so it’s imperative you collect all Antique Coins—so win at Roulette before you advance in the story.</p>



<p>How lucky (or unlucky) were you with Roulette? Let us know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
