            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake is still moving along nicely, according to Remedy in its 2025 half-year financial report. It’s also been revealed that Rockstar Games and Remedy Entertainment are teaming up for the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake.</p>



<p>Remedy’s work on the original Max Payne games was exceptional. Both games sold well and became iconic for their revolutionary bullet-time feature (popularized by The Matrix) and their unique presentation and style. Remedy handed over the franchise to Take-Two, leading to Rockstar Games handling Max Payne 3—another success.</p>



<p>We learned early details about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-gives-update-on-control-2-and-max-payne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake in 2023</a>, and the game went into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-2-is-now-playable-as-max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full production in 2024</a>.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Could it lead to a Max Payne 4? Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remedy’s “Half year financial report January–June 2025” covered many aspects of Remedy, including upcoming projects. There was a new update on the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake, revealing a cool detail.</p>



<p>“The&nbsp;Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake&nbsp;project continues its progress and remains in full production. In the second quarter, the team built on steady momentum from earlier in the year. Collaboration with Rockstar Games remains close and productive, ensuring alignment as the project advances toward its next major phase,” the statement <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>



<p>This means both of Max Payne’s key developers are working together on the project. It’s unclear if this is a 50/50 split of the workload or how much input either team is contributing.</p>



<p>Regardless, long-term Max Payne fans should rest easy knowing Remedy and Rockstar Games are on the case. Can the two companies synergize perfectly to recapture the Max Payne magic? Or do you think there could be some crossed wires? Share your thoughts through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Doesn’t Use Controversial EOMM System, Says NetEase Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-doesn%E2%80%99t-use-controversial-eomm-system-says-netease-games.1267788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Marvel Rivals player base has dwindled in recent times, and many in the community believe EOMM is a big reason. NetEase has publicly acknowledged the belief and says it’s not the case. The developer is preparing a video set to break down how the game’s matchmaking works.</p>



<p>When you think of matchmaking in major FPS games, you probably default to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a>. This is known as Skill-Based Matchmaking, and is a contentious (and constant) frustration across multiplayer games. It favors an algorithm that keeps players in matches with similarly skilled players. EOMM doesn’t get the headlines SBMM does, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-marvel-rivals-planning-collaborations-with-other-marvel-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has been linked with the controversial system for a while.</p>



<h2 id="h-netease-working-on-video-to-explain-marvel-rivals-matchmaking">NetEase Working on Video to Explain Marvel Rivals Matchmaking</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Swiping away the accusations. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>Presumably tired of the speculation, the Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account posted an update on August 12.</p>



<p>“Hi Rivals! As our game continues to thrive, we want to reiterate that Marvel Rivals does not use EOMM. We are currently working on a video to demonstrate our developer insights on the matchmaking and ranking system, which is expected to be released next week,” it said.”</p>



<p>EOMM stands for ‘Engagement Optimized Matchmaking.’ Whereas SBMM targets competitive matches and lobbies, EOMM focuses on player retention and engagement. The long-standing belief is that EOMM is designed to give you regular doses of the highs and lows of online gaming.</p>



<p>One second you’re wrecking lobbies multiple games running—racking up a nasty K/D and W/L ratio—the next, you’re on an unexplainable losing streak. The idea is that the wins keep you playing because you feel powerful, and the losses encourage you to keep playing to secure the next win.</p>



<p>It sounds similar to SBMM. However, the underlying motive is to keep you playing and coming back for more, increasing the likelihood of you spending money on microtransactions.</p>

<p>The video should be a fascinating peek behind the curtain. Will NetEase be completely transparent, or do you think the developer will retain some of the finer details?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-rileycs-cheating-allegations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/viral-vtuber-%E2%80%98rileycs%E2%80%99-has-been-banned-on-twitch-following-battlefield-6-cheating-allegations.1267785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A VTuber has been banned on Twitch after her Battlefield 6 gameplay clip amassed tens of millions of views.</p>



<p>The Vtuber, named RileyCS posted her Battlefield 6 clips on X on August 8, which prompted many users to accuse her of cheating. The discourse around the clip has resulted in the video accumulating 47.8 million views at the time of writing. </p>



<p>Presumably, the viral tweet has resulted in her being reported to Twitch by those who think she’s been cheating, which has resulted in her ban.</p>



<p>You can watch the clip below to decide for yourself if you think she’s cheating:</p>

<h2 id="h-the-battlefield-6-cheating-allegations">The Battlefield 6 Cheating Allegations</h2>



<p>At first glance, it isn’t difficult to jump to the conclusion that Riley is indeed cheating after watching the footage. Her unique playstyle, which requires her to ‘flick’ onto enemies to get gameplay clips for content, does have all the traits of cheating. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/"><strong>RELATED – When Does The Battlefield 6 Beta End? Open Beta End Times Explained</strong></a></p>



<p>However, some have argued in favour of Riley, stating that she’s known within the community for this type of content. Battlefield YouTuber Enders has also analysed the clips, which makes for an interesting watch if you have the time. But then again, the counterargument is that you can turn aimbot on and off very easily (with a foot pedal for instance). </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whether Riely is cheating or not is something that will probably be hotly debated for the foreseeable future until either EA comes out to debunk the claims, or Riely plays at some kind of LAN event.</p>



<p>Regardless, the viral clip has prompted dozens more players to capture similar clips and post them to X. So, the cheating accusations within the community against players, regardless if they are legit or not, will likely continue. </p>



<p><strong>UPDATE – Rileycs has now been unbanned from Twitch.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sarah Bond Brings Xbox Expertise to Tyson Foods by Joining Board of Directors]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sarah-bond-xbox-expertise-tyson-foods/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sarah-bond-brings-xbox-expertise-to-tyson-foods-by-joining-board-of-directors.1267695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sarah Bond, the President of Xbox since 2023, has revealed a new appointment on the Board of Directors at Tyson Foods. The curveball placement was uncovered in a press release from Tyson Foods, a company with Arkansas origins dating back to 1931. Under the Tyson banner sit the likes of Bosco’s, State Fair, Jimmy Dean, and Reuben.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean that Sarah Bond is relocating from under a tech titan to work at a food-focused conglomerate. She has joined the board as an independent director, which is a similar position she already holds at other corporations and companies.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dynamic-and-passionate">Dynamic and Passionate</h2>



<p><br>In <a href="https://www.tysonfoods.com/news/news-releases/2025/8/tyson-foods-names-microsoft-executive-board-directors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> celebrating the appointment of Sarah Bond to the Board of Directors at Tyson Foods, the firm wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Sarah is dynamic and passionate, with proven management strength, and her energy and personality are a wonderful fit for our culture. As our management team, members of the board and the Tyson family got to know Sarah, we immediately felt that she would be a tremendous addition to Tyson Foods.</p>



<p>We are confident that her unique expertise will help us continue to grow and serve our customers, our team members, and our shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a short response, Bond said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Tyson Foods is a world-class food company with iconic brands, and I am delighted to join the board and support the company as it continues to execute its long-term growth strategy with customers and consumers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Taking a glance at Bond’s LinkedIn profile, you can see that she’s also on the board of the USC School of Cinematic Arts and the Entertainment Software Association. In a report from <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/08/xbox-president-delighted-to-join-board-of-directors-at-tyson-foods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PureXbox</a>, it was also noted that Bond is on the board of Zuora, a subscription management platform.</p>



<p>When I looked up Tyson Foods, I found that the company provides extensive volumes of meat and ingredients to fast food chains like KFC, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Burger King, and that the titan boasts more than 120 food processing plants. That’s one hell of a global reach.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MrBeast has officially joined Kick.com to further promote his TeamWater campaign, just weeks after receiving a one-of-a-kind trophy from YouTube for landing 400 million subscribers. The TeamWater campaign has just ticked over $15 million raised after a trio comprised of MrBeast, Adin Ross, and xQc fronted the mission.</p>



<p>The goal is to raise $40 million by the end of the month to support the provision of clean water to countries around the world. It’s a classic MrBeast move, and it has attracted the support of more than 3,000 influencers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-kick-mrbeast">Welcome to Kick, MrBeast</h2>



<p>MrBeast’s arrival on Kick was celebrated by the platform in <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/1955021765878616107" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a social media post</a> akin to the ones published to welcome <strong>partnered creators</strong>. In the hours that followed, MrBeast racked up thousands of followers on the third most-popular streaming platform in the business, further extending his reach and leaning on Adin Ross and xQc’s audiences.</p>



<p>It has been reported that ‘the deal’ to secure MrBeast’s affiliation included a $5 million donation towards the TeamWater campaign.</p>



<p>If there’s one negative sentiment to take away from this reveal, it’s that MrBeast has aligned himself with some less-than-favored creators who have worked hard drumming up awful auras for themselves in recent years.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If successful, the TeamWater campaign will provide clean water to a range of countries around the world, including those located in Africa and South America. After just a few days, almost 50% of the target has been hit, and efforts are expected to accelerate in the coming weeks as the deadline approaches.</p>



<p>MrBeast’s team is also supporting TeamWater by sending 100% of all merchandise purchases to the total money raised.</p>



<p>Are you <a href="https://teamwater.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">going to donate</a> to TeamWater’s campaign? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
