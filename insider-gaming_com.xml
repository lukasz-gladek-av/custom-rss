            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Techland has once again proven that Dying Light: The Beast isn’t ‘just a DLC’ and offered up a stunning 11-week-long roadmap packed with content. We knew ahead of launch that this wouldn’t be a fire-and-forget game and that Techland had things in the pipeline, but now we know exactly what those things are.</p>



<p>Nestled amongst the coming updates sits New Game+, ‘Legend Levels’, Nightmare Difficulty, and almost a dozen week-long challenges under the ‘Call of The Beast’ title.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-doesn-t-end-with-the-release">Dying Light: The Beast Doesn’t End with the Release</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast has stacks of content coming in a series of updates, as revealed today by Techland.</p>



<p>It begins with New Game+, Legend Levels (like the games that came before), and Nightmare Difficulty, for those who want a more tantalizing challenge in the open-world environment of Castor Woods.</p>



<p>Beyond that, there’s a PUBG Mobile collaboration (didn’t see that coming), a ray tracing update for PC, new weapon executions and animations, and visual and quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Call of the Beast community challenge pipeline was also unveiled, with <strong>eleven weeks </strong>of challenges scheduled to run from today, October 16, to January 7. Each week, players will be able to complete a series of challenges, with special, ‘legendary’ rewards being added on weeks four, eight, and after the final week ends.</p>



<p>Techland said in a new release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the campaign, players around the world will take on weekly goals that celebrate teamwork, persistence, and the power of the Dying Light community. Each challenge offers exclusive rewards that appear directly in participants’ in-game stash once objectives are met. From new weapons to unique car skins, every week brings fresh surprises and reasons to celebrate the collective success of the community.To get the weekly rewards, players will need to contribute to the goal that week.</p>



<p>Sticking together with the community to complete at least 17 of the 22 goals will unlock a secret Legendary Reward, which players will receive at the end of the event. Additionally, if the community completes 20 goals, everyone who participated in at least one challenge will receive all the rewards, regardless of when they began taking part in Call of the Beast!&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This breathes more life into the game that some wrote off for being ‘too short’. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-review/">In my review</a>, I put that to rest and stressed just how much meat is on the bones of this game.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to complete all the coming challenges in Dying Light: The Beast.</p>

<p>Employees at Electronic Arts (EA) and members of the Communication Workers of America (CWA) have released a statement regarding the pending acquisition and privatization of the company. In the joint statement, union members working at EA state that they weren’t properly represented during sale negotiations and that there is a worry of company layoffs when it happens. </p>



<p>The group says this $55 billion deal will <strong>“further concentrate power and wealth into the hands of a few gatekeepers while doing nothing to address the concerns of players and workers.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“EA is not a struggling company,”</strong> the statement says. <strong>“With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world. EA’s success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The group says that if any layoffs take place or if studios close, it’s because of a choice to do so and not something done out of necessity. They say that it would be a move done solely to <strong>“pad investors’ pockets—not to strengthen the company.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the statement, the <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">union has launched a petition</a> for the United States Federal Trade Commission to look more into this deal. They are “calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, and preserves creative freedom.”</p>



<p>The announcement of a deal to sell EA to a group that includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in late September</a>. To fund the sale, EA will be taking on $20 billion in debt, which many worry will lead to the aforementioned layoffs.</p>



<p><strong>“Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power,”</strong> they say. <strong>“Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services.”</strong></p>



<p>The statement closes by saying that the <strong>“value of video games is in their workers” </strong>and that they are <strong>“standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry.”</strong></p>
