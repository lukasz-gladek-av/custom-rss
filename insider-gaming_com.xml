<p>InZOI officially released in Early Access on Friday and one of the first viral experiences making the rounds was the fact that the game allowed players to run over children. According to the game’s developers, however, this isn’t supposed to be the case.</p>



<p>In a message sent to Insider Gaming, a Krafton representative said that it was caused by a “unintended bug” that has since been resolved.</p>

<p>“This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch,” the representative said. “These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of inZOI.

<p>The video game industry layoff trend is picking up steam as Cyan Worlds, the developers behind Myst and Firmament, have announced a round of layoffs at the studio.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://xcancel.com/cyanworlds/status/1905668238899327249/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> post on Friday afternoon, the studio said that 12 people will be let go despite their “best efforts to avoid it”. The layoffs will be effective at the end of March.</p>



<p>“Industry conditions have forced us into a tricky spot where we are having to weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025,” the statement reads. </p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft And Tencent Have A Deal, GTA 6 Release Questions, and An Exclusive Game Announcement</a></h6>



<p>“Throughout the past year, we have been ultra-transparent with the entire Cyan team about the choppy waters we find ourselves in, as well as the dangers ahead. While the news of a layoff was not a surprise to the team, it was (and is) still deeply saddening for all of us.”</p>



<p>Those part of the layoffs at Cyan Worlds are receiving a severance package. However, the company is also working on helping them find additional work. That includes <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NURnVwfeqolPAVN-Dn44UpXZS3bRVMaCNQczIzhIpdc/edit?gid=1838665401#gid=1838665401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sharing the information</a> of those laid off and now looking for employment elsewhere.</p>



<p>As far as what’s next for Cyan Worlds, the studio says its “number one priority is to secure financing for our next project, and to restabilize the studio.”</p>



<p>“We’ve been around for a very long time, and have been through tough times before,” they said. “Our sincere hope is to continue to be around, and to provide the types of experiences that only Cyan can deliver.</p>



<p>“As always, we are grateful for all the love and support from our amazing player community.”</p>



<p>Cyan Worlds was founded in 1987 by brothers Robyn and Rand Miller. Since its establishment 38 years ago, the studio has shipped dozens of games.</p>

<p>A recently-released kids movie has received the greenlight for a new game. As first reported on the latest episode of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast</a>, Dog Man is set to receive another video game adaptation.</p>



<p>“Hold on to your police hats because Dog Man has been approved for a video game,” Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson revealed during the show. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>It was added that there is a belief that the new game only recently was given the go ahead after the success of the Dog Man movie earlier this year. For context, the Dog Man film had a box office of around $130.5 million against a budget of just $40 million.</p>



<p>Not much else is known about the new Dog Man game other than its been approved. Dog Man made its video game debut in October 2024 with Dog Man: Mission Impawsible. </p>

<p>And that’s it. Seriously. </p>



<p>You can <strong>press that button as many times as you’d like</strong> with no issues, and live the life of your dreams. And while it could impact your Zoi’s Karma in the future, there is currently no penalty of any kind for taking advantage of the game’s money cheat. So, if you really don’t want to earn money the same way you have to in real life, go ahead and take advantage of the systems that’s available to you in the game.</p>

<p>Call of Duty’s anti-cheat program, RICOCHET, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-anti-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may not be perfect</a>, but it’s the only thing standing between cheaters and both Black Ops 6 and Warzone. With Season 03 about to start, the team that works on RICOCHET provided a progress report today, detailing all the strides made and the impending changes coming this season.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-anti-cheat-updates">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 Anti-Cheat Updates</h2>



<p>Here are the key highlights from the latest RICOCHET Anti-Cheat update ahead of Season 03 of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p>



<h3 id="h-successes-so-far">Successes So Far</h3>



<p>Since the launch of Black Ops 6, Call of Duty’s anti-cheat efforts have put “over 20 cheat makers and dozens of cheat resellers” out of business. The RICOCHET team has issued over 228,000 bans since the game released and has claimed that 23% of cheaters were removed before even playing their first match. The team has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-anti-cheat-not-good-enough/">admitted in the past that the anti-cheat wasn’t good enough</a> when Ranked Play launched. They plan to improve their numbers with new systems to enhance their aim bot detection and “Machine Learning” system.</p>



<h3 id="h-killcam-improvements">Killcam Improvements</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The RICOCHET team says that there are many inaccurate reports of players who are simply have an intel advantage. To help combat this, the killcam in Season 03 will be outfitted with additional information, including a full list of detailed attackers, and new status messages. If you were revealed by the Live Ping perk, by UAV, or by firing an unsuppressed weapon, that information will show up in the killcam.</p>



<h3 id="h-ranked-skill-rating-refunds">Ranked Skill Rating Refunds</h3>



<p>In Season 03, Call of Duty will follow the trend set by other competitive shooters like CS2 and VALORANT, and provide rank rating refunds to players that lost to cheaters. When a cheater in ranked play is banned, anyone who they defeated recently will receive a Skill Rating refund. Initially, this will cover the most recent two weeks prior to the ban. Additionally, players who are playing with cheaters may also have SR taken away.</p>



<p>The SR refund system will go live for Black Ops 6 ranked shortly after the launch of Season 03, with a similar system planned for Warzone when ranked play finally goes live. </p>



<h3 id="h-stop-spamming">Stop Spamming</h3>



<p>Finally, RICOCHET provided the community with a piece of advice: stop spam reporting. The Anti-Cheat team says that spam reporting provides no additional insight, and will also “reduce the trust we have in future reports from an account and may result in punitive measures.”</p>



<p>The full list of announcements from the Call of Duty RICOCHET Anti-Cheat Season 03 update can be found <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Season 03 goes live on April 2nd.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll get some SR back when the Anti-Cheat Season 03 update goes live? Let me know in the comments, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Developer Build A Rocket Boy has announced the release date for MindsEye. The game is currently scheduled to release for PC and current-gen consoles on June 10. IO Interactive Partners will serve as the publisher of the game.</p>



<div><p>One of the main reasons for the hype surrounding the game is the involvement of Leslie Benzies, the former producer of the GTA franchise. Check out the synopsis of the game:</p><p>“<em>Play as Jacob Diaz, a former elite soldier fitted with The MindsEye, a mysterious neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Fight to uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unchecked military power shape every encounter. Jacob isn’t the only one searching for answers, forces working from the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined</em>.”</p></div>



<p>Accompanying the release date reveal was a new cinematic trailer, offering a deeper glimpse into Redrock City’s society and its key players. The trailer introduces characters like the visionary tech magnate Marco Silva and the ambitious Mayor Shiva Vega, hinting at the complex power dynamics that will drive the game’s narrative.</p>
