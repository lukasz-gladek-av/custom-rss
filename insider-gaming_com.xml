<p>Fallout 76’s ‘premium subscription’, Fallout 1st, is set to give players another huge advantage over ‘non-paying’ users of the post-apocalyptic MMO platform. In recent years, many key perks of the plan have popped up, with Bethesda Game Studios stumping up plenty of reasons why Fallout fans should part ways with some monthly cash to secure Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>In the latest change to Fallout 1st, a ‘Doctor Bag Aid Box’ has popped up on the PTS (Public Test Server) in Fallout 76. This feature will enable Fallout 1st subscribers to store an unlimited number of chems in their C.A.M.P.</p>



<h2 id="h-unlimited-chem-storage-in-fallout-76-courtesy-of-fallout-1st">Unlimited Chem Storage in Fallout 76, Courtesy of Fallout 1st</h2>



<p>When I was a non-stop fan of Fallout 76, I’d endlessly preach the benefits of Fallout 1st. For a few dollars a month, you can secure a stack of Atoms, boosters, custom server access, exclusive outfits and items, survival tents, and <strong>much more</strong>. It seems silly to have a Fallout 76 account that’s <strong>not </strong>paired with Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>The latest addition might be enough to sway more players over to the realms of Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>In the PTS, players have noticed the arrival of the Doctor Bag Aid Box, an item that has been talked about for a few weeks. In Fallout 76, the Doctor Bag Aid Box is a deployable item in your C.A.M.P. that allows you to store an unlimited number of chems, such as Stimpaks.</p>



<p>Given how Stimpaks, Super Stimpaks, Psycho, Jet, Buffout, and other chems have a fair weight requirement in Fallout 76, this is a boon for players building their character/s around using them. No longer will they take up precious stash allowances, and soon, they’ll have a dedicated space in your C.A.M.P.</p>



<p>This mimics the addition of the ammo storage unit that was thrown into Fallout 76 several months ago, and it, of course, aligns with the scrap box that Fallout 1st subscribers have been using for years.</p>



<p>Would unlimited chem storage in Fallout 76 sway you into purchasing Fallout 1st? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A new rumor suggests Valve’s next-generation Steam Deck could still be several years away. In a post on gaming forum NeoGAF, known hardware enthusiast and reliable hardware leaker <strong>KeplerL2</strong> claimed that the <strong>Steam Deck 2 is currently planned for 2028</strong>. </p>



<p>The comment, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-launch-october-16.1687405/page-5#post-270737598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">made in a discussion</a> about competing handheld PCs, offered no additional details or evidence to support the date.</p>



<p>A 2028 release date somewhat lines up with past claims of the device being “quite a while” away from happening. Valve has previously indicated that it does not plan to release a new version of the Steam Deck until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-still-says-steam-deck-2-isnt-coming-soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a significant improvement</a> in performance and efficiency is possible. When introducing the Steam Deck OLED in November 2023, Valve designer Lawrence Yang described the device as <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/13/valve-steam-deck-old-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the “definitive first-generation Deck”.</a> At the same time, he was said they were confident that in two or three years, there will be better technology to justify a successor to the first Steam Deck. Whether that</p>



<p>In January 2025, rumors picked up of a Steam Deck 2 utilizing AMD’s Ryzen Z2 processor. However, that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-z2-steam-deck-2-says-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly shot down</a> by Valve engineer <strong>Pierre-Loup Griffais</strong> who said that <strong>“there is (not) and will be no Z2 Steam Deck.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For now, Valve continues to support the Steam Deck and its OLED revision, while competition in the handheld PC market intensifies from manufacturers such as ASUS and Lenovo.</p>



<p>The company has not announced any official release window for a Steam Deck 2. Even with the past reliability of the source, until anything is made official, take the claim with a grain of salt, especially when 2028 is still over two years away.</p>



<p>What do you think the Valve Steam Deck 2 will finally release? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The director of Elden Ring’s film adaptation may be a bigger fan than we thought, given his script size. A recent article from The New Yorker sheds some insight as to how the upcoming A24 film came to be. Even more so, it does hint that the film may be in the right hands after all.</p>



<p>Winner of multiple Game of the Year awards in 2022, Elden Ring was a hit for Bandai Namco and FromSoftware. The intense gameplay and insane difficulty, much like the studio’s Dark Souls series, kept fans playing and is still regarded as one of director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s best. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-movie-finally-confirmed-by-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a film adaptation was announced</a> from indie studio A24 and director Alex Garland. The filmmaker, known for Ex Machina and 28 Days Later, was an interesting choice given the game’s scope. However, we may actually be in luck if Garland’s obsession is true.</p>



<h2 id="h-a24-details-how-elden-ring-film-came-to-be-with-alex-garland">A24 Details How Elden Ring Film Came To Be With Alex Garland</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an article on A24 from <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/01/a24s-empire-of-auteurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The New Yorker</a>, head of film Noah Sacco chatted with Alex Barasch about the studio. While talking about it’s upcoming big blockbusters, Sacco mentions meeting with Alex Garland five years ago. Previously, the director did Ex Machina, Civil War, and Warfare with A24. While there, Garland showed off Elden Ring on PlayStation to Sacco and asked if they could adapt it for the studio. When Sacco agreed, Garland proceeded to write a 160-page script, alongside 40 illustrations, for his version of Elden Ring. The two flew out to Japan once it was done and showed it off to FromSoftware and director Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p>



<p>As you can tell, the deal went well and now the film is greenlit, with many original contributors like Game of Thrones’ George R.R Martin producing. Interestingly enough, this is the second video game film that A24 will produce. Death Stranding, directed by A Quiet Place: Day One’s Michael Sarnoski, is in the works. Regardless, given Alex Garland’s enthusiasm for Elden Ring, the film may turn out to be better than other game film adaptations.</p>



<p>Are you excited about A24’s Elden Ring adaptation? Do you think Garland is the right choice to direct? Let us know in the comments below and on the forums!</p>

<p>Crystal Dynamics, the studio behind the recent Tomb Raider games and a co-developer of the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot, has announced that it was holding layoffs.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Wednesday, the studio said it <strong>“made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions.”</strong></p>



<p>Crystal Dynamics says that the decision <strong>“was not made lightly”</strong>, but was one that it says was needed to <strong>“ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“To those impacted – we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion,”</strong> they said.<strong> “We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as the future of Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics says that it’s development is unaffected by the moves.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Crystal Dynamics for more context surrounding the layoffs, exactly how many people were being let go, and if the recent cancellation of Perfect Dark had anything to do with the decision. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Konami has publicly addressed a number of launch issues for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater that have been reported by players.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Metalgear/status/1960740185957917022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Komani says that it has <strong>“received reports of several issues and are preparing a patch to address them.” </strong></p>



<p>The issues all center around game crashes and includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Performing an additional survival knife attack after completing a series of consecutive attacks to secure food may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while it is equipped may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Collecting food when a hungry crocodile is nearby may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Transitioning from a roll into a crawl may result in the character model floating in mid-air under certain conditions.</li>



<li>In areas where the camera switches to Intrusion View, character movement may become restricted under certain conditions.</li>



<li>Opening the Radio Window under certain conditions may cause the game to crash.</li>
</ul>



<p>Konami doesn’t have a specific timeline for a release for the update, but says that it will “take a little longer to implement the fixes” as they investigate the causes.</p>



<p><strong>“We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause,”</strong> they said.</p>
