<p>No Man’s Sky creator has recently responded to Once Human, allegedly using their assets in a premium loot box, stating, “jokes on them.” </p>



<p>Hello Games No Man’s Sky was released all the way back in 2016, but has still been going strong almost a decade later. The developers recently released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-breach-update-patch-notes-improved-ship-building-space-wrecks-salvaging-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brand-new update</a> for the title, introducing improved shipbuilding, space wrecks, salvaging, and more. Once Human, on the other hand, is a more recent title, releasing in 2024. However, Once Human was recently accused of ripping off assets from No Man’s Sky, and the founder has responded. </p>







<h2 id="h-no-man-s-sky-founder-says-jokes-on-them-in-response-to-once-human-allegedly-ripping-off-assets">No Man’s Sky Founder Says ‘Jokes on Them’ in Response to Once Human Allegedly Ripping Off Assets</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/no-mans-sky-lead-responds-to-reports-of-stolen-assets-in-fellow-open-world-survival-game-once-human-says-the-jokes-on-them-because-theyre-actually-unfinished/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1pavsn4/a_cosmetic_item_in_once_human_looks_extremely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> on the r/NoMansSkyTheGame subreddit talks about Once Human picking assets off No Man’s Sky. The user has revealed that Once Human’s cosmetic item, Sky King, looks very similar to No Man’s Sky’s Teleport Module. The item from Once Human can only be obtained as the highest-tier reward from a premium lootbox, whereas in No Man’s Sky, you can acquire the item just by progressing through the game. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The post caught the attention of Hello Games founder Sean Murray, who responded on <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Murray stated, “jokes on them – we forgot to LOD those rivets,” with an image of the asset in question. For those wondering, LOD stands for Level of Detail, a process in game development that optimises performance by displaying simpler versions of 3D models when they are far from the camera. </p>

<p>Microsoft has announced that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has set the record as the best third-party title to release on Xbox Game Pass in 2025, adding a further accolade to Sandfall Interactive’s debut title.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is widely regarded to be one of the best games to release this year, with the expectation that it will sweep up numerous victories in The Game Awards next week, and the Game Pass record shows just how impressive the release of the title was.</p>







<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-game-pass-best-third-party-title-of-2025">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is Game Pass’ Best Third-Party Title of 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another accolade. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft’s announcement of Clair Obscur’s impressive accolade detailed how it was based on the data of the number of unique players who played the title in the first 30 days of launch.</p>



<p>Sandfall’s creative director, Guillaume Broche, said the success was “so far beyond what any of us could have imagined,” detailing how nerve-wracking it was to release a title, but the “support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream.”</p>



<p>Broche also thanked Xbox and Game Pass for their support, noting that the game’s addition to the service allows people to “try our game when they might not have before,” particularly as the turn-based RPG genre can be off-putting for newcomers.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur is up for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-vote-game-awards-2025-all-categories-nominees-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several major honors at The Game Awards</a>, having been nominated for Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, Best Score/Music, Best Audio Design, Best Independent Game, Besty Debut Indie Game, and Best Role-Playing Game, while Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr make up half of the contenders for Best Performance.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/to-the-moon-founder-make-it-better-for-2026/</link>
            <guid>1371541</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>To The Moon’s inaugural event took place last month in the United Kingdom, and it was, by all accounts, a complete shambles. The images and clips shared on social media painted a picture of a sorry affair in every respect, and many creators made videos exposing the event as an utter failure.</p>



<p>Weeks after the event, To The Moon’s founder, Monty Stewart, has surfaced on LinkedIn with a lengthy statement about what comes next for the expo. He stressed that <strong>it will </strong>be back, and suggested that this year’s expo wasn’t all that bad.</p>







<h2 id="h-to-the-moon-will-return-in-2026">To The Moon Will Return in 2026</h2>



<p>Early in November, To The Moon was on a little marketing kick, and the materials provided suggested that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/to-the-moon-expo-recover-uk-games-expo/">planned to revive</a> the UK’s failing gaming expo scene. Fast forward to a weekday in the middle of November, and To The Moon had arrived, halted temporarily by bad weather, poor planning, and an almost empty conference hall in Birmingham, England.</p>



<p>On social media, creators wasted no time sharing images of the event, with some claiming they’d spent hundreds to reach the venue and were left feeling extremely sour and disappointed:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Alright last little photo dump of To the Moon Expo. These feature the VR Arena, B2B Trade stage, the Indie ‘City’ and the LAN Zone</p><p>Honestly my favourite part is flat hall lighting considering we were meant to be in a (checks notes) Spaceship… <a href="https://t.co/yINWrmiGpW">pic.twitter.com/yINWrmiGpW</a></p></div>— 💽 CaptainAshtro🔜DreamHack (@CaptainAshtro) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaptainAshtro/status/1989293562169843739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>There was almost nothing good to take away from To The Moon, but that’s not how the expo’s founder, Monty Stewart, put it on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7401872276251631616/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a recent post</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>On a personal level I wanted to say thank you to every single person that has supported and continues to support the vision of To The Moon Expo and attended. Every speaker, exhibitor, attendee and the like.</p><p>Seeing the vast majority of posts on LinkedIn being positive, hearing that some of our indies acquired investment meetings and received invaluable feedback on their games is a check box for me; alongside gamers being able to interact with actual games and their favourite IP’s, not just merch stalls. And let us not forget, we were the largest gathering of unique studios and games under one roof nationally within the UK for 2025.</p><p>If we can help people realise their dreams, acquire the funding they need to shoot for the stars and follow their creative passion; that is a win.</p><p>Were there some learning curves? For sure. Definitely some curveballs with the weather and a couple other aspects, but we continued onwards and adapted with the hand we were dealt.</p><p>Can we make it better? Damn right. How are we going to do that? We are looking to 2026 and moving forward with experience that only progress can teach!</p><p>I cannot wait to share with you what is coming for next year. I am also incredibly grateful to not have to handle the mantle by myself moving forward into 2026.</p><p>Innovation has always belonged those willing to challenge the status quo, not those who cling to it. So to the certain few people who have spent more energy on blocking new ideas than building their own; don’t worry, we aren’t here to replace you. Time will handle that for us.</p><p>We will continue to stand at the Vanguard for our creative industry and our movement to ensure that exhibiting at events is not fiscally gatekept and that creative passion within the UK and the globe can thrive.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>Not only does Stewart think the event wasn’t all that bad, but he also intends to come back in 2026 with a new expo, seemingly expecting it to be better received just because he promises it will be.</p>



<p>Some reports came in ahead of the event that revealed how ill-planned it was, even before it landed:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I will not be speaking at To The Moon Expo next week</p><p>I was asked to be part of an Esports advisory group for the event some months ago; however, after the announcement, we were never consulted</p><p>The panel that I was put on last minute, had little to no structure &amp; a loose topic</p></div>— Jeff Simpkins (@HereLiesJeff) <a href="https://twitter.com/HereLiesJeff/status/1986463348821467570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Everyday gamers went to the expo at the NEC in Birmingham expecting a spectacle of an event because of bold marketing claims, but were met with almost nothing to do. One user wrote on X (formerly Twitter), <em>‘Went to see the To the Moon expo today as it was my first ever time heading to see one, it’s just disappointing how little there was to do there, legitimately one area just has consoles connected to monitors with Minecraft installed.’</em></p>



<p>This is a little first-person perspective, but I was invited to attend To The Moon and got cold feet in the morning before making the 2.5-hour drive to Birmingham, instructing my colleague to ‘stay in bed’ because I had some ill juju about the expo. Was that a lucky escape?</p>



<p>Sadly, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-death-uk-gaming-expo/">EGX has died a death</a>, Insomnia appears to be coming back under some distrustful banner, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-gaming-expo-london-wasd/">WASD has also faded</a> into an abyss; there’s effectively nothing left in the United Kingdom for gamers.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord if you attended To The Moon</a> and what you thought about the event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon fans appear to have hit the nail on the head with a huge fan theory regarding Pokémon Pokopia, with leaks confirming the speculation.</p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases on March 5, 2026</a>, putting players in control of a playable Ditto that has transformed into a human, with the game’s setting showing islands filled with Pokémon but no humans in sight.</p>



<p>That has led to intense speculation that Pokémon Pokopia takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, and a fresh leak seems to confirm that environment.</p>







<h2 id="h-leaked-pokemon-pokopia-map-shows-post-apocalyptic-kanto">Leaked Pokémon Pokopia Map Shows Post-Apocalyptic Kanto</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Posting on X, <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1996007165002199320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CentroLeaks</a> shared what is claimed to be the Pokémon Pokopia map, and the translation shows that a post-apocalyptic adventure through Kanto is on the cards.</p>



<p>Areas on the map include Fuschia, with “dried up and unfertilized fieldland,” Pewter, “an abandoned mine covered by rocks,” and, perhaps the most telling of them all, the Viridian Area with a “never-ending burning forest of ash.”</p>



<p>All of those areas are well known in the Kanto region, with Fuschia City being the home of the Safari Zone, Pewter City presenting the first gym badge test against Brock, and Viridian Forest being one of the first areas players explore in the world of Kanto.</p>



<p>Additional content, reportedly arriving in DLC or as part of post-launch updates, includes areas for Cerulean, Cinnibar, Lavender, and Celedon.</p>



<p>Ever since the first trailer of Pokémon Pokopia appeared, fans have theorized that the game’s setting would be a post-apocalptic version of Kanto, with major hints including a destroyed first-generation Pokédex and the remnants of buildings like Pokémon Centers.</p>



<p>Fans have also theorised that Peakychu, the mysterious ghost-like version of Pikachu, is the deceased version of Red’s partner Pokémon Pokopia, and Mosslax, a Snorlax covered in greenery, is the same Snorlax that players in the Kanto region are tasked with waking up by using the Pokéflute.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether those theories are true, and it could be that Pokémon Pokopia takes place in an alternate universe away from the main franchise. </p>



<p>While this may seem far-fetched, Pokémon has blown open the doors to craziness with the likes of time-travelling in Pokémon Legends: Z-A and wormholes in Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon.</p>
