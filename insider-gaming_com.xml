<p>PlayStation and Gran Turismo developer Polyphony Digital announced a new GT game out of nowhere for the holiday season. Find out everything we know about My First Gran Turismo—including its release date—and why it’s one of the most unique entries in the franchise.</p>



<p>A fun surprise never goes amiss, and I’d say My First Gran Turismo falls under this category. PlayStation fans have been reveling in the splendor of Gran Turismo 7 since 2022 and its continuous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gran-turismo-7-update-brings-new-cars-and-updated-physics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content updates</a>. The most recent installment offers the most realistic graphics today, an exhaustive selection of vehicles from world-class bangers to piddly starter cars, and enough racing content to keep you busy throughout an entire Le Mans 24-Hour race. </p>



<p>Now, we have My First Gran Turismo, and it is an odd title. I’ll let you in on a secret, there’s a reason Polyphony Digital went with this wording; so let’s lift the suspension and burn some rubber.</p>

<p><strong>My First Gran Turismo has a Dec. 6 release date, with the content expected to drop at 12:00 AM local time—subject to change.</strong></p>



<p>The release date and time were confirmed by a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/04/my-first-gran-turismo-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-december-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony PlayStation blog</a>. So, unless something happens between now and the launch window, prepare yourself for high-octane action on Dec. 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-my-first-gran-turismo">How to Play My First Gran Turismo </h2>



<p><strong>You can play My First Gran Turismo by downloading it from the PlayStation Store once the product goes live exclusively on PS4 and PS5.</strong></p>

<li>In the search bar, type in “My First Gran Turismo.”</li>



<li>Click on the <strong>My First Gran Turismo</strong> product option.</li>



<li>Press to download the software—if it says “Add to wishlist,” it means the game isn’t ready to download yet.</li>

</ol>



<h2 id="h-is-my-first-gran-turismo-free-to-play">Is My First Gran Turismo free to play?</h2>

<p>No money is required to play, so sit back, download it, and experience the unbridled authenticity of peak, simulated racing.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-my-first-gran-turismo">What is My First Gran Turismo?</h2>

<p>A new character for Marvel Rivals has leaked before the game’s official release on December 6. According to a known Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1864338925164093603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaker on Twitter</a>, Ultron will be added to the game in the future.</p>



<p>According to the leak, Ultron will be a support character with six abilities. Those abilities are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Encephalo-Ray</strong> (Primary) –  Unleash a burning energy beam.</li>



<li><strong>Dynamic Flight</strong>&nbsp;(Secondary) – Fly quickly in the direction of movement and then enter a free-flight mode.</li>



<li><strong>Algorithm Correction</strong> (Passive)&nbsp;– Hold Jump to fall slowly.</li>



<li><strong>Imperative: Firewall</strong>&nbsp;(E) – Summon drones to grant Bonus Health to allies within range, centered on himself and the ally marked by Imperative: Patch. </li>



<li><strong>Imperative: Patch&nbsp;</strong>(Left Shift) – Command a giant drone to follow an ally, constantly healing allies in its radius, with more healing for the designated ally. </li>



<li><strong>Rage of Ultron&nbsp;</strong>(Ultimate) – Summon Ultron Drones to fire Encephalo-Rays, damaging enemies or healing allies.</li>
</ul>



<p>NetEase has yet to confirm Ultron as a character. However, with all of this information out in the public from a data mine, it should be only a matter of time before he is officially announced.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ultron and his abilities seemingly coming to Marvel Rivals?&nbsp;Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
