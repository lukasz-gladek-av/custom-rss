The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>Fantastical Parade is a fantastical name for the first new Pokémon TCG Pocket set of 2026. The new B2 set brings new cards, new Shinies, and new Mega ex variations. Fantastical Parade B2 is kicking off the new year with a bang, and IG has the Pokémon TCG Pocket Fantastical Parade release date, start times, and more.</p>



<p>It hasn’t gone unnoticed that developers Creatures Inc.&nbsp;and&nbsp;DeNA have taken feedback on board. The regularity of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-to-expect-from-pokemon-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> sets has eased up since the first anniversary, and the Deluxe ex set has been a big help. It’s now time for Set B2, and Fantastical Parade is looking to party on through the night (and every other night).</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/</link>
            <guid>1414528</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has revealed a <strong>four-month roadmap </strong>for ARC Raiders, the studio’s new extraction adventure title that was released in October 2025. The roadmap, which spans January to April, is a long-awaited thing that fans have been begging for, and now that it’s here, it promises <strong>plenty</strong>.</p>



<p>Each month boasts a unique theme that comes with new ARC enemies, map improvements, quality-of-life changes, and events galore. If nothing else, the ARC Raiders 2026 roadmap promises to hugely expand the game’s lore.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-roadmap-finally-unveiled">ARC Raiders Roadmap Finally Unveiled</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders was in a rocky place coming out of the festive period. The game fell prey to some issues over the holiday break, and exploits and cheaters alike were running rampant. As soon as Embark Studios got back into the office, things sharpened up a bit, and now that the roadmap is here, fans finally have something to look forward to.</p>



<p>That includes a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">four-part update spree</a> that rewards players with new content once per month.</p>



<p>Here’s the full spread:</p>



<p><strong>January – Headwinds</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New matchmaking option (level 40+)</li>



<li>New minor map condition</li>



<li>Player project</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February – Shrouded Sky</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New map condition</li>



<li>New ARC threat</li>



<li>Player project</li>



<li>Raider Deck</li>



<li>Map update</li>



<li>Expedition window</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>March – Flashpoint</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New map condition</li>



<li>New ARC threat</li>



<li>Player project</li>



<li>Scrappy update</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>April – Riven Tides</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New map</li>



<li>New large ARC</li>



<li>New map condition</li>



<li>Expedition window</li>
</ul>



<p>The introduction of the first new map condition in February should bring about Toxic Swamp, which was discovered weeks ago by eagle-eyed gamers. We’ve also known for a while that February will yield a new Raider Deck and Expedition window.</p>



<p>What’s not so amazing is that we need to wait until <strong>April </strong>to get a large-scale ARC threat and a new map, but talk of a ‘map update’ in February is enough to potentially keep players engaged.</p>



<p>Plenty is coming in ARC Raiders, and the roadmap is indicative of all the work Embark Studios is doing – and plans to keep doing – to keep this game growing and thriving.</p>

A few bits drop in the remainder of January with the release of Headwinds, such as a new Player Project and Minor Map Condition, but the real fun begins in February with Shrouded Sky. </p>







<p>Check out this guide for everything to know about the new content coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-meta-guns-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> in February 2026. </p>

<p><strong>As things stand, the Escalation Roadmap for ARC Raiders suggests that plenty of new content is on the way, including a new Map Condition, new ARC, and even a new Map Update. </strong></p>



<p>And somehow, that’s not all, as February is gearing up to be a major month in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-aggression-based-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>. Here’s everything coming to ARC Raiders during the Shrouded Sky updates.</p>



<ul>
<li>New Map Condition</li>



<li>New ARC Threat</li>



<li>Player Project</li>



<li>Raider Deck</li>



<li>Map Update</li>



<li>Expedition Window</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a comprehensive list, and each phrase has a small image next to it, which might hint at more details. For example, the New Map Condition is pictured alongside a gust of wind—can we expect a storm to hit certain maps? As for the new ARC threat, a flying insect is shown, implying another airborne ARC is on the way. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-the-february-content-release-in-arc-raiders">When Will The February Content Release In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no detailed release window for the upcoming content, but it’s fair to assume that when it does drop, it’ll be at the usual ARC Raiders timings: 1:30 a.m. PT / 4:30 a.m. ET / 9:30 a.m. GMT / 10:30 a.m. CET</strong></p>



<p>It looks like it’s going to be an exciting month, but it can be frustrating to be left guessing when it could all arrive. It’s reasonable to assume that Embark Studios will scatter the content throughout the month to keep the game as fresh as possible. </p>







<p>That’s how they’ve handled it in the past, but everything is subject to change as it draws ever nearer. As usual, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> will keep this article updated should anything change or be announced.</p>

<p>Vampire Crawlers fans can check out the game through a demo arriving for Steam and Xbox in February 2026. </p>



<p>A dungeon-crawling, roguelike deckbuilder spin-off of Vampire Survivors, Vampire Crawlers, was announced during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vampire-crawlers-revealed-at-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Partner Preview</a> event last year, with a Day One release set for Game Pass Premium and Ultimate. The title is scheduled to arrive in 2026, but could be delayed if the devs think it isn’t ready. However, whether it is ready or not, players can try out the game next month on Xbox and Steam through a new demo. </p>







<h2 id="h-vampire-crawlers-demo-announced-for-steam-and-xbox">Vampire Crawlers Demo Announced for Steam and Xbox</h2>



<p>As revealed through Episode 1 of “Let’s Explore Vampire Crawlers” on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ael4oMaKQM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, the demo for Vampire Crawlers will release on February 23 for Steam and Xbox. The video also talks more about the upcoming title, with the devs revealing the main focus this time is “fast turn-based combat”. The devs have recognised that one of the main complaints about some of the most popular turn-based games is that they can be slow and repetitive, and that’s what they want to change.</p>



<p>To circumvent this issue, many devs offer ways to speed up the gameplay by introducing “fast-forward” or “skip-animation” features. However, animations in the games are where all the fun lies, which is why in Vampire Crawlers, players don’t need to wait for the animation to complete to trigger the next abilities. What’s more, the game will not just attack enemies in the front, but will spread to all targets. </p>



<p>The new feature, called Turbo Turn, enables players to perform rapid attacks on enemies without requiring excessive resource management. This feature is particularly beneficial for beginners. However, there’s also something for veterans of the genre. As you play and progress, you can find relics and treasures that unlock new gameplay options involving the cards. Additionally, there’s a gem customization mechanic that allows players to enhance their cards with various effects.</p>
