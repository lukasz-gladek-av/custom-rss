<p>The Daily Mail has shared new looks at Sophie Turner in the role of Lara Croft in the upcoming Tomb Raider series for Prime Video.</p>



<p>On February 6, 2026, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Daily Mail </a>shared photos of Lara Croft in action, showing Sophie Turner parachuting over a lake and running through the woods. Instead of Croft’s signature green top and shorts, she wore athletic wear and cargo pants for the scene, which was filmed in the rain in Surrey.</p>



<p>As of yet, there’s no release date for the upcoming series, which will also feature Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs, and began filming in January. However, Sophie has already encountered some challenges while filming the role. She stated on the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSLuQpWjlj4&amp;pp=ygUeanVsaWEgY3VubmluZ2hhbSBzb3BoaWUgdHVybmVy"> Julia Cunningham Show</a> that she’d become aware of back issues during Tomb Raider training.</p>



<p>“I’ve learned I have a perpetual back problem, but I also realised that it’s much easier to kind of build muscle if you’ve ever worked out before in your life, which I never had,” she said.</p>

<p>Fortnite loves a good collab. miHoYo and Honkai: Star Rail are joining forces with the Fortnite goliath to create epic content for all players to experience through skins and more, and a release date is available.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/honkai-star-rail/" id="3565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honkai: Star Rail</a> is another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/hoyoverse/" id="95199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HoYoverse</a> success, with the free-to-play title continuing to dominate the scene over two years after its explosion into the universe. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/epic-games/" id="87655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games</a> smells success from a mile away, which is why a Honkai: Star Rail and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> collab makes too much sense NOT to do.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s not an extensive crossover, but fans of both franchises will be pleased with the upcoming content.</p>



<p>You can look forward to “A brand-new UEFN island and kick off a creator-involved collaboration tournament,” to celebrate the occasion.</p>
