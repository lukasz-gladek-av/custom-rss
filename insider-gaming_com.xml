<p>It may still be a couple of years away from release, but more information regarding the PlayStation 6 (PS6) handheld console continues to come out.</p>



<p>In his latest video going over some new specs and details he’s uncovered, Moore’s Law Is Dead (MLID) says that the upcoming PS6 handheld console, codenamed “Canis”, will be dockable for connection to an external display.  </p>



<p><strong>“That’s right everybody,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Multiple documents directly call out that this thing can be docked, will be docked like the Nintendo Switch 2.” </strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-news-many-developers-still-don-t-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits">More News: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Many Developers Still Don’t Have Nintendo Switch 2 Dev Kits</a></h6>



<p>When talking about the specs, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-A3Bl2hXoQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MLID said that the system</a> will have <strong>16 compute units of RDNA 5 at 1.20GHz</strong> while in handheld mode. When docked, that speed <strong>jumps to around 1.65GHz</strong>. </p>



<p>Other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously rumored specs</a> for the device include full backward compatibility with PS5 and PS4 titles, 4 x Zen 6c cores, a M.2 SSD slow, haptic vibration, 15W TBP, and more. </p>



<p>The PS6 handheld, along with the standard PS6 console, are reportedly planned to release sometime in late 2027-early 2028.</p>



<p>Sony has yet to announce or confirm any of the specs that have been revealed recently for the PS6 handheld. Until that happens, or Insider Gaming can independently verified its legitimacy, it’s important to take these claims with a grain of salt.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you like games, you’ve probably heard the name Hollow Knight: Silksong at some point. Its disappearance into the seemingly abyss following its 2019 announcement was curious. Thankfully, it resurfaced in 2025, it’s coming out this year, and we’re here to let you know if you need to play the first game beforehand.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-or-prequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong is a direct sequel to 2017’s Hollow Knight</a>. The Knight has stepped aside in the new game so that Hornet can take center stage. If you’re a newcomer to the series, this all might sound more foreign than if I’d written this in an alien-like language. </p>



<p>This guide is to help you if you’re not well-versed in the Hollow Knight world. You should be excited for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong</a>, and you should have all the details ahead of its long-awaited release.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-i-play-hollow-knight-before-hollow-knight-silksong">Should I Play Hollow Knight Before Hollow Knight: Silksong?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’re having fun either way. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It is not essential or a requirement for you to play Hollow Knight before Silksong, but I recommend you do so, as it will help you to appreciate Silksong’s improvements and new content.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Silksong</a> puts you in the shoes of Hornet—a prevalent character in Hollow Knight. By playing the original, you get to understand Hornet’s roots better, how she ties into the world, and why we’re suddenly controlling her instead of The Knight.</p>



<p>Team Cherry has said that Silksong will be a good introduction for new players. It’s a different world with fresh mechanics, but Silksong still has basic tutorials and pointers on how to get started. There will be plenty of first-time players and consumers of Hollow Knight media likely following the hype train.</p>



<p>What I will say is that Silksong was originally planned as DLC for Hollow Knight. So you get the sense that this is a genuine continuation of the world that came before. All things considered, <strong>I recommend you sink a few hours into Hollow Knight before Silksong</strong> to become acquainted with the world, movement mechanics, and the vibe of the franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-worth-playing-in-2025">Is Hollow Knight Worth Playing in 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight is 100% still worth playing in 2025, as it’s considered one of the all-time great indie games and is still incredibly fun to play nearly 10 years later.</strong></p>



<p>To reiterate, Silksong is a new chapter in Hollow Knight. New abilities, new bosses, new biomes, and much more. Playing Hollow Knight means you get to enjoy and appreciate the foundation laid down before Silksong; you get to experience boss fights you would miss out on otherwise, and even small details, such as backgrounds and the soundtrack, need to be enjoyed and savored.</p>



<p>When you think of the Metroidvania genre, or find anyone’s ‘best Metroidvania games of all time’ list, Hollow Knight will be on it. Do yourself a favour and find time to play it—even if it’s only after Silksong.</p>

I recommend you go there to help out newcomers and open up deep conversations with long-time fans.</p>
