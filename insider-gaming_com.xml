<p>On social media, a Treyarch developer has written a transparent post explaining why Call of Duty’s movement seemed to slow down after 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. He also explained why certain mechanics aren’t all that effective in Black Ops 6, despite them having been a staple in the Call of Duty space for many years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-faster-is-not-always-healthier">‘Faster is Not Always Healthier’</h2>



<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/MaTtKs/status/1862340934832132335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a>, Treyarch’s Matt Scronce confirmed – in a way – that movement mechanics were slowed dramatically after MW19 because ‘faster is not always healthier’. He explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once prone and crouch speeds become too fast, you end up with mismatch between 1st and 3rd person POV leading to “snaking” which has been a massive problem in the past.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Modern Warfare’s movement mechanics were fast-paced and intense, with slide cancelling, snaking, and jump shots making up the meta that eventually worked into Warzone when it was released in March 2020. These elements remained, but players were forced to contend with slower, heavier games that felt nerfed in terms of movement.</p>



<p>Scronce’s comments were posted in response to a video comparing Black Ops 6 and MW19, showing how much slower the game has become over the years, particularly movement mechanics like jumping.</p>



<p>He wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve never personally been a fan of spamming jump during combat, so when we intentionally designed omnimovement mechanics, we adjusted sway/bob when jumping by default to ensure that wasn’t the most effective tactic during engagements. </p>



<p>If you want to spam jump while shooting, we have Perks and Attachments to increase effectiveness just like we do for slide and dive.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’ve been relying on jump shots for all these years and wondered why you’re having no luck hitting your shots now when doing so, that’s your explanation in black and white.</p>



<p>Scronce signed off with a reassurance that Treyarch is always evaluating feedback and making improvements based on the community’s sentiment.</p>

<p>Delta Force is preparing to go head-to-head with the likes of Arena Breakout: Infinite and Escape from Tarkov in the extraction shooter world. Recently, it was revealed that the developers are willing to work with a relatively controversial mechanic to compete with the games that spearhead the genre.</p>



<p>When Delta Force’s extraction mode hits an end-of-season ‘wipe’, players will be able to decide if they want to opt in or not. That means that with each new season, players can carry their progress over rather than wiping and starting from the beginning.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-a-decision">Make a Decision</h2>



<p>For the extraction shooter community, a regular wipe makes sense. It ensures that things remain balanced, allowing players to all sit at the same level once every so often. In Escape from Tarkov, wipes typically occur once every six months, and when each wipe arrives, so too does a major game update that changes the playing field.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Escape from Tarkov’s developer, Battlestate Games, released a PvE mode in the game that allows users to play indefinitely without undergoing a wipe, and that was a hit with many players – particularly those who don’t have the time to grind once every six months.</p>



<p>Delta Force is following in those footsteps – in a way.</p>



<p>It was recently confirmed that when a wipe arrives at the end of each three-month season in Delta Force, players are given the choice to either wipe and start fresh or retain what they’ve earned and unlocked and keep playing as normal.</p>



<p>There’s a twist, though. If you choose to wipe, you’ll unlock exclusive rewards and abilities, one of which is the opportunity to spawn as a boss character and take enemies down using powerful weapons. </p>



<p>It’s entirely up to you.</p>



<p>Will you be wiping in Delta Force, or would you prefer to stick with the same gear forever? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you thought Fortnite didn’t have much left in the tank, you’d be sorely mistaken. Recently, the game reached new heights during the Juice WLRD finale event, racking up a whopping <strong>14.3 million </strong>concurrent players, a new all-time high for the game. </p>



<p>This new record effectively decimated the number secured by the arrival of Fortnite OG last year. When the game’s original map was reintroduced, just north of 11 million concurrent players found their way into the game, but that record has been left standing in the dust.</p>



<hr>







<p>Fortnite’s live events are nothing short of monumental, and they never fail to attract millions of users. </p>



<p>In the past, we’ve seen the likes of Travis Scott, DJ Marshmello, J Balvin, and Ariana Grande appear in Fortnite to perform live shows before millions of fans. Typically, these shows have been accompanied by in-game events, limited-time bundles, and skins.</p>



<p>The most recent event brought about an end to Chapter 5, and it saw the late Juice WLRD perform tracks while accompanied by jaw-dropping visuals.</p>



<p>This is a new bar for Fortnite, and it will likely go untouched for some time. </p>



<p>Fortnite’s newest season starts today. The launch trailer for the new season dropped a couple of days ago and it showcased some upcoming content, including a Godzilla-themed event, of all characters. </p>



<p>It has been a glowing year or two for Fortnite. From the arrival of the new UEFN to the success of Fortnite Festival and Rocket Racing, Fortnite is in top form and continuing to impress gamers after almost ten years on the market.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Chapter 5? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Marvel has released the launch trailer for Marvel Rivals, which launches worldwide on December 5. The trailer, which is reminiscent of an anime opening sequence, showcases many of the hero characters coming to the game, and there are a few easter eggs and references sprinkled in for good measure.</p>



<p>It’s an energetic trailer that has fans stoked for what’s to come. Check it out below.</p>

<p>I love the trailer for Marvel Rivals – particularly the sequence that unfolds midway through showcasing a gaggle of characters replicating the iconic group shot seen in 2012’s The Avengers.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer to add a little more fuel to your hype train:</p>

<p>On YouTube, a trailer for a cancelled LEGO James Bond project that would have been developed by TT Games has emerged. It’s only 50 seconds long, but it showcases a game that was reportedly scrapped several years ago, about the time when LEGO Dimensions was discontinued.</p>



<p>It has been claimed online that the game was being pieced together during ‘the last year LEGO Dimensions was being worked on’ in 2016, but it was ultimately decided that James Bond wasn’t a suitable franchise to focus on due to the ‘violence and sexual innuendo’ that the series is famed for.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-brick-by-brick">Brick by Brick</h2>



<p>LEGO has dabbled with many game-based franchises over the years, ranging from Star Wars to Indiana Jones, but it never delivered a James Bond project. Given the expansiveness of the JB universe, it seems as though a LEGO series would write itself – and with the release of this leaked trailer, we now know how close we came to that being realised.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer that was released on YouTube (live at the time of publishing):</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Leaked Unreleased LEGO James Bond Game Trailer - FINAL VERSION (READ DESCRIPTION)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkSR8L8Gjwc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The trailer showcases iconic scenes from various James Bond projects, and for something that was scrapped quite early on, it looks relatively polished. It seems as though it was set to be a fully voiced game, which was starting to be the standard for LEGO games around the time that LEGO JB was reportedly being developed.</p>



<p>Sadly, LEGO James Bond was lost to the abyss of time and won’t ever see the light of day.</p>

<p>Ella Purnell, one of the faces of the Fallout TV show that debuted on Prime this year, is soaking up source material in anticipation of the show’s second season. Purnell, who plays Lucy MacLean, fronted the Emmy Award-winning show when the first season was released in April, working alongside Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten to bring the post-apocalyptic universe to life.</p>



<p>In a string of posts on social media, Purnell revealed that she’s been instructed to play Fallout: New Vegas to ‘prep for a certain job I may or may not be on soon’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-the-wasteland">Back to the Wasteland</h2>



<p>Fallout premiered in April 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, emerging as one of Prime’s biggest launches ever. It proved to be a boon for the entire franchise, as player counts soared across everything from Fallout 4 to the online title, Fallout 76. It was a resurgence of sorts for the series, and for a while, Fallout mania was running wild.</p>



<p>On Bluesky, Ella Purnell posted that she’s playing Fallout: New Vegas – on Xbox – in preparation for filming the show’s second season, which was due to start in November but may have been delayed, if Purnell’s post is anything to go by.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Purnell responded to some fan requests to head north through Quarry Junction after starting the game, realising several hours later how much of a mistake that was. New Vegas veterans will understand why that’s such a problem.</p>



<p>This morning, Purnell posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Obviously time isn’t on my side to absorb all the source material in time. I will still absorb the game until I’m called to the wasteland.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fallout: New Vegas is considered the best game in the series by many, and we <strong>know </strong>that it’s the setting for the second season per the closing moments of the show’s first season.</p>
