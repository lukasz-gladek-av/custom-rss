<p>The team at Xbox, including Matt Booty, has just revealed that the next Xbox Developer Direct, scheduled to take place in January 2026, will be huge, but regardless of that, it can’t fit in everything that is launching across the platform in the next year.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the team teased a phenomenal year for Xbox through 2026, with the imminent launches of some massive titles, and some sizeable anniversaries being lined up.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-xbox-developer-direct-is-coming-soon">Next Xbox Developer Direct is Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a recent<a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> interview with Variety</a>, Xbox’s Matt Booty spoke about the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct showcase, poised to take place in just a few weeks:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t share exactly what’s there, but we’ve got a lot of stuff that we’re shipping next year. In fact, usually Dev Direct is about highlighting what’s coming up for the year ahead. This year, we’ve got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show.</p>



<p>So I will tell you that Playground Games is going to be in the Dev Direct, but we’ll have more stuff next year to ship than we can fit into one Dev Direct show in January, which is a good place to be.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to talk about all the good things happening for Team Green through 2026:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For us, it’s really going to be a great year. It’s going to be the 25th anniversary of Xbox, we’re coming up on franchises of ours that have got these decade-level anniversaries. </p>



<p>It’s the 40th anniversary of Bethesda, Blizzard’s 35, ‘Diablo’ shipped 30 years ago. We’ve announced things like the ‘Halo Remastered’ collection that we’ve got coming, and we’ve got a lot of other things that we’ll talk about soon, that ship next year. So it’s going to be a real banner year for the brand and a banner year for some of our biggest franchises to show up across the industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Booty also took the opportunity to address the developing Call of Duty movie, explaining how good a pick Taylor Sheridan is as the project’s writer.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you think about the way that he tells stories, you think about the other things that he’s been a writer on, I think that the team feels that he’s got a good approach to characters and a good approach to story that’ll match up with their vision of what a ‘Call of Duty’ movie is.</p>

<p>Team Falcons and The MongolZ are the first teams to fall from the StarLadder Budapest Major playoffs after both being swept by more capable opponents. Their fixtures ended with a 0-2 scoreline, with Spirit knocking out Falcons and a dominant Vitality squad dispatching The MongolZ.</p>

<h2 id="h-first-eliminations-confirmed">First Eliminations Confirmed</h2>



<p>The grand final round of the StarLadder Budapest Major is fast approaching, and one team is lining up to walk away with a massive $500,000 prize. Before that arrives, another five fixtures, including the BO5 grand final, has to take place.</p>



<p>Team Falcons fell short after facing the daunting challenge of Team Spirit, who entered the playoffs in formidable form. Spirit was dominant out of the gate, sweeping the series 2-0 without too much fuss. </p>



<p>It was a similar story for The MongolZ, and despite dishing out earlier upsets against some capable sides, Vitality was just too quickly able to outmaneuver the Mongolian side. It was unsustainable, and another 2-0 sweep brought another chapter of the Major to a close.</p>



<p>The remaining matches are set to be blockbuster fixtures:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit vs. Team Vitality</li>



<li>MOUZ vs. FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Natus Vincere vs. FURIA</li>
</ul>
