<p>Everyone, raise your glass and let’s make a toast to The FINALS, as it’s quite literally introduced a weapon skin that makes toast as you’re playing a match.</p>



<p>Just when you think you’ve seen every kind of wacky cosmetic in a live-service shooter, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-current-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The FINALS</a> comes along and boots all expectations out of the window and into the kitchen—next to your toaster. If the thrill of killing and scoring points doesn’t satiate your appetite, then a new toast-making skin might.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-finals-players-are-toast-thanks-to-new-skin">The FINALS Players Are Toast, Thanks To New Skin</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A real breadwinner. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve fallen out of love with the P90 or need a new exercise to use it, Embark might interest you with the new Toast &amp; Roast Skin.</p>



<p>When you want to reload, simply insert bread. Hilariously, the longer you fire the gun and the more you burn through your ammo clip, the more the bread will cook—Ergo, the more it will toast.</p>







<p>Should you suddenly be overcome by full, unadulterated, and unfilmed bullet-spewing menace, barreling through a full clip will completely incinerate your toast: Taking it from a well-toasted snack to a charred mess.</p>



<p>It’s a genius skin, and fits in with the arcadey and kooky nature of The FINALS.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It would look out of place in Call of Duty or Battlefield, that’s for sure. Is it your new favorite skin in The FINALS? If you still play The FINALS, what keeps drawing you in compared to all the other new shooters released in 2025?</p>



<p>As always, please head to the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to express your thoughts, whether about The FINALS or anything else!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Price, Explained—How Much Does It Cost On PlayStation 5?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-price/</link>
            <guid>1374076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re wondering whether a year-old Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5 still has a high price, you might be in for some turbulence. This guide has details on the game’s full price and the different editions you can pick up.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5</a> isn’t a free in-flight meal, far from it. Originally an Xbox and PC title, MSFS 2024 arrives on PS5 with all the updates and content additions that have landed over the last 12-plus months. But don’t think Xbox Game Studios and Microsoft will go easy on you, PlayStation owners.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-cost">How Much Does Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Standard Edition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5 has a fairly routine $69.99 or £69.99 price.</strong></p>



<p>No discount, no price reduction, it’s a full-priced port on PlayStation. It is a premium property with a ton of content, though, so it’s worth the price of admission. When you also consider that this is the first entry in the series’ 40-year history to arrive on PlayStation, it’s quite a significant milestone.</p>



<p>Many will see $69.99 as a fair deal. This is only for the Standard Edition, so is the damage much worse for more expensive packages?</p>







<h2 id="h-all-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-editions-amp-prices">All Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Editions &amp; Prices</h2>



<p><strong>There are four Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 editions for PS5: Standard, Deluxe, Premium Deluxe, and Aviator.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of each edition and what it costs. Warning: The later editions get sky-high with their pricing.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">MSFS 2024 Edition</th><th data-align="center">Price</th><th data-align="center">Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$69.99 or £69.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-70 Aircraft<br>-150 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$99.99 or £99.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-80 Aircraft<br>-155 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Premium Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$129.99 or £129.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-95 Aircraft<br>-160 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Aviator Edition</td><td data-align="center">$199.99 or £199.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-125 Aircraft<br>-160 Airports</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s up to you if you can justify as much as $200 for the PS5 launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. What do you think of its pricing? Should it be more reasonable? Is $200 too much for simply adding more vehicles and airports?

<p>A new Monster Hunter Showcase is scheduled for December 8, 2025, featuring the title update 4 for MH Wilds and the latest information on MH Stories 3. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-still-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top launches of 2025</a>, but some PC performance issues and content complaints have brought criticism from the community. The developers already confirmed they are working on those issues and have now announced a new showcase that will provide players with details on another free content update for Monster Hunter Wilds and the latest information on their upcoming title, MH Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. </p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-monster-hunter-showcase-on-december-8-2025">How to Watch Monster Hunter Showcase on December 8, 2025?</h2>



<p>Announced through the Monster Hunter <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1996867143057445119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the Monster Hunter Showcase will begin on Monday, December 8, 2025, at 2:00 PM PST. Interested readers can tune in to the live stream on the official <a href="https://t.co/WbntyFTmOM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://t.co/KNEebgyzzy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> accounts. The developers have also explicitly stated that “For Monster Hunter Wilds, the event will focus solely on Free Title Update 4.” For Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, we might get to see new story details or maybe a gameplay deep dive. Players will have to wait to know for sure. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is set to arrive in March 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. The title is the latest instalment of the RPG series set in Monster Hunter World. Players get to become a rider who can raise and bond with their favourite monsters while exploring a brand new story that involves two countries on a path of destruction and a set of twin Rathalos, a species that was thought to be extinct. Pre-orders for the game went live in October.  </p>

<p>It’s finally time for PS5 owners to book their ticket to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The title has so far been kept from the blue brand’s main console, but now MSFS 2024 has a PlayStation 5 release date, along with complete start times.</p>



<p>A one-way ticket to the sky beckons for PS5 players. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> took off just over one year ago, and boarded with plenty of Xbox and PC passengers on board. The flight-sim title is the latest in the franchise, and it’s going to be another instance of ‘Xbox Game Studios’ being bizarrely plastered all over a PS5 game.</p>



<p>Here are the official Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 release details for PS5.</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches worldwide for PlayStation 5 owners on December 8.</strong></p>







<p>It’s nearly a year to the day since MSFS 2024 debuted on Xbox and PC: November 19, 2024, to be exact. But now it’s time for MSFS to add its name alongside Forza Horizon 5, Gears of War: Reloaded, and the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved as Xbox hits to make the jump to the blue side of life.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-on-playstation-5-have-early-access">Does Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 On PlayStation 5 Have Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>The PS5 release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 comes with early access for those who pre-order the Deluxe, Aviator Edition, or Premium Editions.</strong></p>



<p>Consider this the gaming equivalent of securing priority boarding on a flight. Early access is out—meaning you don’t need to wait until December 8—and there are more details below on dates and times.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-start-times">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024’s first official launch time is on December 3 at 5 AM PST, with its default release arriving on December 8 at 5 AM PST.</strong></p>

<p>Google Trends has just published its Year in Search report for 2025, and it uncovers a juicy tidbit about Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders, the all-new extraction adventure that has taken the gaming world by storm in the last few weeks. The game was released on October 30 to an overwhelmingly positive reception and has been on the upswing ever since.</p>



<p>Google’s new report revealed that, in 2025, ARC Raiders was the <strong>most-searched game</strong>, despite being released at the tail end of October. It beat all comers to hold the top spot, which is indicative of the sheer amount of interest around this game.</p>







<p>ARC Raiders has been scoring high in the review stakes, securing award nominations, and holding a consistent audience of hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. It’s arguably the most accessible extraction game ever made, and it has turned the tide for a genre otherwise thought of as being ‘too challenging’ for the average gamer.</p>



<p>That’s partly why ARC Raiders was the most-searched game in 2025 on Google, which was confirmed in a recent report published by the Google Trends team.</p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://trends.withgoogle.com/year-in-search/2025/">the full list</a>, and it might surprise you where certain games fall:</p>



<ol>
<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Strands</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Path of Exile 2</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 6</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Roblox</li>
</ol>



<p>It might come as a shock to see GTA 6 so far down the line, but that’s mostly because it’s a case of gamers biding their time until news surfaces. There’s almost nothing to search for otherwise related to Grand Theft Auto 6. On the other hand, ARC Raiders has mission guides, item location tips, loadout walkthroughs, and more, all of which are being eagerly sought out by players far and wide.</p>







<p>It’s a well-deserved accolade for ARC Raiders, which has turned out to be a stunning game that has impressed players more than anyone truly expected. Embark Studios has promised to support the game for years to come, so only bright things are in store.</p>

<p>Activision hasn’t officially unveiled this season’s Call of Duty League skins, and until now, all we’ve seen is the default Call of Duty League Launch pack. That is, until one user on social media uploaded a video showcasing all the CDL 2026 skins in the Call of Duty store.</p>



<p>Thanks to the short video, we now know what every CDL 2026 skin looks like, and this year, they’re more customized per team than they have been in a minute, with a special focus on the skin’s face mask layout.</p>







<p>On social media, user RealityUK uploaded a two-minute video detailing every CDL 2026 Operator skin. This included a brief snapshot of every team competing in this season’s Call of Duty League:</p>



<ul>
<li>Boston Breach</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York</li>



<li>FaZe Vegas</li>



<li>G2 Minnesota</li>



<li>LA Thieves</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>OpTic Texas</li>



<li>Paris Gentle Mates</li>



<li>Riyadh Falcons</li>



<li>Toronto KOI</li>



<li>Vancouver Surge</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the full video, provided by Reality:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The feedback on the leaked CDL skins was mixed, with many coming to claim that their favorite teams were ‘done dirty’ by the skin designers. Many had issues with OpTic Texas’ skin in the video, one of which (the away skin) was almost a plain, stark white with no OpTic colorways.</p>



<p>One user wrote, <em>‘Why does OpTic look so barebones? They are getting more revenue this year the more people buy it’s not fixed anymore why did they go so basic I’m confused?’</em></p>



<p>What wasn’t revealed are the incoming weapon camos, stickers, emblems, and charms associated with each CDL team. It typically costs around $9.99 to purchase a CDL skin pack, and when doing so, you’ll unlock all the above, but all we’ve seen leaked thus far are the Operator skins themselves.</p>
