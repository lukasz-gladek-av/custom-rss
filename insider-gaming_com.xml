<p>Chapter 2’s Candy Factory takes a sinister right turn in Little Nightmares 3. It’s where the game starts to become unhinged and reveal its true colors. While exploring the mysteries of the facility, you need to find Dolls in Little Nightmares 3. Our Candy Factory guide is the perfect walkthrough to do this.</p>



<p>It’s hard to keep your eyes on the ball in Candy Factory. A nasty spider-bug lady is chasing you, and the whole building is a gargantuan cesspool of unnerving sights and sounds. Hidden amongst its many rooms, corridors, and hidey-holes are Doll collectibles.</p>



<p>If you’re after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>‘s collection of secret Dolls—especially for the game’s trophy list—you need this guide (and some prayers after).</p>

<figure><figcaption>Another five to go. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You must find five Dolls throughout Candy Factory in Little Nightmares 3 if you want to own every doll in the level.</strong></p>



<p>A tiny spoiler alert: Not every <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> chapter has five Dolls. That’s why it’s important to address this question in each Doll guide. Candy Factor does have five, so let’s get into the level!</p>

<p>The compulsory path to completing Candy Factory takes you into a large room filled with filing cabinets, folders, and the chapter’s main antagonist. Sneak across the room to the other side and climb up the shelves. <strong>Reach the beams at the top</strong>, and when you start walking toward the screen, turn left at the end, and the first Doll is at the end of the beam.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-2-candy-factory-doll-2-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 2 Candy Factory Doll 2 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s there, we promise you. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Make your way through Candy Factory until you reach a room where you pull down a lever, making the bugs in the room flee, allowing Low and Alone to jump up and down on the platform in the middle of the room. After falling into the next room, climb up the ladder to the right, go through the vent, and move on until you climb up through the grate that puts you in front of a <strong>powered-down elevator</strong>. Take a left through the hole in the wall, and in the room with stacked tubs, <strong>use our screenshot above</strong> to find the second Doll.</p>

<figure><figcaption>One of the more hidden Dolls in the game. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once you’ve restored full power to the elevator, ride it up. Open the window shutter, taking you outside, and instead of running toward you (the player) to carry on, from the window, <strong>run down the long pipe in the opposite direction</strong>—left of the hot air balloon in the background. Climb through the window at the end, and claim Doll number three.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It pays to explore. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll find Doll four not long after the third one. Once you return to the beaten path, you naturally encounter <strong>a room filled with static TVs, the chapter’s boss enemy again, and a wooden plank you need to walk across</strong>. Do this, wait for the boss to leave, and descend to the bottom of the room. Instead of opening up the two-person vent, go to the opposite side of the room to find the Doll sitting small and cute in the open room.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-2-candy-factory-doll-5-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 2 Candy Factory Doll 5 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The end is nigh. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A final chase sequence with the Candy Factory’s boss</strong> results in them being squished in a hydraulic press (lovely, I know), and the door in the press room unlocks once they’re defeated. Go down the long corridor and into the room on the left. The Doll is on the table next to a machine.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed this guide was more of a treat for you than the horrors of the Candy Factory! Little Nightmares 3 sure does have some creative levels, and we might be brave enough to attempt to clean up the game’s remaining Dolls.

<p>Necorpolis is where Low and Alone’s journey begins in Little Nightmares 3. The game starts brighter and sandier than you might expect, but just because it’s light doesn’t mean you’ll have an easy time tracking down every Chapter 1 Doll in Little Nightmares 3’s Necropolis level.</p>



<p>It depends on which side of the fence you reside where collectibles are concerned. Some people love them, and some hate them. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> does have collectibles across its various chapters, there aren’t many—but each one can be an endeavor to track down (and a nightmare).</p>



<p>If you’re having trouble with so much as one collectible Doll in Chapter 1’s Necropolis, we’re here to help.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-dolls-in-necropolis-chapter-1-in-little-nightmares-3">How Many Dolls in Necropolis Chapter 1 in Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We did it, and so can you. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five collectible Dolls to find in Little Nightmare 3’s first chapter—Necropolis.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a fairly easy start to Doll collecting in the game. A couple are handed to you on a silver platter, but the others are very missable if you don’t know where to look in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-1-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 1 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The first Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Doll number one is <em>unmissable</em>. Proceed through Necropolis and travel through the long, dusty desert. Eventually, you climb a huge ladder that takes a long time to climb. Once you reach the top, crawl through the tunnel, break through the wall, and the Doll is there out in the open in the middle of the floor.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-2-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 2 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Second Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The next Doll requires you to carry on as normal until you reach the point where Low and Alone fall into a giant room—behind a helter skelter-like pillar—and the giant baby monster appears and leers into the room. Move between the statues; both of you need to trigger the floor switch, and an elevator takes you all the way down. Instead of going right through the hole in the door, <strong>use Alone’s wrench to break down the wall to the left</strong>. The Doll is in the middle of this secret room.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-3-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 3 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can’t miss the third Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>After a section where you <strong>climb up a large wall of broken wooden planks, shimmying from side to side</strong> occasionally, you reach a market area at the top. Go right, and instead of using your umbrella to ride the vertical breeze to the platform, instead, go up the exposed staircase. The third Doll is at the top, next to a wicker basket.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-4-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 4 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The fourth Doll in a dark room. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Doll number four is available after we go through <strong>Low’s cutscene, where they’re in a prison-like room, unmasked, and hiding under the bed</strong>. When Low and Alone come to, go left, crouch through the hole in the broken door, and the fourth Doll is in the room—this one is easily missable because you’d think to go right as the game hints at.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-5-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 5 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The sneaky fifth Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our fifth and final Doll is toward the end of the level. <strong>You must complete a sequence in a bell tower where you smash the head of a statue, and use the bow to cut the rope and ring the bell</strong>—summoning the baby monster. Hide in the box, and once it grabs the bell and leaves, exit through the window to the right. Now, complete the mini umbrella and ladder puzzle, and proceed. You will reach a section where you use the umbrellas to ride across a gap and then pull the plank off the bottom of a door. Climb through and into the alley. Head up the path, and instead of turning right into the opening, carry on going forward, and the final Doll is sneakily hidden away at the end of the passage on the left.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Little Nightmares 3 trophy and achievement list has as much aura and mystery as the whole game. Supermassive Games has whipped up a truly confusing trophy and achievement list that will have you thinking more than twice about each one. Let’s check out how many there are and their descriptions.</p>



<p>It’s apt that a horror game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>—shrouded in mystery and shadows—clouds its own trophy and achievement list with unclear descriptions. You’ll be scratching your head over the majority of the trophies in this fairly extensive list.</p>



<p>The Little Nightmares 3 trophies and achievements list is a curious one.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-little-nightmares-3-achievements-amp-trophies">All Little Nightmares 3 Achievements &amp; Trophies</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hang in there. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p>Usually, we give you a quick rundown of what you need to do for a trophy list. The <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> list doesn’t specifically mention completing chapters or activities. However, we’ve earned a lot for ourselves—because <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming was able to review the game</a> fully before launch—and can tell you some will be earned without you realizing.</p>



<p>So, let’s cut the chatter and get straight into the Little Nightmares 3 trophies and achievements list.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</th><th data-align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Mastery of The Spiral</td><td data-align="center">Keep on turning</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Child’s Play</td><td data-align="center">You’re not rattled that easily</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Unsupervised&nbsp;</td><td data-align="center">Survived the most pressing of situations</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Showstoppers</td><td data-align="center">The show cannot go on</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Spiral Out</td><td data-align="center">A twisted mind unraveled</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Low-Spirited</td><td data-align="center">The real memories are the friend you made along the way</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">From Nowhere, With Love</td><td data-align="center">…But to be is to have been</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Special Connection</td><td data-align="center">There is no bond as strong as this</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Toybox</td><td data-align="center">Playtime’s over now</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Candy Shop</td><td data-align="center">Sweets for my sweet</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Token Gestures</td><td data-align="center">You hit the jackpot</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Filed Away</td><td data-align="center">Nothing left in the medicine cabinet</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Loose Threads</td><td data-align="center">Little shapes of big things to come</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hello?</td><td data-align="center">You can always call on me</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Guiding Hands</td><td data-align="center">We’re connected, you and I</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Spanner in the Works</td><td data-align="center">I can be quite handy when I want to be</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bullseye</td><td data-align="center">You gotta aim high</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Peekaboo</td><td data-align="center">There’s a twinkle in that eye</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Windy City</td><td data-align="center">Just don’t open it indoors</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Birdbrained</td><td data-align="center">Always ruffling feathers</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Capital Punishment</td><td data-align="center">You’re heading for a shock</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Home Sweet Home</td><td data-align="center">Ready or not, here I come</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stay Tuned</td><td data-align="center">Are you taking notes?</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Light or Flight</td><td data-align="center">Look on the bright side</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Another One in the Bag</td><td data-align="center">Nothung but net(profits)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Unsavory Delicacies</td><td data-align="center">Rotting from the inside, delicious on the outside.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Omnipresence</td><td data-align="center">Far or near, she can make us fear</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Delivery Feed</td><td data-align="center">From store to (cage) door</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Aim Low (and Alone)</td><td data-align="center">Win a prize every time</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Illuminating Experiences</td><td data-align="center">The gift of second sight</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Institutionalized</td><td data-align="center">The Kids Aren’t Alright</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hand-Eye Coordination</td><td data-align="center">You’ve stayed at arm’s length</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-little-nightmares-3">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<p><strong>Little Nightmares 3 has 32 PlayStation Trophies, which means it has 31 Xbox Achievements—with the PlayStation Platinum Trophy proving to be the difference between the two as standard.</strong></p>



<p>The trophy list is divided into the following quantities and rarities: 1 Platinum Trophy,&nbsp;4 Gold Trophies,&nbsp;16 Silver Trophies, and 11 Bronze Trophies. It’s a healthy distribution with plenty of firepower to add to your overall trophy player level!</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s not the biggest trophy list in the world, but it might be one of the most confusing. You might need a helping hand along the way, but the Little Nightmares 3 trophy list will be a satisfying Platinum Trophy or full bundle of Gamerscore. Flex on everyone via the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> once you finally achieve this.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-long-to-beat-little-nightmares-3-game-length-explained.1321495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Supermassive Games has gotten its hands on the Little Nightmares franchise. The studio brings a wealth of experience to one of the most niche yet beloved indie horror franchises. That said, we’re giving you information on how long the game is based on our experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmare 3</a> is finally out. The transition from Tarsier Studios to Supermassive Games may have caused the game to take longer than thought. However, the new developer isn’t actually new, and has built up a reputation in the horror genre—highlighting titles like Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology as fine examples.</p>



<p>The third game oozes quality—which we can testify to, thanks to our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3 review</a>—so let’s see how much there is to enjoy.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-little-nightmares-3">How Many Hours to Beat Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A solid ride. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>By the time we rolled the Little Nightmares 3 credits, the PlayStation home screen indicated that we had spent at least 7 hours playing the game, but it might be closer to 8 hours, to be safe.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re a PS5 owner, you’ll know that when you highlight a game on the home menu screen, there are two indicators on the screen: One indicating playtime and one showing main story progress. When we wrapped up our first playthrough, the home menu was showing 7 hours.</p>



<p>However, this figure doesn’t always seem 100% accurate, based on previous games we’ve played. <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> doesn’t show your playtime in any of the save file slots.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco’s PR did tell us: “We’d expect a playthrough to come in at under 10 hours!”</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-little-nightmares-3-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Little Nightmares 3 Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>To get every collectible and even get all of the Little Nightmares 3 trophies, you’re probably looking at anywhere between 10-15 hours—depending on how you approach the game.</strong></p>



<p>Little Nightmares 3 has an obscure and lengthy trophy and achievement list. If you go into this without a trophy guide at the ready, you could spend a while figuring everything out. Furthermore, each of the four main chapters has a set amount of collectibles. Again, without guidance, it’s going to eat up your time replaying chapters.</p>



<p>Depending on your approach, we’d say that if you use guides to assist you, 10-15 hours sounds about right. If you insist on doing everything yourself and figuring out trophies on your own, you could be looking at even greater game length numbers!</p>

<p><strong>Preloads for Ninja Gaiden 4 are currently available on PC via the Windows Store and Xbox Series X|S. As of this writing, PlayStation 5 and Steam players will have to wait just a little longer before they can start downloading the game.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, we do not have a confirmed date or time that Steam and PlayStation will allow players to start the <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng4/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> preload. The release date is set for October 21, so you should expect it to be available any day now.</p>

<p><strong>As of pre-launch, the Ninja Gaiden 4 file size sits at 54.9 GB on PC through the Windows Store, 36.82 GB on Xbox Series X, and 23.55 GB on PlayStation 5. Steam players can probably expect a similar file size to the Windows Store version.</strong></p>



<p>As is pretty usual, the file size on PC is larger because the game has to account for a larger variety of hardware that will be running the game, a lot of which is stronger than you see in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. With that said, the PlayStation 5 version being less than half of the PC version is definitely a testament to the compression work in that version.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that these file sizes are for the game ahead of launch. If there is a day-one patch or update, who knows how much the file sizes could jump up.</p>

<p><strong>To preload Ninja Gaiden 4, you will have to pre-order the game digitally through any of the supported platforms. Anyone looking to get the game physically will have to wait until release, when they have the disc in hand.</strong></p>



<p>If you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-ninja-gaiden-4-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order the game now</a>, there should be an option at checkout to start downloading the game immediately. If you have preordered previously, look in your owned games library for the option to start downloading. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a> can go to the Game Pass app and search for the game to find the pre-install option.</p>
