<p>Nintendo has finally revealed its long-awaited console, the Switch 2, and more information about it will be shown during an exclusive Direct event on April 2, 2025. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-nintendo-switch-2-direct">What to Expect from Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</h2>



<p>During this event, players might learn more about the upcoming console’s capabilities and what new games will be playable on it. The Nintendo Switch 2 release date, pricing and availability should also be revealed on this date, considering the console is set to release in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several details about the new console were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed today</a> ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. However, most of them were leaked before the official reveal, and players are happy to see them confirmed. The console’s overall size has increased, the device has become more rounded, it will include a kickstand with a broader tilt, joy-Cons now connect magnetically, and the console is now all black, with red and blue accents. </p>

<p>The day has finally come as Nintendo has officially announced the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, the worst kept secret in video games.</p>



<p>In a short <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">two-minute video</a> online (watch below), Nintendo confirmed the full design of the upcoming console. Confirming the look <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-dbrand-give-players-another-look-at-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that’s been leaked</a> in recent months. The console comes in black and will feature a more rounded look, a newly designed kickstand with a wider tilt, a new-look dock, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and more. With the Joy-Cons also being black, the red and blue color of the original appear under the thumbsticks.</p>



<p>There’s also the new button on the right Joy-Con, but its purpose wasn’t confirmed during the reveal video.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As far as games go, the teaser only showed what appears to be a new Mario Kart game running on the console. More information about the console and (likely) its games will be shown during a <strong>Nintendo Direct event on April 2</strong>. One thing confirmed during the reveal is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not only play digital</a> Nintendo Switch games, but it will also play physical Switch 1 games. </p>



<p>That said, the company did state that “certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.” More information on that will come “at a later date”.</p>



<p>Lastly, it was revealed that Nintendo will be holding special “Nintendo Switch 2 Experience” events in April in three United States cities: New York City from April 4-6, Los Angeles from April 11-13, and Dallas from April 25-27.</p>



<p>You can check out the video below.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals devs have warned keyboard and mouse adapter users that they will be banned from the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250113/40955_1206338.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on their website, Marvel Rivals devs addressed the community’s queries about keyboard and mouse adapters. They said they would “relentlessly” battle cheating and call on the community to help maintain a positive gaming atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering, keyboard and mouse adapters allow players to mimic controller inputs while using a keyboard and mouse. This behaviour gives cheaters an unfair competitive advantage over players using controllers, as the cheater also benefits from the aim-assist features for the console version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals devs have also released a list of keyboard and mouse adapters, including the XIM series, Cronus Zen series, Titan Two series, KeyMander series, and Brook Sniper series. They added that any other device that emulates controller inputs with a keyboard and mouse would also be considered an adapter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To combat keyboard and mouse adapter users on Marvel Rivals, the devs have created a “strong detection tool” that, along with their “watchful human eyes, accurately identifies those using keyboard and mouse adapters. They will take steps “to vanquish this nefarious behaviour”, regardless of whether you’re on a PC or a console. Players who use these adapters to cheat could be subjected to temporary or permanent account suspensions, removal from leaderboards, or other punishments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-spiderman-suit-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Spider-Man suits</a> is coming to Marvel Rivals later this month. Also, the game director recently revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their plans for esports</a>.

<p>In a new statement, the Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 developers revealed that they are already looking for the next game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, the statement about the new Warhammer game comes from their latest <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/1alE9DriNd0GJq1SYKn3ZY/e14d3ff03635ea919c569f075b25c60a/2024-25_half_year_report_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial results</a>. Games Workshop CEO Kevin Roundtree first acknowledged the success of Space Marine 2, stating that they “recognise the success of these recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games”. Roundtree added that they are clearly “looking for the next one” and are remaining “cautious when forecasting royalty income”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talking about Space Marine 2’s success, the licensing revenue section of the financial statement revealed that earned income was £26.1 million (approximately USD 32 million), and the increase was “mainly from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. 98% of the total licensing revenue for Games Workshop was contributed by PC and Console game, which was also thanks to Space Marine 2’s release on the platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the topic of a new Warhammer Space Marine 2 game, the game director had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-devs-already-have-ideas-for-a-major-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously stated</a> they had already “proposed some story ideas that could either be DLC or a sequel”.

<p>Treyarch is shocking everyone in Season 2 by adding The Tomb Black Ops 6 Zombies map. It takes BLOPS 6 up to four Zombies maps, and The Tomb’s release date promises new weapons, Easter Eggs, and much more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> isn’t standing around on undead ceremony. Developer Treyarch is making up for disappointing years between Black Ops Cold War and BLOPS 6 by announcing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-revealed-launches-january-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Zombies map</a>—already the fourth, only three months removed from launch. It is set to sit alongside Liberty Falls, Terminus, and Citadelle des Morts, and give you a selection headache.</p>



<p>More content isn’t a bad thing by any means! It’s even more exciting as Treyarch has hinted at big new incomings from Easter Eggs to a legendary weapon making a comeback.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-tomb-zombies-map-release-date-in-black-ops-6">The Tomb Zombies Map Release Date in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of room to move and die. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Tomb’s release date is January 28—alongside Black Ops 6 Season 2.</strong></p>



<p>Season 1 Reloaded has been fun, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2</a> is shaping up to be a good one. The Tomb is a day-one drop, and you can tell Treyarch is already excited about it.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-115-day-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD Zombies blog</a> about Day 115, the team said, “We’ve crafted The Tomb to provide an experience similar to Liberty Falls (by far our most-played Zombies map in recent years!), featuring tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability.”</p>



<h2 id="h-new-easter-eggs-for-the-tomb-zombies-in-black-ops-6">New Easter Eggs For The Tomb Zombies in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A whole new world to explore. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Treyarch has said it’s “delivering plenty of side Easter Eggs” in Black Ops 6 Zombies’ The Tomb map.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve seen music Easter Eggs for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a>. Each map has featured a plethora of smaller Easter Eggs to go alongside Main Quest objectives too. Even though we don’t know any of the new Easter Eggs, you can likely expect another triple-set of headphones to find, hidden armaments and goodies, and a fully fledged story Easter Egg to complete.</p>



<h2 id="h-wonder-weapon-remake-for-the-tomb-in-black-ops-6-zombies">Wonder Weapon Remake for The Tomb in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p><strong>A “reimagined Wonder Weapon” is being teased for The Tomb in Black Ops 6.</strong></p>



<p>The Tomb currently has four <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapons</a> to use: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-ray-gun-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ray Gun</a>, Thrustodyne M23 (AKA Jet Gun), DRI-11 Beamsmasher, and Bastard Swords. A returning weapon from Treyarch’s past narrows it down, but it could still be one of many Wonder Weapons: The DIE Shockwave from Black Ops Cold War, the Void Bow from Black Ops 3, or Alistair’s Annihilator from Black Ops 4.</p>



<p>Fingers crossed it’s a good one I can use to relive nostalgia and turn Zombies into inedible soup.</p>



<h2 id="h-iconic-weapon-returns-in-black-ops-6-the-tomb-map">Iconic Weapon Returns in Black Ops 6 The Tomb Map</h2>



<p><strong>Another promised Black Ops 6 surprise is “one of the most iconic SMGs in Zombies history was coming along for the ride” in The Tomb Zombies map.</strong></p>



<p>I don’t know if this ties into one of Season 2’s new guns in general. Either way, it could be an MP-40, PPSH, or M1927 Thompson—all speculation. Treyarch knows how to keep the community entertained and bring back fan-favorite gear. Here’s hoping the announcement lives up to the hype.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you shocked to see The Tomb announced so soon after Citadelle des Morts? How many more Zombies maps do you think Treyarch adds before all is said and done in Black Ops 6 Zombies?</p>

<p>A new claim states that Halo Studios is seemingly gearing up to announce a new Halo game this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/524254/article/halo-will-have-a-new-game-announcement-this-year-says-industry-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, industry insider <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1879364933630251302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebs Gaming</a> recently spoke about the imminent announcement of an upcoming Halo game. His tweet revealed that the studio has been playtesting future games for the franchise “on a weekly basis”. Rebs Gaming added, “Since they are this far in development, I expect at least one new Halo game announcement this year.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The details about this unannounced Halo game come from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvbaB-n8cro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> video Rebs Gaming posted earlier this week, in which he discussed the new Halo Studios Playtest Lab. This new initiative was revealed through a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/xbox_how-do-you-create-the-best-possible-game-activity-7282199996127453185-lYFF?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post about a “centralised testing space” that can host staff from different departments so they can playtest games together, share ideas, and build better relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rebs Gaming also mentioned another hint about the unannounced Halo game in the same post. The Support, Safety, and Playtest Manager, Susan Bunch, stated that the teams have hosted “a playtest session for the artists and designers to come in and play similar maps in production.” Based on this, the insider speculates that we might receive a reveal pretty soon if maps for the upcoming Halo title are already in production.&nbsp;</p>
