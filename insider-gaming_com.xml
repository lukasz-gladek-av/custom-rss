<p>With Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 up for a record number of nominations at The Game Awards 2025, there was every chance it would bring home many of those accolades. Sure enough, the RPG cleaned up at The Game Awards 2025.</p>



<p>It was a huge night for Sandfall Interactive and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The surprise news that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-major-free-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 DLC dropped through a free update</a> was fun, and it rounded off a successful night for the mega-popular role-playing game.</p>

<p>With many of the Sandfall Interactive crew in attendance at The Game Awards 2025 dressed up in striking French-inspired gear, there was an air of expectation that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 would do something very special.</p>







<p>Nearly four hours later, the 2025 GOTY took home <strong>nine of the 13 awards it was nominated for</strong>. This smashes the previous record of most awards accumulated in one night, set by <strong>The Last of Us Part 2’s seven awards</strong> at the 2020 show.</p>



<p>In other years, Forza Horizon 5 and It Takes Two claimed three awards each in 2021, God of War Ragnarok took home six in 2022, Baldur’s Gate 3 matched GOW’s feat in 2023, and Astro Bot was the recipient of four last year.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 won:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game of the Year</li>



<li>Best Game Direction</li>



<li>Best Narrative</li>



<li>Best Art Direction</li>



<li>Best Score and Music</li>



<li>Best Performance</li>



<li>Best Independent Game</li>



<li>Best Debut Indie Game</li>



<li>Best Role Playing Game</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you think Sandfall’s debut RPG release was worth the hype? Does it deserve the nine awards it claimed? Have any games been cruelly robbed of an award, such as Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 for Best RPG?

<p>The Budapest Major 2025 played host to a stunning moment as Mathieu ‘ZywOo’ Herbaut, the Team Vitality frontman, secured his best Major map performance <strong>ever</strong>. This victory came during the win over The MongolZ to kick off the StarLadder Major’s playoffs round, and it landed on Mirage amid the 2-0 sweep that ensured Vitality’s survival.</p>



<p>To secure the map record, ZywOo secured a 2.47 rating, which is the highest he has ever achieved in the Counter-Strike space.</p>



<p>If you want to place a wager on what’s left of the playoffs, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-stunning-performance-from-zywoo-in-budapest">Stunning Performance from ZywOo in Budapest</h2>



<p>ZywOo’s numbers were nothing short of extraordinary. The masterful competitor secured a ratio of 25 kills to just 8 deaths, and his performance was backed by a blistering 135 ADR. His rating was elevated to unseen levels, indicating exactly why Team Vitality was able to so easily overcome The MongolZ, a team now eliminated from the Budapest Major.</p>



<p>Even on the second map, on Dust 2, ZywOo managed to land a rating of 2.18, walking all over the Mongolian squad.</p>



<p>This performance effectively eclipsed his previous best in Budapest, where he secured a 2.05 rating in a fixture against B8 in the earlier Swiss stages.</p>



<p>Fans of Vitality are now looking to the next match in the lineup: Vitality vs. Team Spirit. It’s a battle of the titans that will see ZywOo contend with the likes of Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets, the prodigy with a mean streak thus far in the event.</p>
