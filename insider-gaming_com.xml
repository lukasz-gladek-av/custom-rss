<p>According to a new job listing, Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel will feature “the most realistic and reactive crowd system in any game to date.”</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-most-realistic-and-reactive-crowd-system-job" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, the new information was revealed through Pawel Sasko’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1892298966961725540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, which talks about seven job openings for the “next Cyberpunk.” If you dig a little deeper into the daily responsibilities of Lead Encounter Designer, the listing implies that CD Project Red is working on creating the most advanced crowd system to date for the next Cyberpunk, with a focus on the realism and reactiveness of the NPCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The community has started sharing their views on this upcoming crowd system for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1itiifo/cyberpunk_sequel_has_new_opening_for_lead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cyberpunkgame</a> subreddit. The players are discussing whether the developers should work on an entirely new city or improve and evolve the existing Night City to flesh it out even more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many have compared the crowd system for games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V with the original Cyberpunk 2077. Some also wonder whether the next Cyberpunk’s crowd system will be able to beat what Rockstar cooks up with GTA 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the details about the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel are currently unknown. All we know is that it is internally referred to as Project Orion. The developers have also stated that Cyberpunk’s plot is a “uniquely American story” with “punk energy”, and thanks to the Boston studio, the sequel <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-sequel-more-american/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feel&nbsp;more American</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Cyberpunk 2077 was th<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-becomes-first-game-to-support-dlss-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e first game to support DLSS 4</a>.

<p>Supergiant Games has dropped the hot Warsong Update for Hades 2’s Early Access phase. It welcomes a ton of new content to the Underworld, including a new God, more content on the surface, and thousands of new voice lines, and it also gives us a peak into the next major update and addresses the full release.</p>



<p>Hades 2 Early Access is about the most reassuring content I played in 2024. I was worried the sequel wouldn’t be able to live up to the towering expectations of its predecessor. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/should-you-play-hades-before-hades-2-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades</a> was a success inside and out and introduced thousands (daresay millions) of gamers to the roguelike realm. Thankfully, Hades 2 Early Access is encouraging, and its Warsong Update is the next step toward completion.</p>



<p>The developer has explained everything you can find in the major update. It has so much for you to explore and find. But we also know even more is coming.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-hades-2-warsong-update-early-access-additions-for-february-19">All Hades 2 Warsong Update Early Access Additions For February 19</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A work in progress. Credit to Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-ares-has-arrived">Ares Has Arrived</h3>



<p>People not familiar with history can conceivably confuse Kratos with the God of War. In Norse mythology, it’s actually Tyr, but in classic Greek, it’s Ares. Hades 2 introduces Ares as a new God Melinoe can encounter.</p>



<p>His primary function is to interact with the Princess of the Underworld. But Ares also has a line of his own Boons to choose from.</p>



<h3 id="h-surface-tension">Surface Tension</h3>



<p>Supergiant Games says the Warsong update makes life above the Underworld even more dangerous: “Are you prepared for the&nbsp;Final Confrontation&nbsp;on the surface? Discover what lies beyond the Guardian of&nbsp;Olympus…if you dare!”</p>



<p>I haven’t reached it myself yet, but a new fight likely awaits. Make sure your loadout and setup are ready by the time you reach it.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-animal-familiar-amp-over-2-000-voice-lines-added">New Animal Familiar &amp; Over 2,000 Voice Lines Added</h3>



<p>One of Hades 2’s newest features over the original is Animal Familiars. You need to unlock the ability, but once you do, Melinoe can be joined by one of several creatures. The Warsong Update adds “<strong>One last animal companion</strong> to join your journey and aid you in battle.”</p>



<p>Plus, crank up the audio as “More than&nbsp;2,000 new voice lines&nbsp;and new events with most of the game’s cast!” have been implemented. This likely means all existing Gods have new lines to hear. Plus, Ares’ new dialog likely contributes to a large part of this.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-hades-2-early-access-major-content-update">Next Hades 2 Early Access Major Content Update</h2>



<p><strong>The developer has already announced the third major content update for Hades 2 is in the works and will be released “some months from now.”</strong></p>



<p>Early Access doesn’t stand still for long. It’s a chance for a game developer to keep improving a game, make it better, and present an excellent product before release. Hades 2 has already had two sizable updates, and the third one is already in development. </p>



<p>Given that we’ve had two major updates in nine months, I would expect the third major update to drop around <strong>July or August</strong> time.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-hades-2-release-date-is">Do we Know When Hades 2 Release Date is?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Supergiant Games still can’t pinpoint the full release for Hades 2, saying: <strong>“It’s still too early to share our plans, including when our v1.0 launch will be.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-complete-hades-2-warsong-update-patch-notes">Complete Hades 2 Warsong Update Patch Notes</h2>
