<p>Please, please, please keep an eye on Fortnite in the immediate future, as pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter appears to be heading to game soon. The breakout musical artist will seemingly be the next face in the massive roster of characters and real-life people to become playable Fortnite characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-have-you-ever-tried-this-one">Have You Ever Tried This One?</h2>



<p>The Fortnite leakers are the first to report Sabrina‚Äôs seemingly imminent arrival. Multiple leakers have claimed that Sabrina Carpenter is likely the next to arrive, and the @FNBRintel account <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1903101976147095629" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> last week that an inside source confirmed that the ‚Äúnext Fortnite Festival artist is female.‚Äù</p>



<p>Another Fortnite leaker, @ShiinaBR, posted today that some Sabrina-themed cosmetics have appeared in the game files already. This includes a glittery microphone with a heart-shaped base and a red, sequined heart-shaped sticker that she regularly uses.</p>



<div><article><p><span>SABRINA CARPENTER IS THE NEXT FESTIVAL ARTIST üî•

Fortnite accidentally added some of her cosmetics to the files earlier than intended! </span></p></article></div>



<p>Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, and The Weeknd have all been featured as the primary Icon in each season of Fortnite Festival. The rhythm game developed by Harmonix, developers of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, launched in Fortnite in December 2023. Each season features its own seasonal pass complete with songs, poses, and instruments related to the season‚Äôs Icon. Each Icon typically releases with playable outfits that can be used in various other games modes, like Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Whether or not Sabrina‚Äôs more risqu√© poses from her performances of ‚ÄúJuno‚Äù make it into the game remains to be seen. But a number of her most iconic songs should be playable in Fortnite Festival. Almost certainly, ‚ÄúEspresso‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlease Please Please‚Äù will be featured, with one or both likely to be outfitted into an emote. The current Fortnite Festival season, featuring pop idol Hatsune Miku as the Icon, is scheduled to end on April 8th.</p>
