<p>Use these Brainrot Tsunami monthly redeem codes for October 2025 to get free rewards in the game, including in-game currencies as well as potions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brainrot Tsunami is often described as a weird <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-raise-animals-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> simulator game where players must navigate tsunami waves and run through the map. Starting with a low speed, players are tasked with training to improve their pace, thereby making the process of dodging the tsunami waves that much easier. Another key mechanic in the game requires players to train with Brainrots. The game also allows players to spawn special tsunami waves, which can be used to troll the competition. As simple as the gameplay sounds, there is a decent amount of strategy involved, and with that in mind, any way to get ahead of the other players must be considered. That’s exactly where these codes will come into the picture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike many Roblox games today, redeeming codes in Brainrot Tsunami is a fairly straightforward process.

<p>Brainrot Tsunami recently had an update, but unfortunately for players, they didn’t release any new codes. However, fans of the game mustn’t lose hope, as the developers are still working on the game, which means that new codes are likely on the horizon. New codes are often released through the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ycveZcDGFV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> or through the Roblox game page. However, to make staying up to date with the codes easier, we recommend that you keep this page bookmarked.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-ensemble-dev-blame-xbox-head-killing-halo-mmo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-ensemble-studios-dev-blames-xbox-head-don-mattrick-for-%E2%80%98killing%E2%80%99-halo-mmo.1341511/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Once upon a time, Halo was set to secure an MMO dubbed ‘Titan’, pieced together by Ensemble Studios, a company shut down in January 2009. In a scalding post on social media, Sandy Petersen, who had been with Ensemble since the 1990s, revealed that Don Mattrick, former overseer of the Xbox brand, killed the project to protect his corporate bonus.</p>



<p>This pulling back of the curtain is a fiery look back at the scrapping of a game that, on paper, sounded very interesting.</p>



<h2 id="h-titan-was-a-prequel-mmo-in-the-halo-universe">Titan Was a Prequel MMO in the Halo Universe</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/SandyofCthulhu/status/1982965186781954468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a>, Sandy Petersen, who was once a level designer working on Doom and Quake before joining Ensemble Studios, revealed why Halo’s ‘Titan’ MMO never saw the light of day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In 2008, Ensemble Studios started planning a gigantic MMO set in the Halo universe. We code-named it Titan. It was to take place tens of thousands of years ago, before the Halos were set off &amp; destroyed all sentient life in the Galaxy.</p>



<p>It was all brought to naught when Don Mattrick realized that his stock bonus was based on the income MS had from games in 3 years.</p>



<p>You see, we estimated 3.5 years to finish Titan if we did it right. And that’s beyond Mattrick’s drop dead date. </p>



<p>So by firing ALL of Ensemble, he didn’t have to pay for our expensive studio for 3 years and he didn’t care about Titan.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Petersen revealed that the would-be Halo MMO would have featured an expansive universe that allowed players to assume control of Forerunners or Covenant characters. The Flood also had a starring spot in the game, but wouldn’t have been playable, of course.</p>



<p>The quest lines were mapped out, the homeworlds were designed, and Microsoft estimated that the game would have made a whopping <strong>$1.1 billion</strong>.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>In 2008, Ensemble Studios started planning a gigantic MMO set in the Halo universe. We code-named it Titan. It was to take place tens of thousands of years ago, before the Halos were set off &amp; destroyed all sentient life in the Galaxy. </p><p>I was in charge of the universe-building -… <a href="https://t.co/8eaSbEt81X">pic.twitter.com/8eaSbEt81X</a></p></div>— Sandy Petersen 🪔 (@SandyofCthulhu) <a href="https://twitter.com/SandyofCthulhu/status/1982965186781954468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Petersen went on to further slam Mattrick, settling on it being part of the executive’s nature in the industry:P</p>



<blockquote>
<p>All he lost was a game studio who never sold less than 3 million copies of everything we made. I don’t believe he did justice to MicroSoft stockholders but hey – Don started as an EA hatchet man so what would you expect?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Petersen and the wider Ensemble Studios team were tasked with bringing to life this ancient Halo setting, and the game was seemingly deep in development when the plug was pulled, and the hand on the cable was Don Mattrick’s. It was once suggested that Titan would have taken unique concepts, such as time travel, and taken a deep dive into the lore of Halo.</p>



<p>Don Mattrick served as the President of Microsoft’s Interactive Entertainment arm, overseeing the strategy of Xbox until he departed from the firm in 2013 to instead serve as the CEO of Zynga.</p>



<p>Halo’s Titan isn’t to be confused with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-blizzards-cancelled-mmo-titan/">Blizzard’s Titan MMO</a>, another canceled game that came to a head after an $80 million investment.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kt-rolster-shatter-expectations-to-reach-worlds-2025-finals-for-the-first-time.1341508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>KT Rolster has pulled something monumental out of the bag, handing Gen.G an insane loss at the League of Legends World Championship in Shanghai. This is the first time that KT Rolster has reached such lofty heights, and it came after knocking out one of the favorites to win the entire event.</p>



<p>The devastating loss kicks Gen.G out of the tournament in fourth place, mere weeks after winning the 2025 Mid-Season Invitational, the Esports World Cup, <strong>and </strong>the LCK 2025 season.</p>



<h2 id="h-gen-g-fails-to-make-finals-yet-again">Gen.G Fails to Make Finals Yet Again</h2>



<p>Gen.G has now failed to make the finals at LoL Worlds <strong>eight years in a row</strong>. In 2021, the organization secured a third-place finish, which is the closest the team has been thus far to making the number one spot.</p>



<p>KT Rolster proved to be the obstacle too strong to overcome for Gen.G this time around. The South Korean squad put up one hell of a fight, going the distance in a best-of-five series mere days after devastating CTBC Flying Oyster in a 3 – 0 sweep.</p>



<p>The team now has a spot in the Grand Final, poised to fight either T1 or Top Esports. It’ll be one for the history books, especially with T1 sitting on a burner with the squad’s typical Worlds buff.</p>



<p>In KT Rolster’s history in the League of Legends space, the organization has won almost <strong>nothing </strong>to write home about, and in the last three Worlds tournaments the brand has attended, lacklustre finishes have left fans wanting more. Even if KT Rolster doesn’t win at the November 9 final, it’ll be the biggest single prize the organization has ever claimed – $800,000.</p>



<p>Do you have any high expectations for KT Rolster, and do you believe the team could beat a dominant T1? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GamerLegion CEO Disputes Claims of 100 Thieves Player Buyout But Confirms Return]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gamerlegion-ceo-disputes-100-thieves-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamerlegion-ceo-disputes-claims-of-100-thieves-player-buyout-but-confirms-return.1341505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, rumors surfaced in the Counter-Strike space that 100 Thieves is preparing for a mighty comeback to the scene, signing Håvard ‘rain’ Nygaard to lead a new roster backed by GamerLegion talent. In an <strong>even more recent post</strong>, the CEO of GamerLegion confirmed that <strong>no such sales </strong>are lined up.</p>



<p>However, the CEO, Nicolas Reber, <span><strong>confirmed&nbsp;</strong>that the organization met</span> with 100 Thieves to discuss ‘their intention to come back to CS’. This effectively bolsters the recent suggestions that the LA-based company is breaking back into Counter-Strike.</p>



<h2 id="h-gamerlegion-isn-t-selling-players-to-100-thieves">GamerLegion Isn’t Selling Players to 100 Thieves</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/GL_L3gi/status/1984552479753978259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a>, Nicolas Reber, CEO of GamerLegion, confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Guess its worth to share. </p>



<p>We had a chat with 100T few weeks ago about their intention to come back to CS, but there is no active discussion about selling any players or cores. We focus on the team we have right now. </p>



<p>Lets get that 3rd place at @pglesports!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/100-thieves-returning-counter-strike-rain-signing/">signing of rain</a> hasn’t been announced yet either, so there’s still time for that claim to be refuted.</p>



<p>100 Thieves was last seen in Counter-Strike more than five years ago. It’s a new world these days, but with 100 Thieves preparing to pull out of League of Legends after Worlds, there’s room for a new roster to rise. The iconic organization fields a current roster in painfully few games, and Counter-Strike is an easy one to step into.</p>



<p>Some have questioned 100 Thieves potentially signing GamerLegion talent, given that there are ‘much better organizations’ to pick from and GamerLegion has had more than a year of bad luck, failing to secure a single major victory for a long while.</p>



<p>What do you think about the potential return of 100 Thieves to Counter-Strike? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>PGL is yet again doubling down on an ongoing commitment to Counter-Strike 2 after unveiling a huge competitive calendar for 2028. Between 2027 and 2028, a whopping <strong>15 Tier 1 tournaments </strong>will play out, including a full slate of <strong>eight events </strong>for 2028 alone. It’s easily one of the most ambitious schedules in Counter-Strike’s esports history.</p>



<p>PGL’s 2027 calendar is looking similarly hefty, with six tournaments being lined up to span January through October.</p>



<h2 id="h-pgl-is-supercharging-counter-strike-2-s-calendar">PGL is Supercharging Counter-Strike 2’s Calendar</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.pglesports.com/news/1760364087969-pgl-confirms-at-least-15-counter-strike-2-tier-1-events-planned-for-2027-and-2028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, the PGL team revealed that 2027 will see <strong>six </strong>independently produced tournaments and one massive collaboration: the Perfect World Counter-Strike Asia Championships.</p>



<p>Here’s the schedule revealed thus far for 2027:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>February 11–22</strong></li>



<li><strong>March 17–29</strong></li>



<li><strong>April 14–26</strong></li>



<li><strong>August 17–29</strong></li>



<li><strong>September 1–13</strong></li>



<li><strong>October 6–18</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Looking even further ahead into 2028, a staggering schedule has been lined up for Counter-Strike fans around the world. Here’s the full list of PGL tournaments planned for 2028:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>February 9–21</strong></li>



<li><strong>March 22–April 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>April 19–May 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>August 16–28</strong></li>



<li><strong>August 31–September 11</strong></li>



<li><strong>October 4–16</strong></li>



<li><strong>November 1–13</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>This is shaping up to be unprecedented in the Counter-Strike 2 space, and it reflects the ongoing value of the game and the ecosystem surrounding it.</p>



<p>The most recent PGL event, PGL Masters Bucharest, wrapped up just yesterday, with Aurora securing the trophy and picking up the lion’s share of the $625,000 grand prize. The win marked Aurora’s most sizeable victory to date in the Counter-Strike space and came mere months after falling in second place at the Esports World Cup.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite x Harry Potter Collaboration Coming Soon, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-x-harry-potter-collaboration-coming-soon-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1341484/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by Fortnite leakers that a Harry Potter collaboration is inbound and set to land in the game in Chapter 7. In a post on social media, the exclusive leak was revealed by FortniteLeaks via a Discord community server, but the bulk of the announcement went hand-in-hand with a message of concern regarding J.K. Rowling’s ongoing involvement with the franchise.</p>



<p>That has left little information otherwise, including it being unclear whether or not Harry Potter content in Fortnite would be featured in the Battle Pass.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-harry-potter-coming-to-fortnite">Is Harry Potter Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p>Fortnite typically ramps up collaborations when projects have something to talk about, and right now, a reboot of the Harry Potter series is being filmed, starring an all-new cast. That means it’s the perfect time for a collaboration, but some have issues with the source material.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteLeaks/comments/1om04sn/fortnite_x_harry_potter_via_poketofficial_and_the/?share_id=qKGzJZqpXkFieNCjZxclq&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Reddit</a>, it was revealed that FortniteLeaks uncovered an upcoming Harry Potter collaboration, scheduled for Chapter 7. The new Chapter is scheduled for release in early December, so it won’t be long until this leak is confirmed or denied either way.</p>



<p>However, FortniteLeaks went on a tangent, breaking down why exactly this collaboration is a bad idea, stressing the link with J.K. Rowling still being a problem.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘For the unaware, series creator J.K. Rowling has a well-documented history of making harmful transphobic remarks. Despite this, Warner Bros. has kept J.K. Rowling involved with the franchise, and she continues to receive significant profits from the franchise’s success. And despite this, Epic Games still made the disappointing decision to collaborate with the franchise.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments under the post, users were quick to stress that it’s a money-making game and that there have been problematic collaborations before.</p>
