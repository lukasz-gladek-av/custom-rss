<p>In their latest update, Palworld developers have changed the behaviour of Pal Spheres while battling Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pal Spheres work like Pokeballs and capture and summon Pals in Palworld. However, after <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236636060484669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">version v0.3.11 </a>(spotted by <a href="https://nichegamer.com/palworld-removes-pal-sphere-summons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NicheGamer</a>), the Pal Spheres will have a different activation. Now, whenever a player uses a Pal Sphere, their Pal will be summoned near the player without them needing to throw the sphere. Also, the new update will display a reticle while aiming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest developments</a> on Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld, the former has alleged that the latter has infringed three different patents and is seeking damages of 10 million Yen (approximately USD 66,000). Pocket Pair replied, stating they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings” in the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Palxworld is getting its biggest island yet in December, which is about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-december-dlc-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six times bigger than Sakurajima</a>. Also, Palworld has finally launched for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-finally-launches-for-ps5-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 consoles in Japan</a>. What are your thoughts on Palworld changing how Pal Spheres work in the game?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/royal-ravens-on-top-following-first-week-of-the-cdl-2025-season.1055466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/royal-ravens-on-top-cdl-2025-season/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The first week of the CDL 2025 season has wrapped and it’s the Carolina Royal Ravens that sit atop the standings. With a record of 2 – 0 and a win/loss of 6 – 2, the Royal Ravens outpaced the other eleven teams in the CDL this past weekend. First, the team handed a smackdown to Team Falcons, and that was followed up with an unexpected win over LAG M8.</p>



<p>The power players are getting well-established quite early on this year, with LAT, Rokkr, and Toronto Ultra all bursting out of the gate without a single loss this week.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-miserable-elsewhere">Miserable Elsewhere</h2>



<p>Uncharacteristically, Atlanta FaZe sits near the bottom of the CDL standings after the opening weekend of play. The squad failed to secure a point, being beaten down by both LAT and Toronto Ultra. The LAT match was a burner, though – almost every round (except the opening Hardpoint, oof) went down to the wire.</p>



<p>Cloud9, Vegas Falcons, and LAG M8 all also failed to secure any CDL points, with C9 NY putting up the worst record – just one single map won out of seven played, tieing the squad with Team Falcons, which many predict will be the worst-performing org this season.</p>



<p>Out of the twelve teams in the CDL 2025 season, the ones to watch have been made clear.</p>



<p>LAT’s combination of Scrap, HyDra, Envoy, and Ghosty is a nasty one. Scrap and HyDra are running wild slaying out (props to HyDra’s 40-bomb), while Ghosty’s IGL role and Envoy’s veteran support bolsters the squad immeasurably. It could be LAT’s year, and it’s well deserved, given how much Nadeshot has poured into the organisation this time around.</p>



<p>Ultra had a great weekend, too. They dealt a massive blow to Atlanta FaZe and followed that up by taking Surge down a peg. The Canadian side made some major changes heading into the new season, picking up Beans and JoeDeceives to flesh out the EU-dominant roster that includes long-timers Insight and CleanX.</p>



<p>This was a fantastic weekend of play all round, and a few technical blips didn’t do too much to mar the entertainment. It’s no big secret that viewership could have been better, but co-streams and watch parties will undoubtedly do bits for the CDL this year.</p>

<p>Steam has once again proven that PC gaming is on the up, securing a new all-time high peak user count and notching up 39,205,447 concurrent players. This record came during a busy weekend that saw the successful launches of Marvel Rivals and Path of Exile II in early access, among others.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Steam has gone from strength to strength in recent years, seeing a sharp increase in user activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and never really slowing down since. The data revealed in charts on SteamDB tell the story from the last twenty years:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The ‘A’ flag on the chart is the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. This event saw millions of gamers worldwide locked down by their respective governments, and more than ever before turned to gaming and content creation as a way of occupying their time – and perhaps making a little money.</p>



<p>That of course warranted a massive growth in the number of PC players around the world.</p>



<p>This weekend, the popular PC platform hit almost 40 million concurrent users – a staggering number by all accounts. Since 2024 kicked off, Steam has been soaring, but some games understandably contribute to that success much more than others.</p>



<p>For example, Counter-Strike 2 maintains a regular 24-hour peak of around 1.5 million users, with PUBG and Dota 2 coming in behind with around 700,000 players. This weekend, Marvel Rivals hit a peak of almost 500,000 players, and Path of Exile II, which is in early access, stormed the charts and racked up 578,000 concurrent users.</p>



<p>It’s worth highlighting that the number displayed is <strong>peak concurrent users</strong>. That doesn’t mean they’re actively playing a game, they’re just <strong>online </strong>on Steam. At the time that the 39 million mark was hit, just over 12 million users were playing games.</p>

<p>On December 6, Grand Theft Hamlet was released across the UK and Ireland in select theatres, and it’s coming to streaming platforms next year. This zany representation of Shakespeare’s work was planned, performed, and recorded entirely in GTA Online by Pinny Grylls and Sam Crane, and it’s making a wealth of impressions on critics worldwide.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, the ‘documentary’ has won awards at film festivals everywhere, including SXSW, Vancouver, and Philadelphia, and it scooped a prize and several nominations at the British Independent Film Awards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-yes-it-s-real">Yes, It’s Real</h2>



<p>When I say ‘Grand Theft Hamlet’, that’s what I mean. It’s a story showcasing the telling of Shakespeare’s Hamlet <strong>in </strong>Grand Theft Auto Online.</p>



<p>The idea was concocted by Sam Crane during the COVID-induced lockdown in the United Kingdom in 2021, and he roped in Mark Oosterveen to star alongside him. Pinny Grylls was eventually brought in to direct the documentary, which is proving to be a rip-roaring success with critics and viewers.</p>



<p>The recently released theatrical trailer gives you an indication of the origins of the project:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET  | UK theatrical trailer | IN CINEMAS FRIDAY 6TH DECEMBER from TULL STORIES" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLpGIHjwhNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Most of the documentary is spent unveiling the trials and tribulations of the team making their way towards the ultimate performance, which unravels at the end of the 90-minute flick.</p>



<p>The reviews speak for themselves. In <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/grand-theft-hamlet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Empire</a>, Grand Theft Hamlet was dubbed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘…a riotously funny, unexpectedly poignant ode to gaming, Shakespeare, the indestructible nature of art, and the benefits of befriending bazooka wielding extraterrestrials.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://theface.com/culture/grand-theft-auto-gta-hamlet-film-mubi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Face</a>, Grylls explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that it’s also important to think about the fact that&nbsp;<em>GTA Hamlet</em>&nbsp;is not really just a&nbsp;film of the play. It’s a&nbsp;story about this crazy adventure to try and put on this play which seems impossible. It’s a&nbsp;kind of comedy adventure story and it was edited to be really, really entertaining and fun, like the big eighties blockbuster movies Sam and I&nbsp;grew up watching, like&nbsp;<em>Back to the Future.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>This isn’t the first time a video game has been used as a platform for a production like this – but it’s certainly the most impactful occurrence. </p>



<p>For instance, the ‘Wasteland Theatre Company’ in Bethesda’s Fallout 76 pieced together and staged a performance of Shakespeare’s works in the post-apocalyptic MMORPG a year or two ago.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is taking the gaming world by storm, and NetEase just revealed that the hero shooter hit 10 million players in just <strong>three days</strong>. It’s aided by the fact it’s a free-to-play, multi-platform title, but it <strong>also helps </strong>that Marvel Rivals is a solid game that stands as a real competitor to games like Overwatch and Deadlock.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ignite-the-battle">Ignite the Battle</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the NetEase team revealed:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/marvelrivals/status/1865909229070016851
</p></figure>







<p>Marvel Rivals offers a breathtaking experience with an unparalleled roster of Marvel-based heroes. From Wolverine to Moon Knight, and from Iron Fist to Thor, players are finding their main and enjoying every second of Marvel Rivals, which is set to challenge the hero shooter paradigm held by the likes of Overwatch for many years.</p>



<p>On Sunday evening, Marvel Rivals <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launch-performance-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured a new all-time high</a> on some platforms, including Steam. On PC, Marvel Rivals hit 480,990 peak concurrent users, putting it above the likes of Fallout 4, Helldivers 2, and Grand Theft Auto 5. The volume of users trying to get into the game has presented some server issues in various regions, but it’s nothing that has marred the overall launch of the game.</p>



<p>The game has also carved out a sizeable piece of the global streaming estate, netting a peak viewer count of 278,000 users on Twitch and sitting in the platform’s top ten categories by viewers.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blue-protocol-return-new-name-studio/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco%E2%80%99s-failed-%E2%80%98blue-protocol%E2%80%99-is-back-but-under-a-new-name-and-studio.1055412/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/blue-protocol-return-new-name-studio/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In August, Bandai Namco and Amazon Games confirmed the cancellation of Blue Protocol, which failed to surface in Western markets after flopping in Japan. This ‘anime MMO’ is being taken offline forever in January after having been in development since <strong>2015</strong>.</p>



<p>It seems that’s not the end of the road for Blue Protocol, though.</p>



<p>Recently, a Chinese studio named Shanghai Bokura Technology – a Tencent subsidiary – revealed a game called Star Resonance, a PC and mobile-based MMORPG that’s looking like a second outing for Blue Protocol.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-for-the-better">Back for the Better</h2>



<p>A recent report published by <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/blue-protocol-star-resonance-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simulation Daily</a> explained that Blue Protocol’s licensure was provided by Bandai Namco to Tencent’s Shanghai Bokura. The new game, named Star Resonance, is deeply reminiscent of Blue Protocol, the cancelled and failed MMORPG.</p>



<p>Sure enough, I managed to dredge up <a href="https://www.bokura.com.cn/news/3b747306-41d1-419c-b137-2a341bd3c80e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> published by Shanghai Bokura several months ago that confirmed a collaboration between itself and the Bandai Namco team that originally worked on Blue Protocol.</p>



<p>The press release mentioned Star Resonance (which wasn’t named back then) is ‘based on the world view’ of Blue Protocol but is a completely different game to the one that was released in Japan. </p>



<p>With that being said, the trailer certainly showcases something as close to Blue Protocol as you could hope to get:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Resonance ACGN style MMO-ARPG based on the Blue Protocol IP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ee2wT-3n3TU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Here’s a snippet from that press release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“PROJECT SKY BLUE” is a project team jointly formed by Bandai Namco Online Inc. and Bandai Namco Studios Inc., aiming to create a new entertainment IP that can move the world, and is responsible for the planning and development of its content. With the online action role-playing game “Blue Law” as one of the core contents, various developments are being planned.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many prospective fans were disappointed by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blue-protocol-shut-down-bandai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of Blue Protocol</a>. Perhaps Bokura’s Star Resonance can fill that gap that was created in their lives.</p>

<p>It’s all stations go in the streaming world today as Ludwig announces a return to Twitch after a three-year platform hiatus <strong>and </strong>Adin Ross reveals he’s stepping down from Kick.com ‘indefinitely’. These bombshell announcements left the content creation community reeling, but Ross’ revelation was much more impactful than Ludwig’s tidbit.</p>



<p>Multiple streamers have returned to Twitch in recent weeks, particularly as exclusivity deals with YouTube dry up and expire.</p>

<p>Adin Ross has an obstacle to overcome before he makes it back to Twitch, and that’s his permanent ban from the popular streaming platform. The controversial creator has cleaned up his act in recent months, but will it be enough to sway the Twitch leadership team and earn him a prestigious spot back on the site?</p>



<p>In a post on Twitter, Adin Ross revealed his split from Kick.com:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I will be making a full video on why I am leaving Kick indefinitely. I am stepping down officially and will be going into detail about this this week. I will tell you all everything.</p>



<p>With that being said, I am going to fully focus on being reinstated on Twitch. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere, Ludwig, one of the world’s most popular streamers, revealed <a href="https://x.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1865882864652546356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a video on social media</a> that after three years of YouTube exclusivity, he’s back on Twitch. Recently, Ludwig scooped the Best Streamed Event award at The Streamer Awards, and he’s still got  more lined up for the future.</p>
