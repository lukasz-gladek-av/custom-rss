<p>Also, Fallout 76 is slated to get a current-gen upgrade this year, and there is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-release-notes-pts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout 76: Burning Springs that was recently released. </a>Howard recently claimed that Fallout 76 was the game Bethesda was currently putting the most work into.</p>
