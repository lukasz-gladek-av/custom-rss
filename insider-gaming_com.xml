<p>Marvel Rivals, one of the more success games of the last year, has seen its development staff it with layoffs. According to multiple posts on social media, publisher NetEase has laid off an entire Marvel Rivals development team.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals’ game director Thaddeus Sasser <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297672154060361729/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to LinkedIn</a> to reveal the news on Tuesday afternoon. </p>



<p>“This is such a weird industry…” Sasser wrote. “My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games…and were just laid off!”</p>



<p>Based on his wording, it’s unclear if Sasser was included in the layoffs or if it was just his team. Insider Gaming reached out for comment, but Sasser declined.</p>



<p>According to Sasser’s profile, his team—which is based in Seattle, Washington—focused on game and level design.</p>



<p>One member of his team, a level designer from the game, Jack Burrows, confirmed he was part of the layoffs. No reason was shared by either party for the cuts.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has also reached out to NetEase for comment on the layoffs and how many people are being let go. Should a response to any outstanding questions be received, they will be added to this story.</p>



<p>Since its release, Marvel Rivals has been at the top of the player count charts on Steam. The game peaked at 644,269 on the platform while it continues to average over 255,000 people per day on Steam alone.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals players will finally be able to exchange their leftover Chrono Tokens from the battle pass into something more useful. After having to let those extra tokens go to waste earlier, players that complete the Season 1 pass can get rewarded for their extra efforts.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-adds-new-chrono-token-exchange-system">Marvel Rivals Adds New Chrono Token Exchange System</h2>



<p>In the developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> for the upcoming Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 update, the team at NetEase confirmed the new Chrono Token redemption system. Players that own the Luxury battle pass and redeem all the rewards can convert leftover Chrono Tokens into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Units used in the store</a>. “Luxury” just refers to the paid pass itself: you did not need to buy the more expensive version that came with extra Chrono Tokens to be eligible for the new redemption system. Any player who buys the pass and redeems all its awards will be able to convert excess Chrono Tokens into Units.</p>



<p>This issue was a major community talking point during Season 0. The shortened season features a much smaller battle pass that could be completed rather quickly, but players were still completing daily and weekly challenges and earning Chrono Tokens that completely went to waste. With the new system, it should encourage players to continue playing and completing challenges even if they’ve completed the pass.</p>



<p>Potentially, this change could result in a little bit less spending of Lattice at the store. However, that all depends on what the ratio of Chrono Tokens to Units will be, which NetEase hasn’t revealed yet. Marvel Rivals fans should temper their expectations now, as it’s very unlikely that it will even be close to a 1:1 ratio. Season 1.5 officially goes live on February 21.</p>



<p>Inspired to complete the seasonal battle pass now? Let us know down below in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
