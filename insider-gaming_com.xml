<p>The latest entry into extraction shooters is here, as Marathon has broken onto the scene at long last. As fun as it is to loot and shoot your way through Tau Ceti, some direction is always nice, and for that, you’ll need to familiarise yourself with Factions. </p>



<p>There are six of them to work with in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>, but you’ll only have access to one of them out of the gates. If you’re looking to make some progress, you’ll want to unlock them all as soon as possible, as they each have unique offerings you’ll want to take advantage of.</p>







<p>Here’s how to unlock each of the six Factions in Marathon, as well as how to increase their Rank. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-factions-in-marathon">What Are Factions In Marathon?</h2>

<p><strong>Factions are essential to your progression whilst playing Marathon, with each one offering you selections of gear to purchase and Contracts to complete in return for a variety of rewards. </strong></p>



<p>As you work your way through Marathon, you’ll quickly realise that Contracts are the biggest source of progression in the game, and there appear to be two varieties of them to complete, which are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Contracts: Repeatable missions you can complete for the given Faction, which vary in difficulty and rewards</li>



<li>Priority Contracts: One-time missions that are essential to the faction. These are tied to progression and help boost your Faction Rank, as well as offering significant story relevance</li>
</ul>



<p>You can only have one Contract active at a time, and you must select which one you’d like to work on before going out on your next run. That means no multitasking—you’ll have to think about the purpose of every run you go out on. </p>

</ul>



<p>Each Faction offers a unique set of Contracts, but frustratingly, you won’t have access to them all out of the gate. You’ll need to unlock them all if you want to truly progress through Marathon, so here’s how you can get that done.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-factions-in-marathon">How To Unlock Factions In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will they unlock? Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>If you want to unlock the other five Factions in Marathon, you’ll need to complete a special type of contract—the Liaison Contract.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll begin to unlock these pretty early into the game; you’ll just need to complete the tutorial and the Welcome To Tau Ceti Contract. </p>







<p>Once they’re finished, you’ll unlock Liaison Contracts. These are unique Contracts that get you in touch with a new Faction, with each one having its own Liaison to complete. You’ll only have to do these once, as a Faction is unlocked permanently upon Contract completion. </p>



<p>That being said, it’s one thing to unlock the Faction, but you’ll want to rank up with them, too. The higher their Rank, the more useful they’ll be to you, so that should be your next priority.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-factions-in-marathon">How To Rank Up Factions In Marathon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What it’s all for. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To rank up Factions in Marathon, you’ll need to complete Contracts for each of the Factions, with different Contracts offering varying amounts of Rep.</strong></p>



<p>Rep is the currency used to rank up Factions, though it’s utilised automatically. It’s important to rank the Factions up, as the higher the rank they are, the better gear you’ll have access to. Also, at certain milestones, you’ll unlock various reward packages, as well as new Standard Contracts. </p>

</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though, as each Faction has its own selection of Upgrades for you to invest in. These vary drastically between Factions, with some offering improved Vault Space, whilst others offer various permanent Stat upgrades for your Runner. You’ll want to look into these thoroughly, as they’re crucial to building your Runner to suit your playstyle, and you’ll need to know which resources to keep an eye out for on your next run.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Viewer Count Hits New Low As Marathon Starts Running]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-viewer-count-drops-marathon-takes-off/</link>
            <guid>1447675</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It might have been inevitable, but as Marathon’s server slam has commenced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> has taken a gut punch in terms of viewership. At the time of writing, ARC Raiders boasted <strong>more players </strong>than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> (on Steam, at least), but viewership for Embark Studios’ extraction adventure had hit an all-time low.</p>



<p>On Twitch, the viewer count was floating at around 22,000 as Marathon got started. That’s the lowest ARC Raiders has been in terms of active, engaged viewers since the game came out in October 2025.</p>











<p>ARC Raiders enjoyed a stunning time in the sun after launching at the end of October. It became regarded as one of the best games of 2025, and in our ARC Raiders review, we dubbed it the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" id="155345">most refreshing extraction game</a> ever made.</p>



<p>But almost month after month, the game’s viewer count declines. In December, it dropped -33% compared to November, and in February (this month), -23% from January. Now that a fair chunk of the game’s player base has moved off to see what Marathon has to offer, it’s suffering further, sitting at around 22,500 at the time of writing.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s a drop of around 94% since launch, from peak to current.</p>



<p>Funnily enough, Marathon, which comes out in just a week, has managed to trump ARC Raiders in a <strong>major </strong>way, despite only just entering its first open, public test. It has managed to secure a higher peak viewer count than ARC Raiders ever did, notching up a lofty height of 523,301 viewers, which was secured during Marathon’s gameplay reveal in April 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As this is being written, Marathon boasts more than ten times the viewership of ARC Raiders, as everyone becomes curious to see what’s happening in Bungie’s new extraction game. The gap between the <strong>player count </strong>(on Steam) was just 30,000 players, too, in ARC Raiders’ favor.</p>



<p>Many believe that Marathon won’t hold a torch to ARC Raiders, which has proven to be overwhelmingly successful since being released in October. It might have some short-term success, but it’s becoming tough for new extraction-based games to <strong>really </strong>succeed in the increasingly saturated market.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/why-cant-i-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-currant-error-code-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans around the world have been patiently waiting for Marathon to arrive, but before it does, Bungie has released the Server Slam Playtest. Although its main goal is to test the server’s stability ahead of Marathon’s full release, the Server Slam Playtest is a great introduction to the game, offering tons of early game content for fans to dive into.</p>







<p>However, that doesn’t mean there won’t be bumps in the road, and some fans have noted difficulties trying to jump into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> action. If you’re one of the struggling few who’ve run into the ‘Currant’ Error Code, here’s what it means and how to fix it.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-the-marathon-server-slam-playtest-servers-working-right-now">Are The Marathon Server Slam Playtest Servers Working Right Now?</h2>



<p>As of February 26, the servers are up and running, as they’re working as intended for the majority of the player base, though it might take you some time to log in. </p>

</ul>



<p>Launch day for any new online title is always bound to present some server instabilities, as the game finds it feet and copes with the sudden surge of players. However, that doesn’t make it any less frustrating if you’re finally ready to play the game, only for the servers to let you down. </p>



<p>Thankfully, it seems that for the most part, the Marathon Server Slam Playtest servers are operational, though some errors are popping up, namely the ‘Currant’ Error Code. If you’ve been unlucky enough to see it, here’s what it means.</p>







<h2 id="h-currant-error-code-in-marathon-server-slam-playtest-explained">‘Currant’ Error Code In Marathon Server Slam Playtest, Explained</h2>

<p><strong>If you’re trying to log in to the Marathon Server Slam Playtest and you’re seeing the ‘Currant’ Error Code, that means that there’s an issue with your network connection. </strong></p>



<p>As was the case going into the Server Slam Playtest, Bungie were aware that there’d be teething issues, and some have cropped up already. The ‘Currant’ Error Code appears to be the most commonly seen error, and it’s all to do with your network status. </p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>According to Bungie, the first step you should take is to ensure that your current connection is working as intended, so double-check your Wi-Fi and make sure it’s all up to speed. If you’re still seeing the issue, then you’ll want to run through some Network Troubleshooting. </p>



<p>Other users online have reported that a quick fix to the issue is the good old restart, but even that’s not guaranteed to solve the problem. It might just be a case of waiting it out and trying again soon, with the Server Slam expecting high amounts of players—this is likely affecting connectivity issues.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Get ready to head back to the backyard for an all-new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/backyard-baseball/" id="2001">Backyard Baseball</a> title. Appropriately enough, it should make everyone’s summer vacation a little more lively as the game launches on July 9, 2026.</p>



<p>The release date for the upcoming title was announced on social media. The game is being developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mega-cat-studios/" id="3592">Mega Cat Studios</a>, and they’ve ported several classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/backyard-sports/" id="1860">Backyard Sports</a> titles to PC via Steam. This forthcoming release will be playable on PC and Mac and will get console releases.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2>History of Backyard Sports</h2>



<p>The first Backyard Baseball was released in 1997. The games were minimalistic PC titles featuring a diverse roster of children playing many sports, the first of which was Backyard Baseball. Games eventually made it to platforms such as the original Sony PlayStation, the PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube, and the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Still, they were always available on home computers through 2009.</p>



<p>The football version of Backyard Sports even spun off an animated special in 2002.</p>



<p>Now, a new generation of children, not to mention adults looking for the nostalgic hit of that silly sports game that they might have picked up at a Scholastic Book Fair, will get the chance to play an all-new Backyard Baseball this summer.</p>







<h2>PC Specs for Backyard Baseball 2026</h2>



<p>The 4th coming game will feature six different game modes with three ways to play. There will also be achievements, unlockables, and collectibles. However, the developers are boasting that this game won’t have microtransactions.</p>



<p>The minimum required PC specs have been made available. Check them out below:</p>
