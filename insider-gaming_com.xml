            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-developers-have-already-written-part-3s-story/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The developers of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 have confirmed that the game’s story was completed at the end of 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-story-has-been-completed">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Story Has Been Completed </h2>



<p>As spotted by Genki_JPN on <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1882281479713214682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-plot-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>), Final Fantasy 7 Remake producer Yoshinori Kitase and director Naoki Hamaguchi discussed Part 3’s plot during an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202501/30815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>. Kitase stated that Tetsuya Nomura, Final Fantasy 7 Remake director, handed over the story for part 3 at the end of last year, and he is “very satisfied with it” and is “sure it will be a satisfying conclusion for fans as well”.</p>



<p>Kitase elaborates that Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 is the conclusion of the series, making it integral into the franchise. Hence, he gave Nomura the homework to deliver “something that would respect the original while also giving a sense of satisfaction beyond what could be experienced in the original.” He wants a story that can “conclude the Remake Project.” It seems we might receive this instalment much sooner than expected.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-ff7-rebirth-s-pc-upgrades-might-arrive-for-ps5-version">FF7 Rebirth’s PC Upgrades Might Arrive for PS5 Version</h2>



<p>The developers also discussed bringing FF7 Rebirth <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1882297316381770153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC’s upgrades to the PS5 version</a>. Naoki Hamaguchi revealed they received many requests for upgrades for the PC version to be brought to the PS5 version. The developers “would like to make it happen at some point,” but it has to be within the PS5 version’s performance limits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a new interview with Insomniac, Marvel’s Wolverine may or may not be released in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a conversation with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ceo-ted-price-exits-ryan-schneider-chad-dezern-jen-huang-playstation-1236281913/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-have-to-be-like-logan-today-and-remain-very-stoic-insomniac-quiet-on-whether-wolverine-will-make-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-games-founder-and-president-ted-price-is-retiring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new co-heads</a> of Insomniac, Ryan Schneider, Chad Dezern and Jen Huang, were asked whether Marvel’s Wolverine is still slated to release in 2025. Dezern didn’t confirm or deny the release window but stated they would “love to talk more about Wolverine”, as the title has already been announced. Still, they must “be like Logan today and remain very stoic until it’s time to pop the claws down the road”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dezern added that they will have to hold on to their “pent-up excitement” for Marvel’s Wolverine, and that’s all they could speak about their upcoming projects during the conversation. Marvel’s Wolverine was announced during a PlayStation Showcase in 2021, where a small snippet showcased the character’s iconic claws. Since then, we have yet to hear any official announcements for the game; however, much has been revealed through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/major-wolverine-leaks-appear-online-spoilers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, the Insomniac heads also expressed interest in “game-to-screen adaptations.” Ryan Schneider spoke about the Ratchet &amp; Clank film and how they “got an early start on that.” Schneider added that they are “interested in that kind of thing,” and the team loves Ratchet &amp; Clank in particular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel’s Wolverine’s creative director has joined <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-creative-director-leaves-to-join-xboxs-perfect-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s Perfect Dark team</a>. Also, Insomniac confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-additional-story-dlc-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no additional story content is coming</a> for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.

<p>PockerPair Publishing and Tales of Kenzera: Zau developers Surgent Studios have announced that they’ll be joining forces, with PocketPair supporting the development of a new horror game at Surgent.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), the publisher said, “We’re pleased to announce that our first project as Pocketpair Publishing will be supporting a brand new horror game from Surgent Studios. SURGENT STUDIOS is a studio with an original approach, and Pocketpair is excited to support them to the fullest extent. Please look forward to future announcements for details of specific projects!“</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Abubakar Salim, the Founder of Surgent Studios, about the deal. Salim said, “I think it’s wonderful that PocketPair Inc. is taking their successes and channeling them into artists and supporting the medium of making games. It’s an incredible honour to be a part of their journey, and there’s a lot more to share over time.”</p>

<p><br>PockerPair found its success last year with the launch of Palworld, which saw the player battling Pokemon-like creatures but with guns. </p>



<p>PocketPair Publishing said on the deal with Surgent Studios, “We understand the challenges of creating your dream game.&nbsp;At Pocketpair , we’ve been fortunate to find success. Now, more than anything, we want to use that success to help other developers achieve theirs.“</p>



<p>The game hit a peak concurrent player count of 2,101,867, making it one of Steam’s highest-ever concurrent player counts. As of February 22, 2024, the company announced that the game sold 15 million copies on Steam and had reached 10 million players on Xbox.</p>

<p>The developer of the GTA 6 parody game Grand Taking Ages is launching on Steam after a revamp. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A little over a month ago, a title called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-iv-grand-taking-ages-ps-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Taking Ages VI </a>popped up on the PlayStation Store, and it felt eerily similar to Rockstar’s highly anticipated 2025 release, GTA 6, with both games even having the same acronym (GTA VI). After a closer look, it was revealed that Grand Taking Ages VI was a game development simulator where the player manages a studio while tackling obstacles that developers encounter while creating the game. The title was recently pulled from the PlayStation Store due to its controversial appearance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulled-gta-6-parody-game-grand-taking-ages-from-the-playstation-store-but-its-now-cleared-for-release-on-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> reveals that Grand Taking Ages, the GTA 6 parody game, is now launching on Steam while remaining pulled from the PlayStation Store. The developer, Violarte, stated that their approach towards Steam differed, as they “engaged with the team” early on with the game’s concept before the official submission. For its approval, the game underwent a “thorough” review process to be listed on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After arriving on Steam, you can spot key differences in the GTA 6 parody game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3464800/Grand_Taking_Ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing</a>. Grand Taking Ages has dropped the number ‘VI’ from the title. Additionally, they have new screenshots, a fresh trailer, and a revamped description. These changes were made to “clearly differentiate Grand Taking Ages from the original inspiration, GTA 6, and to emphasize its unique direction.”</p>



<p>Grand Taking Ages developer also addressed the PlayStation Store listing, stating they “strongly believe” that the new changes should be enough for the game to return to the platform. The game is slated to release in July 2025; check out its new description:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming Soon Since Forever! Start your game dev journey in Mom’s garage! Battle angry fans, dodge ruthless journalists, and perfect the art of “creative” deadlines. Survive on pizza and energy drinks while building your dream studio into… a slightly better garage!</p>
