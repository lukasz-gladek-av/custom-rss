<p>Co-creator of Back to The Future, Bob Gale, has said that a new video game is in the works. </p>



<p>The news came in a new interview by <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2024/05/back-to-the-future-co-creator-bob-gale-on-why-disney-rejected-script-possible-sequel-or-reboot-more.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cleveland.com</a> (paywalled), who had the opportunity to sit down and speak to Back to the Future’s co-creator Bob Gale.</p>



<p>In the interview, Gale was asked “what’s next” for him in the Back to the Future universe, to which he replied, “We’ve got a shot at a new video game based on Back to the Future.”</p>



<p>Gale continued, ”&nbsp;I don’t want to tell you any more than that because I’m not allowed to, but this is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. Knock on wood that it will happen. Of course, 2025 is the 40th anniversary of the original movie. We’re planning on some events, plus there’s a documentary that’s in post-production now about the making of the musical.”</p>



<p>For those out of the loop, Back to the Future has had a game before called “Back to the Future: The Game” and released in December 2010 by Telltale Games and released in 5 parts, known as espisodes.</p>



<p>The game received fairly positive reviews and reached number 3 in the PlayStation 3 sales charts on its release, however, Telltale Games did not release any sales figures.</p>

<p>It hasn’t been a smooth launch for the new-generation Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-launch-to-be-worst-when-it-comes-to-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited availability</a> alongside allegations of a paper launch from consumers, those who’ve been lucky enough to get one of the new $2,000 GPUs aren’t without their issues.</p>



<p>Over the last few days, posts on various <a href="https://www.chiphell.com/thread-2669678-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/1if73o9/rtx_5090_not_detected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddits</a> have appeared with claims that the GPUs—both the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and Chinese-specific RTX 5090D—are bricking. The common claim among all posts is that the cards are being undetected by their systems. Some have tried clearing the CMOS while others simply cleaned and reinstalled the drivers for the cards. None of those efforts have seemed to work.</p>

<p>The reports began to get so frequent that Nvidia had to issue a statement on the matter.</p>



<p>“We are investigation the reported issues with the RTX 50 series,” the company told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/nvidia-is-investigating-the-reported-issues-with-the-rtx-50-series-cards-after-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-owners-and-some-rtx-40-series-folk-report-black-screen-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a vague statement from Nvidia, but it does acknowledge that they know there’s an issue. What’s caused the problem will likely be revealed if and when Nvidia releases a fix or offers solutions for those suffering.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is staring the naysayers in the face and battling them back with reckless abandon. Despite campaigns on social media to smear the game’s image, the Warhorse Studios RPG is soaring up the charts. It has now more than <strong>doubled </strong>the peak player count of 2018’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance on Steam, and it’s not slowing down.</p>



<p>KCD2 is proving to be a smash hit. Not only did it receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glowing praise in my review</a>, but it’s already one of 2025’s most decorated games. It sold more than one million copies in a single day, with Warhorse Studios and Plaion making a profit within 24 hours of launch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-up">On the Up</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 had, at the time of publishing, hit a peak player count of 233,586 users. That dwarfs the record set by the first title, which was released in 2018 and secured a peak count on Steam of 95,800.</p>



<p>Incredibly, the launch of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has worked wonders for the first game. Players worldwide are flooding the first game to get the scope of the story before landing in the sequel. At the time of writing, the first game was sitting on a peak player count of 38,669 users, the highest it had been since March 2018.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has had some trouble on social platforms because of some of the more complex themes present, but that’s not enough to slow down the growth of this phenomenal title.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has already revealed that this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">three major expansions</a> will be released for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. The developer has a wonderful track record in that arena, having released a string of top expansions for the first game that provided entertainment long after the story was completed.</p>

<p>The PlayStation Servers are the equivalent of a quality midfielder in EA FC 25, if you don’t have a good one, everything around you falls apart. EA’s servers are known for being hit-and-miss, but it’s another thing if PSN is lunging in with two-footed tackles to break things down.</p>



<p>EA FC 25 relies so heavily on Servers. The game’s biggest modes include Rivals, Champions, Rush, and Squad Battles, and the Servers can ruin any matches in the blink of an eye. It’s always been a complaint and one that likely isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>



<p>It’s not always EA’s fault EA FC 25 doesn’t work though. Xbox might have issues, but so might Sony and its PlayStation Network. Let’s look into the state of PSN for you right now to see if there’s a hitch in the formation.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-ea-fc-25-servers-down-right-now-on-playstation">Are EA FC 25 Servers Down Right Now on PlayStation?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Please help us, Zinedine. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can’t play EA FC 25 online right now because PlayStation’s Servers are down due to a worldwide problem with the usually reliable PlayStation Network.</strong></p>



<p>Not since the 2011 PlayStation Network outage has PSN been down this long. Alas, this is the case as Sony’s solid infrastructure is down for maintenance. You might have been unaware of this happening, so let’s fill you in on the timeline.</p>



<p>The early hours of February 8 saw the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Network go down</a> for maintenance across the board. This prevented players from accessing any PlayStation Network Services—crucially, online <strong>multiplayer</strong> being one. As I write this, <strong>it’s still down</strong>, and we don’t know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-psn-down-how-long-is-it-down-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why PSN is down</a>.</p>



<p>PlayStation has been very hush-hush throughout the outage, outside of one message for the community. The company’s <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ask PlayStation</a> X page communicated a message to PS users: “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN.</strong>“</p>



<p><strong>EA FC 25 is currently playable on every other format</strong> as EA servers are working. If you do have access to EA FC 25 on another platform, you can still play online if you need a fix.</p>



<p>We have an up-to-date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN Server Status tracker</a> monitoring the PlayStation Network’s status. Keep checking back with Insider Gaming for breaking updates.</p>



<hr>



<p>The PlayStation Network is having a detrimental effect on all online multiplayer gaming. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fortnite-down-on-playstation-now-fortnite-psn-servers-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-gta-down-on-playstation-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-down-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> are all high-profile casualties throughout the maintenance.</p>



<p>Do you think PlayStation and Sony should be more vocal throughout this? Are PS users going to be handed a free game or two to make up for the chaos? Only time will tell. Drop a comment to let us know what you think about all of this.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 started as a single-player exclusive game, and then along came GTA Online. This live-service, open-world epic has been the backbone of the GTA franchise for more than a decade, and it’s where friends and foes alike congregate to share their crime-fuelled adventures.</p>



<p>Sadly, GTA Online is inherently tied to the wonders of the internet on PlayStation. That means if PSN goes offline, GTA 5 will be down – and <strong>that means </strong>that GTA Online will be offline too. In this guide, we’re taking a look at what to do if GTA Online stops working and answering a key question: ‘Is GTA 5 down on PlayStation?’</p>



<p>Let’s find out how you can check the GTA Online PSN server status.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-gta-down-on-ps5">Is GTA Down on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>GTA Online is down at the time of publishing due to an ongoing global issue with the PlayStation</strong> <strong>Network </strong>(last checked 08/02/25).</p>



<p>On February 8, the PlayStation Network buckled, crashing worldwide and plunging tens of millions of gamers into darkness. The major outage was a show-stopping event, taking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all PSN services offline</a> in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>For future reference, there are things you can do to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check the PSN server status</a>, but in most cases, it’s a matter of just waiting until the network comes back up again.</p>



<p>If GTA Online is down on PS5, you can bet your last dollar it’s offline on PS4, too.</p>



<p>Read on to check how you can figure out whether it’s a global outage or a more localised issue that’s taking GTA down on PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-rockstar-server-status-for-gta-online">How to Check Rockstar Server Status for GTA Online</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Check the GTA Online servers with this status page</figcaption></figure>







<p>The best way to check the <strong>GTA server status </strong>is via the <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Support service status page</a>. This one-stop-shop will tell you if GTA is down on PlayStation – or any other platform, for that matter. It’ll let you know about Red Dead Online too, if that’s more your speed.</p>



<p>Otherwise, you can stay connected to <a href="https://x.com/RockstarSupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar’s support function</a> on social media.</p>

<p>Call of Duty has become a mammoth network of games culminating in the infamous CoD HQ hub. But if you’re having trouble playing Warzone, Black Ops 6, or any other Call of Duty game on PlayStation, the serves could be an issue. Let’s take a look at the latest happenings.</p>



<p>Activision has so many CoD games live at once it’s untrue. There are so many different eras of CoD you can enjoy and gameplay styles too. Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer, and Battle Royale, mean there’s something for everyone. Every now and again <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD’s servers</a> go down, and it can be due to issues with Activision’s servers.</p>



<p>There are other circumstances where everything breaks too. If you’re a PlayStation user trying to get into CoD but can’t, the PS servers are probably a big reason why.</p>

<p><strong>The Call of Duty PlayStation servers are not working due to an issue with the PlayStation Network.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been wrapped up in work, your busy life, or anything else, you might not have heard about PSN. PlayStation’s online infrastructure mysteriously went offline on February 8, causing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worldwide outage of PlayStation online services</a>.</p>



<p>No one knows for sure <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-psn-down-how-long-is-it-down-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why PSN is down</a>, and the only details so far come from the <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ask PlayStation X page</a> on social media. The page officially addressed the problem with a quick message: “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN</strong>.”</p>



<p>This does mean <strong>all forms of Call of Duty work elsewhere</strong>. Warzone, Black Ops 6, and any other CoD game currently work just fine on Xbox, PC, and other applicable platforms. If you have another console, or maybe COD Mobile on your phone, this might have to keep you ticking over until the maintenance issue is sorted.</p>

<p>This is especially bad timing with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-play-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty having a free weekend for Black Ops 6</a>. It’s also Double XP too. Are you hoping Activision extends the free trial and Double XP Weekend for all those affected. Discuss it in the comments.</p>
