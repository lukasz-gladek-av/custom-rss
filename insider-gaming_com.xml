<p>A new rumor has emerged online suggesting that Fortnite may be collaborating with Minecraft.</p>



<p>Fortnite is a major player in the realm of collaborations within the gaming industry, partnering not only with various media franchises but also with different games. In the past, we have seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-rare-fortnite-skins-that-need-to-return-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters from iconic games</a> such as God of War, Halo, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and more appear in Fortnite. Now, it appears the devs may be collaborating with one of the largest games of all time, Minecraft.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-minecraft-seemingly-in-early-development">Fortnite x Minecraft Seemingly in Early Development </h2>



<p>The information about Fortnite’s Minecraft being in early development comes from <a href="https://x.com/AdiraFNInfo/status/2011541834959671372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> user (formerly Twitter) AdiraFNInfo, which was reposted by reliable Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2011542845010952494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>. However, HYPEX’s post has the word ‘rumored’ in it, which means that they haven’t been able to confirm whether this is indeed true. At the same time, if this is true, it could go down in the books as one of the biggest Fortnite collaborations of all time. </p>



<p>Fortnite has definitely levelled up their collaborations game over time, from just introducing skins, to introducing mythics and special abilities, and now designing their Island inspired by the collab. If Minecraft gets a similar treatment, we might see the Island adopt Minecraft’s unique art style. We could also see skins like Steve and other items make it into the game. However, this is just speculation, and readers should take this information with a massive grain of salt. </p>







<p>In other news, another claim states that Fortnite could be collaborating with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-office-x-fortnite-collaboration-could-be-coming-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>. Additionally, here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch notes</a> for the January 9 39.20 update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re in the mood for some ’80s and ’90s nostalgia, grab some Dunkaroos and get ready to be transported back to the world of Disney Afternoon cartoons on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, Capcom released the Disney Afternoon Collection. Originally developed by Digital Eclipse, the game featured six classic NES games based on Disney cartoons from the 1980s and 1990s. The six included games were: Darkwing Duck, TaleSpin, two Chip’n Dale Rescue Rangers games, and two DuckTales games. Now, nine years after its original release, the game could finally come to the Nintendo Switch</p>







<h2 id="h-a-new-esrb-rating-has-surfaced">A New ESRB Rating Has Surfaced</h2>



<p>Atari, which now owns Digital Eclipse, has an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41099/the-disney-afternoon-collection/">ESRB rating</a> for the collection of games specifically on the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2. It’s not shocking that any Disney game would receive an E for Everyone rating, but fans can read the full rating description below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Disney Afternoon Collection is rated E for Everyone by the ESRB with Mild Fantasy Violence and Use of Tobacco. This is a collection of action platformer games from classic Disney franchises. Several games depict instances of mild, fantastical violence: players stunning enemies; characters shooting enemies; players throwing objects (e.g., boxes, rocks) at enemies; a plane shooting down enemy planes. Some games contain larger bosses and boss rush modes. One boss is depicted holding a cigar.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>There is no proposed Switch release date for the NES game collection at this time. However, it is available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC, for anyone looking to scratch that nostalgic itch right now.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to follow the story and report any updates.</p>

<p>Xbox has provided an update to its “Shared Commitment to Safer Gaming,” which it has partnered on with Nintendo and Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>



<p>Xbox first announced the collaboration in 2020, noting that it partnered with its traditional competitors because it believes more can be accomplished when working together. Gaming, like any major community, is an excellent way for people to connect, but it also raises safety concerns.</p>



<h2 id="h-highlights-of-the-commitment-to-safer-gaming">Highlights Of The Commitment To Safer Gaming</h2>



<p>In the update, written by Kim Kunes, the Vice President of Gaming Trust and Safety, the latest guidelines agreed upon by the three organizations were outlined. Fans can read the complete outline on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/14/online-safety-principles-xbox-nintendo-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Xbox Wire website,</a> but below are some highlights:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Partnership: We partner with industry peers, publishers, regulators, law enforcement, and our communities to advance player safety.</p>



<p>We partner and engage with global and regional industry trade organizations, industry members, regulators, law enforcement, non-profit organizations, and experts to develop and/or advance online safety initiatives. These include Thriving in Games Group, the Family Online Safety Institute, and others.</p>



<p>We invest in leading technology and proactive collaboration to help thwart improper conduct and content. We participate in key industry initiatives, including the Tech Coalition and its Lantern program, that are dedicated to enhancing child safety through technology, knowledge-sharing, and transparency.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Roblox is one of the games that have recently come under fire <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-roblox-safe-for-kids-truth-parental-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for child safety concerns</a>; in fact, the state of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-child-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Louisiana is suing Roblox</a> over these concerns.</p>



<p>Xbox is not just working with Nintendo and Sony on player safety. More of the Microsoft console’s exclusive games are appearing on PlayStation and Nintendo platforms as<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/4th-game-during-xbox-developer-direct/"> Xbox continues to push the narrative that everything is an Xbox. </a></p>

<p>Oh God, it’s happening…. perhaps.</p>



<p>Recently, Shiina posted a roundup of the latest Fortnite news in a short YouTube video. One rumor suggested that a nostalgic duo from a live-action TV show could be coming to the game as early as next week.</p>



<p>Shiina said that if that is true, it could be The Office, as they had heard the collaboration within the works. Their tone made it clear this was not a lock. Whether Jim Halpert and Pam Beesley or Dwight Schrute and Michael Scott, The Office has no shortage of iconic duos that could be added to the game.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming will continue to monitor the story and report whether or not The Office is officially coming to Fortnite, but as we all know, you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. Michael Scott said that Wayne Gretzky said that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Two Months Later, Only 10,000 Escape from Tarkov Players Have Finished the Game]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-finished-game/</link>
            <guid>1406497</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two months ago, Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0 and was officially released as a <strong>full game</strong>. It was the most monumental milestone in the studio’s history, and the game’s director called it the most significant moment of his life. The release of Tarkov 1.0 introduced the game’s ultimate ending, achievable after completing an all-new campaign.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and just <strong>10,489 players </strong>have managed to complete the game. It’s not known exactly how many people <strong>play </strong>Escape from Tarkov, but on Steam alone, you typically have around 25,000 concurrent players at peak times – and that’s the minority platform <strong>by far</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-have-completed-escape-from-tarkov">How Many People Have Completed Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, confirmed that, at the time of writing, 10,489 players had <strong>escaped from Tarkov</strong>. When Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0 in November, this became the ultimate goal for fans worldwide, but also emerged as one of the toughest challenges ever presented in the extraction shooter space.</p>



<p>To make it to the game’s ending, an entire campaign with some hefty quests must be completed, and players then need to contend with a final ‘gauntlet’ through a new map, Terminal. This is the final mission and arguably the toughest thing Tarkov players have ever faced.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">10489 players escaped fromTarkov so far. Beasts! 🫡</p>— Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/2011537504126845148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>If that wasn’t enough, players need to escape from boarding a boat, but depending on their squad size, <strong>not everyone </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-ending-zubr-seats-changes-battlestate-games/">is guaranteed a spot</a> on said vessel. That means that, for one or two players, it’s a trip back to the lobby and a second go at the final gauntlet.</p>



<p>It took <strong>two weeks </strong>for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/">first player in the world</a>, <strong>Tigz</strong>, to successfully escape from Tarkov. He did this while streaming live, and the broadcast was tuned into by several Battlestate Games employees, including Buyanov himself.</p>



<p>Many players have followed in his footsteps, but 10,489 users represent a serious minority group in the assumed <strong>millions </strong>of Escape from Tarkov owners. In August 2025, Nikita gave fans a glimpse at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-player-count-how-many/">how many people were playing</a> Escape from Tarkov <strong>PvP </strong>on a random Sunday evening, and the number was around 45,000.</p>



<p>That doesn’t include PvE, which should equal another 30,000 – 40,000 (if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/">Nikita’s PvE player count</a> claims are accurate). That means almost 100,000 concurrent players were enjoying Tarkov on a Sunday evening, and extrapolation means that just 10% of those players would have completed the game, two months after the opportunity became available.</p>



<p>We can safely say very few Tarkov players have managed to accomplish the ultimate goal.</p>
