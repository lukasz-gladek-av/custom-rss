<p>Indie games are thriving like never before. From innovative gameplay to stunning visuals, the indie scene is a treasure trove of creativity, with standout titles across every platform. This year, games like Animal Well, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Nine Sols, and UFO 50 captured our hearts and imaginations. Yet, even among such a stellar lineup, one game stood above the rest — not just as the best indie game, but as one of the year’s defining games overall. Say hello to Balatro, your 2024 indie game of the year.</p>



<p>In a poll on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, Balatro emerged victorious, earning a commanding 72% of the votes. It outpaced contenders like Palworld, Harold Halibut, Animal Well, and UFO 50. And if you’ve played even a few hands of Balatro, the result should be no surprise.</p>



<h3 id="h-redefining-the-deck">Redefining the Deck</h3>



<p>At its base, Balatro is a poker game, but not as you know it. Developer <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LocalThunk</a> takes the familiar structure of poker and transforms it into something wildly original.</p>



<p>Players start with a traditional 52-card deck, but from there, the rules are upended. Instead of competing against other players, your goal is to hit specific target scores using creative strategies. The addition of Joker modifiers (special abilities that can alter the way cards behave) is a game changer. For example, modifiers might let you form straights by skipping numbers or treat hearts and diamonds as a single suit. These twists create an endless variety of deck-building possibilities, ensuring that no two runs are ever the same.</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-high-stakes-endless-strategy">High Stakes, Endless Strategy</h3>



<p>The beauty of Balatro lies in its balance of simplicity and depth. Players must carefully manage their money and deck-building strategies to progress through the game’s eight antes. The Boss Blinds that present unique challenges to test your planning and adaptability, add an extra layer of complexity. Every decision feels meaningful, and one wrong move can spell the end of a run.</p>



<p>But that’s precisely what makes Balatro so addictive. It’s the perfect “just one more run” game, where every defeat only fuels your desire to improve and try again. Few games manage to capture this balance of challenge and replayability so effectively.</p>



<p>What makes Balatro truly special is how it reimagines a familiar concept and makes it feel entirely fresh. LocalThunk’s ingenuity and commitment to creating a unique experience shines through in every hand you play. It’s a game that keeps you on your toes, rewards thinking, and delivers endless hours of fun.</p>



<p>Do you agree with Balatro as the indie game of the year for 2024? Let us know down below, and join the conversation in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-sports-game-of-2024-best-new-sports-games-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Sports genre continues to tick along and produce annual entries. However, new sports IPs are constantly popping up, and legendary series’ are being revived. All of this happened in 2025, so let’s show you our Best Sports Game of 2024 winner and nominees.</p>



<p>Sports games are a genre that will never die. With so many sports and simulated interpretations of them, we’re guaranteed multiple releases each year. Plus, as most sports have annual seasons, it makes sense to see yearly iterations. I’m thinking of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-team-of-the-year-promo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC</a>, NBA 2K, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-25-was-the-best-selling-game-in-us-for-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden</a>, and a myriad of other popular franchises.</p>



<p>2024 featured a lot of these names, and our Best Sports Game of 2024 award winner came top of the league.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-sports-title-of-2024-winner-ea-fc-25">Best Sports Title of 2024 Winner — EA FC 25</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I can only imagine the greatness of this conversation. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>I feel it says a lot about the state of sports titles when EA FC 25 is the recipient of our Best Sports Game of 2024 award. EA’s latest soccer sim sequel isn’t bad by any means—and I’ve spent a couple of hundred hours with it already—but its lack of innovation is symptomatic of a genre that seems to thrive on the concept.</p>



<p>However, when it works, EA FC 25 is a fabulous addition to the long-running series. The 2024 iteration features the new FC IQ tactical system upgrades—which make a world of difference to your gameplay—and I’ve enjoyed the flexibility to mold my team and adapt to my ever-changing squad of players. </p>



<p>Also, Rush is a brand-new 5v5 game mode effectively replacing Volta’s ghost town. These matches are fast-paced, shorter, take place on smaller pitches, and encourage high-scoring games. Absent-minded teammates can detract from the experience, but it’s a great inclusion and something I hope EA builds on.</p>



<p>EA FC 25 features subtle tweaks across the board, and modes such as Pro Clubs have undergone their biggest changes in years. The main selling point for FC 25 is it plays a great game of soccer—the biggest (and best) sport on the planet. Yes, center-backs can somehow catch up to Mbappé&nbsp;with little effort, referees are card-happy, and certain shooting mechanics can be exploited—like every year—but I <em>always </em>want to play another match.</p>



<p>I feel other sports titles aren’t doing enough to make their presence known. For soccer alone, eFootball continues to be a shell of its former Pro Evolution Soccer self, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-ufl-achievements-trophies-list-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UFL</a> is the new kid on the block trying to make a name for itself. I’m hoping a sports game (old or new) brings 2025 to life and challenges the EA FC mantle.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-sports-games-of-2024-nominations">Best Sports Games of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>EA FC 25 hasn’t won by a landslide, don’t get this twisted. Other sports titles have more than adequately put their name in the hat. From improved follow-ups to returning legends, let’s check out the main contenders to the crown. </p>



<h3 id="h-wwe-2k24">WWE 2K24</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t go one-on-one with The Undertaker. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>WWE 2K24 feels like a series heading in the right direction. 2K22 was a welcome return after the 2K20 fiasco, and 2K23 was a step-up. Here, I feel WWE 2K24 is once again a gradual improvement over its predecessor, without being groundbreaking. The realism, presentation, and refined nature of the in-ring mechanics are as sumptuous as ever. However, a seriously lackluster Showcase Mode (for 40 Years of Wrestlemania, no less) and technical issues bring WWE 2K24 down, and the developer needs to address the same recurring drawbacks for it to earn a GOTY title match.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-sports-college-football-25">EA Sports College Football 25</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Prestigious. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>A 2013 legal dispute halted the beloved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-call-of-duty-release-college-football-25-is-still-the-best-selling-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports College Football</a> franchise quicker than a quarter-back running full-speed into an offensive tackle. It’s taken 11 years, but EA Sports College Football 25 has been a blessing for many who want an alternative to EA’s annual mire which is Madden. This is potentially the start of something beautiful. The College Football aesthetic is nailed down for every team and it features improved gameplay mechanics Madden could do with copying. However, its game modes aren’t the deepest, and it feels like EA was testing the waters with EA Sports College Football 25—a much-improved sequel could throw a flag on the field though.</p>



<h3 id="h-topspin-2k25">TopSpin 2K25</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A swift backhand to the sports genre. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>I had to do a double-take when I realized it’s been 13 years since I owned the last TopSpin game—2011’s TopSpin 4. I’m not sure why Tennis games haven’t been chased very hard over the years—given the popularity of the sport—but I’m glad 2K are now firing on all sports fronts—with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> on the way. I feel I can copy and paste many of the sentiments I did for the nominees. TopSpin offers great gameplay with its winning combination of punchy, racket-slapping shots and authentic tennis matches. But it’s rough around the edges in place: Stadiums and licensed players look great, but animations began to repeat frequently, and it needs a bit more depth in its content. Like EA Sports College Football 25, we’re glad to see it back, and hope it goes one better next time!</p>

<p>When was the last time you came in first on Call of Duty: Warzone? You might win a match next year with a few worthwhile Warzone tips and tricks from someone who won a single round way back when the game was first released.</p>



<h2 id="h-open-your-parachute-early"><strong>Open Your Parachute Early</strong></h2>



<p>Most people carefully plan their drops with pinpoint accuracy. They know which building they’ll camp in and the route they’ll take into the zone once it appears. But you know better.</p>



<p><strong>Open your chute early</strong>. When you do, you pull your starting pistol. Did you know you can kill opposing players while they’re still floating down to the ground? Use these precious seconds in the air to down an enemy player, or at the very least, take some of their health away.</p>



<h2 id="h-spend-cash-early-spend-it-often"><strong>Spend Cash Early, Spend It Often</strong></h2>



<p>When you die, you wind up in the Gulgag. You’ll receive a single life in a 1v1 against another opponent there. If you die, you’re done. If you win, you resurrect and parachute down once more.</p>



<p>To avoid losing all of the money you earned up to this point, spend it early and often. You can buy a self-resurrect for $4500, which is invaluable to avoid the Gulag and remain in the match.</p>



<p>While playing in a party, any help you can provide to your team makes you invaluable, so spend the money to revive dead teammates!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-how-to-get-a-cleaver-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-cleaver-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Get a Cleaver in Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-avoid-the-gas"><strong>Avoid the Gas</strong></h2>



<p>Well, duh. This is a non-tip, you’re likely thinking. But wait, the gas in Call of Duty: Warzone is unlike the gas found in PUBG or Fortnite. In this battle royale, the gas is deadly. With the gas rapidly encroaching your position, you cannot hang around, waiting to unleash an ambush.</p>



<p>If you have a gas mask, your character will automatically put it on when inside the gas zone. But this process takes a long time. Use that limited time to find a better position—a gas-free position.</p>



<h2 id="h-grind-the-pre-game"><strong>Grind the Pre-Game</strong></h2>



<p>Many are content to sit around and wait for the actual battle royale to begin. They grab a drink, eat a snack, or check their social media.</p>



<p>During the pre-game, use those precious minutes to train your weapons. You earn XP before the match by getting kills, which unlocks perks, attachments, and skins.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/look-your-absolute-best-by-learning-how-to-transmog-in-diablo-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>What’s the end game of any role-playing game? It’s fashion, right? Many of us play RPGs and MMORPGs because we feel a deep connection to a character we built from the ground up. As that character progresses in level, becomes stronger, and finds better gear, a part of ourselves flows into said character. And upon reaching the end game, when you’re all-powerful, what then? Well, it’s time to learn how to transmog gear in <strong>Diablo 4</strong>!</p>



<h2 id="h-travel-to-kyovashad"><strong>Travel to Kyovashad</strong></h2>



<p>You can transmog your gear in Diablo 4 by traveling to the central city of Kyovashad. You’ll find a small inn directly to the north of the waypoint. On the top floor, the only room at the top of the landing that players can enter, is a bed and a cabinet. It’s here that you’ll transmog your equipment.</p>



<p>Once you activate the cabinet, you’ll find various options to customize your character better. You can alter your appearance by adding cosmetic items like the wolf pup backpack cosmetic from the beta or transmog your gear based on available cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-earn-transmogs-in-diablo-4"><strong>How to Earn Transmogs in Diablo 4</strong></h2>



<p>If your selection of transmogs feels lackluster, it’s because you’ve been spending all your time raking in the gold instead of salvaging items.</p>



<p>By visiting the local blacksmith in any settlement, you can salvage unwanted gear and, occasionally, receive a new transmog. You can tell when you’ll earn a new cosmetic look based on the hammer-like icon over the item.</p>



<p>Of course, you’ll also be able to buy premium cosmetics through the in-game store. Those, however, can be pretty expensive. As we’ve seen since the Early Access launch, the store features quite the pricing scheme. A single outfit collection can cost up to $25!</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can buy the occasional single piece, like a shield cosmetic, for much less.</p>







<h2 id="h-saving-outfits-for-later-use"><strong>Saving Outfits for Later Use</strong></h2>



<p>Perhaps one of the most annoying aspects of a transmog system in RPGs is having to continually update your appearance after acquiring new gear. For some, it’s easier to wait until max level. Others, however—myself included—like to look like an absolute unit throughout the game.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in the transmog section, you’ll find ‘Ensembles.’ You start with a single ensemble slot and pay gold to unlock additional slots.</p>



<p>This feature allows players to quickly transmog an entire gear set to suit their style and appearance desires with one click.</p>

<p>Do you have a favorite cosmetic set in Diablo 4? Let us know in the comments, or share a screenshot of your character in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-single-player-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot released</a> in September, many players loved the nod to the history of Sony and PlayStation classics throughout the game. From tributes to more recent franchises like Horizon and Uncharted to older series like Ape Escape, the game fed into nostalgia in a big way. This has led to questions about whether PlayStation could dip into its backlog of classic franchises for new games in the future.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/26274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, PlayStation Co-CEO Herman Hulst was asked about past PlayStation series and the possibility of bringing them back. According to Hulst, it’s not something that’s out of the question for the company.</p>



<p>“The numerous IP holdings we hold are important assets for PlayStation, and as part of our efforts to strengthen our portfolio, we are continuously looking at opportunities to leverage past IPs, as well as developing new franchises,” Hulst said via auto translation.</p>



<p>Hulst added that the company’s goal is to release games made by the best developers whether they are a part of PlayStation Studios or not. He tipped the hat to external studios for the “many successes so far”.</p>



<p>The idea of reviving past franchises has picked up steam across the games industry over the years. Currently, fellow Japanese company Sega <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-outlines-segas-plans-for-new-slate-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is in the middle</a> of a massive revival of classic games like Golden Axe, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, and more. </p>



<p>Whether PlayStation decides to bring back classic titles down the line obviously remains to be seen. Still, it has to be nice for longtime fans of the studio to see that the door isn’t closed if the right opportunity comes along.</p>



<p>What classic PlayStation franchises do you hope to see get a revival in the future? Let us know down below and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums. </p>

<p>Alongside the countless story missions available—both in the single-player campaign and in Red Dead Online—the multiplayer mode features countless ways to earn decent money fast. You could, for instance, sift through treasure maps, take part in free roam events, earn money by completing daily challenges, take on the trader role, do delivery missions, and overall maximize efficiency to earn quick money to beat the vast majority of players economically.</p>



<h2 id="h-go-treasure-hunting"><strong>Go Treasure Hunting</strong></h2>



<p>If you’d rather not get your hands dirty as a lawless gunslinger in the Wild West or don’t feel like taking part in the often-lengthy story missions of Red Dead Online, then consider locating treasure maps and becoming a defacto treasure hunter instead!</p>



<p>You can earn treasure maps in several ways, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Leveling Up</strong> — Rockstar Games is kind enough to provide the occasional map when you level up. More specifically, every five levels. The maps are in the camp lockbox or at the local post office.</li>



<li><strong>Gang Hideout Challenges </strong>— If you finish off a gang hideout in Red Dead Online, you can earn a map by taking down the boss or via a lock box at the very end of the missions.</li>



<li><strong>Outlaw Passes </strong>— If you pay for one of the Outlaw Passes in Red Dead Online, you’ll occasionally receive maps via the Benefits page.</li>



<li><strong>Posted on Trees</strong> — While exploring the world in free roam, you may stumble upon treasure maps stuck to various trees. The tree in question will appear illuminated, and you can snag the map and find the treasure chests for yourself.</li>



<li><strong>Treasure Hunters</strong> — Scattered about the world of Red Dead Online, you’ll stumble upon other treasure hunters. These NPCs are out there earning money, sometimes very good money, and they’ll sell you a map for a few dollars. Or, you could take it at gunpoint! After all, the in-game economy works at the end of a barrel sometimes.</li>
</ul>



<p>While perhaps not the fastest way to earn money in Red Dead Online, becoming a treasure hunter can be fantastic fun, especially from a role-play perspective.</p>



<h2 id="h-become-a-bounty-hunter"><strong>Become a Bounty Hunter</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most lucrative and enjoyable ways to make money in Red Dead Online is by tackling the bounty hunter role. You can earn decent money in Red Dead Online by taking on bounty-hunting missions posted throughout the massive game world. You’ll track down targets and can even earn weekly bonuses to earn the most money.</p>



<p>It’s simple! Alongside tracking down bounties, including legendary bounties, you can earn higher rewards by looting fallen enemies to make more money faster. Then, you can buy something powerful, like a bolt action rifle. With the said rifle, you can snipe your bounty and their bodyguards from afar before moving in to loot.</p>



<p>Speaking of legendary bounties, numerous story missions are associated with the bounty hunter role in Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>But first, you’ll have to pick up the Bounty Hunter License in Rhodes. The usual cost for the role is 15 Gold Bars, though various promotions may discount the total price in Red Dead Online. Then, you can tackle bounty-hunting missions from various Bounty Posters scattered about the game world, all of which will earn you money, gold, and experience.</p>



<p>Then, if you want to acquire the Prestigious Bounty Hunter License to tackle new ranks and acquire high-level items, and new skills, you’ll have to pay 30 Gold Bars. This license will also unlock Infamous Bounty Targets, which prove more lucrative overall.</p>







<h2 id="h-loot-gang-hideouts"><strong>Loot Gang Hideouts</strong></h2>



<p>There are various rewards for completing gang hideout missions in Red Dead Redemption 2, especially if your goal is to earn huge amounts of cash. Most hideouts are completely manageable solo, meaning you can earn money through bounty hunting, then buy a few powerful weapons and clear hideouts with ease.</p>



<p>Once all is said and done, you can scoop up the cash from the fallen bodies and perhaps even complete a few daily challenges for taking down foes along the way.</p>



<p>What’s the best way to take down a hideout, you ask? Personally, I would recommend utilizing a strong weapon like the repeater. It offers an excellent range advantage along with a high rate of fire to take down numerous foes without putting yourself in harm’s way.</p>



<p>Furthermore, each time you complete a hideout, you’ll earn a treasure map from the camp’s leader. The treasure map will spawn either on the corpse of the fallen commander or via a nearby lockbox, which usually contains some cash, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-play-free-roam-events-and-missions"><strong>Play Free Roam Events and Missions</strong></h2>



<p>As a multiplayer open world, Red Dead Online features countless free-roam events, and the occasional story mission, to help players earn money fast. If making money is the end goal, then why not have fun along the way by taking part in, say, the Showdown Series or horse races event?</p>



<p>You can quick join free-roam events throughout the game to earn money fast in Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>If you’re a new player to Red Dead Online, then the Rockstar-hosted events can be quite lucrative. These often weekly events usually offer double money and gold for Free Roam Events, with rewards handed out for completing specific challenges.</p>



<p>If you play online in a party, then tackling missions and events together is the easiest way to earn money quickly in Red Dead Online. It’s also a lot more enjoyable than tracking and killing NPCs to sell their meager inventories to the traders.</p>



<h2 id="h-take-on-a-player-role"><strong>Take On a Player Role</strong></h2>



<p>Along with the Bounty Hunter role is the Specialist Role, Naturalist Role, and Moonshiner Role. These unique in-game roles in Red Dead Online can help you earn a gold bar now and then, pick up raw materials to sell, acquire a fishing rod to catch lucrative trout and other wildlife, and gain a reasonable amount of cash in the game.</p>



<p>Of the three previously mentioned roles, the Moonshiner Role proves most effective at earning cash in-game. It does take some start-up, however, as you’ll have to complete a story mission or two, along with opening the business and acquiring supplies.</p>



<p>To make the best moonshine, you’ll have to pay upfront. Once you do, that little shack will begin to earn cash fast in Red Dead Online. Along with crafting moonshine, you’ll also take part in Bootlegger Missions, which will reduce the cost of production overall. But in doing so, you will contend with other players. Someone could easily grief your efforts. Or, you could pay out of pocket, though doing so will eat away at your profits.</p>



<p>Furthermore, invest in the upgrades! More potent moonshine will earn you more money per sale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-multiplayer-game-of-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Multiplayer games live and die by the experiences they offer — gameplay, features, and the community surrounding them. It takes something truly exceptional to shine in a crowded field. Enter Helldivers 2. Combining fun gameplay, diverse missions, and a thriving community, this game didn’t just check the boxes — it nailed them. That’s why it earned the title of Insider Gaming’s Best Multiplayer Game of 2024.</p>



<p>In a poll held on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, the results spoke volumes. Helldivers 2 dominated, capturing 47% of the votes while Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 came in second with just 23%.</p>



<p>So, what makes Helldivers 2 the definitive multiplayer experience of the year?</p>



<h3 id="h-a-game-built-around-unity-and-chaos"><strong>A Game Built Around Unity and Chaos</strong></h3>



<p>At its core, Helldivers 2 thrives on its unparalleled sense of community. The premise is simple yet brilliantly executed: spreading democracy, one battle at a time, alongside thousands of other players working toward the same grand objectives. Whether you’re toppling robot regimes, escorting citizens to safety, or obliterating Bile Titans, teamwork is the name of the game. Success isn’t just rewarding, it’s downright euphoric.</p>



<p>And then there are the moments that keep players coming back for more. Maybe it’s the flawless execution of a mission, where everyone plays their part like a well-oiled machine. Or perhaps it’s the chaotic hilarity of failure like a teammate accidentally triggering a mine that you laid or an unexpected ambush leading to utter mayhem and friendly fire. Every session is a mix of camaraderie and comedy, making even defeat an unforgettable experience.</p>



<p>Unlike many multiplayer titles, Helldivers 2 offers a dynamic, player-driven story. There’s no predetermined ending here as your actions shape the game’s future. Each day’s decisions ripple through the universe, influencing what happens weeks or even months down the line. This evolving narrative keeps the stakes high and ensures there’s always a reason to return to the battlefield with friends.</p>



<h3 id="h-why-helldivers-2-stands-above-the-rest"><strong>Why Helldivers 2 Stands Above the Rest</strong></h3>



<p>What truly sets Helldivers 2 apart is its emphasis on connection. Arrowhead Game Studios nailed the delicate balance of making players feel like a cog in a massive, universe-spanning machine, while still letting them revel in personal and team triumphs. It’s a rare feat that few multiplayer games achieve so seamlessly.</p>



<p>Whether you’re chasing victory or laughing through chaos, Helldivers 2 delivers on all fronts.</p>
