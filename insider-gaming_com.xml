            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Amazon is laying off more than 14,000 corporate employees. Within those layoffs, Amazon Games and Twitch will be hit in some capacity.</p>



<p>Bloomberg says, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTY2Nzc5MywiZXhwIjoxNzYyMjcyNTkzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNFVOSThHUTdMSEIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.gpW2CyZmAypCDjxGr-gBHrW6EnUxZkFspCrjiLV-dwc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">without going into</a> specifics, that both video games and the cloud-computing area of the company will be affected. Insider Gaming has reached out to Amazon to ask how many people were set to be let go from the gaming division and Twitch. As of publishing, a response has not been received.</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the cuts “would largely fall on its offices in Irvine and San Diego, as well as its central publishing division.”</p>



<p><strong>“The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs,”</strong> the report reads.</p>



<p><strong>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,”</strong> an email sent by vice president of audio, Twitch, and games Steve Boom to employees said.</p>



<p>Included in the layoffs was Tarfu, who had been with Twitch for 11 years.</p>



<p><strong>“I started off working in trust &amp; safety, then moved to customer experience,” </strong><a href="https://x.com/Tarfu/status/1983196834698015164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he shared.</a> <strong>“I was the person who built the entire fraud program at Twitch. One of the reasons I never told people what I did for work.</strong></p>



<p>“<strong>I was the one keeping bad actors off Twitch who steal and abuse revenue on the platform. I guess I did my job too well since they let me go. But do I have some great stories of being there over a decade.”</strong></p>



<p>News of the mass layoffs was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-targets-many-30000-corporate-job-cuts-sources-say-2025-10-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first reported</a> by Reuters. The cuts would be, according to the outlet, the largest cut since 2022, when Amazon let go of roughly 27,000 people. This new set of layoffs would be the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/amazon-to-announce-sweeping-corporate-job-cuts-starting-tuesday.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">largest in company history</a>, with impacted employees to be notified via email.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have more coverage of the layoffs, including what happens to Amazon Games, as it becomes available.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2’s Future Saga Chapter 3 DLC arrives on October 30, 2025, with new characters, missions, and more content. </p>



<p>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is one of those games that has been receiving post-launch content for almost a decade now. Earlier this year, the developers introduced the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-daima-character-pack-2-releases-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daima Pack</a>, which brought Goku Super Saiyan 4 to the title. We are now receiving Future Saga Chapter 3, which introduces Broly from Dragon Ball Super and Golden Frieza (Ultra Supervillain). </p>



<h2 id="h-xenoverse-2-future-saga-chapter-3-will-introduce-broly-and-golden-frieza">Xenoverse 2 Future Saga Chapter 3 Will Introduce Broly and Golden Frieza</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtxSegpS7TI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> provides plot details for Xenoverse 2 Future Saga Chapter 3. Frieza has joined hands with Fu, and now he aims to master time itself, which is why they are trying to infiltrate the Time Next. Frieza has unlocked another form that draws power from the crystals, making the character more powerful than ever. The design of this character and some of the plot points seem inspired by Black Frieza’s origins in the Dragon Ball Super manga. </p>



<p>Along with the new playable characters, Golden Frieza (Ultra Supervillain) and Broly (DB Super), the developers have introduced tons of new content for players to try out. A brand new mission, three new parallel quests, six additional moves, five costumes/accessories, three Super Souls, 23 Illustrations, a new stage: Conton City ruins, and an extra scenario: Cheelai &amp; Broly All Out! Conton City Patrol. Towards the end of the trailer, the devs also teased that Future Saga will receive a fourth and final chapter. </p>

<p>Microsoft has announced that it’s increasing its investment in AI. On Tuesday, it was announced that the company purchased a 27% stake in OpenAI for $135 billion. </p>



<p>Microsoft has had a partnership with OpenAI for years, but Tuesday’s announcement increases that commitment to the AI-based company behind ChatGPT, Sora, Whisper, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“What began as an investment in a research organization has grown into one of the most successful partnerships in our industry,”</strong> the joint press announcement says. <strong>“As we enter the next phase of this partnership, we’ve signed a new definitive agreement that builds on our foundation, strengthens our partnership, and sets the stage for long-term success for both organizations.”</strong></p>



<p>With the added push towards AI within Microsoft, players and employees are likely to be concerned about more AI being used to develop upcoming games. On this front, Xbox’s Phil Spencer has gone on record saying that they won’t force its use on staff. </p>



<p>He said that AI use is left to individual teams and that he’s <strong>“found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier, and any top-down mandate that ‘Thou must use a certain tool’…is not really a path to success.”</strong></p>
