            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that Hideo Kojima, the legendary game creator, has joined the cast of Zootopia 2 to provide a Japanese dub for Paul Moldebrandt, a mole who works in the Zootopia Police Department. His cameo appearance reportedly comes after he was directly approached by Jared Bush, the film’s director, to request his voiceover talents.</p>



<p>Zootopia 2 is set to hit screens in just a few days, launching on Friday, December 5.</p>







<h2 id="h-an-unexpected-cameo">An Unexpected Cameo</h2>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded by Famitsu</a>, Hideo Kojima expressed his delight at being invited to voice a character in Zootopia 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have plenty of experience with cameo appearances in live-action films and games, but this will be my first time dubbing an animated feature film. And it’s from Disney, to my surprise!</p>



<p>And since it came directly from director Jared Bush, I was incredibly honored and accepted without hesitation</p>



<p>My participation was limited to a small scene, but even at the recording stage, the level of detail was impressive. Thanks to the illustrations, the recording went smoothly. I’m usually on the directing side, so I learned a lot from actually acting. I was reminded of how much attention voice actors pay to basic things like turning pages in the script and adding noise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Kojima said, this isn’t his first time acting. He has appeared in a few small roles over the years, most notably in Cyberpunk 2077 and Control. He also assumed roles in Metal Gear Solid games and has made cameos in Death Stranding.</p>



<p>The report from Famitsu suggests that Kojima was a huge fan of the first Zootopia movie, released in 2016, and when he saw it, he was left wondering how they could ‘surpass’ it with a sequel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Justin Lin, the director of several Fast and Furious films, has been announced as the director of the live-action Helldivers film. In addition, the writer of several horror films, like Annabelle and I,t wrote the script for the video game adaptation. </p>



<p>As one of PlayStation’s newer series, Helldivers didn’t seem to hit its stride until 2024, when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-brings-in-around-2-5-million-players-every-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it became a worldwide phenomenon</a>. The multiplayer sci-fi shooter was a viral sensation and still is in some ways. With constant updates and a recent port to Xbox, Arrowhead Studios’ hit felt primed for Hollywood. In January 2025, it was announced that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be brought to film</a> by Sony Pictures. Updates went silent for a bit until now, where it’s been revealed that a high-profile director and writer are attached.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive from The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the outlet revealed that <strong>Justin Lin has joined the Helldivers film as director</strong>. He will be adapting the project from a script <strong>written by Gary Dauberman</strong>. While additional crew and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-ceo-wants-a-list-to-be-violently-killed-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casting</a> have yet to be revealed, the report says that Lin <strong>plans to bring out the ‘humanity’ of the game</strong> with <strong>timely themes</strong> and <strong>a built-out world</strong>. It also seems like the story will <strong>revolve around a squad of elite Helldivers taking on various creatures and the Super Earth</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve watched any Fast and Furious movie from the 2010s, it’s likely been directed by Justin Lin. The filmmaker is a hit with action-film fans and a notable name in the genre. Currently, Lin is set to direct Keanu Reeves in BRZRKR and adapt One Punch Man into a film. For Gary Dauberman, the scribe has been behind some of horror’s recent hits like It (and its sequel, It Chapter Two), Annabelle, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn</a>. All that said, it’ll be interesting to see how Helldivers shapes up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splinter Cell Remake’s Director Has Returned to Ubisoft to Finish The Game]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-director/</link>
            <guid>1369813</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splinter Cell Remake director David Grivel has returned to Ubisoft to finish what he started in 2021.</p>



<p>Announced on his LinkedIn profile, David Grivel announced that he’s rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as the project’s Game Director for the Splinter Cell Remake. </p>







<p>The Splinter Cell Remake originally started development in 2021 under the codename ‘North’, with not much else being said on the game since. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> in 2024 that the game is currently in development on the Snowdrop engine, with a tentative release date of 2026. It’s likely given the projects (and Ubisoft as a whole) issues that this release date is no longer accurate, but we will update our readers when we learn more.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming received footage of the project in early 2025, which showed Irving Lambert speaking to Sam Fisher in a superb cinematic. As it’s understood, the Splinter Cell Remake is a fully-fledged remake from the ground up, which will include being built around a modern audience from the ground up, rather than a simple graphic rehaul.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the game is in development for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>



<p>As for what Grivel’s return to the game means for the game’s immediate future is unclear, but the news that development continues on the game will be a warm welcome to those who were skeptical of the project’s future.</p>
