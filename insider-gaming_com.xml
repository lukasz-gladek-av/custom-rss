<p>If you are hoping for EA to release Apex Legends 2, you might want to let go of that hope for now. </p>



<p>During its latest earnings call, EA CEO Andrew Wilson was asked about what the company’s plans were involving Apex Legends in order to regain a player base that has been steadily declining. One of those questions involved the possibility of doing a full rebuild of the game, and launching an Apex 2.0, of sorts.”</p>



<p>“[W]hat I would say is that typically, what we have seen — again in the context of live service driven games at scale is the Version 2 thing has almost never been as successful as the Version 1 thing,” Wilson said. </p>



<p>“And so actually, the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global player base that we have and deliver the new innovative creative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the progress that they’ve made or the investment that they have put into the existing ecosystem.”</p>



<p>Wilson then went on to say that EA’s goal is to “innovate in the core experience” of Apex Legends. He said that it’s been seen as seasons move forward and continue to grow. </p>



<p>“[W]e’re changing kind of key modalities at play within those seasons and then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers,” he said. “And we think we can do those two things together, and we don’t believe we have to separate the experience in order to do so.”</p>



<p>Wilson also said that he, and the company, believe that Apex Legends is in an “incredibly good position” moving forward. Specifically, he mentioned the ability of the game to reach the “very top tier” of the genre while having a “strong brand”, “strong mechanic”, and a “very committed global community”.</p>



<p>Despite no plans for a completely new Apex Legends game, Wilson admitted that there is a need for changes to the game in order to keep that community happy and engaged with the game for months and years to come.</p>



<p>“We’ve also observed is a need for kind of meaningful systematic innovation in the game that fundamentally changes the way the game plays more broadly and our teams are working on that as well,” he said.</p>



<p>As far as what those innovations could be, that wasn’t mentioned. It was only reiterated that the “team is working through” it.</p>

<p>Nintendo says there were no layoffs at a subsidiary. Earlier this week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-subsidiary-reportedly-hit-with-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japanese outlet Leakpress</a> reported that Mario Club Co. Ltd. was laying off up to 150 employees.</p>



<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-subsidiary-isnt-laying-off-employees-despite-rumours-to-the-contrary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> on the matter, Nintendo says that isn’t the case.</p>







<p>“We have confirmed with Mario Club Co., Ltd. that the rumoured information in the report is untrue,” the company said. </p>



<p>Mario Club Co., Ltd. is a debugging subsidiary in Japan. The company is known for providing quality control for Nintendo while also testing and debugging Nintendo first-party software.</p>



<p>In 2024, there have been <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 14,000 known jobs lost</a> to layoffs in the gaming industry. Most recently, Sony announced that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down Firewalk Studios and Neon Koi</a> in a move that will see up to 210 people lose their jobs.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-happened-to-case-in-black-ops-6.1023135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-case-in-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 you the reigns to various characters throughout the Campaign. However, one character stands out above the rest—Case. We’re here to give you a rundown of what happened to Case, and clear up any confusion.</p>



<p>Many Call of Duty games have taken the liberty of making multiple, integral characters playable through the Campaign. I still remember switching between CoD 4’s Sgt. Paul Jackson and the legendary Sergeant ‘Soap’ McTavish, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> doesn’t quite reach this extent, one mission moves you around a lot.</p>



<p>Case is our main character for the majority of BLOPS 6 though, and his story unfolds shockingly throughout the main story missions. Once you’re done with distractions such as solving the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-safe-code-and-complete-every-safehouse-puzzle-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Safehouse Puzzles</a>, you eventually come to the end of the Campaign, and the resolution is a subjective one.</p>



<p><strong>*Spoiler Warning: The end of Black Ops 6 is about to be discussed, so be warned.*</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-does-case-die-in-black-ops-6">Does Case Die in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The end moments are chaotic. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve done some digging, and no one seems to know for sure if Case really did die at the climax of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign—nor has Activision, Treyarch, or Raven Software confirmed this.</p>



<p>I know this isn’t the answer you hoped for, but it does mean if you like Case, and want more of his involvement, I reckon there’s a good chance he’s still alive and kicking. To recap, the conclusion of Black Ops 6 sees Pantheon forces invade the Rook in a bid to wipe out the team and rescue the good-turned-bad Harrow.</p>



<p>Case thwarts Harrow’s escape effort, resulting in the helicopter crashing into the water near the Rook safehouse. With water slowly consumingthe vehicle, Case and Harrow fight. After a sample of The Cradle breaks and infects Case, our hero kills Harrow, and the water and surrounding environment seems to get the better of Case—as the screen fades to black.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-case-alive-in-black-ops-6">Is Case alive in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>This isn’t official, but <strong>I believe Case is still somehow alive in Black Ops 6</strong>—I could be proven wrong though.</p>



<p>I can’t think of many instances in CoD games where a major death isn’t given some kind of on-screen attention or an off-screen mention. We either see the character in question die, or their death is mentioned in a post-credits cutscene, or in a commemoration to the individual’s life and legacy.</p>



<p>Black Ops Cold War carried on its story through seasonal multiplayer content; so I think we either see Case return at some point in the next year, or he could end up being the main villain in the next Black Ops installment. If it happens, you owe me a Pepsi Max.</p>
