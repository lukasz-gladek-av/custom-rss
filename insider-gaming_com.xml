<p>The brightest star in CS2 right now, Team Spirit rifler Danil “donk” Kryshkovets, is already dominating pro play in 2025 after a breakout year. Fresh off a Major win and a sweep at the biggest Counter-Strike awards show, donk is already off to a blistering start this year.</p>



<p>Is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best CS2 player in the world</a> going to dominate the year again? It’s certainly looking that way.</p>

<h2 id="h-donk-dominates-fnatic-in-spirit-s-first-cs2-match-of-2025">Donk Dominates Fnatic in Spirit’s First CS2 Match of 2025</h2>



<p>The 2025 competitive CS2 calendar begins with the BLAST Spring Bounty event this year. Lower-seeded teams are gifted the opportunity to pick their higher ranked opponents, and can claim a higher bounty award if they manage to defeat them.</p>



<p>Fnatic, once a famed dynasty in Counter-Strike, earned the “honor” of taking on the reigning Major champions for a $60,000 bounty. But donk and company were not interested in lining Fnatic’s pockets.</p>







<p>The series began on Train for the first time in tier one competitive CS2. Donk started hot on Train, producing a ton of impact for his team and winning 80 percent of his opening duels. On Nuke, Spirit’s pick, donk dominated again like he did in Shanghai, dropping 19 kills and only giving up nine deaths. Spirit rolled over Fnatic 13-4 on Nuke, quickly eliminating them from the single-elimination qualifier.</p>



<p>It’s a fitting start for a player that closed out the year by definitively proving that he is the best player in CS2 right now. Donk put on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">historic, record-breaking performance</a> at Perfect World Shanghai, claiming MVP honors with ease. At the HLTV Awards, he swept all four categories he was nominated in. He <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40752/all-the-winners-of-the-hltv-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won the awards</a> for Rookie of the Year, Opener of the Year, Highlight of the Year, and the illustrious Player of the Year.</p>



<p>Is donk can back-to-back as Player of the Year and a Major winner? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
