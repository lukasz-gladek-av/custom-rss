<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. The February 10, 2026, Quordle has four new words for you to find, and this guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>

<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="block-44882c9d-d6a6-4e4f-9b1a-8312ae0b3036">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone and region, meaning the next game will start on February 11.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

<p>A reliable insider has revealed the headliner for PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for February 2026: none other than Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. </p>



<p>PlayStation Plus <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/february-free-playstation-plus-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free monthly titles</a> were revealed recently, and one big complaint was that there were no good titles in the collection. The headliner was Undisputed, featuring Subnautica: Below Zero, Ultros, and more. It seems that PlayStation will be making up for a big exclusive through Game Catalog. </p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-s-spider-man-2-coming-to-playstation-plus-game-catalog-on-february-17">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Coming to PlayStation Plus Game Catalog on February 17</h2>

The report reveals that Insomniac’s hit superhero title, along with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown and Neva, will be available through PS Plus on February 17. It is also likely that PlayStation will announce the upcoming PS Plus games at the State of Play event this week; however, that hasn’t been confirmed. </p>



<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is the sequel to Insomniac’s acclaimed superhero action-adventure game. Released in 2023 for PlayStation 5, it also received a PC port in 2025. The game features both Peter Parker and Miles Morales as playable characters, as they face off against symbiote forces. </p>



<p>New York City has been expanded, and new gameplay features have been introduced to allow players to navigate the city more quickly. Additionally, players will encounter original interpretations of iconic villains from the series, including Venom, Kraven, Lizard, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first game in the next season of Supermassive Games’ Dark Pictures anthology is now available for pre-order.</p>



<p>As revealed in a new trailer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/directive-8020/" id="90789">Directive 8020</a> will release on May 12, and players can now pre-order it for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. The game was originally scheduled for early October 2025; however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/supermassive-games/" id="1159">Supermassive </a>announced layoffs in July 2025, which pushed the release to 2026.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-directive-8020">What to Expect From Directive 8020</h2>



<p>Directive 8020 is a Sci-Fi survival horror game where the Earth is dying, and a crew travels to a new planet that can hopefully be the next home for Humanity. However, the planet is home to an alien organism that can take the form of any crew member, setting the stage for a tense experience.</p>



<p>Lashana Lynch, known for her work in The Woman King, stars in the title, where choices matter and will affect the outcome of the main campaign.</p>



<p>This is the first non-VR Dark Pictures Anthology game since 2022’s The Devil in Me. The games were originally released annually, but the team ultimately decided they didn’t want to be tied to such a demanding schedule.</p>



<p>“We don’t want to be tied down to a game every six months or one every year or anything like that. This game’s big, and we want it to be treated as such,” Will Doyle, creative director of Directive 8020, told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer </a>back in 2024 about the upcoming title.</p>
