<p>It was announced just yesterday the the next Xbox Games Showcase is set for June 8, and there’s one game that I’m keeping an eager eye open for. I’ve been waiting to hear something about the State of Decay 3 release date for the longest time, and this could finally be when we find out what’s going on.</p>



<p>Presently, the game doesn’t even have a <strong>release year</strong>. The running rumour is that State of Decay 3 will be released in 2026, but Undead Labs and Xbox Game Studios haven’t confirmed a thing.</p>

<h2 id="h-take-me-to-the-apocalypse">Take Me To The Apocalypse</h2>



<p>State of Decay 3 is long overdue, in my book. I’m a huge fan of the franchise and adore the sandbox elements of picking a home and building it up while fighting with a band of permadeath survivors to outlive a zombie apocalypse. It’s everything I want in an end-of-the-world, undead epic.</p>



<p>In September 2024, Undead Labs revealed it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-2-end-support-undead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending support on State of Decay 2</a> to focus entirely on the sequel, which means the team will have had almost a year to get the game in shape by the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2025.</p>



<p><strong>Last year</strong>, the Xbox Games Showcase played host to a phenomenal new State of Decay 3 trailer, which I and many other fans lapped up.</p>



<p>We don’t know much at all about State of Decay 3, bar the fact that it’s coming. The new trailer that was released almost a year ago revealed a few tidbits, but it’s nothing that we didn’t already expect from the game, such as fearsome undead enemies, vehicular combat, and multiplayer mechanics.</p>



<p>I’d do malicious things to get my hands on the State of Decay 3 release date – hopefully, something is shown at the upcoming Xbox Games Showcase. It has been almost seven years since the last State of Decay game was released.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a new State of Decay game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup is shaping up to return to Riyadh this summer, and it has just been confirmed that it’ll feature a monumental prize pool worth <strong>$70 million</strong>. This is a new all-time high for the esports industry, topping the record set by the Esports World Cup Foundation with last year’s $60 million prize pool.</p>



<p>It was stated by the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation, Ralf Reichert, that the team wanted to have ‘room for growth’, and the only way was well and truly <strong>up </strong>this year. This prize pool includes a staggering $7 million prize reserved for <strong>one organisation </strong>that tops the Club Championship.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-in">All In</h2>



<p>The Esports World Cup is, by sheer scope, the biggest competitive gaming event in human history. It features a full line-up of the most popular esports titles in the world, and it takes place over two-months in the heart of Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>It’s lavish, it’s opulent, and it’s designed to be the grandest spectacle the gaming world has ever seen.</p>



<p>Everything from the event’s opening ceremony to how trophies are awarded is bursting with pantomime and innovation. Last year’s event saw losing teams hand over their ‘piece’ of the trophy to the winning team to crush in a hydraulic press. That’s intense.</p>



<p>In a statement, the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation explained what represents the pinnacle of the event:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you look at the Esports World Cup, the Club Championship is what holds it together.</p>



<p>On the one hand it’s fantastic that we have all of these games and can bring them together at one point in time, which is unique, then the Club Championship is what makes it a story and wraps it together. We don’t consider it as a side element but at the very heart and centre of the Esports World Cup. Naturally, this should have the highest prize money.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full list of games appearing at the Esports World Cup in 2025 is nothing short of incredible. From Tekken 8 to Call of Duty and from Rocket League to League of Legends, there’s a spot and a show for everyone. Even Chess is set to appear, as is Rainbow Six Siege X and Rennsport.</p>



<p>It’s a veritable feast of competitive gaming action, and you can follow it all here at Insider Gaming.</p>
