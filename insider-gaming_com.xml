            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale devs are working on two significant social features to add to the game, with proximity chat and the potential of ‘portals’ in single-player that allow friends to join your game without having to tweak settings.</p>



<p>News on Hytale continues to come thick and fast following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founders reacquiring the title from Riot Games</a>, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-price-revealed-ahead-of-early-access-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing revealed last week</a> and details on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access release date</a> arriving in the coming days.</p>



<p>The early access launch will be a major step for the future of Hytale, but there is still a lot to come, and two major features have been revealed.</p>

<figure><figcaption>More to come. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an in-depth interview with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcmNb40D6Vg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ElRichMC</a>, Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme answered a range of questions about the development of Hytale and plans for the future, alongside taking the opportunity to reveal two components that are in the works.</p>



<p>One of those is support for multiplayer in single-player worlds, allowing players to have drop-in, drop-out gameplay with friends, but, in a bid to make it more immersive, the current plan is for an item that needs to be built to access the feature.</p>



<p>“I want the game to be more social, so I was thinking, what if, to invite your friends, you have to make a portal? And when you leave the game, they go out from that portal, to make it more immersive,” Collins-Laflamme said.</p>



<p>While this may seem like a simple feature, it’s added that “some other popular games don’t have it,” and the crucial aspect is the ability to “invite your friend with no need to change your firewall settings.”</p>



<p>Another feature that goes hand-in-hand with the planned multiplayer functionality is proximity chat, which is confirmed to be in the works, but Collins-Laflamme admitted he’s “not sure” whether the feature will be available at the early access launch.</p>



<p>Voice chat is “very important” for Hytale, opening the doors for plenty of other experiences to be built, particularly given the expansive modding support the game will have.</p>

<p>Fortnite’s Sidekicks feature looks set to receive a huge flock of collabs, according to leakers, as a major agreement with Paramount is said to have been reached.</p>



<p>The Sidekicks feature was added earlier this month, featuring customizable pets, visible only to you and players in your party, in specific modes, and additional Sidekicks are expected to be added regularly.</p>



<p>A first collab Sidekick has been added in The Simpsons season, with Scratchy coming in the Itchy &amp; Scratchy bundle, and other animated stars are on the horizon.</p>







<h2 id="h-paramount-ips-coming-to-fortnite-as-sidekicks">Paramount IPs Coming to Fortnite as Sidekicks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Paramount</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable Fortnite leakers, <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1992656693499756589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">including SamLeakss</a>, Paramount IPs are coming to Fortnite as Sidekicks, which aligns with previous leaks indicating collabs with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob Squarepants</a>.</p>



<p>No specifics have been shared on what collabs to expect, but there is a lengthy list of potentials, with Paramount’s expansive list of IPs including the likes of SpongeBob, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers, and more.</p>



<p>Some of those franchises, including TMNT and Transformers, have already featured as collabs in the past, including with skins, but the new Sidekick feature opens the door for other characters, smaller in size, to feature.</p>



<p>One of the biggest franchises under the Paramount umbrella that would certainly fit the Sidekicks theme is Paw Patrol, though the show is geared to a younger audience and may therefore not be suited to featuring in Fortnite.</p>



<p>An agreement with Paramount opens the door for plenty of options, and time will tell exactly what will be added to the game, but it’s clear Epic Games has big fans to utilize Sidekicks in more collabs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a fresh report from NewZoo, it has been confirmed that ARC Raiders skyrocketed within just two days on the market, beating many of the world’s most capable and impactful games in October’s revenue charts. The data revealed that ARC Raiders secured the seventh spot in the charts in October, despite being released on October 30.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has proven to be one of the most transformative games ever released, taking over the extraction shooter genre and retaining an enormous player base almost a month after release.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-on-top-almost">ARC Raiders On Top (Almost)</h2>



<p>In an all-new October revenue report from NewZoo, it was documented that ARC Raiders hit the seventh spot in the charts despite being on the shelves for just two days in October.</p>



<p>It effortlessly walked over some of the biggest games in the business:</p>



<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>VALORANT</li>



<li>ROBLOX</li>



<li>World of Warcraft</li>



<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
</ul>



<p>The stunning achievement sat ARC Raiders behind the likes of NBA 2K26, Fortnite, Ghost of Yotei, and Battlefield 6, all of which is/were to be expected.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders continues to stun gamers worldwide, and everyone from diehard extraction shooter fans to those totally new to the concept is getting on board. Recently, a streamer-backed initiative saw some of the biggest creators in the space take part in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/">unofficial ‘war’</a> that pulled unprecedented audiences into some streamers’ chats.</p>



<p>There’s a hefty roadmap in store for ARC Raiders, and Embark Studios, the game’s stellar creator, has vowed to support the title for years to come. The next major update will be <strong>Cold Snap</strong>, coming in December 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/invincible-vs-data-mine-reveals-unannounced-controversial-character.1362466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a data mine from the Invincible VS Closed Alpha, a controversial character is set to join the roster. Furthermore, it seems the character may be the next one announced.</p>







<p>Based on the comic series and animated show, Invincible is a more bloody version of superheroes. Think <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-boys-operators-for-call-of-duty-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Boys</a>, but more on the mature and dramatic side. The Prime Video show has been going strong for three seasons, with the fourth coming in March 2026. Many game adaptations <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skybound-games-announces-new-invincible-universe-game-within-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been made</a>, but Invincible VS gives the fans what they’ve wanted: a good old-fashioned fighting game. </p>



<p>Announced earlier this year, the game, which comes from former Killer Instinct developers, looks to be the ultimate Invincible experience, down to the show’s all-star cast (like The Walking Dead’s Steven Yeun and Whiplash’s JK Simmons) returning. Now, it seems a new character has been prematurely revealed, and it’s one that comic book fans will be taken aback by.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The news comes from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p53a5b/invincible_vs_closed_alpha_test_accidentally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RIPMrMufasi</a>, who posted on /GamingLeaksandRumours about the Invincible VS Closed Alpha. The test, which started on November 21st, has been going fairly well. As was the case with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-demo-data-mine-heroes-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, it doesn’t stop fans from doing a data mine into the files and seeing if anything unannounced is in it. As expected, there was indeed something: <strong>a character available through a model swap bug</strong>, seen in the video <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/bada-bing-VLST6Nh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>



<p>According to the video from the Invincible VS data mine, <strong>the character looks to be Anissa</strong>. In the show, the Viltrumite warrior is played by Shantel VanSanten (One Tree Hill, The Boys). The character, seen as an antagonist in the show, is <strong>a rather controversial choice</strong>. While not adapted into the show yet, an inappropriate moment in the comics between her and Mark, the protagonist, has made many worried about her inclusion. </p>



<p>As of now, the character has not been confirmed by Skybound Games or Quarter Up, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. For fans of the show, the character is a welcome addition to the roster. However, to fans of the comics, it’s one that may stir up some controversy. Either way, if true, it won’t be long until it’s official.</p>







<p>What do you think of Anissa possibly being added to Invincible VS’ roster? Think it’s a controversial pick? Will it become a problem soon? Which Invincible character would you like to see in the game?

<p>Udo Kier has starred in well over 200 films, starting in 1966 on the TV show Road to Saint Tropez. His frequent collaborations with iconic artist Andy Warhol and the vampire film genre made him a familiar face for fans. In the 90s, Kier appeared in films like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Blade, and Johnny Mnemonic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s appeared in several video game adaptations like Far Cry and BloodRayne. However, he’s also shown up in games over the span of his career. Often military, Udo Kier played the role of Yuri in Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2 and Yuri’s Revenge. Furthermore, he played Dr. Peter Staub in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-wwii-available-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: WWII</a> and Erich in Martha is Dead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the actor’s future projects is OD, Hideo Kojima’s next big horror project for Kojima Productions. Unfortunately, it seems Udo Kier did not finish filming for the project, as Kojima <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1992785286712209409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted about his passing</a>, saying filming was set to start next Spring. The actor was announced alongside Hunter Schafer and Sophia Lillis at the 2023 Game Awards. A teaser for the Xbox Game Studios’ title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/od-gameplay-reveal-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a>. It’s unknown if the actor will be recast or scrapped from the project at this time.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to his family and his partner during this difficult time.</p>
