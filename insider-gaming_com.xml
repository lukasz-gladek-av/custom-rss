<p>Microsoft has unveiled Xbox Copilot for Gaming, a new tool aimed towards being a the “ultimate gaming sidekick” for players. </p>



<p>In an appearance on the official Xbox Podcast, Xbox Corporate Vice President of Gaming AI Fatima Kardar unveiled the AI-powered tool to the world. The announcement also included a detailed post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>



<p>“This AI-driven sidekick is designed to be your personalized gaming companion, helping you get to your favorite games faster, coaching you to improve your skills, and connecting you better with your friends and communities,” Jeff Rubenstein, director of Xbox editorial, said. “Copilot for Gaming will be there when you need it but out of the way if you don’t.”</p>



<p>During the podcast, an concept example of how the new tool could work was shown using Minecraft.  In the game a player picked up wood and entered a prompt asking “Okay, I’ve got some wood. What do I do with that?” Copilot for Gaming answered by explaining how to turn the gathered oak logs into wooden planks.</p>



<p>Another example shown involved Overwatch. A player asks the tool for help on who to pick after the hero they wanted, Echo, was already selected.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“Echo’s taken, but Cassidy would be a solid pick with this team,” Copilot says. “His mid-range hit scan and Mercy’s damage boost will work great on Ilios Ruins. Plus you’ve done great with him on this map before.” </p>



<p>After the player dies during the game, Copilot explains that it happened because they stayed in the fight for too long and suggested to regroup with their team the next time they are in a similar situation.</p>



<p>The tool will even let you pull up situation-specific advice for the game and moment you are in, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>Everything shown during the podcast were proof of concepts and not actual gameplay uses. As far as a release date, Copilot for Gaming will start in a slow rollout on mobile devices for members of the Xbox Insider Program “soon”. A release on other devices and then to the general public will happen “gradually”.</p>

<p>The First Berserker Khazan looks as beastly as the creatures that inhabit the game. But it could be bad news for Khazan’s PC specs and various system requirements. Let’s take a look and see if it’s as powerful as it looks.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t be a year in gaming without one or two AAA titles fighting for the Soulslike crown. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is looking to challenge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> in 2025. The latter is established, but Khazan looks promising. Featuring a story of revenge and retribution, The First Berserker Khazan has a clear-cut and combat-heavy tale to tell.</p>



<p>It’s a huge step forward for developer Neople, and I’m here to reveal whether Khazan’s system requirements will trouble your hardware.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-minimum-requirements-on-pc">The First Berserker Khazan Minimum Requirements on PC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>With great power comes great specs and requirements. Credit to NEXON</figcaption></figure>



<p>The minimum PC specs are probably what you need to consider if you crave more souslike action and don’t care how it looks. It also goes without saying this only applies to PC players. You need to remember Khazan’s trailer and gameplay footage has likely been rendered with the highest-possible settings.</p>



<p><a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a> may not look as pretty using minimum PC requirements, but it’s better than nothing. Here’s every minimum spec and what you need to be able to play it.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Minimum PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 64bit 22H2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 3 1200 / Intel Core i3-6300</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">Arc A580 / GeForce GTX 970 / Radeon RX 580</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">12 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">70 GB</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-recommended-requirements-on-pc">The First Berserker Khazan Recommended Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>The minimum settings are quite generous. I think most (if not all) players should have no problem running The First Berserker Khazan. They should also be able to make it pop—even with inferior gear. But if you have an impressive rig running a lot of juice, you’re probably here for the recommended specs.</p>



<p>Here’s each setting and what it would be handy to have to ensure Khazan is smoother than a hot knife through butter.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Recommended PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Recommended Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 11 21H2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 5 3600 / Intel Core i7-6700K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">Arc A750 / GeForce RTX 2070 / Radeon RX 5700XT</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">70 GB</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Developer Strange Scaffold has announced the release date for its latest game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT): Tactical Takedown.

<p>Created by the studio behind games like El Paso, Elsewhere and I Am Your Beast, TMNT: Tactical Takedown is a turn-based game that follows what happens after both Splinter and Shredder die.</p>



<p>“Reimagining the franchise with a bold new vision,&nbsp;Tactical Takedown&nbsp;blends turn-based strategy with fast-paced beat-em-up action,” the game’s description reads. “With Splinter and Shredder dead, and the Turtles on the cusp of adulthood, players fight through 20 mutating levels, battling iconic foes like the Foot Clan in this coming-of-age story.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-skate-microtransactions-range-from-%E2%82%AC5-%E2%82%AC99-in-closed-alpha.1133439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-skate-microtransactions-range-from-e5-e99-in-closed-alpha/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Tuesday night, Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the first to report</a> of microtransactions being added to the closed alpha playtest of EA Skate. Now, just a couple days later, we have an idea at what EA is charging for their San Van Bucks (SVB) within the game.</p>



<p>Thanks to a Reddit user by the name of <a href="https://postimg.cc/gallery/CkGNDr3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sm1one_out_there</a>, it appears that EA is charging users a range of €5-€99—the prices shared are in Euros, but the conversion for microtransactions is usually similar to USD, so expect $5-$99—for the in-game currency. </p>



<p>At €5, you get 500 SVB. At €9.99, that jumps to 1050 SVB including a 5% boost in the amount you receive. The rest of the options are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>€24.99 – 3,000 SVB</li>



<li>€49.99 – 6,250 SVB</li>



<li>€99.99 – 13,000 SVB</li>
</ul>



<p>Based on other images shown, as well as previously announced plans by EA, all of the microtransaction purchases go towards in-game cosmetics. There are no pay-to-win mechanics coming to EA Skate.</p>



<p>An example of item costs include 200 SVB for socks, 300 SVB for board art, and 400 SVB for a tank top.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that the microtransactions are currently only being added to PC and PlayStation players during the playtest. EA and Full Circle will also cease giving players “random grants of SVB” that it had been doing in prior playtests. </p>



<p>They also reaffirmed that “any SVB purchased will be credited back at Early Access launch” provided you are using the same EA account for both playtests and Early Access. Lastly, it was confirmed that items acquired during the playtest will also be reset at Early Access launch, but not during the playtest itself.</p>
