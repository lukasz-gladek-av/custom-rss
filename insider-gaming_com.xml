<p>Xbox Game Pass members will have to pay almost the price of a standard edition for Forza Horizon 6’s 4-day early access. </p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct finally gave fans what they were asking for: a release date and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-forza-horizon-6-gameplay-footage-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay deep dive</a> for the highly anticipated racing title, Forza Horizon 6. Along with that, we also received details on the pricing and editions for the upcoming title, and it seems Game Pass players will have to put forth some extra cash for early access, more than the usual price. </p>



<h2 id="h-game-pass-members-have-to-pay-almost-the-price-of-a-standard-edition-to-get-forza-horizon-6-early-access">Game Pass Members Have to Pay Almost the Price of a Standard Edition to Get Forza Horizon 6 Early Access</h2>



<p>So, Forza Horizon 6 is available for free for Game Pass Ultimate and PC members; however, that only includes the Standard Edition. To get the 4-day early access, players will need to grab the Premium Edition, priced at $119.99/£109.99 GBP/€119.99 EUR. Game Pass members can get their hands on the Premium Edition by purchasing an <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/forza-horizon-6#purchaseoptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upgrade</a> worth $59.99, and that’s where the problem lies. </p>



<p>Players on social media have been calling out the increase in the price of the Forza Horizon 6 Premium Edition upgrade for Game Pass members. For the previous title, FH5, players would only need to pay $50; however, that has now been increased to $60, which is almost the price of a standard edition, $69.99. In the UK, the price for this upgrade is £59.99, the same as the standard edition costs in the region. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those wondering about the Forza Horizon 6 deluxe edition, that has been priced at $99.99/£89.99 GBP/€99.99 EUR. </p>

<p>Highguard is looking to claim the FPS crown in 2026 and is trying to do so under a cloak of absolute secrecy. Details about Highguard are few and far between, but release time info is available, and the release date is locked in.</p>



<p>So far, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> looks like a mix of first-person shooters rolled into one. It has Hero Shooter elements, you can ride huge beasts, there’s a free-flowing speed and nimbleness to traversal: It seems to do it all. People have been wondering when Highguard is coming out and what time you can start playing it, so let’s try to clear some of this up.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-time-does-highguard-release">What Time Does Highguard Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fire away. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to Steam, it will be a universal 6 PM UTC launch for Highguard.</strong></p>



<p>This could easily be subject to change, so take the information with a trusty pinch of salt. If you look at the SteamDB page for Highguard (It might have changed by the time you read this), it clearly says: “<strong>18:00:00 UTC.</strong>“</p>



<p>Given how little we know about Highguard and the lack of promotion, some people are doubting it’ll even release when it claims—let alone hit a specific launch time outed by Steam. Does Steam even know?</p>



<p>Keep checking back, as this information has huge potential to turn around. Or, we can all see what the fuss is all about come 6 PM UTC on release day.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-release-date-confirmed">Highguard Release Date, Confirmed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stop the presses. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wildgate’s Highguard is slated for a January 26 release date.</strong></p>



<p>Whether it does or doesn’t happen is anyone’s guess. It’s one of the most bizarre games and releases in recent memory. Everyone may end up looking back on the confusion as a stroke of brilliance, or wondering how Highguard was ever going to work.</p>



<p>It could be telling that the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-trophy-list-has-revealed-more-details-than-the-devs-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard Trophy List revealed more details than the devs did</a>. Check your PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam stores on January 26 at 6 PM UTC to see if the Highguard prophecy actually came true.</p>



<p>There’s been an extraordinary amount of criticism and backlash for a game everyone pretty much knows nothing about.

<p>It seems Michael and Dwight will receive new skins in the Fortnite x The Office collaboration. </p>



<p>Fortnite has seemingly been brewing a lot of big collaborations for the coming seasons, with names like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festivals-next-major-collab-may-have-been-found/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pink Pony Club</a>, and so many more being thrown out. However, one collab that everybody has been eagerly waiting to hear more about is the Fortnite x The Office collab, and now more details have been revealed. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-the-office-will-introduce-michael-and-dwight-skins">Fortnite x  The Office Will Introduce Michael and Dwight Skins</h2>



<p>A reliable Fortnite insider, Hypex has revealed which skins will be introduced for The Office collaboration. The first skin will be of Michael Scott (portrayed by Steve Carell), the Regional Manager of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin. The other skin is of Dwight Schrute (played by Rainn Wilson), who is the Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. Both of these characters are easily the most popular in the show and have the best chemistry. </p>



<p>Additionally, the collaboration will include several edit styles for both skins, two emotes, tissue boxes as kicks, and much more. Interested readers can check out the full Fortnite x The Office collab showcase in the YouTube video embedded below. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Fortnite x Office collaborations seem to have been in the works for quite some time, as we heard about them a long time ago. Fortnite itself had teased the collaboration a couple of days ago with an <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2013733381436236001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">image of a beet</a> and the caption “Build.

<p>The official Forza Horizon 6 reveal was incredible. It showcased everything Playground Games has been working on for the Japanese-inspired sequel, and if you’re already revving up your car in excitement, it’s time to fill you in on Forza Horizon 6’s Xbox Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Is it safe to say that Forza Horizon 6 is the biggest racing game of 2026? It will take a lot to top it, and with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-forza-horizon-6-gameplay-footage-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay footage revealed</a> so far, it’s hard to argue. Playing it is a must, and with the confusion surrounding Xbox Game Pass in recent times, it’s brought FH6 into the spotlight.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-forza-horizon-6-releasing-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Forza Horizon 6 Releasing On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A speedy success beckons. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 will officially launch as a day-one Xbox Game Pass offering, meaning you’ll get it for free if you have the correct subscription.</strong></p>



<p>The whole Game Pass price increase controversy in 2025 raised big questions about future launches. These doubts have been dispelled about Forza Horizon 6, though, and you only have to look to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox</a> itself for the answer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Arriving for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, Steam, and day one with Game Pass Ultimate. Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Game Pass is more expensive now, but you’ll still be able to have access to certain full-price AAA games. There are still good times and games on the horizon (pun intended).</p>







<h2 id="h-which-version-of-xbox-game-pass-is-needed-to-play-forza-horizon-6">Which Version Of Xbox Game Pass Is Needed To Play Forza Horizon 6?</h2>



<p><strong>You need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to play Forza Horizon 6 for free.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not free, technically, but you understand the concept. It’s better than paying $60, $70, or $80. This does mean you need the most expensive version of the Game Pass model, and here’s how to get it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724#join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox website</a>.</li>



<li>Press to Join Game Pass.</li>



<li>An option will appear with three tiers.</li>



<li>You need to click <strong>Select </strong>under the <strong>Ultimate </strong>tier.</li>



<li>Complete your subscription.</li>



<li>Once Forza Horizon 6 debuts, you can download it and play it as part of XGP Ultimate.</li>
</ol>



<p>Knowing that Forza Horizon 6 is coming to Game Pass should make a lot of people happy. If you are a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, look forward to entering the new world of Horizon. Also, head to the Insider Gaming Discord Server and leave a message to say if FH6 is enough to get you to sign up with Game Pass. Conversely, pop a message down to say why it <em>isn’t </em>enough, if it’s the case.</p>

<p>Make sure you know about all <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-ps5-all-consoles-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6 consoles and platforms</a> ahead of launch, and if you’re unsure, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-setting-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which location Forza Horizon 6 is taking the series this time around.</a></p>

<p>A new Nintendo Direct for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has been announced for next week.</p>



<p>First revealed through the <a href="https://www.nintendo.today/en-US/contents/04020be1-e2e8-49eb-8282-a99fb58f27c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Today</a> app, this upcoming direct will take place at 9am ET/6am PT on Sunday, January 25.</p>







<p>It’s the second-straight Nintendo Direct event to specifically be about the movie. The last one took place on November 12, 2025, and gave fans a first look at the new trailer along with introducing Bowser Jr. and Rosalina to the film. </p>



<p>The next Direct is likely to give a new trailer, the reveal of new characters, and, possibly, the stars who voice them. There are rumors and leaks suggesting Yoshi will also be in the movie, but the green dinosaur has yet to be seen on camera.</p>



<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is the sequel to 2023’s Super Mario Bros. Movie. It’s currently scheduled to release in theaters on April 3, 2026. That’s almost three years to the day of the original movie’s release.</p>
