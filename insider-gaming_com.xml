<p>China is on the rise in the gaming sphere with a host of top-notch releases catching the eye, and Where Winds Meet is a further feather in the cap for the rising giants in the industry.</p>



<p>The Everstone Studios title, backed by the might of NetEase Games, achieved significant success in its homeland, where it launched in December 2024, and the global release shows every sign of following in those steps after smashing through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-hits-10m-pre-registrations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million mark for pre-registrations</a>.</p>



<p>Having dived into the game during a limited-time review period, I’m delighted to report that Where Winds Meet is a shining example of what free-to-play titles can be.</p>







<h2 id="h-a-world-of-possibilities">A World of Possibilities</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beautiful world. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first thing that will catch your eye in Where Winds Meet is the size of the game, both in terms of the download space required and the sprawling map that is there to explore. </p>



<p>I was initially sceptical of the developer’s claim that there is over 100 hours of single-player content to explore but though my limited time in the game did not allow me to get into triple-figures for playtime, it was more than enough to confirm that those declarations are entirely accurate.</p>



<p>You can barely walk a few meters in Where Winds Meet without uncovering something new to do, whether it’s a new side quest, a random event that appears, a puzzle to solve, or enemies to fight. And, while the combat wasn’t groundbreaking, I found it refreshing to be able to pick up and play, and there was plenty of options to customize the settings further to make it easier, or harder, if I wanted.</p>



<p>For a world so large, it’s impressive that I did not encounter a single area that felt barren and lacking, as there was more than enough to do, and I didn’t even touch the multiplayer aspects of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-just-one-more-fight">Just One More Fight…</h2>



<p>The biggest obstacle I faced in the game was deciding where I wanted to focus my energy. I’m a completionist and want to uncover all the secrets a game has to offer, but I may have met my match in Where Winds Meet, as 100% completion seems impossible.</p>



<p>I constantly found myself distracted by something, whether it was a puzzle to solve or a bear to fight, and couldn’t say no to the optional quests that appeared. Whenever I told myself it was time to log off, I encountered something else I wanted to do, and the process repeated again and again.</p>



<p>While I played the game as a solo player, there was still some interaction with other players, often in humorous ways. In Where Winds Meet, you can place signposts that appear for other players, which some used to provide hints for puzzles, while others encouraged you to do nefarious acts—like using the new ability you just learnt to throw an innocent old man into a river.</p>



<p>Those small moments provided further evidence of just how big Where Winds Meet can be, which will be expanded significantly when </p>







<h2 id="h-a-fine-example-of-f2p-s-strengths">A Fine Example of F2P’s Strengths</h2>



<p>Throughout my time with Where Winds Meet, there was one thought I couldn’t get out of my head: the utter disbelief that the game is available as a free-to-play title.</p>



<p>There are plenty of microtransactions available for those who want to splash out, but, from what I could see, the options were merely cosmetic, providing no in-game benefit, or time-savers that provide a chunk of currency to spend on items, enhancements, and similar.</p>



<p>With hundreds of hours of content, a sprawling open-world to explore, and plenty to do in single-player and multiplayer, both co-operatively and in PvP, Where Winds Meet could have released as a fully-priced game and would have been more than decent value for money.</p>



<p>The fact that you can enjoy it all without having to spend a dime is staggering, and can serve as an eye-opener in the industry when prices for AAA titles continue to rise.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-great">Verdict: 4/5 – Great</h2>
