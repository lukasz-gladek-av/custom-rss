<p>PlayStation has just confirmed that players will receive a new look at Saros at The Game Awards 2025 on December 11. </p>



<p>Saros is the next sci-fi shooter from the hands of Housemarque, the team responsible for bringing us games like Returnal, Nex Machina, Matterfall, and more. They provided players with a look at the title’s gameplay during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September’s State of Play event</a> and have now confirmed a new look at the title for TGA. </p>







<h2 id="h-saros-pre-order-announcement-expected-at-the-game-awards">Saros Pre-Order Announcement Expected at The Game Awards</h2>



<p>PlayStation confirmed Saros’s presence at The Game Awards 2025 through a new post on their <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1998407291754729536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post says that players will receive a “new look” for the title, but doesn’t explain what that means. We could receive a new gameplay trailer or a trailer focusing on the narrative bit as well. Some players are also speculating that pre-orders will open that day, as the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-has-been-rated-in-taiwan-pre-orders-expected-imminently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated in Taiwan</a> recently. </p>



<p>Saros is an entirely new IP from Housemarqye which focuses on a “haunting story of a lost off-world colony on Carcosa under an ominous eclipse.” The key difference between Saros and Returnal gameplay is the presence of permanent resources and progression, which makes every death valuable. Which means that even though the world will change after each death, players can come back stronger with the ability to choose and permanently upgrade their loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit parts.</p>







<p>In other news, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider title</a> will be revealed at The Game Awards, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> will appear at the event as well.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-appears/</link>
            <guid>1377166</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long-awaited Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake might have just gotten one step closer to being released, as the PEGI ratings board has published a new listing that talks about ‘Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced’.</p>



<p>There’s no fresh information on the listing, which says that the game will have ‘violence, bad language, and in-game purchases’, but this is deeper validation that it’s preparing to be revealed by Ubisoft after all these years.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-flag-remake-seems-to-be-called-resynced">Black Flag Remake Seems To Be Called ‘Resynced’</h2>



<p>For those not in the know about Assassin’s Creed, the game is all about ‘synchronization’. Players explore vast open maps and slowly learn the lay of the land, becoming adjusted to their ancestors’ memories and ‘synchronizing’ with events that occurred hundreds of years before.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s appropriate for the Black Flag remake to be called Resynced.</p>



<p>The listing on the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=assassin%27s+creed&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-i0li0NzwBJhdRBDPCsKjBAyuSVn5_-ycuy9Fg1XUMz0&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PEGI website</a> doesn’t give much away:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/">Insider Gaming exclusive report</a> published just a few weeks ago, we confirmed that the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake is set to be released before March 31, 2026.</p>



<p>In September, it was claimed that the Black Flag remake would be ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-new-details-claim/">more RPG-heavy</a>‘, with Ubisoft’s teams aligning the game more closely with the broader, more ambitious titles that have been released in recent years, like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Origins</li>



<li>Odyssey</li>



<li>Valhalla</li>



<li>Shadows</li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this year, drama sparked when Matt Ryan, the voice of Edward Kenway in Assassin’s Creed Black Flag, revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/">he faced legal action</a> when he insinuated at a convention that the Black Flag remake was happening.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remakes-buster-sword-almost-had-a-more-realistic-version/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has revealed how Cloud’s iconic Buster Sword almost received a more realistic version. </p>



<p>The Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director, Naoki Hamaguchi, has revealed quite a few details about Part 3 in recent days. He revealed that the game experience is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>” and has narrowed the title down to two options. Now he has provided a small tidbit on the questions they pondered while creating the Buster Sword for FF7 Remake. </p>







<h2 id="h-buster-sword-was-just-a-regular-sword-players-wouldn-t-accept-it">Buster Sword Was Just a Regular Sword “Players Wouldn’t Accept It”</h2>



<p>During an interview with Julien Chièze on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKxyZ5DsgSs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/square-enix-director-naoki-hamaguchi-considered-giving-cloud-strife-a-more-realistic-sword-for-final-fantasy-7-remake-but-decided-jrpg-fans-wouldnt-accept-it-we-stayed-faithful-to-the-og/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Naoki Hamaguchi spoke about Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s Buster Sword. For those unaware, the Buster Sword is an iconic weapon wielded by Cloud Strife, known for its massive size. The director revealed that during the development process, there were discussions about the “aspect of the weight” and how Cloud swinging an enormous sword with one hand would “weaken the sense of realism”. </p>



<p>So at the time, the development team considered creating a “more realistic version of the Buster Sword” for Cloud to wield in Final Fantasy 7’s Remake. However, they decided against it as “it was just too iconic, and if we’d made it just a regular old sword, players wouldn’t accept it.” Hamaguchi concluded, stating that “stayed faithful to the OG” in the end and “a whole new generation of people fell in love with it, so I think it was the right call.”</p>

<p>A new report by Capcom reveals that they will bring new releases and remakes of Devil May Cry, Mega Man, and Ace Attorney to new hardware. </p>



<p>Capcom has some massive franchises under its belt, which include Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Street Fighter. However, they also have smaller franchises, which have a considerable user base. Capcom has stated that it will work to bring more projects for these franchises as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-devil-may-cry-ace-attorney-and-mega-man-to-receive-new-projects-remakes-and-ports">Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, and Mega Man to Receive New Projects, Remakes, and Ports</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/2025/12/capcom-moves-to-revitalize-mega-man-ace.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockman Corner</a>, Capcom has released its <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2025/annual_2025_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2025 integrated report</a>, in which COO Haruhiro Tsujimoto has spoken about developing new projects, remakes, and ports for its other IPs. The statement first talks about Capcom aiming to sustain their “KPI of 10% or better annual operating profit growth along with our long-term goal of annual software sales of 100 million units.” Their efforts are “focused on core IP such as the Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Street Fighter franchises, and mapping out mainline series entries and sequels, remakes, new IP, and ports of content to the latest hardware.” </p>



<p>The statement adds that the developers release “two or three major new titles each year,” but have recognised they need to grow their pipeline. Capcom owns popular IPs such as Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, and Mega Man, and their goal is to expand the user base and improve performance “through new releases, remakes, and ports of titles in these series to new hardware.” They will grow these franchises into core IPs “by enhancing the brand power and cultivating loyal fan bases.”</p>







<p>In other news, Capcom stated that Resident Evil Requiem’s development started <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-says-resident-evil-requiem-development-started-way-before-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“way before” RE Village</a>. Additionally, a former Capcom designer recently stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-crossed-a-line-says-former-capcom-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld “crossed a line”</a>.

<p>Jeffrey Dean Morgan wants to play Arthur Morgan in a Red Dead Redemption adaptation.</p>



<p>During a recent appearance at a convention, the The Walking Dead star took part in a fan Q&amp;A session. As part of that session, one fan as him if he’d be at all interested in playing the main protagonist from Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>







<p><strong>“That’s the one that I want to do,” </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/__GLLVjR2O0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he&nbsp;told the fan</a>. <strong>“It’s not even a question. One, the only genre… My favorite genre is western and there’s not even a close second. And my son plays that game and it’s freaking awesome. In a heartbeat, I would do it for free.”</strong></p>



<p>Though he’s mainly known for film and television roles, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is no stranger to lending his voice to video games. Back in 2019, he voiced a virtual version of his The Walking Dead character Negan for Tekken 7 DLC. </p>
