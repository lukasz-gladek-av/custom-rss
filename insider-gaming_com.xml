<p>ARC Raider developers have confirmed that player behaviour is analysed while matchmaking. </p>



<p><span>Embark Studios’ latest&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/" target="_blank">extraction adventure</a>, ARC Raiders, has been on a great run lately.</span> Not only is it one of the most popular titles of 2025, but it also won best multiplayer game of the year at The Game Awards 2025. What’s more, the title’s new update, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-flickering-flames-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cold Snap</a>, is live now. Ahead of the update, the developers gave players a hint about ARC Raiders matchmaking. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-confirm-player-behaviour-is-analysed-for-matchmaking">ARC Raiders Devs Confirm Player Behaviour is Analysed for Matchmaking</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-interview-embark-talks-behavior-based-matchmaking-map-updates-and-playing-nice-with-strangers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, ARC Raiders art director Robert Sammelin confirmed that player behaviour is factored in while matchmaking in ARC Raiders. Sammelin stated, “Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We do analyze behavior and match accordingly.” When asked if he could elaborate on this, the art director said “no” jokingly, keeping players in the dark about how it is factored in during matchmaking. </p>



<p>There was a prevailing theory in the ARC Raiders community that players with nicer behaviour would be matched with others with similar gameplay styles, while more aggressive players would be forced to play together. The developers have now confirmed that this could indeed be the case; however, we do not know what else is factored into matchmaking. </p>

Additionally, the developers recently asked the community for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-map-design-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical feedback on the game’s map pool</a>, asking them to drive the game forward.

<p>Crystal Dynamics has revealed that Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will receive a difficulty adjustment for modern players, and players might remember the original version as extremely difficult. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 was a great day for the original Tomb Raider fans, as Legacy of Atlantis was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced for 2026</a>. It is a complete remake of the original game, built from the ground up. Now, the developer has revealed that the remake might not be as brutal as the original title. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-to-receive-a-difficulty-adjustment">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis to Receive a Difficulty Adjustment</h2>



<p>During a presentation attended by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leads-say-its-essential-to-adjust-the-ps1-originals-difficulty-for-modern-player-tastes-but-things-that-you-expect-in-a-tomb-raider-game-are-going-to-be-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked how they would be targeting the difficulty of Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, given all the insta-death situations and other problems players faced in the original title. Kerslake replied, stating that “part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes.”</p>



<p>However, that doesn’t mean the core Tomb Raider experience will change, as “there are puzzles in combat and traversal and death-defying action.” Also, players will also “see big rolling balls, and you know, the things that you expect in a Tomb Raider game are going to be there in spades,” added Kerslake. </p>



<p>The Anniversary edition of Tomb Raider also had a workaround for the original’s difficulty, adding quick-time events to get through the insta-kill situations. </p>
