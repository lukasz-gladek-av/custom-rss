<p>The topic of Marvel Rivals and leaked characters is unlikely to ever go away. While the community rightly lauds the current crop of heroes, everyone is keeping an eye on the next superhero to grace our screens. So, we’ve taken a trip to the rumor mill, and unearthed every bit of gossip pertaining to new Marvel Rivals heroes.</p>



<p>Heroes were the big selling point of the Marvel Rivals launch. While Marvel is blessed with a cornucopia of iconic characters, the initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-character-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hero list</a> could have impacted Marvel Rivals in different ways. Thankfully, players seem to be enjoying the content, and this is evident with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million players in Rivals’ first three days</a>.</p>



<p>You can’t sit around and bask in your success in the live-service market though. Times move quickly, attention spans shrink, and you need new content in the pipeline. This is where Marvel Rivals leaked characters are a big selling point of the shooters’ future, and any info is helpful.</p>

<p>So far, <strong>12 new Marvel Rivals characters have leaked</strong>, and the speculated names span various Marvel franchises: <strong>Fantastic Four, The Avengers, Captain Marvel, and X-Men</strong>.</p>



<p>We’ve already discovered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultron and The Thing</a> are destined for Marvel Rivals, but this is a small mackerel of what’s allegedly to come. The leaks come courtesy of various X social media sources including <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals — Leaks</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Facio_Leaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Matfacio | Leaker of games</a>, <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miller Ross</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/FumoLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fumo Leaks</a>.</p>



<p>Here is every leaked Marvel Rivals character so far, and their attached Marvel franchise.</p>



<ul>
<li>Angela</li>



<li>Blade</li>



<li>Captain Marvel</li>



<li>Emma Frost</li>



<li>Hit-Monkey</li>



<li>Jean Grey AKA Phoenix</li>



<li>Johnny Storm  AKA Human Torch</li>



<li>Knull</li>



<li>Mister Fantastic</li>



<li>Susan Storm AKA Invisible Woman</li>



<li>The Thing</li>



<li>Ultron</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Knull</strong> was seen in the Season 0: Dooms’ Rise Official Trailer, so his debut is very likely. The rest of the rumored characters are all datamines and speculation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarvelRivals"></a>In addition to these potential heroes, I’ve also seen Daredevil discussed, but only in memes showing his gameplay to be nothing but a blank screen—if you know, you know. Otherwise, these 12 names are the common heroes outed by leakers, and datamines have revealed info about each including movesets and Team-Up abilities.</p>



<p>Interestingly, there’s still no mention of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Doom</a>—a hero we’ve discussed before in great detail. The villainous Victor was the heartbeat of the No One Rivals Doom trailer on Jul. 26, and also the Dooms’ Rise video. There’s still no confirmation of his arrival yet though, so we’ll keep our eyes peeled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-game-director-reveals-new-details-about-companions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Avowed’s Game Director, Carrie Patel, has disclosed details on how companions interact with the player in the upcoming game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-more-interactivity-and-reactivity">“More Interactivity and Reactivity”</h2>



<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/after-starfields-strict-companions-im-glad-avoweds-crew-wont-be-backseat-driving-and-second-guessing-all-your-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Carrie Patel discussed how they wanted to provide “a little more interactivity and reactivity” to companions “based on the events and conversations and quests that you’re encountering in the game.” Patel added that they wanted companions “to have a little bit more to say” about their journey together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patel then goes on to talk about how engaging with companions is a significant part of RPGs, but finding the ‘balance’ is also crucial. They didn’t want Avowed’s companions to “feel like someone is backseat driving and second-guessing all your choices.” Patel also compared Avowed’s companions to Starfield’s, stating that they won’t have as extreme reactions when you do something ‘evil’ but will provide some form of pushback.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-s-companions-will-have-opt-in-engagement">Avowed’s Companions Will Have Opt-In Engagement</h2>



<p>Patel then talks about the opt-in engagement players can experience with companions in Avowed. The developers have “written a lot of content for these characters for their engagement in the story with one another, with the player.” However, it’s up to the players whether they want to explore this content. For example, when they return to the party camp, players “might hear their companion say a thing or two”, but they decide whether to have the conversation and “get to know their companion a bit better.”</p>
