<p>Marvel Rivals has a brand new surprise for the players, arriving in the form of the first-ever PvE Zombies mode on October 23, 2025.</p>



<p>Season 5 of Marvel Rivals is scheduled to arrive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on November 14</a>, bringing Gambit and Rogue into the mix. Ahead of that, the developers have one last new update for players in season 4.5, bringing some PvE fun into the mix. The upcoming game mode is inspired by the animated series Marvel Zombies. </p>



<h2 id="h-slay-zombies-in-marvel-rivals-from-october-23">Slay Zombies in Marvel Rivals From October 23</h2>



<p>Through a new post on the official Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the executive producer at Marvel Games, Danny Koo, spoke more about the upcoming PvE Zombies mode. The new Marvel Zombies-inspired mode lets players embody one of 5 playable characters —Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff, or The Punisher —as they face off against endless hordes of zombies. Surviving is the goal until you can test your might against the two bosses, Zombie Namor and Queen of the Dead. </p>



<p>To take on this new threat, the developers have also granted each of the five heroes new abilities. Jeff can charge through the hordes, Blade can slice and dice through the bouncing Moon Blades, Thor gets a persistent Awakened State to shock more zombies, and Magik is getting an unlimited Darkchild form. The post also included a sneak peek of the Marvel Rivals PvE Zombies mode gameplay, featuring the 5-hero squad being ambushed by zombies from every angle, but still holding their ground. </p>

<p>Battlefield 6 is receiving a new update within the next week, which will address progression pace and XP Leveling. </p>



<p>The launch of Battlefield 6 has shaken the gaming industry, with the new title rivalling the likes of Call of Duty launches. The game sold 7 million copies in the first 3 days, making it the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest launch in series history</a>. However, there have been some minor issues at launch, such as progression and XP leveling, and fortunately, the developers are already addressing them in the next update. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-devs-acknowledge-progression-pace-issues">Battlefield 6 Devs Acknowledge Progression Pace Issues </h2>



<p>In a lengthy new post on the BattlefieldComms account on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the developers acknowledged the progression issues in Battlefield 6 and revealed how they will be addressing them. The developers understand that it’s taking way longer to unlock hardware, such as gadgets and weapon adjustments, and are making changes accordingly. </p>



<ul>
<li>Match completely and daily bonuses, XP has been increased by 10% and 40% respectively.</li>



<li>The XP a players need to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks has been reduced, with useful attachments arriving twice as fast.</li>



<li>Players should note that the UI for weapons that are already being progressed might show something “abnormal at first”, but will be resolved once players use that weapon in a match. </li>



<li>The assignments that required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 to begin will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively.</li>



<li>The developers are aware of the “frustrations regarding the challenges themselves and are actively working on reviewing them.” However, this change will take longer to develop, test, and implement. </li>
</ul>



<p>The goal of Battlefield 6’s progression changes is to make the experience feel smoother and more rewarding while retaining the sense of achievement of fully mastering a weapon. The new update will go live within the next week or sooner, depending on testing and verification. The developers are also aware of concerns about visibility, weapon bloom, vehicles not spawning, and more, and will share more details when possible. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-changes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-studios-announce-battlefield-6-portal-%E2%80%98xp-farms%E2%80%99-will-soon-be-patched.1327510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield Studios has announced that it will soon be making changes to the Battlefield 6 Portal to reduce the amount of ‘XP farms’ in the game that have been taking up server capacity.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> on the official Battlefield Communication channel, it was stated that since the launch of Battlefield 6, the maximum capacity of the Battlefield 6 Portal servers has been consistently reached, which has been attributed to XP farms.</p>



<p>They said, “After reviewing the data, we found that a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots. We completely understand the motivation behind this, like faster progression and a way to test setups without pressure, but it’s led to some unintended side effects. With so many servers focused on farming XP rather than active play, it’s become noticeably harder for players to create and find experiences to play with other people.”</p>



<p>As such, changes will soon be coming to Battlefield Portal, including changes to “diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.”</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-portal-changes">Battlefield 6 Portal Changes</h2>



<p>It’s not entirely clear what the changes will be, but it’s likely to be an adjustment to the rate at which people earn XP in Battlefield Portal, meaning that they will be less likely to be used for XP farmers. </p>



<p>One change, though, could be the change that stats and accolades will no longer count towards your player stats, which has seen players artificially inflate their stats with absurd K/D ratios and more.</p>



<p>Presumably, however, the changes will be intended to incentivize people to transition to the core multiplayer experiences, as there will also be some progression updates to the game in this regard.</p>



<p>So for now, you should probably grind your weapons in Battlefield Portal before the changes coming in the coming days.</p>



<p>What do you think about the leveling system in Battlefield 6 at the moment? Do you think it’s too slow? Let us know over on the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Mega Evolution has returned in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with even more to unlock than ever before, and an array of different requirements are present before you can obtain them all.</p>



<p>Obtaining all the Mega Evolutions is a lengthy, but worthwhile, task in the bid to complete <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-mables-research-rewards-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mable’s Research Tasks</a>, which provides the ultimate prize of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-shiny-charm-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shiny Charm</a>, but you won’t be able to get them all until the post-game.</p>



<p>We’ve got all the requirements and Mega Evolutions in Pokémon Legends: Z-A detailed in this guide.</p>







<figure><figcaption>One of many. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mega Evolutions in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A require obtaining a specific Pokémon’s Mega Evolution Stone, with several ways of obtaining</strong> <strong>them.</strong></p>



<p>Many are locked behind story progression, with no way to jump ahead, while others can be obtained relatively early on, as long as you have enough cash or Mega Shards. Pokémon Legends: Z-A does make some even more difficult to obtain, however, locking them behind online ranked participation.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the many ways you can get Mega Evolution Stones in Pokémon Legends: Z-A</p>



<ul>
<li>Story Progression</li>



<li>Stone Emporium</li>



<li>Quasartico Mega Shard Exchange</li>



<li>Mystery Gift Rewards</li>



<li>Ranked Battle Rewards</li>



<li>Post-Game Content</li>
</ul>

<p>If you had any doubts over the legitimacy of the recent wave of gargantuan Pokémon leaks, then The Pokémon Company COO Takato Utsunomiya calling for them all to be removed is probably the most telling piece of evidence you can ask for.</p>



<p>October 13 saw a seismic influx of Pokémon leaks hit the internet. We learned about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Generation 10’s Wind and Wave</a>, a bunch of new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon games, and the DLC Roadmap</a>, not to mention potential Pokémon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMO Details</a>!</p>



<p>It’s been a rip-roaring few days, and we don’t think The Pokémon Company has taken too kindly to it all.</p>

<figure><figcaption>We’ve learned so much already. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Centro LEAKS</a> has become one of the go-to accounts in all of social media where Pokémon leaks are concerned. Some would argue it’s the account everyone refreshes. It posted a bunch of leaks ahead of Pokémon Legends Z-A, and it’s a regular source of Pokémon leaks for Pokémon Pocket and other associated media.</p>



<p>The page reported on October 16 that it had been contacted directly by The Pokémon Company.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Takato Utsunomiya, the Chief Operating Officer of The Pokémon Company, has personally sent an email to Centro Leaks / X to take down the Pokémon leak images.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Centro LEAKS has reiterated that it will not be removing any such leaks or images. In fact, the page has doubled down on its findings and revealed that among the images they want removed are the alleged Pokémon Wind and Wave logos.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The social media page has now pinned a message from Oct. 17, 2024, saying: “If only he knew that laws don’t exist in Perú.” </p>



<p>The message was presumably another instance of copyright issues between the page and The Pokémon Company, and it’s clear that Centro LEAKS’ stance won’t change in 2025. So, unless The Pokémon Company has something stronger in mind, Centro LEAKS will have all the original leaks on its page for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>Which of the leaks has intrigued you the most? Do the new Wind and Waves designs look good?

<p>Dead Space 4 is a wishlist game for many survival-horror fans. Glen Schofield is the genius behind the original title, and while he didn’t have any direct involvement in its sequels, the creator wants to return and get horrible again with Dead Space 4.</p>



<p>It was almost a year ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schofield revealed EA turned down Dead Space 4</a>. There’s a wide belief that the Dead Space Remake didn’t meet sales expectations for Krafton. This is likely why we haven’t heard a sniff about a <a href="http://Dead Space 2 Remake Shelved for Battlefield, It’s Claimed – UPDATE: EA Denies Claim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Space 2 Remake</a>, let alone a fourth game. However, Schofield has reiterated his desire to return to the world of nail-biting terror and necromorphs.</p>



<h2 id="h-glen-schofield-wants-to-make-dead-space-4">Glen Schofield Wants To Make Dead Space 4</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One more round? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Schofield declared in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I have quite a few ideas that I’m ready to go with, and one of them is Dead Space 4. The fact that EA just got bought, I think there’s an opportunity. I’m already making calls.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He revisited his trip to EA, which we’ve already mentioned above, and doubled down on the fact that EA has seemingly moved on from Dead Space:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I went to [EA] recently and they’re like no, we’re not interested anymore. I said, I can get back the leadership team. I need the models from EA Motive [Dead Space Remake creator] and I can save you 30 to 40 million dollars on the idea that I have. And, they’re like, ‘no.'”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Dead Space creator believes the $55 billion takeover of EA could lead to some changes, though: “I am more optimistic because somebody new could buy [the rights to the Dead Space IP].”</p>



<p>EA did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-space-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ask if fans were interested in more Dead Space Remakes</a> shortly after the 2023 release. However, it appears that all plans are on hold for now. Would you like to see a Dead Space 2 Remake? Or can we go one better and finally get the Dead Space 4 sequel we’ve all been waiting for?
