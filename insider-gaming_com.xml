<p>Before Dragon Breath shotguns had an opportunity to take over Warzone’s meta, Raven Software temporarily removed the attachment in the April 11 update, and Treyarch also rolled out a change to the Shattered Veil boss in Black Ops 6 Zombies. </p>



<p>The return of Verdansk in Warzone in Season 3 caused a massive uptick in interest. <span>As a result, some players who previously dropped the game are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/author/ryanlemay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">re-installing Warzone on PS5</a> and other platforms.  </span></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision</a>&nbsp;is reportedly pleased with the results, and the devs have already previewed new content for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-3-reloaded-release-date-expected-start-time-verdansk-ranked-play-new-multiplayer-maps-smg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mid-season update</a>. In addition, the Warzone and Black Ops 6 teams are constantly releasing new minor patches to improve the overall experience. </p>

<h3 id="h-12-gauge-dragon-s-breath-ammunition-removed">12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath Ammunition Removed</h3>



<p>Warzone players discovered that using 12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath ammunition and the Kimura RYL33 Laser Light together on the MX Guardian transformed the shotgun into the best close-range weapon in the game. </p>



<p>With both attachments equipped, the MX Guardian had an unbelievable 280-millisecond time-to-kill speed in gunfights up to five meters, and that only dropped off to 560 ms from 10 meters. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a> explained, “12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath ammo was only meant to be available on specific trigger types for the MX Guardian Shotgun. As such, we’ve disabled this attachment until we can address the issue.” </p>



<h3 id="h-shattered-veil-boss-changes">Shattered Veil Boss Changes </h3>



<p>The Shattered Veil boss was designed to be challenging in BO6 Zombies, but players used an exploit with the Void Sheat that allowed it to do more damage than intended. This update addresses that issue and makes a few changes, to provide other options to use against the boss. </p>

<p>Larian Studios announced an impending final update for Baldur’s Gate 3 in <strong>November 2024, </strong>but it’s only now that it’s shaping up to be released. It’s simply known as ‘Patch 8’, and it’s set to introduce some major changes and additions to Baldur’s Gate 3, which Larian has already moved on from.</p>



<p>Amongst these additions are crossplay mechanics, photo mode, and an array of subclasses.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-is-patch-8-being-released-in-baldur-s-gate-3">When is Patch 8 Being Released in Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2>



<p><strong>Larian has confirmed that Patch 8 will be released globally across all platforms on April 15.</strong> This marks the final major update for the award-winning epic that launched to an overwhelmingly positive reception when it was released in August 2023.</p>



<p>The team has been reluctant to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-comes-next-year-and-includes-cross-play-photo-mode-and-more/">release Patch 8</a> in Baldur’s Gate 3 until it was as close to perfect as possible, it seems. It has been in testing for months and that only came after strenuous efforts to polish the new features.</p>



<p>It has also been reported that Baldur’s Gate 3 will go on sale when Patch 8 is released on April 15, which is sure to bring about a spike in sales as newcomers jump on board to find out what all the fuss has been about over the last year and a half.</p>



<p>In January, Larian Studios confirmed that it had shifted priorities and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-have-moved-their-full-attention-to-the-next-game/">sighted the ‘next game’</a> for the team as the core focus. Baldur’s Gate 3 will get Patch 8, and then no more major updates are set to follow – but the game remains popular regardless.</p>



<p>Will the Patch 8 update in Baldur’s Gate 3 bring you back to the game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.

<p>The director of Chainsaw Man is working on a new roguelite horror game on Roblox called The Inn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/534957/article/chainsaw-man-director-reveals-his-next-project-is-a-roblox-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, The Inn’s official <a href="https://x.com/TheInnRoblox/status/1909996710543421643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) revealed the upcoming Roblox game with a new trailer recently, informing players that Ryu Nakayama, the director of Chainsaw Man, is directing the title. Nakayama is known for his work on projects like Jujutsu Kaisen, Yatterman Night, and more. Nakayama hasn’t worked on a game before The Inn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Inn’s trailer starts with the players stepping into a traditional Japanese inn, which seems inviting from the outside but dreadful from the inside. We see some rooms engulfed in flames, supernatural beings popping up in jump scares, blood splattered everywhere, and other horror elements. No release date or window was provided for the game. </p>



<p>On the Chainsaw Man Director’s personal <a href="https://x.com/r_nkym_/status/1910016940346859949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account, Nakayama revealed that he is working on the Roblox Horror Game in collaboration with Mayflower. It is his “first time working on a game” and has been a “challenging and exciting” experience. The director added that even though he knows that Roblox is a popular platform in North America,&nbsp; he is “deliberately trying to give it a stronger Japanese feel” (as translated by Google on X).&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo’s Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild and its DLC will set players back $90 for its Nintendo Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>That’s according to the mathmagician wizard out there (not really), who have calculated that whichever way you try to get the game and its DLC on the Nintendo Switch 2, it’s going to be $90.</p>



<p>That’s because Nintendo are notoriously bad for not discounting its games, no matter how old they are.</p>



<h2 id="h-90-quick-maths">$90, Quick Maths</h2>



<p>I first spotted these amazing calculations by Paul Tassi at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/04/11/nintendo-says-switch-2-breath-of-the-wild-is-90-with-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>, but basically, $90 is the number you get to no matter how you try and play the game on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For those looking to buy the game outright, it will set you back $70, plus the $20 DLC taking you to $90. For those looking to upgrade from the original Nintendo Switch version, you’ll still have to buy the game for $60 and need to buy the “enhanced” edition for an additional $10. Add on the $20 for the DLC and you’re at the $90 price point once again.</p>



<p>The news likely adds even more frustration to what has been a disastrous reveal for the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s $450 console price point (which could still increase in the US following all the tariff shenanigans) has been a constant cause for debate in the community. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – Nintendo Switch 2 Games Will Cost Up To $98 For Physical Games When Converted From Euros</a></strong></p>



<p>Admittingly, though, it’s a console that’s still going to fly off the shelves, but I’m personally finding Nintendo’s greed here a little hard to stomach, especially given the current economic climate. It seems like whichever way we look at it, more expensive games are going to be hitting us sooner rather than later. </p>



<p>What do you think about the current pricing structure from Nintendo? Will you be buying Zelda for $90?
