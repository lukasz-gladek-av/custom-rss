<p>Embark Studios has an exciting proposition on its hands with ARC Raiders. The multiplayer shooter exudes all the qualities of a well-thought-out and handcrafted extraction game, so let’s check out its release date and potential start times to see when we can get you above the ground.</p>



<p>There’s been serious buzz around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-arc-raiders-pvp-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> since day one. Having Embark Studios behind the project—creators of the chaotic and addictive The Finals—has naturally generated hype. Sprinkle in some fun lore, angry machines, and the constant danger of encountering other real-life players, and ARC Raiders could be something.</p>



<p>Let’s check out its confirmed release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-arc-raiders-coming-out">When is ARC Raiders Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The surface isn’t safe. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We have a fixed October 30 release date for ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>Once the initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-arc-raiders-invite-code-for-tech-test-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders playtest</a> finished, all anyone wanted was a release date. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-players-think-they-found-a-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Players even thought they’d found one</a>, only for this to be false. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> finally answered prayers and gave us a concrete release date.</p>



<p>It’s arriving in the middle of a competitive window. Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7 will be waging war on either side of the Oct 30 date. If you’re after a competent, tactical extraction shooter instead of all-out multiplayer warfare, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders</a> might be what you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-arc-raiders-start-times">Do we Know ARC Raiders’ Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, it’s too early to give you exact start time for ARC Raiders, but we might be able to hazard a guess based on previous data.</strong></p>



<p>I find that previous betas and playtests can be a good indicator of the final launch times. One particular ARC Raiders playtest started at 1:30 AM PT. Does this mean ARC Raiders will release at 1:30 AM on October 30? We’ll have to wait and see.</p>



<p>The only thing I can do is tell you we’ll be updating this article once we have the accurate start times. The confirmed release date is the crucial aspect for now, and you can see where the game falls in a crowded game calendar.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-franchise-could-bring-back-%E2%80%98social-stealth%E2%80%99.1269243/</guid>

<p>A popular feature from the Assassin’s Creed franchise, ‘social stealth’ could make its return in one of the next games in the series. </p>



<p>Since Assassin’s Creed: Shadows has now been released, players are already waiting for the next big game in the series. Recently, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened to sue</a> the actor of Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag over a slip-up with the remake details. Now, the developers have revealed that an old feature hasn’t been ruled out from the franchise, which means we could see it in one of the next games. </p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-devs-reveal-why-it-didn-t-have-social-stealth">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Devs Reveal Why It Didn’t Have Social Stealth</h2>



<p>During a recent AMA segment with the devs on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/hi_were_simon_andr%C3%A9_and_luc_developers_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/assassinscreed</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/ubisoft-explains-why-assassins-creed-shadows-ditched-social-stealth-but-says-its-likely-not-gone-for-good-our-stealth-team-chose-to-put-100-percent-of-their-energy-on-the-moment-to-moment-tactical-shinobi-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), the developers were asked whether “social stealth elements” could make a comeback in the future. Additionally, they were also asked why social stealth was not a part of Assassin’s Creed: Shadows. </p>



<p>The developers responded, stating that for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the stealth team had put “100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience”, which is why there was no room to add social stealth. However, that “does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the Assassin’s Creed franchise”. </p>



<p>For those wondering, social stealth was a feature seen in previous Assassin’s Creed games, where the protagonist could hide from his enemies and pursuers by blending in with the crowd. </p>

<h2 id="h-assassins-vs-templars-conflict-is-the-core-pillar-of-the-ac-series">Assassins Vs. Templars Conflict is the Core Pillar of the AC Series </h2>



<p>During the same AMA segment, the developers added that the Assassins vs. Templars conflict has always been a core pillar of the Assassin’s Creed series. With Shadows, they planned to establish their protagonist in the setting before expanding on the conflict. Now that it is done in the main game and through the Critical Role story drop, players should expect “more deep dive in this conflict in the near future.”</p>



<p>In other news, the Claws of Awaji DLC is scheduled to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release this September</a>. Additionally, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rating-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. What are your thoughts on social stealth returning to the Assassin’s Creed franchise?

            <title><![CDATA[The ‘Big Division 2 Project’ Will Be Revealed at Gamescom]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/division-2-project-gamescom-reveal-panels/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-%E2%80%98big-division-2-project%E2%80%99-will-be-revealed-at-gamescom.1269174/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed that two panels centered around The Division 2 will take place at Gamescom next week. The team will be hosting a meet-and-greet event alongside two presentations designed to reveal the future of The Division 2, including the ‘big Division 2 project’ that Ubisoft has just started talking about.</p>



<p>It was also noted that The Division: Resurgence, the all-new mobile game that’s in development now, will be showcased.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-big-division-2-project">What is the Big Division 2 Project?</h2>



<p>I’ve got no idea, but thanks to a new social post from Ubisoft, I know we’ll get more clues next week when Gamescom unravels.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is what the team said about what’s coming to Gamescom from Ubisoft, where The Division 2 is concerned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Division 2 will be at Gamescom this year, with two panels and two meet-and-greets.</p>



<p>Our first panel will take a look at the creative and art direction behind Battle for Brooklyn, and we’ll also give you a small glimpse at what’s coming next for the seasons.</p>



<p>In our second panel, we’ll talk about how your feedback is shaping The Division 2, share some updates about The Division: Resurgence, and reveal more about the ‘big Division 2 project’. We’ve only just started teasing it, but we’re really excited to give you an update.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you can’t make it to Cologne (hint: we’ll all be there!), you can watch both panels online across Ubisoft’s channels.</p>



<p>Battle for Brooklyn was released earlier this year and was met with positive sentiments from the community. After more than six years, The Division 2 is still alive and well, and judging from Ubisoft’s comments, it’s about to get even better.</p>



<p>Are you going to tune in to see what Ubisoft is teasing for The Division 2? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
