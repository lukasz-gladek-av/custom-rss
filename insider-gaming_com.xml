            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-developers-comment-on-sbmm/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest saga of Battlefield leaks, the community has voiced its frustration of leaked code suggesting that SBMM is in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>The news first surfaced earlier this week, after internal code obtained by the Battlefield Labs playtests showed that Battlefield 6 will have matchmaking commands to match players of similar skill – AKA, Battlefield 6 will have Skillbased Matchmaking (SBMM).</p>



<p>Predictably, the community was up in arms about the leak, with most voicing their frustrations that they would much rather have a server browser as games such as Call of Duty, which notoriously has a harsh SBMM system, is no longer enjoyable. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-developers-weigh-in-on-sbmm">Battlefield Developers Weigh in on SBMM</h2>



<p>David Sirland, one of the Lead Producer’s on Battlefield 6 took to the closed Battlefield Labs Discord server to explain (uploaded by Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jwo1s3/psa_from_david_sirland_in_bf_labs_surrounding_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Old_Doubt5886</a>) the situation around Battlefield 6 and SBMM. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“PSA: 2042 has SBMM according to this definition – this is what I tried to detail above yesterday. It has a factor of skill, its used, but ping and time to game is the TOP priority, and in a 64 player game our want is to spawn a server that starts as soon as possible – thus the skill factor is negligable in terms of sorting into servers. Also with a party that is more or less ignored. Just for clarity – saying SBMM is bad is not really useful. What you really want to say is “Heavy SBMM where skill separation is a priority is bad”.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t make skill as a factor in matchmaking bad wholesale, on the contrary we need a skill value to make balanced teams – no matter the ranges of skills total on a server. It wouldn’t be fun if all high skill players ended up on the same team, would it?</p>



<p>Just to calm this thing down a tad – the fact a skill value is in the matchmaker (it’s been there since we started being able to matchmake BTW) – doesn’t mean we are going with a heavy handed SBMM solution. Quite the opposite, Battlefield is at its best when you play the all out war modes with friends and different types of players – we do not want to limit that.</p>



<p>All of this is also true (skill being important for team balancing) regardless of in which way you join the server For reference, did you feel like the BF labs playtests were heavy handed SBMM? No? then we good. It’s the same matchmaker and settings we’ll use (with tweaks if we find any issues of course).”</p>

<p>So, at face value at least, the current theories on Battlefield 6 and SBMM are unwarranted, at least where Sirland is concerned. Of course, things are subject to change during development, but <strong>that’s why</strong> Battlefield Labs was set up an NDA’s have been enforced. On this, Battlefield Community Manager <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jwo1s3/comment/mmkie21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">T0TALfps</a> weighed in on the recent leaks.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Okay&nbsp;<strong>enough,</strong></p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is about building and collaborating on the future of Battlefield, and we want to do that in the correct way. I want to remind everyone things that are taking place in Battlefield Labs may or may not make their way to the final finish line. This is the greatest thing about this program, it allows us the ability to get creative, see what works with those involved, gain educated and informed feedback from those that are participating and potentially spot bugs around the features too. We’ve long wanted to implement this program, responding to your requests for greater involvement and a return to this type of reactivity around all things Battlefield.</p>



<p>There is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities, and this is not it. We will address various topics and expand participation in Battlefield Labs when appropriate, but the constant reposting of things is not that time or place. Individuals are and will continue to be removed if they continue to violate the NDA that they agreed to.</p>



<p>Information and content that gets shared&nbsp;<strong>is out of context</strong>&nbsp;and often with a narrative wrapped around it that is doing damage to the trust and transparency we want to establish. Things simply are not the same when it comes to hearing about something out of context versus actually experiencing it – or reading about it in detail with the correct descriptions around it.</p>



<p>While the allure of brief internet fame might be tempting, it undermines our efforts to remain open and communicative. And quite honestly, if that is your intention, then I question where this aligns with the interests of our, THIS, community.</p>



<p>We all can agree that we wanted to have an environment that allowed for testing and collaborating once again. We want to be as transparent as we can be, you have seen us return to the values you once recognized in us. We all want to make Battlefield play like Battlefield, but we cannot do it if the trust continues to be tampered with. We must be allowed the ability to do it right – alongside you all and in the correct way.</p>



<p>And to all those of you who do wish to see things grow, we commit to you that we are reading your comments and feedback in and out of the program, we are seeing and exploring your experiences with Battlefield, and we are paying attention just like what we stated in our&nbsp;first Community Update&nbsp;&lt;3</p>



<p>If you want to be a part of the moment and participate in Battlefield Labs you can sign up via&nbsp;<a href="http://go.ea.com/bflabs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://go.ea.com/bflabs</a>&nbsp;and rest assured that your moment will arrive.</p>



<p>One final reminder that when it comes to features, content, functionality, and more – it is only official when we share it and we are comfortable with the topic at hand.</p>



<p>To those who are here for community and wish to see a bright future for Battlefield, thank you – truly. I truly believe community has been closer to the development of Battlefield than ever before, and I have been around for quite some years now. What we’re doing is something different, I know that you feel that too. It is truly refreshing to see you experience pre-alpha content and share your thoughts but for us to then react and change in a short time frame – it’s something else.</p>



<p>Rules aren’t fun, but they exist to make it better for us all. Thank you to those that are abiding by them, but thank you for your trust and time too to make this great for you – our community.</p>



<p>Let’s keep doing this together, and do expect more Community Updates in the very near future!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-coming-xbox-and-ps5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon is the next contender in the extraction shooter space, attempting to carve out a name for itself alongside games like Escape from Tarkov. It’s a sci-fi epic that prioritises teamwork and collaboration over milsim mechanics, and for that reason alone, it’s a refreshing title that promises to disrupt the genre.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re answering a critical question that many have on their mind: ‘Is Marathon coming to Xbox and PS5?’</p>



<p>Read on to learn what we know about Marathon on console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-on-console">Will Marathon be on Console?</h2>



<p>Most extraction shooters are only ever released on PC. The top dog is Escape from Tarkov, which is PC exclusive. Then you’ve got competing titles like Gray Zone Warfare, Marauders, and Dark &amp; Darker, all of which are locked to PC platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Marathon will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC</strong>, emerging as one of the few extraction shooter titles on console platforms.</p>



<p>It’s a revolutionary thing that’s sure to turn heads, given that it has been compiled by the creators of Halo and Destiny.</p>



<p>You can wishlist <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon on PS5</a>, and the Xbox link is coming soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marathon-crossplay">Is Marathon Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Marathon will be a fully crossplay and cross-save title, which means you can play with your friends on PC if you’re playing on Xbox. It also means that if you play on PC then want to pick up your progress on PlayStation 5, you’re more than welcome.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most seamless ways to play games, and it makes sense that Bungie would support it, given how progress works in other titles that the team has worked on.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Marathon? Let me know what you think about this upcoming extraction shooter in the comments, or check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Sanfall Interactive’s debut project, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>, turns the traditional turn-based format on its head by adding real-time combat mechanics. The game is set in a distorted version of late 19th-century France and follows an expedition group with a unique goal. </p>



<p>In this universe, there is a paintress, and when she paints a number on a monolith, every one of that age turns to smoke and fades away. Every year, an expedition group departs to stop the paintress before their age is painted, and Expedition group 33 is the latest to attempt to change their fate. </p>

<p>Before Dragon Breath shotguns had an opportunity to take over Warzone’s meta, Raven Software temporarily removed the attachment in the April 11 update, and Treyarch also rolled out a change to the Shattered Veil boss in Black Ops 6 Zombies. </p>



<p>The return of Verdansk in Warzone in Season 3 caused a massive uptick in interest. <span>As a result, some players who previously dropped the game are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/author/ryanlemay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">re-installing Warzone on PS5</a> and other platforms.  </span></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision</a>&nbsp;is reportedly pleased with the results, and the devs have already previewed new content for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-3-reloaded-release-date-expected-start-time-verdansk-ranked-play-new-multiplayer-maps-smg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mid-season update</a>. In addition, the Warzone and Black Ops 6 teams are constantly releasing new minor patches to improve the overall experience. </p>

<h3 id="h-12-gauge-dragon-s-breath-ammunition-removed">12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath Ammunition Removed</h3>



<p>Warzone players discovered that using 12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath ammunition and the Kimura RYL33 Laser Light together on the MX Guardian transformed the shotgun into the best close-range weapon in the game. </p>



<p>With both attachments equipped, the MX Guardian had an unbelievable 280-millisecond time-to-kill speed in gunfights up to five meters, and that only dropped off to 560 ms from 10 meters. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a> explained, “12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath ammo was only meant to be available on specific trigger types for the MX Guardian Shotgun. As such, we’ve disabled this attachment until we can address the issue.” </p>



<h3 id="h-shattered-veil-boss-changes">Shattered Veil Boss Changes </h3>



<p>The Shattered Veil boss was designed to be challenging in BO6 Zombies, but players used an exploit with the Void Sheat that allowed it to do more damage than intended. This update addresses that issue and makes a few changes, to provide other options to use against the boss. </p>

<p>Larian Studios announced an impending final update for Baldur’s Gate 3 in <strong>November 2024, </strong>but it’s only now that it’s shaping up to be released. It’s simply known as ‘Patch 8’, and it’s set to introduce some major changes and additions to Baldur’s Gate 3, which Larian has already moved on from.</p>



<p>Amongst these additions are crossplay mechanics, photo mode, and an array of subclasses.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-is-patch-8-being-released-in-baldur-s-gate-3">When is Patch 8 Being Released in Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2>



<p><strong>Larian has confirmed that Patch 8 will be released globally across all platforms on April 15.</strong> This marks the final major update for the award-winning epic that launched to an overwhelmingly positive reception when it was released in August 2023.</p>



<p>The team has been reluctant to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-comes-next-year-and-includes-cross-play-photo-mode-and-more/">release Patch 8</a> in Baldur’s Gate 3 until it was as close to perfect as possible, it seems. It has been in testing for months and that only came after strenuous efforts to polish the new features.</p>



<p>It has also been reported that Baldur’s Gate 3 will go on sale when Patch 8 is released on April 15, which is sure to bring about a spike in sales as newcomers jump on board to find out what all the fuss has been about over the last year and a half.</p>
