<p>Nintendo has announced that the Nintendo Switch 2 direct will start at 9am ET/6am PT/2pm GMT on April 2, 2025. The date had been known since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the console’s reveal</a>, but the time wasn’t confirmed until February 5.</p>



<p>Not much was said about the event by Nintendo aside from the company stating it will “share a closer look at Nintendo Switch 2”. </p>



<p>It’s expected that full specs will be discussed as well as all of the consoles new core features. It could also be assumed that the first batch of Nintendo Switch 2 games will be revealed. Fans have already gotten a glimpse at Mario Kart 9 (name not confirmed) along with what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-9-could-feature-new-24-player-races/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could be a new feature</a> for the next game in the franchise.</p>







<p>The release date and pricing of the console is also expected to be announced. </p>

<p>OverActive Media, the parent company behind the Call of Duty League’s Toronto Ultra, has published a statement following the recent Major tournament held in Madrid, Spain. In a press release, it was confirmed that Major I, the first sizeable tournament of the CDL 2025 season, was ‘the most successful Major (they) have ever hosted’.</p>



<p>It was revealed that 80% of attendees at the venue in the Spanish city were from <strong>outside </strong>the country and that 12,000 people in total flocked to the Caja Mágica arena.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-defining-moment">‘A Defining Moment’</h2>



<p>OverActive Media’s CEO, Adam Adamou, explained in the press release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By bringing together top-tier talent, innovative strategies, and fresh ideas, we are strengthening our connections with fans while unlocking new revenue streams and growth opportunities. </p>



<p>The energy in&nbsp;Madrid&nbsp;and the success of our acquisitions reaffirm our commitment to building a global esports company that entertains millions while creating sustainable growth.</p>



<p>Call of Duty League Major I was the most successful Major we have ever hosted. We sold more than 12,000 tickets, with more than 80% traveling from outside&nbsp;Spain, driving tourism and significant economic impact for the local community. </p>



<p>The energy in the arena, the intense competition, and the global engagement made this event a defining moment for the Call of Duty League and a clear statement on the sustainable growth of our esports presence in&nbsp;Europe.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I had the pleasure of attending the CDL Major in Madrid and caught up with many of the best Call of Duty players in the world. I was able to sit down with Atlanta FaZe, the team that won the tournament after a gruelling Grand Final against the LA Thieves.</p>



<p>The CDL Major I event was a boon to kickstart the latest competitive season. More than 233,000 consecutive viewers tuned in from around the world, and the showcase proved that Europe can be one of the most lucrative regions to host further Call of Duty events. This was the first CDL Major to take place in Europe in the history of the tournament.</p>



<p>Next, the Call of Duty League will head back to the United States, with Major II taking place in Texas in March 2025.</p>



<p>Later this year, in the summer, Toronto Ultra will host another CDL event – the Call of Duty League Championship tournament in Canada.</p>



<p>Did you attend the CDL Major in Madrid? Let me know what you thought about the event on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Due to recent feedback, Pokemon TCG Pocket announced that players will receive 1,000 Trade Tokens as a Gift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s trading feature has received a lot of criticism since its release, primarily due to the features’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restrictions</a> and the cost of trades (tokens). Many players have complained about the price being too high to perform a sufficient number of trades, and there aren’t many ways to earn them either. Due to this feedback, TCG Pocket has <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1887035219351368102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">decided</a> to gift players 1,000 free Trade Tokens while they investigate ways to improve the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-free-1-000-trade-tokens-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-nbsp">How to Claim Free 1,000 Trade Tokens in Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The developers have made it simple for players to claim these free Trade Tokens. All they need to do is visit the Gifts menu, which players can access by clicking the icon on the top right corner of the home screen. Here, they will find a gift from the development team, which includes 1,000 Trade Tokens. Click on the ‘Claim’ button to add the tokens to your inventory.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-space-time-smackdown-emblem-event">Space-Time Smackdown Emblem Event </h2>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket has recently released its Space-Time Smackdown expansion, which introduces over 140 cards from the Sinnoh region, along with legendary Pokemon like Dialga and Palkia. The developers currently host an <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1886942825222168827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">emblem event</a> where players can earn emblems depending on their wins against other players. One win will provide a participation emblem, five wins will get you a bronze emblem, 25 wins will get you a silver emblem, and 45 wins will let you earn a Gold Emblem. Players can also complete other missions to gain items like Shinedust and more.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Have Difficulty Settings?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-difficulty-settings/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-have-difficulty-settings.1100703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-difficulty-settings/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It becomes apparent early on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and difficulty go hand in hand. I wouldn’t say it’s “Souls” levels of difficulty, but it’s easy to be caught out in KC2. If you’re reading this, you know what I mean, and I’m here to see if you can stop seeing the game over screen as regularly.</p>



<p>2018’s Kingdom Come Deliverance became a fan-favorite for its setting, characters, and immersive gameplay. Its mechanics included a lot of realism-based actions: Needing to hydrate, the necessity of eating and sleeping, and the punishing nature of its combat. KC wasn’t easy, and despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling 8 million copies</a>, the brutal nature of its combat wasn’t for everyone.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> has improved in almost every way. But one noticeable area that feels the same is the rugged and tough gameplay battle encounters. This is why players are already questioning if difficulty settings exist in KC2.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-change-the-difficulty-settings-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Can You Change The Difficulty Settings in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t you laugh at me, good sir. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>I can confirm you can’t change the difficulty settings in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. It uses a default difficulty setting designed to accommodate all players—meaning you might struggle in moments.</strong></p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 hasn’t budged in the difficulty settings department (kind of, but more later) and you need to adapt. You learn early on you need to take the RPG seriously. If you don’t stock up on Bandages, you bleed to death. If you carry an assortment of rancid meat for days on end, you have no food, and you starve to death.</p>



<p>Additionally, you will die <em>repeatedly </em>if you don’t adhere to the nuances of KC2’s combat mechanics. Even I find it easy to become overwhelmed by a fight, and I end up mashing the main attack button. You know what happens? You already know it.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-make-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-harder-hardcore-mode-explained">Can You Make Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Harder? Hardcore Mode Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Oh good. Credit to “Kingdom Come: Deliverance II – Roadmap Trailer | PS5 Games” Trailer on YouTube</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is getting a Hardcore Mode as post-launch content.</strong></p>



<p>The forthcoming gameplay addition was announced during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DMCj5dtJLs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Roadmap Trailer</a> announcement. Along with a bunch of new content coming after KC2’s debut—including a Barber feature, Horse Racing, and new Quests—the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> includes Hardcore Mode.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios hasn’t confirmed what Hardcore Mode entails, but history tells us KC2 is about to become a lot tougher. If I use Bethesda’s Fallout series as a classic example, the franchise’s Hardcore Mode typically makes healing and all status conditions recover a lot slower, items weigh more, and fast travel affects player status too.</p>



<p>There are so many avenues the developer can go with KC2’s Hardcore Mode. The one thing I’m confident about is if you playthrough Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on Hardcore Mode, you’re going to have a heck of a challenge on your hands.</p>



<p>We don’t know when it’s coming yet, but stay tuned for updates on the Hardcore Mode content patch.</p>

<p>Is a Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Hardcore Mode right up your alley? Or do you think the developer needs to add difficulty settings to make the title more accessible? Let us know.</p>
