<p>Nearly all of the actors with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies mode have quit the game, according to a new claim. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1865103558414340269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Call of Duty leaker GhostOfHope says that they have left the game due to a lack of protection against AI.</p>



<p>“Almost all of the actors that feature in the Zombies crew in Black Ops 6 Zombies have pulled out of working over the lack of AI protections in their contracts,” Hope said. “This has resulted in some of the disappointing recasts we are now seeing early on (Ex: SAM on Citadelle), with some likely still to be recast in future maps etc.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for comment on the report. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>Concerns of AI protection for video game actors is nothing new. SAG-AFTRA members are currently striking against game studios for that exact reason after negotiations with studios failed to deliver any sort of guarantees for actors. The strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially began</a> in July after 18 months of negotiations, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-strike-with-video-game-voice-and-performance-artists-to-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues without a deal</a>.</p>



<p>One of those studios the union is in negotiations with just happens to be Activision Blizzard as well as EA, Insomniac, Take-Two, Warner Bros. Games, and more.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation in Riyadh has announced a multi-year partnership with Activision’s Call of Duty League. This partnership has been dubbed ‘a key component of EWCF’s commitment to fuel the sustainable growth of esports’ by the Saudi Arabian gaming company.</p>



<p>It wasn’t made too clear what the partnership will entail, but it comes just days after both Black Ops 6 and Warzone were confirmed to be appearing at the Esports World Cup in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-life-changing-global-event">‘Life-Changing Global Event’</h2>



<p>It’s expected that this partnership will go beyond the Esports World Cup in 2025, but the press release that landed today with this news was a little vague about what the partnership means for COD esports.</p>



<p>In a statement, the Chief Games Officer at the EWCF, Fabian Scheuermann, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Call of Duty&nbsp;is one of the most celebrated games on the planet and has captivated global communities for generations. Together, we are creating new opportunities for players, from grassroots to elite competitors, to rise through the ranks and compete on the world’s biggest stage. </p>



<p>As we continue to grow the largest-ever celebration of esports excellence, we look forward to welcoming all players into a life-changing global event, one that connects players, games, fans, and the entire esports industry under one banner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Daniel Tsay, the general manager of Call of Duty Esports at Activision, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Call of Duty League&nbsp;is thrilled to partner with the Esports World Cup to support the continued growth of competitive Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Our pro players and affiliated orgs had a great time competing during last year’s EWC tournament and showcased how fun and intense pro-am style competition can be.&nbsp;This partnership gives our players, community and fans even more opportunities to enjoy premium competitive Call of Duty for years to come.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The three-year partnership will hopefully be given a little more meat in the coming weeks as the Call of Duty League 2025 season unravels. It’s set to commence today, with a slew of matches running through the weekend to welcome back COD’s top-tier competitive ecosystem.</p>
