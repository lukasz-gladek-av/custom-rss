<p>According to a new report, it seems like the mystery of the Game Awards statue may have been solved. Furthermore, if true, it comes from a studio fresh off huge wins at the event.</p>



<p>Since last month, a weird statue in the middle of New Mexico has appeared out of nowhere. Both The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley hinted at its true nature, but fans have been going berserk figuring out what it means. From God of War and Diablo to Saros and The Elder Scrolls, guesses <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been all over the place</a>. Some theories had some real weight to them, though many were shut down by industry figures like Jason Schreier and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-director-reveals-if-the-game-awards-2025-statue-has-anything-to-do-with-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Barlog</a>. However, a new trademark for a legendary RPG series has been spotted, with the designs matching the statue perfectly.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-divinity-game-possibly-being-revealed-at-the-game-awards-via-mystery-statue-new-report-details">New Divinity Game Possibly Being Revealed at The Game Awards via Mystery Statue, New Report Details</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report first came from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, who previously did pieces on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-dead-rising-hollywood-possible-capcom-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Rising</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-screenshots-canceled-xbox-avalanche/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contraband</a>. In it, the outlet found trademarks for a new Divinity game, directed by Baldur’s Gate 3’s Larian Studios. From the looks of it, the logo and accompanying images look strikingly similar to those of the statue. The picture of the listings, as well as the statue for reference, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/0BhWOdo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be found here</a>. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that the connection has not been confirmed by Larian or The Game Awards, so take it with a grain of salt. In any case, a new Divinity is something many fans will be pumped about. The last release, Divinity: Original Sin 2, came out in 2017 for last-gen consoles. The acclaimed RPG series took players to a new medieval fantasy world with turn-based combat and an isometric perspective. While the logo and all do look new, it could be a remaster of sorts for newer consoles. Still, Larian Studios has been on a roll after the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-bafta-games-awards/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, so, needless to say, if true, it’s one to keep a giant glowing eye on.</p>

<p>Everyone is obsessed with ‘wrapping up’ more than just presents now as the Holiday season approaches. Xbox Wrapped 2025 is the best way to see how much time you’ve spent on your Xbox, what you’ve done on it, and accessing Xbox Wrapped is nice and easy.</p>



<p>The Xbox brand probably hasn’t had the hottest 2025, and the whole <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-founder-describes-game-pass-price-hikes-as-greed-over-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass price increase</a> probably wasn’t the best of news. Despite these setbacks, there’s still a more than healthy player base on Xbox, and this is why Xbox Wrapped’s Year in Review could unearth some fascinating stats about your playtime.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-year-in-review-2025-expected-release-date">Xbox Year in Review 2025 Expected Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New year, new stats. Image via Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You should expect the Xbox Year in Review 2025 to arrive during the week of December 8, as this lines up with the last couple of editions of Xbox Wrapped.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike other ‘Wrapped’ round-ups, the biggest consistency about Xbox’s Year in Review is the inconsistency. Looking back at previous releases, you can see that the Xbox Year in Review 2023 was <strong>Tuesday, December 12</strong>, and last year it was <strong>Wednesday, December 4</strong>.</p>



<p>You could guesstimate that it’ll be Wednesday, December 10, for the 2025 edition of the round-up. If it’s not the first week of December, then it has to be the second. We’ve already passed Tuesday, leaving a reasonable assumption of Wednesday, December 10.</p>



<p>Note: Insider Gaming is not claiming this is the date, but is assuming a logical conclusion. Stay tuned and keep checking back for updates.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-xbox-wrapped-2025-stats">How To Check Xbox Wrapped 2025 Stats</h2>

<p><strong>Once the official Xbox Wrapped 2025 notice is up, there should be an easy-to-access link where you sign in and claim your full Xbox Year in Review 2025 analysis.</strong></p>



<p>This is based on the last couple of years, but it’s hard to imagine the process changing too much. Here’s how you potentially check your Xbox stats in 2025:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/YearinReview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Year in Review</a> site.</li>



<li>Log in to your Xbox account.</li>



<li>This should automatically trigger your custom Xbox Wrapped journey.</li>



<li>You can read and share details of your Xbox gaming in 2025.</li>
</ol>



<p>You only have a limited time to check the review once it’s live. Make sure you do so, and take a screenshot or share the link to keep the stats as memories or future comparisons!</p>



<p>Share your results once the Xbox Year in Review 2025 is live. Apart from social media, you’re encouraged to head on over to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a> to discuss your stats with other Xbox users.</p>

<p>Bruce Straley’s studio, Wildflower Interactive, will be revealing its debut game at The Game Awards. Straley’s resume includes creating The Last of Us and directing Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and A Thief’s End for Naughty Dog.</p>



<p>The Game Awards are no strangers to The Last of Us. With the Naughty Dog IP winning multiple awards, including Game of the Year in 2020 for Part 2, it’s not surprising to see why. Last year, Naughty Dog even revealed its next project, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, at the end of the show. However, one of The Last of Us’ co-creators, Bruce Straley, wasn’t there, having left the company in 2017. He started Wildflower Interactive in 2021, an indie studio, but didn’t give more information than that. Now, fans can expect to see what the studio has been working on come December 11th.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-game-from-wildflower-interactive-run-by-the-last-of-us-bruce-straley-to-premiere-at-the-game-awards-2025">New Game from Wildflower Interactive, Run by The Last of Us’ Bruce Straley, To Premiere at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1998452590397501921?s=46&amp;t=hX1f8t9VMLBATttRMgQR3A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Twitter</a>, Game Awards host Geoff Keighley announced that <strong>the debut title from Wildflower Interactive will be revealed at the show</strong>. The video, only 30 seconds long, shows off the game’s cel-shaded style and a neat wilderness setting. In the back, some dialogue can be heard, including a bear-like roar and some reassurance. No details, like the title or release, have been revealed, though it’s likely to appear during the show on December 11th.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Bruce’s co-director on The Last of Us, Neil Druckmann, will likely be in attendance. The TV adaptation of The Last of Us’s second season is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominated for Best Adaptation</a>, in which Neil helped direct. Bruce’s legacy at Naughty Dog goes beyond The Last of Us, as he directed Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and A Thief’s End, which many claim to be the best in the series. Either way, an ambitious new project with a talented director at the helm is always something to look forward to.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix Downplays Value of WB Games, Calls Division “Minor” in Deal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-downplays-value-wb-games/</link>
            <guid>1377472</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On December 5, it was announced that Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery had come to an agreement to sell the Warner Bros. side of the business to the streaming giant. As part of that deal, it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was confirmed that all</a> of Warner Bros. Games (WB Games) properties and studios would be owned by Netflix. </p>



<p>While Netflix didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment regarding what the future could hold for the gaming division of Warner Bros. On December 8, however, the first gaming-specific comments were made by Netflix Co-CEO Gregory Peters on the company’s pending purchase of WB Games.</p>







<p>Peters <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said that when the deal</a> was coming together, WB Games wasn’t “built” into the deal model. He says that, despite their being “great studios and great folks working there”, they didn’t “attribute any value” to the games side of the company.</p>



<p><strong>“While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things,”</strong> Peters said. </p>



<p><strong>“Now we’re super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering. They’ve got great studios and great folks working there. So, we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.”</strong></p>







<p>Should the Netflix deal for Warner Bros. close in 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/">they’ll own studios</a> like Avalanche Software, Rocksteady Games, TT Games, and NetherRealm Studios. That means games like the aforementioned Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, the rumored in-development Batman game, and others will be under the Netflix umbrella.</p>



<p>To hear that they didn’t consider gaming when determining the value of the company might not be what fans want to hear. That said, it’s tough to know what the company really feels about the gaming side of things based on those comments alone.</p>



<p>The real showing will come after they official own all of the studios. Of course, that’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/">if they close the</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/">deal</a>. </p>

            <guid>1377442</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rogue is the next character set to arrive in Marvel Rivals on December 12 with Season 5.5, and the developers have provided the usual glimpse of her vanguard moves in a new trailer. </p>







<p>Anna Marie, or more commonly known as Rogue, is perhaps one of the most beloved members of the X-Men in the Marvel fandom. Partnered with her <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-gambit-voice-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved Gambit</a>, fans have been wanting to see her inclusion for a long time, and to see her as a vanguard is just the cherry on top. </p>



<h2 id="h-rogue-heading-to-marvel-rivals">Rogue Heading To Marvel Rivals </h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rogue: Tempted to Touch | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_CwYQQP21Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>At first glance, Rogue looks poised to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-november-20-update-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shake up the meta</a> in a completely unique way. She’s built primarily as a close-quarters brawler, diving into the thick of the fight and dealing impressive damage up close. But she’s far from limited to melee—she can yank enemies toward her and chip away at anyone caught within her damaging aura.</p>



<p>The real show-stealer, though, is her ability to borrow powers from other heroes. Whoever she drains, she can temporarily wield their abilities as if they were her own. The trailer highlights just how versatile this can be: Psylocke’s invisibility, Thor’s lightning strikes—it all becomes part of Rogue’s toolkit, giving her the potential to dominate the battlefield like no other Vanguard.</p>







<p>Her Ultimate amplifies things even further, letting her batter nearby foes while shielding herself and unleashing heavy, punishing blows. A new Vanguard is always an exciting addition to Marvel Rivals, but Rogue looks ready to steal the spotlight in every sense.</p>



<p>It’s always been the season of Rogue and Gambit, and the notorious couple are finally paired together in-game. What do you think of Rogue’s vanguard abilities in Marvel Rivals?
