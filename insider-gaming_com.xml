            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-multiplayer-how-does-it-work/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1 is taking the world by storm, topping the charts on Steam and pulling in hundreds of thousands of players. It’s a shock hit that has come out of nowhere, and it’s dominating the gaming world despite having a bizarre theme. In this guide, we’re looking at whether Schedule 1 is multiplayer, and <strong>if it is</strong>, we’ll break down how to play with friends.</p>



<p>If you’ve been trying to play Schedule 1 co-op, read on to find out how it all works.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-co-op-in-schedule-1">How to Play Co-Op in Schedule 1</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to play Schedule 1 with your friends, you’re in luck – you can do so in both the free demo and the paid version of the game</strong>. To invite friends to your game, you’ll need to open the ‘Lobby’ menu that can be found in the top-right corner of the game scene. From there, you’ll utilise Steam’s friend mechanics to invite someone to your game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-schedule-1-multiplayer-work">How Does Schedule 1 Multiplayer Work?</h2>



<p>In Schedule 1 multiplayer modes, the host has all the power.</p>



<p>They’re responsible for saving the game, and any progress you make in someone else’s co-op lobby won’t impact your single-player adventure. That means if you buy Schedule 1 and boot it up and jump straight into your friend’s game, you’ll end up unlocking <strong>nothing in your single-player game</strong>.</p>



<p>You won’t even have a save file.</p>



<p>If you’ve already kickstarted a solo venture, you won’t be able to invite any friends to revel in your drug manufacturing madness.</p>



<p>It gets a little trickier when it comes to finances, too. Every dollar you earn and bank with your friends in Schedule 1 multiplayer is added to a collective pot – but the cash in your pocket is <strong>yours alone</strong>. Also, items can’t be shared between players unless they’re placed in storage.</p>



<p>Put simply, you need to put something down before another player can pick it up.</p>



<p>Oh, and you can only have a maximum of four players in both the demo and the paid version of Schedule 1.</p>



<p>That’s effectively everything you need to know about Schedule 1 multiplayer – have fun making drugs together!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-and-skins/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/will-tarkov-arena%E2%80%99s-battle-pass-and-skins-make-it-to-the-main-game.1156587/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-and-skins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We never thought we’d see a battle pass or traditional season structure in Escape from Tarkov – and we’re kind of <strong>still not. </strong>But Escape from Tarkov: Arena, the session-based multiplayer arena shooter, is getting a battle pass system along with cosmetics and skins soon. On social media, Battlestate Games has spent the past couple of days teasing just that.</p>



<p>In a new post on Twitter, players are given a glimpse at the CQCM Mask, a favourite item amongst the game’s W-key spamming Chads, with a <strong>custom skin</strong>.</p>



<p>It starts with Arena – will it bleed into Escape from Tarkov proper?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-geared-up">Geared Up</h2>



<p>The <strong>free </strong>battle pass that’s coming to Escape from Tarkov: Arena is expected to behave exactly as you’d imagine. It’ll reward players with exclusive items, skins, and boosts in exchange for cold, hard XP grinds. The more you play, the more you’ll unlock.</p>



<p>That’s right, I said it’s <strong>free</strong>. That was something confirmed by Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov two days ago.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov: Arena isn’t free – you need to pay for that as it’s a spin-off from the core extraction shooter title.</p>



<p>Here’s the post on social media that revealed a snippet of the CQCM skin:</p>











<p>Players are now wondering how any crossover impact will ripple throughout the wider Escape from Tarkov ecosystem. Will there be a linking function allowing users to run their skins and cosmetics in Escape from Tarkov’s extraction shooter platform? I, for one, hope so. I’ve wanted to customise my gear more in Tarkov for the longest time.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov uses a ‘wipe’ pattern that typically involves resetting the game once every six months. That could easily pivot to a season structure equipped with a battle pass of sorts, but it would need BSG to pack it with content for it to be interesting. Given that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/months-add-escape-from-tarkov-gun/">takes months to add a single gun</a> to the game, that’s a <strong>huge </strong>ask that probably won’t be delivered.</p>

<p>‘A Minecraft Movie’ has now become the biggest-ever opening weekend for a video game movie with a staggering $301 million.</p>



<p>The movie completely shattered analysts predictions, who forecasted that movie would only generate $70-$80 million domestically in its opening weekend – A Minecraft Movie hit $157 million opening domestically and $144 million overseas for a global start of $301 million.</p>



<p>Domestically, at $157 million for its opening weekend now puts A Minecraft Movie as the biggest day one and weekend video game adaption, passing the previous record set by The Super Mario Bros. Movie at $146.4 million domestically over three days. A small caveat is that The Super Mario Bros. Movie released on a Wednesday, but even so earned $204 million by Sunday.</p>



<p>The movie has also become the highest-grossing movie during the opening weekend for any film releases in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie’s success means that the movie has already become highly profitable, with the film having a $150 million production budget plus marketing and distribution costs, so it wouldn’t be too surprising to see if a sequel is already being planned.</p>



<p>The video game has sold over 300 million individual copies worldwide since its release in 2011, with its success attracting the eyes of Microsoft, who purchased Mojang (Minecraft’s developers) in 2014 for $2.5 billion.</p>



<p>The film stars Jack Black, Jason Momoa, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, Sebastian Eugene Hansen and Jennifer Coolidge.</p>



<p>It’s numbers become even more impressive after new leaks online show that a version of the film is already circulating online in its entirety, meaning that piracy has already become a huge issue for the blockbuster title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1’s sole developer, Tyler, has said that the next update for Schedule 1 is scheduled to go live tomorrow.</p>



<p>In an update on X, Tyler said that the “next update is almost ready to go” and is set to be fully released on Monday. Its said that the next update in Schedule 1 will include boutique store, a pawnshop, wall decorations, and “some other fancy stuff.”</p>



<p>However, Tyler’s most recent update (which came at the time of writing) said that the v0.3.4 open beta is “taking a bit longer than expected”, and will release first thing in the morning. For those unaware, Tyler is from Australia, so players should expect the BETA update to come sometime in the afternoon for east coast players and later at night for those in the UK.</p>



<p>Schedule 1 has proven to be a massive success for the games single developer, going on to achieve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">414,000 concurrent players</a>, with that number likely to be smashed later today.</p>



<p>It’s success hasn’t come without its issues, though, as the developer is now reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing IP copyright issues and is currently being investigated for infringement</a>. As for what those issues are remains to be seen, but the developer is yet to comment on the matter.</p>



<p>Evidence on the investigation surfaced on the website&nbsp;<a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes,</a>&nbsp;featuring a document entitled: “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>



<p>Are you excited for the next Schedule 1 update? Have you played the game? Let me know what you think in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
