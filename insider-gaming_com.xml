<p>The Falcons organization officially announced the signing of Bosnian Counter-Strike superstar Nikola “⁠NiKo⁠” Kovač today, successfully bringing on the star that once rebuked them. The first significant domino to fall during the latest post-CS2 Major transfer window has fallen. </p>



<p>The plethora of resources available to the Saudi organization have finally led to the star they’ve always wanted, and the move has drastically altered the competitive CS2 landscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-second-time-s-the-charm">Second Time’s The Charm</h2>



<p>This is Falcons’ second time going after NiKo, having spent most of 2023 pursuing one of Counter-Strike’s greatest riflers. Though at the end of 2023, NiKo pivoted and chose to remain with G2 Esports for the 2024 season. G2 and NiKo fell just short of winning the Major that still eludes them, but the 2024 campaign was still a successful one. Russian AWP prodigy Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blossomed into one of the best players in the world</a>, and G2 capitalized on the signing of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guatemalan sensation Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa</a>. G2 lifted trophies at IEM Dallas, the BLAST Fall Final, and the BLAST World Final in 2024.</p>



<p>Despite the presence of the legendary Emil “Magisk” Reif, Peter “dupreeh” Rasmussen, and coach Danny “zonic” Sørensen, it was a turbulent and forgettable 2024 season for Falcons. The roster struggled throughout the year, even with Oleksandr “⁠s1mple⁠” Kostyliev playing with them on loan. The nail in the coffin was failing to qualify for the Perfect World Shanghai Major, prompting Falcons to discontinue s1mple’s loan and bench everyone not named Magisk.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Falcons are <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40627/sources-falcons-in-talks-over-heroic-trio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly considering</a> the trio of Damjan “⁠kyxsan⁠” Stoilkovski, René “⁠TeSeS⁠” Madsen and Abdul “⁠degster⁠” Gasanov, who all currently play for Danish organization Heroic. But this is the result of another instance in which Falcons have been denied the player they really want, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-will-reportedly-keep-cs2-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G2 has reportedly closed off talks for previously mentioned m0NESY</a>.</p>



<p>With the big NiKo domino now fallen, and the post-Major break ending in less than two weeks, many more new signings and transfers are expected over the next few days. </p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch helped the Japanese company to rebound spectacularly after the WiiU’s underwhelming tenure. The hybrid console has sold millions in hardware and software and is responsible for some of the highest-reviewed titles of all time. But I think it’s high time the Nintendo Switch 2 scoots its way into 2025.</p>



<p>I’ve always been a “PlayStation” guy, ever since I was a kid. I’ve had the odd Game Boy and DS, but they were fleeting and flirtatious moments—outside of excessive Pokémon&nbsp;binges. I missed out on Metroid, the best Mario games, Zelda, etc, you name it. This all changed the day I decided to invest in a Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>As a proud Switch owner, I’ve spent the last few years catching up, and I think the Nintendo Switch is a monstrous marvel. However, it feels like it’s outstayed its welcome—despite the addition of the OLED line—and I want something new to play with.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-nintendo-switch-has-has-a-good-run">The Nintendo Switch Has Has a Good Run</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Simple and superb. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s get the obvious downer out of the way—<strong>the Nintendo Switch isn’t very powerful and never has been</strong>. This hasn’t been much of a problem for its colorful and cartoony, first-party titles though. Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 3, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-super-mario-mario-kart-sets-announced-for-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart</a> 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-super-smash-bros-stages-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> have sold a couple of hundred million copies between them, and they aren’t games designed to stretch a console to its limit—<em>maybe</em> for the Switch.</p>



<p>The optimized performance and sheer smoothness of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom feel like a minor miracle. But most games can’t hit 60 FPS, and performance varies from title to title—even if the unit is docked. The Switch has reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 146 million units</a>—apparently making it the third-best-selling console behind the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS—but consumers deserve the best.</p>



<p>I may come across as entitled, but after years of enjoying crispy 4K HDR, 60 FPS gameplay on my PlayStation 5, I want the same for the Switch. I didn’t want to do this, but Pokémon&nbsp;Scarlet and Violet was the final straw. What should’ve been Game Freak’s magnum opus, turned into a performance PR nightmare. I bought Pokémon&nbsp;Scarlet on day one, and it doesn’t matter how many times Sprigatito bats its precious eyelids at me, I can’t ignore the ugliness of Scarlet and Violet’s choppy frame rate, endless bugs, and lackluster performance across the board.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s array of exclusives is second to none. This is highlighted by the returning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> in 2025, and a new 3D Mario would benefit massively from a Switch 2. First-party content isn’t an issue for Nintendo and never has been. However, one of Nintendo’s biggest problems could be solved by a Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-third-party-isn-t-bouncing-enough">Nintendo’s Third Party Isn’t Bouncing Enough</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I count two pixels here. Credit to IGN’s Mortal Kombat 1 For Switch Review.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you have exclusives selling like hotcakes, I get third-party isn’t much of a concern. I do find it puzzling Nintendo is happy to overlook this segment of the market though. Many third-party titles never see the light of day on Switch, and this is presumably due to technical limitations.</p>



<p>Those that do release have to make serious reductions. Take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-switch-hate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 1 on Switch</a> and the image of Johnny Cage above. 2023’s fighter is an unbelievable beat ’em up on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with some of the most lifelike graphics and rapid response times. Its Switch port is a shell of its next-gen contemporaries with laughably long load times, blurry graphics, and a huge reduction in textures and performance.</p>



<p>On the other hand, bigger open-world titles don’t perform too badly on Switch. Hogwarts Legacy is still quite rough around the edges but manages to hold up, and The Witcher 3 miraculously plays well—again, at the expense of huge graphical and performance-related downgrades. It’s less a case of “if it can,” and more “should it?” It earns Nintendo more money, but these are titles deserving to be experienced as they were intended.</p>



<p>If the Nintendo Switch 2 can improve its performance, even more consumers might favor the portability and dual accessibility of the Switch 2 over a PlayStation or Xbox. More sales mean revenue and happier shareholders. The next console is rumored to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced before April 2025</a>—possibly to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-releasing-march-2025-rumor-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in March 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Providing Nintendo nails it, the long-awaited follow-up could eclipse its younger sibling, and eventually become the top-selling Nintendo hardware in history.</p>



<hr>



<p>The Nintendo Switch’s run is one of the most successful and prolific in gaming history. But are you ready to see what Nintendo has in store with the Switch 2? Which potential titles and franchises would benefit the most?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[More People Play PvE in Tarkov Than You’d Think]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-people-play-pve-in-tarkov-than-you%E2%80%99d-think.1073175/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games introduced PvE to Escape from Tarkov a few months back, and it was a divisive decision that was met with mixed reviews. Many hardcore players claimed it was stripping ‘the point’ out of Escape from Tarkov, while the more casual players welcomed the change with open arms – once they’d <strong>bought </strong>the mode, of course.</p>



<p>In the Tarkov community, playing PvE is somewhat stigmatised. It’s often met with jibes from the more skilled players claiming that it’s ‘the easy way out’, or something similar. However, in a recent revelation, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov highlighted just how many people play PvE – and the number will surprise you.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-even-stevens">Even Stevens</h2>



<p>During a recent Tarkov TV stream, Nikita – the head of the studio at Battlestate Games – got onto the topic of PvE player numbers. It has long been thought that PvE gamers represent the minority in Escape from Tarkov, and while that’s true sometimes, it was proven by the numbers that things balance out over time.</p>



<p>Nikita said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the start of a wipe, 15 – 20% of players choose PvE, and 80% go for PvP. However, as the wipe progresses, the player ratio becomes roughly 50/50%.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the ‘wipe’ hits Tarkov – as it did a week ago – hundreds of thousands of players come flooding back to see what’s new and to kickstart an all-new playthrough, taking on the early-game tasks once again. However, the player count dwindles over time, as do other elements like viewership.</p>



<p>It can become stagnant within a month or two, with many players drifting off as the power players become established. Before long, it’s seen as being ‘too late’ to start the wipe, given that you’d be coming in as a fresh player against high-level opponents with the best weapons and armour.</p>



<p>The endgame loop also gets tiring for those who make it there as quickly as possible. Once the core tasks are completed and all the boxes have been ticked, it’s an endless grind of daily and weekly challenges and fruitless PvP battles.</p>



<p>The answer? It’s PvE.</p>



<p>By playing PvE, you access a more balanced playing field – perhaps an <strong>easy </strong>playing field. It’s a great introduction to Escape from Tarkov’s maps, modes, and mechanics, and in PvE, all you’re missing is real-world opponents. Aside from that element, everything else is effectively identical.</p>



<p>As the wipe goes on, 50% of Escape from Tarkov’s players gravitate towards PvE, and that’s a huge figure. Are you one of them? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>
