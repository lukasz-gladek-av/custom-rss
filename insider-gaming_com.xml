<p>PureArts is now accepting pre-orders for one of the most remarkable Assassin’s Creed collectables ever marketed. The ‘Assassin’s Creed Animus: Jacob &amp; Evie’ statue, which stands at a whopping 24 inches tall and weighs a hefty 39lbs, is available to order now and will be shipped Q4 2025.</p>



<p>If you want to secure an exclusive edition that comes with a wearable replica of Jacob Frye’s necklace, you’ll need to move fast – only 250 will be made.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-greatest-collector">The Greatest Collector</h2>



<p>This is an item that only the most hardcore fans will consider copping.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate was released in 2015 to a relatively stellar reception, emerging as the last of the ‘original formula’ games that were sunsetted when Origins was released in 2017. It saw players assume control of two protagonists – Jacob and Evie Frye – as they explored Victorian London.</p>



<p>The setting was superb, the map was meticulously created, and the story was great – if a little predictable. It had brilliant expansions, and for me, it was on home turf, so that was a bonus.</p>



<p>PureArts’ Jacob and Evie statue is 1/4 scale, which means it’s <strong>massive</strong>. For $1,299, you’re getting a hefty polyresin figure with incredible details. It has onboard LED lighting, a ‘hyperdetailed’ sculpt, and the most accurate thing you’ll see from the game short of downloading it and pressing ‘play’.</p>



<p>The Jacob and Evie statue joins a long line-up of similar figures from PureArts, who historically has poured effort into creating some of the finest collectables from the world of Assassin’s Creed.</p>



<p>Could you see yourself parting ways with $1,299 in celebration of Assassin’s Creed Syndicate? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Bungie has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released an official</a> update on the status of Marathon. The update came in the form of a nearly 10-minute long video on the game’s official YouTube channel.</p>



<p>In the video, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-replaces-marathon-game-director-with-former-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Director Joe Ziegler</a> gives an update on what’s been worked on since the last update on Marathon. He covers the direction of the game as well as plans for future updates about the game.</p>



<p>The update also doesn’t include any look at official gameplay, but does come with some concept art for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/">few of the game’s heroes</a>. If you want to watch the video for yourself, you can below.</p>



<p>As far as what was covered, Ziegler discusses the game being an extraction shooter, including diving into to what an extraction shooter is for those who may be unfamiliar with the subgenre. Ziegler also talks about taking elements from the original Marathon and expanding them for a new game with a modern audience. </p>



<p>“We’re taking a lot of familiar elements, especially a lot of the mysterious and kind of eeriness and the — how do I put it —  the psychological kind of the entire IP as it exists before,” he said. </p>



<p>“But we’re layering on some elements that we think really help modernize it, and also bring it to a new story and new world that we can sort of continue to update and delight all of you with over the course of time.”</p>



<p>Regarding how the game’s been changing during development and where things currently stand, Ziegler says that changes to the game have been “aggressive” for the past couple years along with holding multiple playtests.</p>



<p>“We’ve been testing with a lot of players,” he said. “A lot of players like yourself, also with creators. It’s sort of insanely awesome and I’m filled with gratitude when I think about it because there’s so many people who contributed by telling us, ‘Hey, this thing sucks’ or ‘This thing’s great’.”</p>



<p>He then added that there are a number of things within the game that are at different states of development. Things like the game’s environments are in a more complete state while the character models continue to be iterated through.  Marathon’s enemy models, he said, are “still kind of a little bit in an early state.”</p>



<p>Back to the characters, Ziegler gave a sneak peak at a couple of the characters in development: a runner codenamed Thief and one codenamed Stealth..</p>



<p>Ziegler then wrapped up the video stating that more content reveals are coming in 2025 for Marathon. Also coming in 2025 will be an expansion of Bungie’s playtests for Marathon to include more players. There was no hint as to when that would happen, however.</p>



<p>As far as an official release date update, that information wasn’t provided.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surprise-surprise-%E2%80%93-nuketown-24-7-is-coming-to-black-ops-6.1021269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-24-7-playlist-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s a given at this point; an expectation that we all foster when a new Call of Duty title launches. It’s axiomatic: within a matter of days following the release of a new game, there <strong>will be </strong>a 24/7 playlist. On November 1, Nuketown lands in Black Ops 6 – and dataminers have found that when it does, a 24/7 playlist for the map will go live.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-written-in-the-stars">Written in the Stars</h2>



<p>On Twitter, ‘SemtexLeaks’ uncovered a reference to a Nuketown 24/7 playlist in Black Ops 6, which will assumedly arrive when the map is added to the public pool on November 1. That means that players far and wide will be spending hours grinding the iconic, small-form map – just as our Call of Duty masters intended.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This year’s Nuketown is a ‘reimagining’ of the original map that surfaced in 2010, and by all accounts, it looks fantastic while at the same time retaining the familiar feel of the decade-and-a-bit-old environment that has re-appeared in every Black Ops game.</p>



<p>From the code uncovered in the game’s files, Nuketown 24/7 will feature a rotation of Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, Domination, Hardpoint, and Kill Order. Except for Kill Order, which is new for Black Ops 6, this is a fairly standard rotation that players have come to expect from Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>Most of the maps in Black Ops 6 have proven to be troublesome for one reason or another, so perhaps the familiarity of Nuketown will give some players a feeling of comfort after this first week of struggling.</p>



<p>Will you be jumping into Nuketown 24/7 when it drops on November 1? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is available now for everyone, and the developers at Treyarch and Raven are actively working on future updates for the game. While updates will include new additions, there are also a number of issues that the developers know need to be fixed.</p>

<p>Are you excited about Berlin’s VCT Game Changers Championship? The relatively new tournament series has become increasingly popular among Valorant fans. The co-ed series features both women and male players from various esports organizations. Here is the upcoming VCT Game Changers Championship format being used.</p>



<h2 id="h-berlin-s-vct-game-changers-championship-format">Berlin’s VCT Game Changers Championship Format</h2>



<p>The popular event will feature some of the best Valorant players in the world facing off against each other in Berlin. However, no official prize pool has been announced.</p>



<p>Still, fans are gearing up for a legendary event to see who takes home the 2024 Game Changers Championship title.</p>



<p>So, what about the format? Well, Riot Games just released the tournament format today on Twitter, let’s break it down:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>10 Teams Competing</strong></li>



<li><strong>Double-Elimination</strong></li>



<li><strong>Best-of-3 Brackets</strong></li>



<li><strong>Top Seeds From NA and EMEA Will Get a Buy Into 2nd Round</strong></li>



<li><strong>Final Matches: Best-of-5</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The series will feature competitors from the following regions of the world:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>North America</strong></li>



<li><strong>Latin America</strong></li>



<li><strong>EMEA</strong></li>



<li><strong>China</strong></li>



<li><strong>APAC</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brazil</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Grand Finals will be streamed live on the <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/status/1850930070640324947">official Valorant Twitch.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-tournament-dates">Tournament Dates</h2>



<p>Here are the official VCT Game Changers Championship dates:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>November 8 – 17, 2024.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The tournament series is meant to give Valorant fans and competitors the gaming action they need during the official VCT off-season. The actual VCT season ended in South Korea back in August of 2024 when EDward Gaming was awarded first place.</p>



<p>Luckily, Valorant understands that waiting until 2025 for more competitive Valorant action will not go over well with fans and players. </p>

<ul>
