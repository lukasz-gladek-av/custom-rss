<p>Use these Roblox Duct Tape Challenge monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Pets, Potions and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you a fan of racing games with a quirky side? If so, Duct Tape Challenge is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-death-ball-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that will definitely be worth your time. Despite being a car-related game on paper, Duct Tape Challenge offers an alternate experience to players, with the main objective being to tear through multiple layers of duct tape. Players must upgrade their cars to make them faster and give them more destructive power, as the number of layers destroyed determines how many coins they earn at the end of the run.&nbsp;</p>







<p>These coins can be used for various things within the game, including upgrading cars, buying pets, stat multipliers and a lot more. These rewards encourage players to keep grinding and beat their personal bests, as the power spikes from even the smallest of upgrades are clear to see. Although simply playing through the game will give players the resources they need to progress, using redeem codes can be a good way to get ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired Duct Tape Challenge codes. However, considering the popularity the game has garnered in recent months, new codes are likely to be released. When new codes drop, old ones tend to expire, and when that happens, this section of the article will be updated to reflect as such.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New codes are usually released through the game’s official Discord server, or sometimes through the developers’ socials as well.

That’s where this page can be a lifesaver, as we update this article as soon as any new codes drop. Bookmark this page to never miss out on any free rewards again.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Skybound Game Studios, the gaming subsidiary of Robert Kirkman’s Skybound Entertainment, is facing a sizeable lawsuit filed by iam8bit. This lawsuit alleges fraud, a breach of contract, and theft of original designs, and it was taken to the LA Superior Court for consideration.</p>



<p>The filing claims that Skybound has failed to explain financial discrepancies logged over the years of the partnership between the two firms, amongst other things. This has left iam8bit to file a considerable claim against Skybound.</p>







<h2 id="h-skybound-faces-allegations-of-financial-misconduct">Skybound Faces Allegations of Financial Misconduct</h2>



<p>Skybound Game Studios and iam8bit entered into a partnership in April 2021, and according to the complaint, Skybound has always failed to deliver monthly financial reports as agreed and has added ‘millions of dollars in fake line items’ to expense reports.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/iam8bit-is-suing-skybound-game-studios-alleging-fraud-and-theft-of-designs-000822886.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was explained</a> that an impartial auditor was introduced to the debate, and even then, Skybound couldn’t explain the finances.</p>



<p>Beyond financial woes, iam8bit has accused Skybound Games of cutting it out of a deal related to Stray, the dystopian indie smash hit that launched on PlayStation in 2022. It was claimed that Skybound used original designs created by iam8bit for promotional purposes to secure a separate deal for a Nintendo Switch release of the game.</p>



<p>It has been argued that Skybound has exploited trade secrets while scalping iam8bit’s creative output for marketing purposes.</p>



<p>This leaves iam8bit’s legal team to seek monetary damages, some kind of punitive reform, and compensation for legal fees.</p>



<p>Skybound Games has refused to comment on the lawsuit thus far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FURIA has stormed into the playoffs of the StarLadder Budapest Major, completing a flawless 3-0 run through the tournament’s third stage to cement their dominance over rivals G2 in Hungary. Heading into the series, the head-to-head between the two was locked at 3-3, but FURIA shattered that ratio with a decisive 2-0 win.</p>



<p>It was an intense series that left FURIA one step closer to lifting the trophy in Budapest.</p>



<p>The predictions don’t end with this article, though. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"></a></figure>







<h2 id="h-furia-in-the-fight-for-first">FURIA in the Fight for First</h2>



<p>The opening map in the series, Inferno, provided FURIA with early leverage, as the team secured a commanding 13-5 win over G2. It was a shock-and-awe mission for FURIA, with FalleN and YEKINDAR putting out multi-kills that left G2 flailing in the wind for much of the map.</p>



<p>Overpass came next, and again, FURIA was swinging around the map with reckless abandon. Even a brief respite provided by SunPayus with a clean pistol clapback wasn’t enough to recover those lost rounds.</p>



<p>In a post-match statement, Sid ‘sidde’ Macedo explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We were still deciding if we would full buy or not. I knew we needed a pause to organize our ideas, and FalleN came up with a very good plan of playing off the stacks, playing with numbers, and playing with smokes. Everyone contributed, and I’m glad I called the pause to bring it together.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This victory effectively breaks the deadlock with G2 and extends FURIA’s dominant streak at the Budapest Major in Hungary. The Brazilian side scooped trophies going into the Major, and now they’re looking to add another to that cabinet.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) isn’t looking to bring back Dead Space in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As first reported on the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tM8RcRXnHX8">Insider Gaming Weekly,</a> sources have told Insider Gaming that the series has been put “on ice”. That’s based on internal messaging happening within the company.</p>







<p>Sources added that with the direction of EA, they don’t expect the series to be picked back up anytime soon. That includes the idea of a remake, reboot, or sequel. </p>



<p>That said, there is still of a future for the 17-year-old series. With reports that the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Funt being in a tough spot financially after the EA sale, those who spoke under the condition of anonymity are hoping that EA, under the new ownership, would want to sell the IP.</p>



<p>This isn’t saying EA is actively looking to sell the series. This is from talking with a few people in the company that feel EA could sell it to try and pay off the debt and recoup some of the money after the deal closes next year.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-move-to-japan-kojima/</link>
            <guid>1374901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Eidos Montreal worked with Kojima Productions on the developer’s new game ‘OD’ for around a year before some of its developers were asked to move to Japan.</p>







<p>According to sources who added further context to our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past report on the current layoff situation</a> at Eidos Montreal, OD, which was previously known as Overdose, had been in development there for around a year in 2023. The game was internally known as P21, but development of the project at Eidos Montreal ceased after a request from Kojima Productions to have the developers move to Japan and cut ties with Eidos Montreal, said the people.</p>



<p>At the time of the request, around 20 developers were working on the project.</p>



<p>Kojima’s ‘Overdose’ title suffered a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-overdose-gameplay-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monumental leak in November 2022</a>, when gameplay footage obtained from the backend of YouTube by a leaker known as ‘The Snitch’ surfaced online. The two minutes of gameplay revealed that the game featured Death Stranding’s Mama (Margaret Qualley) in a blue dress and officially leaked the working name of the game as ‘Overdose’.</p>



<p>In 2023 at The Game Awards, Kojima officially announced with Jordan Peele that the game would be called ‘OD’, saying that people would “either love it or hate it”. In September 2025, a new teaser for the game, titled ‘Knock’, was released.</p>



<p>The game has seen several setbacks since its announcement, with filming for the game being delayed until 2026 due to the&nbsp;2024–2025 SAG-AFTRA video game strike. On November 23, 2025, Ubo Kier, who was set to star in the game died at the age of 81. </p>







<div><p>Kojima said in a statement on X,</p><p>“I’m at a loss for words. It all happened far too suddenly. Because of the strike, we weren’t able to shoot “<em>OD</em>” for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in Milan at the end of September, he told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year. He was full of energy then too, making me laugh with his usual “Udo-isms.” I still can’t believe this. Udo wasn’t just an actor. He was truly an “icon” of his time. We’ve lost a great “icon.” There will never be another like him. Udo, rest in peace. I will never forget you.”</p></div>



<p>It’s currently unknown when the game will officially be released, but it will be published by Xbox Game Studios.</p>
