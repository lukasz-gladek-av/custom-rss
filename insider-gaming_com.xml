<p>The current lead for the Battlefield franchise has stated that the only reason Call of Duty exists is because EA had a fallout with him. </p>



<p>The Battlefield franchise is back to its victory days with the release of BF6, finally giving the likes of Call of Duty some serious competition. Their last title, Battlefield 2042, didn’t perform well with fans, but the developers have pulled off a complete turnaround, with BF6 reaching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost 750k concurrent players</a> on launch day. </p>



<h2 id="h-vince-zampella-reveals-call-of-duty-is-only-here-because-ea-were-d-s">Vince Zampella Reveals Call of Duty is Only Here Because ‘EA Were D***s’</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GQ</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/call-of-duty-creator-and-current-battlefield-6-head-vince-zampella-says-the-only-reason-that-cod-exists-is-because-ea-were-d-ks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Vince Zampella spoke about Call of Duty’s existence. The executive vice president at Electronic Arts stated, “The only reason that&nbsp;Call of Duty&nbsp;exists is because EA were dicks”. For those unaware about Zampella’s past, he left EA after a dispute, only to make Infinity Ward in 2002, which led to the creation of the Call of Duty franchise. He later returned to EA to oversee games such as Titanfall, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,&nbsp;and Apex Legends.</p>



<p>Vince Zampella is a true veteran of the shooter genre, delivering players with some of the biggest hits in this space. He started with Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, where we worked closely with Steven Spielberg. After the dispute, Activision tasked him with creating a franchise that would kill Medal of Honor, and that was Call of Duty. However, after that, he returned to EA and is now overseeing the latest big thing in the FPS space, Battlefield. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s campaign offers players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-campaign-tells-you-to-uninstall-when-youre-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an uninstall button</a> after completion. Additionally, Black Ops 7 beta matches were nearly 99% cheater-free. What are your thoughts on Call of Duty not existing if Zampella didn’t have a fallout with EA? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sucker-punch-could-make-a-new-sly-cooper-or-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei.1324336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation has benefited from the mammoth exclusive launch of Ghost of Yotei—the follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima. Now, Sucker Punch is already looking ahead to a potential Sly Cooper or Infamous game as the next project.</p>



<p>Aside from 1999’s forgotten Rocket: Robot On Wheels, the American-based team known as Sucker Punch Studios got its career firmly on track with 2001’s Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus. This led to a further two Sly games (the fourth being handled by Sanzaru Games), before moving onto the inFamous franchise. 2009 to 2014 saw five separate inFamous experiences, and then it was time for Ghost of Tsushima. </p>



<p>Once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-like-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a>‘s Legends multiplayer update has been added, Sucker Punch is weighing up what to do next.</p>



<h2 id="h-going-back-to-sly-a-serious-possibility-for-sucker-punch-studios">“Going Back To Sly” A Serious Possibility For Sucker Punch Studios</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The next samurai story might have to wait. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/ghost-of-yotei-sucker-punch-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, Sucker Punch studio head and co-founder Brian Fleming said: “Whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time”.</p>



<p>Fleming indicates that despite the studio’s size, it can’t do more than one project at a time.</p>



<p>This follows an interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/07/17/ghost-of-yotei-directors-share-philosophy-on-balancing-freedom-with-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameInformer</a>, where Ghost of Yotei co-creative director Nate Fox said he “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-director-love-to-work-more-infamous/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Would love Sucker Punch to work on more InFamous</a>.” Again, whatever the company decides, it will likely be the only piece of media the studio develops for a few years.</p>



<p>Sucker Punch Productions has steadily become one of the most prolific and premium game studios in the world. You never hear bad words or controversy about it, and the company goes about its business creating one incredible game after another. With the main bulk of Ghost of Yotei’s development complete—aside from post-launch content—the future could be interesting.</p>



<p>What do you think? Will Sucker Punch listen to the old-school fans crying out for a new Sly or inFamous game? Is a new ‘Ghost’ game to make a trilogy a given? More importantly, what do you want to see from the incredible studio?

<p>According to a reliable source, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is set to arrive for the Nintendo Switch 2 this year, on December 5, 2025. </p>



<p>Rumours about Assassin’s Creed Shadows coming to Switch 2 have been popping up for a long time now. We first saw a PEGI rating for the Switch 2 port surface online, and then, recently, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-version-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listing at a French storefront</a> was revealed with a placeholder image and product description. Now, we have the release date as well for AC Shadows on Switch 2. </p>

Lastly, the price for the Switch 2 port has been revealed, and it seems the game can be purchased for around €50, with some retailers offering promotional offers. </p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has also already received its Claws of Awaji DLC, which adds 10 hours of content to the game, along with a new weapon, skills, and abilities. Naoe and Yasuke embark on a new adventure to secure an object for Japan’s future. </p>

<p>It’s hard to believe it’s been a year since Pokémon TCG Pocket launched. The mobile-only card-collecting experience has been a great imitation of real-life buying, collecting, and trading, and Pocket is undergoing significant changes as part of its first anniversary.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-devs-plan-to-release-a-major-update-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> is a much cheaper alternative to collecting physical Pokémon cards. It has proven to be another money-making phenomenon, with regular updates adding new sets and features. While the community is still divided over Deluxe Pack ex, more updates are being prepared in the background.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-updating-trading-amp-wonder-picks">Pokémon TCG Pocket Updating Trading &amp; Wonder Picks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s first anniversary is set to bring three major changes and improvements: A new Share feature, an upgrade to Trading, and improved Wonder Picks.</p>



<p>Firstly, the new Share feature allows you to gift one of your friends a card between one and four-Diamond rarity once a day. A quick one-off gift that should allow you to fill any collection gaps much faster.</p>



<p>The second change is the range of tradeable cards you can choose from. Recent booster packs will now be eligible for trading, and you’re no longer restricted to the old-school rarity limits.</p>



<p>The game will allow you to trade the following rarities:</p>



<ul>
<li>One-Diamond</li>



<li>Two-Diamond</li>



<li>Three-Diamond</li>



<li>Four-Diamond</li>



<li>One-Star</li>



<li>Two-Star</li>



<li>One-Shiny</li>



<li>Two-Shiny</li>
</ul>



<p>Finally, the Wonder Pick mechanic is getting a decent overhaul. The only meaningful change since the game’s launch has been the Sneak Peek bonus that appears every now and again—and it doesn’t even activate that often.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Pocket</a> channel: “Cards from the latest expansion you have not obtained will appear more often,” and “The number of cards you currently own will be displayed on each card in Wonder Pick.”</p>



<p>The anniversary announcement doesn’t say when any of these features are dropping. We’ll have to wait and see on this.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s clear the team is listening to the fanbase. Do you think these changes address key areas of the game? Is there anything else that needs to be tweaked or added?
