<p>Epic Games has confirmed a significant restructure to Winterfest rewards distributed in Fortnite, which could result in some players missing out on the full slate.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s annual Winterfest event kicked off on December 18, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-winterfest-2025-all-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">total of 16 rewards available</a> to claim for free, but an immediate bug was encountered, which was later fixed alongside confirmation that players will need to be active for the majority of the event to claim all of the rewards.</p>

<p>Unlike previous Winterfest rewards, including last year’s, the gifts available in the cabin to claim do not stack, with a maximum of one opening per day, <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2001798607070970065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite confirmed on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>This means that players who may be travelling or busy during the festive season could miss out on the biggest rewards, including the two exclusive skins, which are unlocked by claiming a total number of rewards and can’t be claimed individually.</p>



<p>There are 14 total rewards distributed from the daily gift claim in the cabin, meaning less than seven days of the entire three-week-long event can be missed if you want to claim all of the rewards.</p>



<p>To claim the Glacial Dummy Outfit, seven days’ worth of rewards need to be collected, while the Cheeks outfit is unlocked once 13 days of presents have been opened.</p>



<p>Players have already hit out at Epic Games regarding the changes over social media, pointing out that the priority for players won’t be logging into Fortnite daily over the holidays, and will instead be spending time with friends and family.</p>



<p>While it doesn’t take long to log into Fortnite and claim a Winterfest reward, the requirement for daily activity will still cause trouble for plenty of players.</p>
