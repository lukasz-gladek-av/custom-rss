<p>We’d like to think that everyone regularly showers to keep clean and healthy. While you may be sitting down for long Battlefield 6 sessions, we should be keeping that shower active. Players are reportedly being told by Battlefield 6 itself to take a shower, with the keyword being ‘reportedly.’</p>



<p>It can be hard to take anything for granted at face value in 2025. The overwhelming influx of AI means that so much of what we see online is up for debate. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-ps4-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> is an excellent shooter, and it’s easy to lose yourself, as Eminem once told us. But you definitely shouldn’t miss your opportunity to go outside, touch some grass, and keep on top of your personal hygiene!</p>



<p>Allegedly, EA is reminding you that this is the case.</p>

<figure><figcaption>To stink or not to stink, that is the question. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>An image circulated on social media of a Battlefield 6 player’s screen featuring a simple message: “Take a shower.” They were allegedly banned for a “few hours” as a result.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the alleged Battlefield 6 in-game message in its entirety:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Take A Shower. You have been playing for 16 hours straight we cannot allow you to continue on Battlefield 6 servers. We have restricted your account for a few hours please take a break. We have an obligation to keep our players and community safe. This ban is only temporary polease try again soon.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This would be quite an unprecedented message from a developer to stop the community from enjoying their game. Still, because the image is out there, it’s raising questions about its legitimacy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-s-take-a-shower-screen-real-or-ai">Is Battlefield 6’s Take A Shower Screen Real Or AI?</h2>



<p><strong>We can’t officially confirm if the message is fake, but all signs and evidence point to the Take A Shower screen being a semi-convincing case of Photoshop or AI.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, we haven’t had a single session of Battlefield 6 for 16 hours or more. Officially, we can’t debunk this. But there are several factors that should reinforce that this isn’t a real image.</p>



<h3 id="h-grammar">Grammar</h3>



<p>Where do we even start with the grammar? There’s a random space before “You” begins the paragraph, there are missing commas galore, and the sentence’s construction feels very sloppy and inorganic.</p>



<h3 id="h-qr-code">QR Code</h3>



<p>Quite simply, the QR Code doesn’t work. That’s about as big a telltale sign as you need, really. Unless our device was malfunctioning when we tried to scan it, it highlights that this image probably isn’t real.</p>



<h3 id="h-restricted-button">Restricted Button</h3>



<p>We’ve allegedly been told about the ban, why it’s happened, and that you can’t play anymore. It makes sense to have a “Quit” button, so why would there be a “Restricted” option? It reeks of an AI prompt that hasn’t fully grasped the initial request.</p>



<p>Feel free to make up your mind on the Take A Shower Screen. We don’t advise this, but if you desperately need clarification, there’s an easy way to test this: Either play the game for over 16 hours, or keep it running for that time.</p>



<p>If you manage to do any of this, let us know. Send us a picture, or go to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, so we can solve this bizarre mystery once and for all!</p>

<p>When you play Battlefield 6 online, you expect to face the wrath of human players. There’s been a lot of discussion about whether or not bots exist in Battlefield 6’s main online multiplayer modes, and we’ve got all the answers and more.</p>



<p>Barely a month into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-dlc-trophy-list-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>‘s launch, and the word bot has been used to death. It literally means nothing anymore; it’s been said or typed that much. A bot is an AI-controlled character, and you usually find them in training modes, single-player campaigns, and they’re seldom seen in online multiplayer. Which is why it’s more curious that Battlefield 6 players think BF 6 has a bot infestation.</p>



<p>There was a clear and obvious answer to this question for a long time, and then Battlefield Studios made it even easier.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-battlefield-6-have-bots">Does Battlefield 6 Have Bots?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>For those seeking a chill time. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 does feature bots in its online multiplayer component, not just the campaign.</strong></p>



<p>It’s official, Battlefield 6 has bots. They were already appearing in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Portal</a>, and in multiplayer from the game’s launch (more on this later), but EA and Battlefield Studios made this mainstream information on November 1 with the addition of the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Breakthrough</a> playlist option.</p>



<p>Here’s what the Battlefield Comms page said about it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We understand that sometimes you want to jump into Battlefield but without the intensity of a full PvP lobby. To create a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges, we’re introducing Casual Breakthrough and this new mode is now live in the main menu under the Multiplayer tab.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Casual makes it so that the majority of the lobby is AI bots—with a sprinkling of human players. This is to give users a more relaxed environment without the worry of human sweats ruining their evening. Bots are very easily identifiable as they won’t move authentically.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Introducing: Casual Breakthrough</p><p>We understand that sometimes you want to jump into Battlefield but without the intensity of a full PvP lobby. To create a more relaxed way to play while still earning progression and completing challenges, we’re introducing Casual Breakthrough…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1984667774430691819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Their movement patterns are more robotic and stiff. They also tend to stand on the spot and shoot, and you won’t find them jumping and sliding about everywhere in a bid to kill you with motion sickness. If you choose Casual Breakthrough, you’re guaranteed to come up against bots, but let’s find out why you’re coming up against them outside of this mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-are-bots-appearing-in-battlefield-6-matchmaking">Why Are Bots Appearing In Battlefield 6 Matchmaking?</h2>



<p><strong>Bots can be used to populate any Battlefield 6 server if the matchmaking system is struggling to fill the lobby.</strong></p>



<p>This has been an ongoing issue since day one: Lobbies being filled up with extra bots to make up the numbers. Battlefield 6 has a more than healthy player count, and will continue to do so for months, maybe years. The game is popular, everyone is enjoying the return to form, and it’s bizarre that bots can appear so regularly.</p>



<p>I’ve encountered my share of bots during later EU hours, and it’s been reported that “Outside peak hours, most lobbies are filled with bots in non-EU/US regions,” according to Reddit.</p>



<p>Multiple regions are reporting that they encounter bots outside of the peak windows, too. Adding bots is simply the most effective way to ensure lobbies are filled with players and there’s no team disparity—especially chaotic 64-player Conquest games, for example.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Worryingly, EA nor Battlefield Studios (as of writing) has yet to address the problem. The closest they’ve come to acknowledging bots is the Casual Breakthrough announcement, and that’s it. Given that a big goal for Battlefield 6 was complete player communication, we’re hoping for some feedback or acknowledgement sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>How frequently are you encountering bots in non-Casual Breakthrough matches? Is it harming your enjoyment of the game?
