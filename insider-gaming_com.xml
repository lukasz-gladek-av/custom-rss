<p>Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé says he’s surprised that Microsoft hasn’t released more Xbox games for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In an interview with The Game Business, Reggie discussed Xbox’s third-party strategy and admitted he expected to see far more crossover between the two platforms by now.</p>







<p><strong>“I’m surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective,”</strong> <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">Fils-Aimé sa</a><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">i</a><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">d</a>. <strong>“Certainly, some games could easily be ported over to Switch 2. And I’m surprised that we haven’t seen more of that.”</strong></p>



<p>Fils-Aimé went on to say he thought Xbox would have announced several new titles ahead of the holidays.</p>



<p><strong>“I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday,”</strong> he said.<strong> “All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement. And I’m surprised it hasn’t happened.”</strong></p>



<p>Currently, Microsoft has released Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 on the Switch 2 with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle set to come sometime in 2026. Aside from that, however, there hasn’t been any other first-party port or new released announced for Nintendo’s latest console. </p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-says-they-want-to-support-the-switch-2">Xbox Says They Want To Support The Switch 2</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, just after the Switch 2 was announced, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said that he wants to support the Switch 2. He even went as far to say that Nintendo has been a “great partner” for Xbox.</p>







<p><strong>“I’m really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them,”</strong> Spencer said at the time. “<strong>And getting the support from them for our franchises, I think, is an important part of our future.”</strong></p>



<p>While many expect more first party Xbox games to make their way to the Switch 2, when it happens remains anyone’s guess. In the meantime, all fans can do is hope.</p>
