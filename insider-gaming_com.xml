<p>Square Enix celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Kingdom Hearts series in 2022. Kingdom Hearts 4 was unveiled during the special presentation, showing us how glorious a next-gen KH could look, but the project has gone quiet since.</p>



<p>I have played Kingdom Hearts 1 to death, and it’s one of my favourite games ever. Sequels have grabbed my attention, but a warmth resides in me when I think of KH1. Recent Kingdom Hearts titles have so many narrative strands weaving about all over the place that it’s hard to keep up sometimes, but there’s no mistaking the brilliance of the franchise. </p>



<p>Director Nomura Tetsuya has said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-is-heading-towards-the-conclusion-of-the-series-says-game-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 4 is heading toward the end of the series</a>. But many players want to know what they’re getting with Kingdom Hearts 4 before they contemplate the future.</p>

<p>The April 10, 2022, Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary Celebration featured trailers for new KH games. The final announcement was for <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-iv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, and featured a set-piece battle between Sora and a skyscraper-sized Heartless boss.</p>



<p>It ends with a comical cameo featuring Donald and Goofy. Those closing moments were the last we’d see for three years. We reported in 2024 that a leaker had outed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 release date for Kingdom Hearts 4</a>. We’re a third of the way through 2025, and still have heard nothing—making this report feel thinner by the day.</p>



<p>The only thing Square Enix has said about KH recently is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-series-is-coming-to-steam-in-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts is finally coming to Steam</a>. It’s at the point now where I’d forgotten KH4 exists until I saw social media today. In today’s ever-evolving and fast-paced game industry, it’s hard to believe it’s been three years since Kingdom Hearts 4 was announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-dont-come-with-a-download-code-its-all-on-the-same-cartridge/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games have been confusing because of their contents, but Nintendo has clarified that they don’t include download codes, and everything is on the game cartridge.</p>



<p>The physical and digital media conversation is louder than ever. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost-physical-digital-game-prices-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2’s increased game costs</a> have made physical media the costliest it’s ever been. But when players are paying for physical media and receiving digital media instead, it sends mixed signals.</p>



<p>There’s been unrest and understandable headscratching over the Switch 2’s games and what you get. There’s been talk of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/not-all-nintendo-switch-2-games-include-game-on-cartridge-despite-prices-of-up-to-90/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 physical Nintendo Switch 2 games</a> giving you a code instead of a game cartridge. One thing we know for sure is that if you buy a Switch 2 Edition release, you don’t get a code.</p>



<h2 id="h-switch-2-edition-games-have-everything-on-the-game-cartridge">Switch 2 Edition Games Have Everything on The Game Cartridge</h2>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vooks</a>, Nintendo addressed Switch 2 game cartridge concerns: “That physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will <strong>include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card</strong> (i.e. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code).”</p>



<p>So, if you’re buying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild</a> Switch 2 Edition, you get the game’s box and a cartridge inside with the full upgraded version of the RPG—<strong>no code required or included</strong>.</p>



<p>However, Nintendo did clarify that this applies to first-party exclusives: “Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.” We’ve seen this before with Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Black Flag and Rogue bundle featuring a physical case and a download-only code inside it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-selling-switch-2-consoles-us-at-a-loss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-could-be-selling-switch-2-consoles-%E2%80%98at-a-loss%E2%80%99-in-the-us-but-they-can-take-it.1160133/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-selling-switch-2-consoles-us-at-a-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by a securities analyst that Nintendo could be shaping up to sell every Switch 2 console ‘at a loss’ based on the estimated costs of the bill of materials. This is because of the recent tariffs imposed by the United States government, and it’s assuming that they stay at 10%.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-uneven-ground">Uneven Ground</h2>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-10/nintendo-s-pivotal-switch-2-launch-boosted-by-trump-tariff-pause?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bloomberg</a>, the scope of the financial situation surrounding Nintendo and Trump’s tariffs came into question.</p>



<p>Hideki Yasuda of Toyo Securities in Japan explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We believe the Switch 2’s bill of materials is around $400, meaning Nintendo would still be selling consoles at a loss in the US with the 10% tariff — but the loss would be something Nintendo would be able to absorb.</p>



<p>Sony is in a tougher situation as most of its PlayStation production is in China, and it may be forced to hike PS5 prices in the US in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2’s price point is much higher than that of the first console, released in 2017, but Nintendo recently went on record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-why-switch-2-so-expensive/">explaining why that is</a>. It’s all to do with the quality of the offering and the upgrades over the first console – and inflation also weighs into the debate.</p>



<p>In the Bloomberg report, Bernstein’s Robin Zhu explained how Nintendo could raise prices if the tariffs escalate:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If the tariffs stay at 10%, Nintendo probably keeps pricing at $450 and just takes the hit on margin.</p>



<p>At 46% Vietnam tariffs, I expected them to raise by $50 to $100.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These tariffs are wreaking havoc on the pre-order situation in the United States and Canada. Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been put on hold as manufacturers and retailers across the region contend with what might happen next.</p>
