<p>Activision has unveiled the bracket for the Call of Duty League’s first ‘Minor’, one of the new tournaments set up to make the CDL 2025 season feel much more dense. The Minor tournaments offer a stopgap between Majors, and while they have a much smaller prize pool, they’ll feature just as much excitement and skill from the players.</p>



<p>Minor tournaments are hosted online and feature a one-shot $20,000 prize for the ultimate victor.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minor-win-major-effort">Minor Win, Major Effort</h2>



<p>The first CDL Minor will occur between January 10 and 12, and all twelve teams in the CDL are invited to participate. It’s a single-elimination tournament, which means every loss will knock one team out of the running for the $20,000 prize.</p>



<p>Here are the opening matches for the first CDL Minor tournament:</p>



<p><strong>Friday, Jan 10</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Los Angeles Guerillas M8 vs. Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe vs. Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Vegas Falcons vs. OpTic Texas</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York vs. Vancouver Surge</li>
</ul>



<p>From there, Boston, Carolina Royal Ravens, Toronto Ultra, and LAT will all wait to see who their opponent will be, having earned a bye earlier in the qualifying rounds.</p>



<p>The action will wrap up on January 12 and the winner of the first-ever CDL Minor will be crowned after becoming $20,000 richer. </p>



<p>On Friday, January 17, the qualification matches for Major I recommence after the festive break. On January 30, the first European Major in CDL history will take place in Madrid, running until February 2. The pattern will continue until COD Champs, which is yet to be officially revealed but should take place in June or July this year.</p>



<p>It’s widely believed that this year’s Call of Duty League Championship will take place in Canada.</p>



<p>It’s an exciting time to be a Call of Duty esports fan. What are you most looking forward to from this season?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/amd-announces-new-ryzen-9000-cpus-at-ces-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>AMD has officially unveiled its new Ryzen 9000 CPUs during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJoaV5NnPtw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its press event</a> at CES 2025 in Las Vegas.</p>



<p>AMD started with the reveal of the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D processors. Starting with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, the high-end CPU features 16 cores with 32 threads. It also features up to 144MB in total cache thanks to 3D V-cache boosted CCDs (Core Chiplet Dies). Breaking the cache down, it’s 64MB Zen 5 CCDs and 64GB from X3D. There’s also 16mb L2 cache for the 144MB total. For everything it includes, the CPU carries a TDP of 170W.</p>



<p>The 9900X3D CPU comes in with a little less power, but not by much. The processor comes with 12 cores and 24 threads with 140MB of total cache and a 5.5GHz max clock speed. It has a TDP of 140W. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Ryzen 9 9950X3D</th><th>Ryzen 9 9900X3D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cores</td><td>16</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Threads</td><td>32</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Max Boost</td><td>5.7GHz</td><td>5.5GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Total Cache</td><td>144MB</td><td>140MB</td></tr><tr><td>TDP</td><td>170W</td><td>140W</td></tr><tr><td>Release Date</td><td>Q1 2025</td><td>Q1 2025</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>TBA</td><td>TBA</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As far as performance is concerned, AMD says the new cards are up to 8% faster — on average — than the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. Some games like Black Myth Wukong only saw a  1% performance increase. Games like Counter-Strike 2, however, saw a 58% jump.</p>



<p>When comparing to Intel’s latest Core Ultra 285K CPU, AMD says the Ryzen 9950X3D sees an average performance increase of 20% at 1080p on high settings. Games like Final Fantasy 14, FarCry 6, and Watch Dogs: Legion were over 40% faster per AMD. Black Myth Wukong saw performance around the same while Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora performed slightly better.</p>



<p>Both of the new CPUs are scheduled to launch in March. An exact release date along with final pricing will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Intel isn’t leaving the discrete graphics card market anytime soon. During the company’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwYUiSXDZ5A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CES 2025 keynote</a> on Monday, Intel’s new co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus said that the company remains “committed” to the market moving forward.</p>



<p>“I get this question a lot,” Holthaus said. “We are very committed to the discrete graphics market, and we will continue to make strategic investments in this direction.”</p>



<p>Intel launched its latest Arc Battlemage graphics card, the B580, last month for $249. The entry-level card features 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, and a 192-bit memory bus. The next Battlemage card, the B570, is scheduled to launch on January 16. That card will cost $219 and feature 10GB of GDDR6 VRAM and 18 Xe2 cores. </p>



<p>In addition to the new Battlemage cards, Intel is working on the next-gen Celestial and Druid cards. Those, however, are still years away. Intel has made it clear their goal isn’t to contend with cards like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 and 5090. Instead, they want to give budget conscious PC users more options.</p>



<p>What do you think of Intel continuing on with graphics cards? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/tech.9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
