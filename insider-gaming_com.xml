<p>Bloober Team is hot off the heels of its 2024 success. Cronos: The New Dawn is a brand-new IP from the makers of the Silent Hill 2 Remake, and it has everything you could want from a survival-horror game: A nervous atmosphere, a constant feeling of trepidation and jeopardy, grotesque monsters, and an inventory so limited you’re wondering if you can stuff a few more ammo clips into your suit.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> feels <em>safe</em>—and I hate using that word with new games, as it feels like an insult. It feels like a pejorative, but in many cases (this one especially) it’s a compliment. Bloober Team throws out the odd new idea here and there, but the game feels like a well-rounded survival horror title with an interesting story.</p>



<p>The game’s central enemy mechanic revolves around the concept of merging, and it feels like Cronos has dipped its hand into the best pots, aptly creating an amalgamation of tried and tested horror tropes to produce a polished and impactful debut.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-review">Cronos: The New Dawn Review</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Did you pay for your fare? I don’t think so. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>You are a nameless Traveler: A mysterious figure sent to retrieve items, uncover time rifts to gain a deeper understanding of the planet’s implosion, and explore its fallen remnants in search of The Traveler who came before you. The ‘Change’ brought the world to its knees and executed it in cold-hearted fashion. All that remains is a series of monsters—each more unpleasant than the last—who merge with defeated enemies and become stronger—which is a real problem for you!</p>



<p>I found the first hour of <a href="https://cronosnewdawn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> to be a bit slow and unengaging, to be honest. You think of Silent Hill 2’s foggy and genuinely haunting opening moments, whereas Dead Space hits you with loud, blaring danger sirens as a Necromorph tries to pierce you in a tense elevator chase sequence. Any lingering doubts quickly evaporated into intrigue as the story and gameplay improved progressively. It crescendoed by the end of my 14 hours in Cronos’ hellscape, and I was truly left wanting more when the credits rolled.</p>



<p>The story feels a bit ambiguous and ambitious for its scope at times, but the final payoff is satisfying. It probably requires a second playthrough to fully grasp the intricacies of the narrative’s details, which are revealed through cutscenes and typical world-building notes and tapes scattered throughout the game’s various vile and decrepit biomes.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-fix-what-isn-t-broken">Don’t Fix What Isn’t broken</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nope. Just nope. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve played any survival-horror game before, Cronos swiftly becomes second-nature. You need to be accurate, and learning the game’s charge-up mechanic is crucial to make shots stronger and optimize ammo management. The upgrade system is a slow-burner (don’t expect to upgrade even half your gear by the time your first playthrough is done), and the pacing ducks and dives between combat-heavy encounters and exploration.</p>



<p>The game genuinely improves as it unfolds, allowing you to acquire more weapons and tools. I would’ve liked more variety in the weaponry, but your flame Tool and explosive bombs you get somewhat compensate. Cronos’ level designs range from snowy exteriors to dank, dilapidated residential buildings with monsters scuttling around every surface. You risk eternal dizziness as you need to have your head on a swivel, lest you get pounced on by an unsuspecting enemy.</p>



<p>My favorite portion of Cronos was a hospital section midway through the game—no prizes for where the inspiration came from here. Puzzles aren’t really at the forefront of Cronos’ design, but this area requires multiple keys, and special items are necessary for doors and hidden areas. The tension was palpable throughout, too. My anxiety and nervousness were through the roof as I ventured into unknown corridors and rooms, and there wasn’t enough absorption in the world to mop up my terror sweats.</p>



<p>Cronos has jump scares aplenty, and its addictive 80s synth music offsets any built-up paranoia you’re likely to experience. As much as you won’t want to, searching the vicinity is a must. Despite being advertised as a hard game, I comfortably finished Cronos with under 10 deaths—but I am well-versed in the genre. Seek out Energy, look for Cores, and your cat-like curiosity will be rewarded—there are literally cat collectibles. </p>



<p>If you’re worried there’s not enough of a challenge, a Hard Mode is unlocked at the end, along with a New Game+ setting.</p>



<h2 id="h-room-for-one-more-please">Room For One More, Please?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An explosive journey. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ll flat-out say Cronos’ inventory system is frustrating beyond belief. It’s probably the most oppressive balancing act since Resident Evil 0. If you don’t focus your Core upgrades on increasing your inventory slots ASAP, you’re going to suffer. Each ammo slot doesn’t hold much, and you can never truly have a consistent balance of ammunition, weapons, and health.</p>



<p>If you find a health item out in the open, you can’t use it; it <em>has</em> to be in your inventory. The only way to drop items is to permanently discard them. You’re telling me we can have magical inventory boxes that can transfer your gear from one safe area to the next, but I can’t use a first aid pickup right in front of me?</p>



<p>You often have compulsory story items taking up slots, and I ended up not really using the game’s central burning mechanic because each flame canister—you guessed it—takes up an inventory slot. I felt punished for minimizing ammo and resource waste. Now, I think the game’s Hard Mode will be better-suited for me, and inexperienced horror fans are probably going to chew through supplies faster than a hungry mouse does a block of cheese, but veterans might get the ick from the system’s obtrusiveness.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-verdict">Cronos: The New Dawn Verdict</h2>



<p>The critic in me will say Cronos: The New Dawn isn’t transcendent. Again, this is ok. What Cronos does, it does very well, and taking the recency bias of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-silent-hill-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> out of the equation, I can’t recall a new survival-horror game I’ve enjoyed this much and found this immersive in a while.</p>



<p>Once it gets going, Cronos batters you with a buffet of scares, stress, and superb combat. I can’t overlook the stingy inventory management headaches that will last a lifetime, but there’s no denying that Cronos: The New Dawn wants you to think and strategize. I’ll wrap up this review by saying Cronos: the New Dawn is an excellent new survival-horror title. If you have an interest in the genre, this is a must-play, and old-school horror fans will love this: Such is our calling.</p>

<p>The Sonic Series Producer has stated that Mario Kart World did not influence Sonic Racing CrossWorlds in any way. </p>



<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds launches this month on September 25, 2025. Ahead of the release, players will be able to try the game through an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-getting-free-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open network test</a> scheduled for mid-September. Ahead of that, the developers have revealed how Mario Kart World had no impact on their upcoming title’s development plans.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-did-not-influence-sonic-racing-crossworlds-development-plans">Mario Kart World Did Not Influence Sonic Racing CrossWorlds Development Plans</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://traxion.gg/sonic-series-producer-was-surprised-by-mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Traxion</a> (via <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/09/02/sonic-team-boss-mario-kart-world-wont-have-any-influence-on-sonic-racing-crossworlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyNintendoNews</a>), Sonic Series Producer Takashi Iizuka spoke about Mario Kart World’s impact on Sonic Racing CrossWorlds. Izuka first stated that, like everyone, they are also unaware of the “road map of Mario Kart titles” and were “surprised” when it was released. At the same time, the developers were expecting one to be released soon, as Nintendo “typically” releases a new karting title with new hardware.</p>



<p>However, Iizuka added, “Whether or not Mario Kart was going to be released, our goal was to develop the best kind of Sonic racing title. That hasn’t changed – Mario Kart World won’t have any influence.” Izuka also spoke about the differences between the two games, which include cross-play, a customizable gadget system, characters from other IPs, Travel Rings, and more. </p>



<p>He stated that these features add “depth to the racing and are something other kart racers aren’t doing.” Izuka concluded, saying, “Even though Mario Kart World was announced, it didn’t influence our development plans.”</p>



<p>In other news, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-full-character-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete character list</a> has been revealed, including launch, season pass, and bonus characters.
