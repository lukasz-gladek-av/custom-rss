<p>Marvel Rivals, one of the most popular games of the moment, is to receive a Christmas-themed event. The information was released today (16) by <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1868702639585980656">NetEase Games</a>. The event starts on December 20th and will last until January 9th.</p>



<p>Called The Winter Celebration, the event will feature a new game mode focused on Jeff. Called Jeff’s Winter Splash Festival, the mode is very reminiscent of Splatoon, where the two teams have to use the shark to “paint” the map. The winner is whoever paints the largest part of the territory within a time limit.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In addition to this themed mode, the team will deliver new themed skins for Venom, Rocket, Jeff himself, Groot, and Magic. Jeff’s skin will be free in keeping with the good spirit of the time.</p>



<p>The team has also promised surprises, but no further details have been released. Despite the event being viewed favorably, players are making a series of demands on the game’s social networks. Among them are requests for a mode where players can select their hero’s category before the match, the possibility of voting on maps, and, of course, a better balance between the characters.</p>



<p>As Marvel Rivals has only just been released, the team will certainly need more time to work on these additional features. Even balancing takes time, after all, there are dozens of different characters.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Marvel Rivals during the Christmas event? Let us know in the comments and join the discussion on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">forum</a>!</p>

<p>It appears Ubisoft is genuinely committed to Steam, as they’ve announced not one but three classic titles on the platform will receive achievements. Alongside all of the Ghost Recon Wildlands achievements, you can also unlock Steam Achievements in Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin’s Creed Unity as of December 16. For now, let’s focus on the tactical shooter!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-ghost-recon-wildlands-achievement-added-to-steam">Every Ghost Recon Wildlands Achievement Added to Steam</h2>



<p>In all, there are now <strong>57 Steam Achievements</strong> in Ghost Recon Wildlands, with the majority unlocking throughout the main campaign and side missions. There are, thankfully, a few specific to Fallen Ghosts and Operation Narco Road. You shouldn’t have much trouble achieving 100% in Wildlands, though!</p>

<p>Mafia: The Old Country, from developer Hangar 13 and publisher 2K Games, is the fourth mainline entry in the long-running Mafia series and a return to the game’s roots. Whereas the last game, Mafia 3, took a spin on the old-school mafia theme by following Lincoln Clay dismantling the Italian Mafia step-by-step, The Old Country brings the story back to its origins by focusing on Italy, where the Italian Mafia began. We’re still a ways off from release, though, and information about the potentially third-person action game remains scarce. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-mafia-the-old-country-release-date">When is the Mafia: The Old Country Release Date?</h2>



<p>Following a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer leak</a> supposedly from The Game Awards, we now know that Mafia: The Old Country will launch in the summer of 2025. However, an exact release date is currently unavailable.</p>

<p>Of course, a teaser trailer is one thing, the actual trailer is way more impressive:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-are-playing-path-of-exile-2-poe2-player-numbers-and-all-time-peak/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Path of Exile 2 launched into Early Access on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on December 6, and within less than two weeks (as of this writing), it skyrocketed to become one of the top three most-played titles on Steam. The ARPG is pushing serious numbers, outpacing Diablo IV’s recent expansion and surpassing Marvel Rivals, PUBG, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Valve’s digital storefront. So, what kind of player numbers are we talking about for Path of Exile 2?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-players-does-path-of-exile-2-have">How Many Players Does Path of Exile 2 Have?</h2>



<p>On a Monday morning, before holiday vacations, as we explore Path of Exile 2’s significant player numbers, there are approximately <strong>370,000 active players</strong> in-game at the time of publication, and that’s just on Steam. That’s an absolutely staggering number of Witches, Mercenaries, and Monks grinding levels to defeat Count Geonor at the end of Act 1 or Jamanra, The Abomination, at the end of Act 2.</p>



<p>Of course, these numbers will fluctuate throughout the week and in the coming months, and we’ll likely see a massive influx of players next year when Path of Exile 2 inevitably launches as a free-to-play ARPG for everyone.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-all-time-peak-number-of-players-for-path-of-exile-2">What’s the All-Time Peak Number of Players for Path of Exile 2?</h2>



<p>While the current number of people playing Path of Exile 2 is impressive, the all-time peak, achieved on December 8, is jaw-dropping. On that day, the latest hit from developer Grinding Gear Games had a total of <strong>578,569</strong> players on Steam. We don’t have numbers for the GGG launcher, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S, unfortunately.</p>



<p>Again, I fully expect the team to beat this number next year. As Path of Exile 2 progresses through Early Access, we’ll receive additional monsters, bosses, story acts, classes, and ascendancies to choose from. This very well could become the largest ARPG to date!</p>



<p>What do you think of Path of Exile 2? Let us know in the comments below, or visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a> to discuss your favorite class and build!</p>

<p>Nvidia’s upcoming GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards were recently spotted on Zotac’s website.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/zotac-confirms-geforce-rtx-5090-with-32gb-gddr7-memory-5080-and-5070-series-listed-as-well" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, Zotac’s website featured listings for the upcoming, next-gen Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs. These listings have been removed; however, there are still some hints that point towards an upcoming announcement. If you head to Zotac’s <a href="https://www.zotac.com/us/product/graphics_card/all?field_filter_g_memory_type_tid%5B%5D=2954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will observe new additions to its filters section. Players can filter the GPUs on the website by GDDR7 memory type and 32 GB capacity; these features are not available for the current RTX 40 series GPUs.</p>



<p>Five new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs surfaced on Zotac’s website, including RTX 5090, RTX 5090D (China Exclusive), RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070. The website didn’t feature the RTX 5060 and RTX 5080D GPUs. The listing also confirms 32 GB GDDR7 memory for the upcoming GPUs. With the graphics cards already surfacing on hardware manufacturer’s websites, it seems like Nvidia might be gearing up for an announcement soon. </p>
