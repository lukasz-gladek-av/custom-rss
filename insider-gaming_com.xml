<p>Use these Roblox Spear Fishing monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gems, Coins and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spear Fishing, as the name hints, is a fishing-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forge-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> simulation. Your only job is to hunt down the rarest sea creatures in the water areas using Harpoons, Baits, Fish Basket, and Spear Guns. To kill Mythic, Legendary, and even Epic creatures, in some cases, you’ll need the finest tools. However, one must spend a large number of Coins and Gems to purchase them. This is when the active Spear Fishing codes come into action, as they can be redeemed for free Gems and Coins. This guide features all active codes, the code redemption process, tips for investing the free resources, and more.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nikita Trolls Escape from Tarkov Players with PAY2WIN Reward Code]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-reward-code-pay2win/</link>
            <guid>1375732</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, has trolled the Escape from Tarkov community with a code appropriately named ‘PAY2WIN’. On social media, the prolific developer posted an image featuring some of the most valuable items in Escape from Tarkov, announcing that a code would drop soon, suggesting that those very items would be obtainable.</p>



<p>When the code dropped, it was with a tongue-in-cheek reference: ‘PAY2WIN’. However, upon redeeming the code, players quickly learned that they’d been hilariously duped.</p>







<h2 id="h-pay2win-was-a-joke-all-along">PAY2WIN Was a Joke All Along</h2>



<p>The code that Nikita Buyanov was teasing led users to believe they’d be getting <strong>stacks</strong> of stuff in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>This image included an FLIR optic, an Altyn helmet, stacks of Bitcoins, and a THICC case, amongst other things. However, shortly after, Nikita revealed the code, PAY2WIN, and users quickly set about redeeming it in the game’s launcher.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The bundle was ultimately unveiled as one of the worst stacks of items you’d ever hope to get in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This includes some of the most useless weapons, such as the TOZ and the Blicky, one of the smallest backpacks, a pack of croutons, a fuze (but no grenade), and a replica helmet. You literally couldn’t have asked for a worse bundle.</p>



<p>It’s not often that the Escape from Tarkov developers crack a joke like this, but they’ve admittedly given away quite a lot of stuff recently with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-escape-from-tarkov-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more reward codes</a>.</p>



<p>It’s often pointed out that ‘free is free’, but perhaps this bundle isn’t even worth anything!</p>







<p>Did you redeem the code in Escape from Tarkov? Let us know if you’re happy with your little Blicky on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The Streamer Awards have wrapped for another year, and the trophies have all been dished out to the most deserving content creators of 2025. It was a mixed bag, and while most awards were fairly predictable, there were a few hidden gems in the line-up. The least surprising of all was the award for Best VTuber, which went to TheBurntPeanut.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has had a stellar year, putting up some remarkable numbers and growing at an alarming pace on account of his entertaining, high-energy content, hilarious animations, and genuinely enjoyable gameplay. This year, he pushed Ironmouse out of the spot that the former champion had held for three years straight.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-is-your-vtuber-of-the-year">TheBurntPeanut is Your VTuber of The Year</h2>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar with TheBurntPeanut, all you need to do is check out a compilation of his most entertaining clips on YouTube to get a taste of his brand. He’s an animated peanut that uses a mix of skins and ‘costumes’, combined with an energetic commentary and some hilarious gameplay, to keep tens of thousands of viewers entertained at any given time.</p>



<p>This year has been transformative for TheBurntPeanut, who has used games like Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders to propel himself into the major spotlight.</p>



<p>At The Streamer Awards this year, the nominations were pretty close to call:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chibidoki</li>



<li>Ironmouse</li>



<li>Kenji</li>



<li>Mori Calliope</li>



<li>TheBurntPeanut</li>
</ul>



<p>Ironmouse had previously won the VTuber of the Year award at The Streamer Awards for three consecutive years, but TheBurntPeanut’s stellar year managed to push him into the top spot.</p>



<p>In his acceptance speech, TheBurntPeanut said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am honored to accept this Best VTuber of the Year award.</p>



<p>It is a great honor to accept this Best VTuber of the Year award, big shout-out to QTCinderella for putting on this immaculate award ceremony as well as a shout-out to the Peanut team, making sure the streams are always the best they can be.</p>



<p>Obviously, the largest shout-out to the Bungulators, you guys are the best, thank you for all the support, gentlemen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full ceremony can be watched here:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>TheBurntPeanut also scooped the award for Best FPS Streamer, making him one of only a few streamers to walk away with more than one award at the event.</p>
