<p>A new update from Battlefield 6 developers reveals that bots are being reintroduced to Verified Experiences. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 developers have been addressing bots across various modes in their title since the game’s launch. The lead producer recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-bots-system-explained-by-lead-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> how the bot system works in BF6, the criteria that need to be met, and how they can help the situation. Now, a new update reveals that bots will be returning for their community experiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-bots-will-grant-reduced-xp-and-each-game-mode-supports-12-of-them">Battlefield 6 Bots Will Grant Reduced XP and Each Game Mode Supports 12 of Them</h2>



<p>The latest update regarding bots returning to Battlefield 6’s Verified Experiences was shared through an official post from the BattlefieldComms <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986550835615027359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). <span>The developers had&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981556746482307086" target="_blank">temporarily removed</a>&nbsp;bots from Verified Experiences to support healthier matchmaking in their Community Servers and Portal Experiences update last month,</span> and are now reintroducing them to Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The post explains that each game mode will support up to 12 bots. If bot backfill is enabled, matches will require eight players to start, with up to 6 bots filling each team. If backfill is not enabled, you will need 20 players to start the match. </p>



<p>Bots will provide reduced XP in BF6, and player XP will remain at 100% (similar values to Multiplayer modes). Moreover, when bots are enabled, players’ statistics, such as hours played, kill/death ratio, and total revives, will not show any gains or losses. The stats system is currently not functioning as intended and is being actively adjusted. Lastly, challenges will remain completable.</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 players are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-players-turn-off-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editing game files</a> to turn off matchmaking against ‘overpowered’ aim assist. Additionally, the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million copies</a> across all platforms.
