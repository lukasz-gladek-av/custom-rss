            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-gamecube-controller-not-compatible-with-switch-2-games-just-gamecube-classics/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s come to the Nintendo community’s attention that the new Nintendo GameCube Controller—set to launch with the Switch 2—can is only usable with the limited collection of classic GameCube titles via Nintendo Switch Online.</p>



<p>A cool bonus during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> was the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-online-adds-gamecube-games-to-nintendo-switch-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameCube integration for Switch Online</a>. Nintendo’s library of retro games is growing even more, thanks to GameCube additions. Legendary properties, including Pokémon Stadium and Super Mario Sunshine, will make up the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.</p>



<p>A line of official Nintendo GameCube Controllers are coming too—featuring the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-is-for-gamechat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C-Button</a>. But if you’re looking to grab this super-special controller, take heed of its limited capabilities.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It’s very restrictive. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The “Classic Nintendo GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch 2!” video on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoUK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo UK YouTube channel</a> features an explainer of the new GameCube Expansion features. We also get treated to a look at the new GameCube controller, but a small-print message toward the end is easily missed. </p>



<p>At <strong>2:13</strong>, a message at the top of the screen reads: “<strong>The controller is only compatible with Nintendo GameCube—Nintendo Classics.</strong>“</p>



<p>The controller isn’t expected to be cheap, and it’s also quite exclusive. It’s only: “Available for Nintendo Switch Online members” on the My Nintendo Store. Unless you’re a die-hard Nintendo or GameCube fan or collector, this is another big cost for a piece of hardware only usable with a small handful of games.</p>

<p>Between the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price of the Switch 2</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost-physical-digital-game-prices-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of the games</a>, and even a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2s-paid-tutorial-welcome-tour-almost-made-a-player-fall-asleep-at-nintendo-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid tutorial</a>, the Switch 2 costs soon adds up. Are you desperate for a new GameCube controller? Or is this one step too far, and you’re looking to use the new Pro Controller or Joy Con 2?</p>

<p>Razer has quietly started to pause the sales of some of its products to the US over tariffs.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645276/razer-blade-gaming-laptops-sales-pause-us-tariffs?utm_content=buffer99c07&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bsky.app&amp;utm_campaign=verge_social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Razer has stopped the pre-order and purchase of its new Blade 16 laptop on its US site. According to the Internet Archive, the laptop was avaiable on April 1st, but was removed the next day after Trump announced the new tariffs.</p>



<p>The Verge contacted Razer’s Public Relations Manager, Andy Johnston for comment on the removal, to which the he replied, “We do not have a comment at this stage regarding tariffs.”</p>



<p>The direct link to the Blade 16 configurator now takes you to a 404 error page on the US site, while other regions pages are still operational.</p>



<p>Razer has several key partners and manufacturing facilities all over the world (like most technology giants), but primarily such facilities are based in China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, who have all been impacted by Trump’s new tariffs.</p>



<p>Razer isn’t the only tech giant to pause pre-orders and sales of its products in the USA either as last week, Nintendo also it would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pausing pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 in the US</a> but still maintaining its June release date.</p>



<p>According to sources, Nintendo already has a decent stock supply of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles in the US, but tariff rises and uncertainty for their next batches of shipments means that a price hike is almost certainly going to happen. At the time of writing, the Nintendo Switch 2 is currently priced at $449.99.</p>

<p>Blue Prince is destined to win many awards in 2025, making it a popular prospect. If you want to play Blue Prince for yourself, we have the latest details on potential platforms, including PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC through Steam.</p>



<p>The early months of 2025 have seen indie games dominate. REPO has terrified players, Schedule 1 has given players a new high, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-blue-prince-release-start-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Prince</a> is the next level up in quality. The room-crafting roguelike is innovative and imaginative, and its review scores mean it’s likely to be in contention for multiple Game of the Year prizes.</p>



<p>But with so many consoles, platforms, and exclusivity agreements, it’s hard to know where a game is available nowadays. I’m here to draft up the answers to this question for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-blue-prince-on-ps5">Can You Play Blue Prince on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Same rooms, different platforms. Credit to Dogubomb</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Blue Prince is arriving as a day-one launch on PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>Better yet, if you own PlayStation Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-blue-prince-on-xbox-game-pass-or-playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Prince is available as a free PS Plus game</a>! That’s right, if you are a PS Plus subscriber, you can play Blue Prince free of charge. We imagine developer Dogubomb has a secure partnership with Sony and PlayStation to allow this. It’s sure to give the game a massive boost and get the roguelike out there for more people.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-blue-prince-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Blue Prince on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox Series X|S players are also treated to the release of Blue Prince.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.blueprincegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blue Prince</a> is not a PlayStation exclusive. So if you’re on Xbox, you also get to draft rooms, explore Mt. Holly, and try to live up to your role as an heir and make yourself jolly by locating Room 46. I have even more good news: Blue Prince is a day-one Xbox Game Pass title, following in PlayStation’s footsteps.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-blue-prince-on-pc">Can You Play Blue Prince on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s another tick for Blue Prince as we can confirm the roguelike is available on PC and Steam.</strong></p>



<p>A few thousand people already have Blue Prince wishlisted. The people know it’s coming, and if you’re not a console gamer, you can sample Dogubomb’s efforts for yourself on PC. The system requirements are minimal, so they shouldn’t stop you from running Blue Prince.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-blue-prince-on-nintendo-switch">Can You Play Blue Prince on Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>The hot streak comes to an end as we regretfully announce Blue Prince is not releasing on Nintendo Switch.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not sure why, but Nintendo misses out on the soon-to-be-heralded classic. Blue Prince is only coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. But like many games, don’t be surprised if Blue Prince gets a future port on one of (if not both) the Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
