<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 announcement feels imminent if rumors and leaks are to be believed. Every passing day feels like an excruciating wait for Nintendo fans, so we’ve collated every possible detail including the latest rumors, leaks, and Switch 2 speculation—including a potential Nintendo Direct in January 2025.</p>



<p>March 3, 2017, was a landmark day in the annals of gaming history. It was the official launch of the Nintendo Switch. A money-making phenomenon that has allegedly sold close to (if not more than) <strong>150 million units</strong>. The OG Switch has printed money for Nintendo, and after eight years, it’s about time we got its successor—the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-desperately-need-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Rumors and gossip have circulated for months about when its announcement could be. 2025 has picked up where 2024 left off, only, the speculation has intensified one millionfold. The Nintendo Switch 2’s announcement feels closer than ever, and evidence supports this.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-date">Do we Know the Nintendo Switch 2 Announcement Date?</h2>

<p><strong>No official date has been officially or unofficially announced yet regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement, but it’s believed it could arrive on Thursday, January 16.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo hasn’t confirmed the existence of the console, but it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acknowledges-recent-nintendo-switch-2-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged the Switch 2 leaks</a>. The company’s response was in retaliation to alleged <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons surfacing</a>. </p>



<p>Nintendo has previously said the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 will be announced before April 2025</a>. Everything feels like it’s dovetailing nicely, and the rumors are only the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-direct-january-2025-rumors-amp-leaks">Nintendo Direct January 2025 Rumors &amp; Leaks</h2>



<p><strong>A January 2025 Nintendo Direct could be on the cards with the showcase happening as early as the week of January 13.</strong></p>



<p>As of writing, this means the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-revealed-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 is being announced this week</a>! This is the biggest <em>take with a pinch of salt</em> imaginable, but the source is a reliable one. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nate the Hate</a> says the console is going to be shown off, along with a reveal trailer.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nate also says the Direct will “<strong>focus almost exclusively on the console itself</strong>” and is saving software reveals and information for a later date.</p>



<p>Again, <strong>January 16</strong> is being outed as the crucial date, but we’ll update you as and when we get new information or leaks.</p>

<p>2025 could be a big year for Nintendo Switch 2 games, and possible launch-day software includes <strong>Metroid Prime 4</strong>, <strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong>, and <strong>classic Xbox titles</strong> too.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</a> seems like a logical choice to help shift units at launch.

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios CEO has recently stated that he would like to see A-list actors “get violently killed” in the upcoming Helldivers movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1i1sa6p/arrowhead_ceo_on_actors_for_the_helldivers_movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Helldivers</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-movie-arrowhead-wants-hollywood-stars-die-opening-montage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>), the Helldivers 2 community has been discussing the upcoming movie in its official Discord channel, where the CEO, Shams Jorjani, recently shared some interesting thoughts. When asked whether the team knows details about the upcoming film, Jorjani responded that they do have some information, as the production keeps them “in the loop.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jorjani was also asked whether A-list actors like “Chris Pratt” will be featured in the upcoming Helldivers movie. He replied that the whole team is “hoping for as many A-list actors as possible—as long as they all get killed violently immediately.” </p>



<p>The essence of Helldivers 2 comes from giving your life for democracy, and the developers want this same form of hilarious self-sacrifice to be relayed in the movie, too.&nbsp;Players have already started making their predictions in the comment section, hoping to see the likes of Sean Bean, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Tom Holland and more get killed. Fans also don’t mind joining in as nameless actors if they get the opportunity to be mowed down by friendly fire. </p>



<p>On the topic of the Helldivers movie, the creative director also revealed Arrowhead’s involvement in the upcoming film, explaining that they are unaware of what it takes to make a movie and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-director-talks-about-their-involvement-with-the-upcoming-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“don’t, and shouldn’t, have the final say.”</a></p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2 developers have already begun fleshing out the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dev-next-game-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high concept’ for the team’s next game</a>. Also, the title was Insider Gaming Community’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-multiplayer-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Best Multiplayer Game” of 2024</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/will-tiktok-be-banned-us-and-when/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/will-tiktok-be-banned-in-the-us-and-when-will-it-happen-answered.1082667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/will-tiktok-be-banned-us-and-when/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>TikTok is in a precious position at present. It sits on a precipice, with the United States government attempting to shut down the application’s operations in the country. It would be a monumental blow to the application owner, ByteDance, and it all stems from the organisation being headquartered in Beijing, China.</p>



<p>Will TikTok be banned in the US? In the middle of January, the Supreme Court will determine whether the application will receive a blanket ban in the nation, but many things can happen before then to prevent that.</p>



<p>Find out in this guide if TikTok will be banned and when that might happen, plus learn about some alternatives.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-tiktok-getting-banned-in-the-us">Is TikTok Getting Banned in the US?</h2>



<p>The United States Supreme Court is attempting to ban TikTok <strong>unless </strong>the platform breaks away from Chinese ownership. By way of a resolution, an American company or entity could purchase a portion of the platform to run it from the United States, which would keep everything running as normal.</p>



<p>A few months back, the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">Bobby Kotick were rumoured</a> to be interested in purchasing the site, and recently, MrBeast’s name came up in the discussion. It could even be someone like Elon Musk who might save TikTok from being banned in the US.</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/president-joe-biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-in-united-states/">Joe Biden signed a bill</a> that would see TikTok banned in January 2025 if it wasn’t divested away from the Chinese owners.</p>



<p><strong>The due date for the final decision (and ultimate action) is January 19. If nobody secures TikTok’s US operations by then, the application will be banned nationwide. As nobody has stepped forward to claim or save TikTok just yet, it looks like the ban will go ahead.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-if-tiktok-is-banned">What Happens if TikTok is Banned?</h2>



<p>Most likely, the Supreme Court will order app store operators such as Google and Apple to remove TikTok from their storefronts, making it near-impossible to download the application on devices.</p>



<p>Also, internet service providers will be required to place blocks on the desktop version of the site, further restricting access. This could also apply to cellphone network carriers.</p>



<p>If you’re using a VPN, you may be able to still access TikTok. A VPN allows you to ‘spoof’ your location, making it seem as though you’re in another country or region, which is the most effective way to bypass geoblocking measures.</p>



<p>Ultimately, if TikTok is ‘hard banned’ in the United States, many content creators who rely on the app for a revenue stream will be massively impacted.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-donald-trump-save-tiktok">Will Donald Trump Save TikTok?</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, Donald Trump was hellbent on shutting down TikTok, but as underwent his political campaign for election into the presidency in 2024, he doubled back on that decision. </p>



<p>It became a belief that Donald Trump would halt the US TikTok ban, which he has the power to do once he has entered office. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, he will be sworn in as the United States President on January 20, one day <strong>after </strong>the ban takes place. He could retroactively make a change, but he can’t stop it from going ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-tiktok-alternatives">What Are The Best TikTok Alternatives?</h2>



<p>If you want an alternative to TikTok in case the application is banned in the US, you’re in luck.</p>



<p>Many people rely on Instagram Reels as an alternative to TikTok, or Facebook, which also supports a ‘shorts’ ecosystem. One of the best alternatives to TikTok is YouTube, which has a strong shorts platform that many creators use to earn a fair bit of money.</p>



<p>In recent months, YouTube has been slipping back a little on live streaming and prioritising short- and long-form content, so there’s a strong argument there for moving from TikTok to YouTube.</p>



<p>Other sites, such as Lemon8 and RedNote, could also face legislative action, given that they’re owned by Chinese organisations. Lemon8 is owned by ByteDance, the parent company sitting over TikTok, so that’s not the best step if you’re looking for a TikTok alternative.</p>



<p>To put it finely, 170 million American users could be set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-ban-united-states-closer/">lose access to TikTok this month</a>, so be prepared. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s ‘BTR Driver Storyline’ is Now Available]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-btr-driver-storyline-unlocked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98btr-driver-storyline%E2%80%99-is-now-available.1082661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-btr-driver-storyline-unlocked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has announced the arrival of the ‘BTR Driver’ storyline in Escape from Tarkov. This snapshot mission chain will allow users to learn more about the BTR driver, who is present on several of the game’s maps, including Streets of Tarkov and Woods.</p>



<p>This news comes amid a slump for the game exacerbated by an increasing number of cheaters and technical issues. That fact alone has prompted some users to slam Battlestate for focusing on ‘things that don’t matter’ to the average player.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-driver">Enter The Driver</h2>



<p>On social media, the Escape from Tarkov team posted an update explaining when, where, and how you can access the BTR Driver storyline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>BTR driver storyline is now available in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>The chain starts at Mechanic with the task “A Helping Hand” at character level 20</li>



<li>Completing the chain earns the new achievement and unique rewards such as barters for new items and weapons, customization items, and more</li>



<li>The task chain will be permanent.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been more than a year since the BTR mechanic was added to Escape from Tarkov, and for most players, it goes by relatively unnoticed. When it was introduced, it was buggy as all hell, gunning down PMCs with reckless abandon for no reason whatsoever.</p>



<p>It has a few neat functions, such as banking found loot, using it as a taxi service, and providing cover fire to PMCs willing to stump up the cash, but for the bulk of users, it’s just a thing that drives around the map on loop.</p>



<p>Admittedly, it’s nice to get a bit more content in Escape from Tarkov, but I’ll mirror what some users are saying – perhaps BSG’s efforts would be better spent fixing what exists rather than adding more to the game.</p>



<p>Have you ever used Escape from Tarkov’s BTR, or could you not care less about the thing? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
