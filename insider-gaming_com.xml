<p>ARC Raiders CEO reveals that games like Helldivers 2 inspired them to move away from free-to-play to a more traditional model. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ new extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, has cemented itself as one of the top dogs in the multiplayer shooter genre, doing so without pursuing a free-to-play model. The title’s success is apparent, with the game recently hitting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 million sales</a> within 2 months of release. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-wanted-to-make-the-game-feel-like-it-s-totally-worth-40-bucks">ARC Raiders Devs Wanted to Make the Game “Feel Like It’s Totally Worth 40 Bucks”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBeat’s Dean Takahashi</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/embark-boss-says-arc-raiders-usd40-price-was-inspired-by-the-likes-of-helldivers-2-wed-rather-make-people-feel-like-its-totally-worth-40-bucks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Patrick Söderlund, Embark Studios CEO, revealed why they ditched the free-to-play model for ARC Raiders. Söderlund stated that they “looked at games like Helldivers” and realised that’s the same space they want to be in, rather than releasing a free-to-play game. Söderlund adds that he is unsure whether this was the right or wrong decision, but is happy about the fact that the game is “relatively affordable”. </p>



<p>Söderlund then spoke about how they arrived at $40 as the game’s price point. The dev team knew that the game didn’t have a campaign, so they didn’t want the price to be a “offender for someone”. Therefore, they decided to “rather make people feel like it’s totally worth 40 bucks.” The hope is that players feel that they got value for their money, “given how much time they seem to spend in the game.”</p>







<p>In other news, the CEO of Embark Studios has stated they don’t want to promote PvP because “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceo-the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game isn’t about shooting other players</a>”.

<p>The CEO of Embark Studios has revealed that they don’t wish to promote PvP systems, as they don’t want to foster that type of gameplay. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders is undoubtedly one of the standout titles of 2025, and it shows no signs of slowing anytime soon, having recently hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new milestone of 12 million units sold</a>. At the same time, it seems the developers aren’t looking to go all-in on PvP to keep the fire burning, since the game wasn’t designed with that as a focus.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-don-t-want-to-foster-pvp-type-gameplay">ARC Raiders Devs Don’t Want to Foster PvP-Type Gameplay</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBeat’s</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dean Takahashi</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/arc-raiders/250358/news/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund revealed why they aren’t looking to promote PvP systems. The CEO first mentioned discussions about adding Nemesis systems; however, they don’t know where the team is at right now and are also happy that the game doesn’t have a leaderboard and “it’s not competitive.”</p>



<p>Söderlund adds that the dev team “doesn’t want to necessarily foster that type of gameplay” as “the game isn’t about shooting other players”. Of course, the game allows you to be aggressive and fight other players, “but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players.” The PvP element was added to craft tension. </p>



<p>The Embark CEO then spoke about the game being designed to be played “without other players for a long time,” and noted that this worked quite well in some instances. However, as soon as other players were added, the dev team had to resort to subtle ways of signalling, rather than telling you how many players are on the server, how many have died, etc. </p>



<p>Hence, ARC Raiders is all about players using audio and visual cues when engaging in PvP situations. Players need to hear other players shooting and see raider flares go up to see where the action is. Not providing all the information at once creates tension, forcing players to decide whether exploring the area where the action is a risk worth taking. </p>



<p>However, the CEO also said that private servers in ARC Raiders are “absolutely something we could consider,” and that could be an excellent addition for players looking for more PvP action. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does StarRupture Have Controller Support?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starrupture-controller-support/</link>
            <guid>1399165</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>StarRupture has officially launched into early access, with the Creepy Jar title putting players on a hostile planet tasked with survival, and controller support is a feature players have raised questions about.</p>



<p>Early access to StarRupture launched on January 7, giving players the first opportunity to dive into the game, but there’s still a lot to come in development before the full release.</p>



<p>If you want to know all the details on the status of controller support in StarRupture, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-starrupture-have-controller-support">Does StarRupture Have Controller Support?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Image via Creepy Jar</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, StarRupture does not include controller support following the launch of early access on January 6, with only mouse and keyboard support.</strong></p>



<p>While it is possible to map out controller inputs using Steam, the process can be complicated if you don’t know what you’re doing, and there’s a chance that you will miss some crucial inputs, particularly for features that might not be immediately clear at launch.</p>



<p>Steam does provide the option to download controller input profiles created by other players, so it’s worth keeping an eye on the Reddit and Discord pages for any creations.</p>



<p>The door is not closed to controller support entirely, however, as StarRupture launched in an early access stage and development of the title continues.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-starrupture-add-controller-support">Will StarRupture Add Controller Support?</h2>



<p><strong>StarRupture will add official controller support in the future, but there is no timeframe of when it will be added.</strong></p>



<p>The early access roadmap overview shared by the developers specifies plans for controller support, along with plans for additional accessibility support, including improved keybinds, subtitle options, and adjustable text size.</p>



<p>Controller support’s inclusion in the early access roadmap indicates there are plans to add it before the full release, an approach that varies froma a previous release by Creepy Jar, Green Hell.</p>



<p>Initially launched in early access in August 2018, the 1.0 release of Green Hell followed in September 2019, with controller support then added in December of the same year.</p>



<p>No timeline has been stated yet for the duration of early access and the full launch, but, although planned, controller support may still be a way off.</p>
