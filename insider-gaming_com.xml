<p>It’s tough trying to follow previous efforts, but the biggest and best games in 2025 offer hope. From stellar AAA behemoths to long-time-coming remakes and remasters, there’s a lot to be excited about. However, we start from the beginning with January 2025’s biggest releases.</p>



<p>2024 continually got better, leaving us to salivate at another jaw-dropping year at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>. Last year is in the rearview mirror, and it’s time to shine the light ahead at what’s to come. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> is lurking somewhere, ready to sweep up every award and penny from our pockets, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is camouflaged and coming for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-remakes-and-remasters-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best remake</a> crown, and there’s an FPS that could spell <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-will-be-on-xbox-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a> for all of us.</p>



<p>I’m already trembling with fear at how expensive this year could be. Let’s start with January 2025, and its biggest games to set the stage for the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-games-coming-in-2025">Best Games Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>Release dates can change—even at the last second—but I feel confident in declaring these to be January’s biggest games. I’ve also provided their release dates for you to mark on your new 2025 calendar.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-january-16">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD — January 16</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The kings of the Kongs. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>January 2025 is a very remaster and port-friendly month. Nevertheless, I never tire of Donkey Kong’s underrated and punishing difficulty. Nintendo is giving Donkey Kong Country Returns HD at least one more port, this time for the Nintendo Switch. With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 rumors</a> growing—and my belief <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-desperately-need-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we need a Nintendo Switch 2</a>—this might be the last chance to collect, swing, smash, and bash in Country Returns before it finally makes way for a new entry.</p>



<h3 id="h-dynasty-warriors-origins-january-17">Dynasty Warriors: Origins — January 17</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I’d hate to clear up this mess. Credit to KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD</figcaption></figure>



<p>I couldn’t tell you the first thing about Dynasty Warriors: Origins—or the series. Every time I see one though, I think, “This looks fun.” Origins’ trailers and gameplay reveals boast even more obscene on-screen soldier counts and epic battles. Dynasty Warriors producer and director Tomohiko Sho told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dynasty-warriors-10000-soldiers-tokyo-game-show-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, “The team set themselves the goal of having <strong>10,000 soldiers on screen at a given time</strong>.” Even if it doesn’t quite hit this number, it looks widely impressive nonetheless.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-23">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth — January 23</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Every Cloud has a silver lining. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC release date</a> is one to watch. Rebirth may have already been out for nearly a year, but that’s no excuse to miss this masterpiece. It may have underperformed in sales, but I believe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-deserves-more-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth deserved better</a>—in terms of sales and awards—and PC players are getting a superior version of the JRPG. The port features DLSS, Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling, Improved Lighting, and VRR. Queen’s Blood has never looked so vibrant.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-january-30">Sniper Elite: Resistance — January 30</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Wait for the killcam. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> is a rare, new AAA game in January 2025. Rebellion is back at it again with its sniper-gore-fused third-person shooter. I say gore because I’ve seen enough horrifying killcams from the franchise down the years to make me wince at the thought of them. More mission variety and creativity are promised as you seek to neutralize Germany’s secret Wunderwaffe&nbsp;weapon—and Sniper Elite: Resistance is a day one Game Pass launch.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-spider-man-2-january-30">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 — January 30</h3>



<figure><figcaption>That’s a big tongue. Credit to Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>One final port rounds off our biggest games of January 2025 list—Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Spidey and Miles (and Venom) are surfing the web to the realm of computers with this polished port. Like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-marvels-spider-man-2-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Spider-Man 2 PC release</a> boasts improvements and upgrades on the original—<strong>Enhanced ray-tracing options</strong> being the news here.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/virtuos-is-working-on-an-unannounced-remake-using-unreal-engine-5.1076022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/virtuos-unannounced-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A developer’s LinkedIn profile has revealed that Virtuos is working on an unannounced remake for current generation consoles using Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>First spotted by X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a>, the information comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksii-moskovchenko-17278017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oleksii Moskovchenko</a>‘s LinkedIn page, who is a Technical Art Director at Virtuos. His description of his current work simply reads, “unannounced UE5 PS5/XSX/PC remake.”</p>



<p>In December 2024, several rumors began to circulate that Virtuos would be developing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake on Unreal Engine 5</a>, which was further corroborated by leak Extas1s, who said that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game could be announced at the heavily rumored Xbox Direct</a>, which is believe to take place in January. </p>



<p>While some find it somewhat hard to believe that Virtuos could be developing a fully-fledged remake of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion on Unreal Engine 5, the proof is seemingly starting to stack up. For those out of the loop, a remake or remaster of Oblivion first popped up during the FTC investigation into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which the game expected to release during the fiscal year of 2022 – a date that has obviously been missed.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, we shouldn’t have long to wait to know if the rumors are true if the announcement is set to come during the Xbox Direct, which WindowsCentral’s Jez Corden also <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1876466327583621306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently claimed</a> would be announced very soon. </p>



<p>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was first released in 2006 and has sold an estimated 9.5 million copies worldwide, according to the market research firm Electronic Entertainment Design and Research. </p>



<p>For those waiting on the highly anticipated Elder Scrolls 6, well, unfortunately, that one is still years away from release.</p>



<p>What do you think of the current rumors? Do you think Virtuos is developing The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion on Unreal Engine 5? Let us know down below, and be sure to join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
