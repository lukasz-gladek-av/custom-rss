<p>VALORANT Night Market, the special event that fans of the first-person arena shooter love, is set to return on December 11. This time around, the Night Market will remain open for almost a month, giving players a longer opportunity to secure their dream VALORANT skins.</p>



<p>As always, getting the skins you’re seeking in the Night Market isn’t a <strong>guaranteed thing</strong>, but if you do manage to swing the one you’re after, you’ll secure it at a hugely discounted price.</p>



<p>It’s a little bit of gacha, but it’s good fun for players, and it only comes around once every few months.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-valorant-night-market">When is the Next VALORANT Night Market?</h2>



<p>The next VALORANT Night Market has been revealed by Riot Games as coming on December 11. It’s set to run until January 6, giving you plenty of time to hopefully unlock the skins that you’re hunting in this gacha-style event.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>How does the Night Market work?</strong></p>



<p>The VALORANT Night Market is a limited-time shop event that offers players six randomly selected weapon skins at discounted prices, ranging from 10% to 49%. The offers are unique per player, and only certain ‘collections’ are selected for the Night Market event.</p>



<p>You simply access the Night Market, click to reveal your discounted skins, and if you want them, you can buy them with a heavy discount. The only drawback is you’re never going to get bundle-exclusive skins or Ultra-tier skins.</p>

            <guid>1373938</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new look at Resident Evil Requiem will be debuting at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-megabonk-nomination-withdrawal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>. The event is set to occur on December 11th, with Requiem one of the nominated titles.</p>



<p>Releasing on February 27th, 2026, Resident Evil Requiem marks the next chapter in the iconic horror franchise. Following Grace Ashcroft, you’ll return to Raccoon City and investigate a series of mysterious deaths. Fans have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveals-first-and-third-person-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seen a lot</a> of the title since its reveal last year, but with rampant rumors and leaks, it seems there’s a lot of mystery still left to discover. Luckily, it won’t be long before players can see more, as the Capcom title is set to show at one of the biggest gaming events of the year.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-look-at-resident-evil-requiem-debuting-at-the-game-awards">New Look at Resident Evil Requiem Debuting at The Game Awards</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1996731931103580519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> by The Game Awards’ official account, <strong>Resident Evil Requiem will be in attendance at the show</strong>. Specifically, <strong>a new look at the title will premiere</strong> at the award show, streaming on <strong>December 11th</strong>. It’s unknown the extent of the first look or content like gameplay or story. Either way, it’s more Resident Evil Requiem, and that’s not a bad thing whatsoever.</p>



<p>It’s a big night for the game, too, as it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominated for Most Anticipated Game</a>. Resident Evil Requiem is up against some heavy-hitters like Grand Theft Auto 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-wont-feature-at-the-game-awards-despite-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a>, 007 First Light, and Marvel’s Wolverine. Fortunately, given the series’ pedigree, with Village, 2 Remake, and 4 Remake getting GOTY nominations, its chances of taking some gold next year are quite good. In any case, there’s a lot more left to look forward to for Requiem as February 27th creeps up.</p>

<p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, known for his prolific career in film and TV, has passed away. His resume includes roles in The Man in the High Castle, Memories of a Geisha, and, for many, Shang Tsung in the Mortal Kombat film series. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/cary-hiroyuki-tagawa-dead-mortal-kombat-actor-1236636368/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, the Japanese actor died this morning, surrounded by family in California. His cause of death was due to complications of a stroke. The actor was only 75 years old.</p>

<p>Starting in 1986 with Big Trouble in Little China, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa had become a prevalent figure in many blockbusters in the 90s and 2000s. Films like License to Kill, Memories of a Geisha, Elektra, and Planet of the Apes brought the actor into the limelight. However, it was his portrayal of evil sorcerer Shang Tsung in the 1995 film adaptation of Mortal Kombat (and it’s 1997 sequel Mortal Kombat: Annihilation) that made him an icon. While the film was pure 90s, Cary’s devilish portrayal of Tsung was met with high praise, especially for the line “Your Soul is Mine!”.</p>



<p>In the 2010s, Tagawa found himself in roles in projects like The Man in the High Castle, 47 Ronin, and even an adaptation of Tekken as Heihachi Mishima. He even found himself reprising his role as Shang Tsung in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-500m-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 11</a>, available as DLC. Other video game credits of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa include Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu and Soldier Boyz.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to his family and friends during this difficult time.</p>
