<p>Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord, the fantasy strategy RPG famed for its endlessly enjoyable medieval combat, is taking to the high seas in its next expansion, War Sails. The upcoming naval expansion was announced during the Future Games Show Spring Showcase.</p>







<p>War Sails will introduce naval combat to Mount and Blade for the first time in the franchise’s history. Taking much inspiration from the Vikings, players will command 18 types of ship, engage enemy ships in naval combat, and build an empire on the seas. The trailer showed large-scale naval battles and the ability to command a massive fleet and board enemy ships. Just like with their armies on land, players will need to upgrade and manage their fleet, and keep supplies stocked to prevent poor performance or even a mutiny.</p>



<p>In the Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord base game, players grow their parties from a small band of soldiers into a powerful army capable of taking any stronghold by force. Over time, players outfit their army with siege engines and cavalry. The roleplaying elements come into play when players manage relationships with various NPC like local lords, merchants, and brigands. There are eight major factions, each consisting of its own set of clans, beliefs, goals, and outlier groups. In the trailer for War Sails, the various color schemes of the different factions can be seen on the soldiers and the ship dressing. A ninth faction, the Nords of the Northern Kingdom, will debut in War Sails. New features like a robust stealth system and random events will be added to the base game as well.</p>

<p>The Last of Us 2 Remastered is all set to arrive on PC next month, April 3, and to celebrate the occasion, they are introducing new No Return Content as a free PS5 update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Last of Us 2’s new No Return content will be available on PC at launch and on PS5 on the same date as the free downloadable 2.0.0 patch. This update will introduce four new maps, two new characters, new trophies and additional bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-tlou-2-no-return">What’s New in TLOU 2 No Return?</h2>



<p>The Last of Us 2’s No Return mode’s first new map is Overlook, which provides a view of the city of Seattle. Next is School, where players might remember facing W.L.F with Ellie and Dina. The third map, Streets, is set in Hillcrest’s overgrown neighbourhood. Last is Nest, the infected-infested building players had to clear as Abby in The Last of Us Part 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Last of Us 2 will add Bill and Marlene as the two new characters for No Return in the latest PS5 update. Bill features the ‘Smuggler’ playstyle, has access to the custom pump shotgun, receives double rewards from drops, and can fend for himself against melee attacks but cannot dodge. Marlene, on the other hand, has the ‘Risk Taker’ play style, which provides her with a Custom Assault Rifle, ‘All or Nothing Gambits’, and has the ability to reroute her No Return Path once per run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, Naughty Dog is offering some cosmetic content for The Last of Us 2 along with the No Return content; it will be available on PC and PS5 for free. It is a new skin for Ellie featuring Jordan A. Mun’s jacket from their upcoming game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Players will have to unlock the skin via in-game bonus points.</p>
