<p>When Ubisoft announced that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake was canceled</a>, it was also revealed that five other games were ending. Insider Gaming has learned the six games that have been cancelled at Ubisoft.</p>



<p>First reported on Insider Gaming Weekly, Insider Gaming understands that the following six games were canceled:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</strong> – Canceled after being first announced in 2020.</li>



<li><strong>Project Ether</strong> – In development since 2019, which was canceled, but has morphed, in a way, into a newer project. Believed to have been in development at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" id="168333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Halifax</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Project Pathfinder </strong>– Known previously as Project U</li>



<li><strong>Project Crest</strong> – A World War 2 extraction shooter</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</strong> – Stopping support</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Singularity </strong>– A new mobile Assassin’s Creed Game</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with the game cancellations that were previously announced—confirmed above—there was also a multiplayer Assassin’s Creed that had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-assassins-creed-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly been shuttered</a>. That game, however, isn’t a part of this group. </p>



<p>One game that is still coming is the Assassin’s Creed: Blag Flag Remake. The latest rumors suggest that a reveal will take place in April after being delayed out of the current fiscal year.</p>
