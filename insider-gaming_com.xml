<p>Electronic Arts recently revealed an unprecedented Battlefield tournament with a $1 million prize pool. The REDSEC Elite Series was poised to be a new entrant into the battle royale esports space, contending with the likes of Call of Duty: Warzone. However, the team behind the tournament recently announced a postponement of the event and offered <strong>no new date</strong>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team expressed their apologies and stressed that they’re still looking forward to fostering a competitive scene in Battlefield REDSEC that’s ‘built to last’.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-elite-series-pushed-back">Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series Pushed Back</h2>



<p>Battlefield REDSEC has been impacted by an ‘unforeseen technical issue’ that has warranted a sizeable delay on the event rolling out. This news was revealed in <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1998882936569905156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent social post</a> from Electronic Arts and the teams organizing the $1 million tournament.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To our Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series community,</p>



<p>After a thorough review, due to an unforeseen technical issue that impacted the integrity of the competition, we’ve made the difficult but necessary decision to postpone the Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series in all regions. We want to be upfront: this is on us. </p>



<p>We’re truly sorry for the disruption this causes. Your time, passion, and commitment have meant everything to this series, and we don’t take that lightly. </p>



<p>We remain fully committed to the Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series and to creating a competitive scene that’s built to last. We’ll share more updates in the new year.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The tournament was supposed to run from December 10 – 18, and the announcement came just as players were preparing to compete in their first Battlefield REDSEC tournament.</p>



<p>While Electronic Arts wasn’t entirely clear on the reasons behind the delay, it’s widely believed the game has too many technical issues that risk compromising the event’s integrity, such has been the case in recent years with Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to comment. One user wrote, ‘Thanks for the transparency and ownership. We’ll get there. This thing is still going to be epic.’ Another made a damning statement against the game, ‘Your latest update broke the game. All of a sudden, hit registration is an issue.’</p>



<p>Tech-savvy gamers have dug into the issues and uncovered a memory leak problem associated with the latest Battlefield REDSEC build.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s official: Kim Kardashian is making her way into the multiverse of Fortnite as the latest celebrity collaboration. Hours ago, the socialite and entrepreneur revealed her skins with a post on social media, prompting many Fortnite players to make <strong>the obvious comments</strong> about the character model.</p>



<p>It seems that Epic Games has flouted earlier ‘rules’ about not showing cleavage (amongst other things) in Fortnite, let’s just say that.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-kim-kardashian-coming-to-fortnite">When is Kim Kardashian Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p>Kim Kardashian will join the Icon Series in Fortnite on December 13, with a lineup of <strong>three skins </strong>(with one modelled on SKIMS) being added to the store. The bundle will feature the three skins, all of which are ‘highly customizable’, a back bling, a glider, and an exclusive emote, which some have claimed is a bit too lascivious for a kid’s game.</p>



<p>The depth of customization for the Kim Kardashian skins will allow players to alter her hairstyles and outfit colors.</p>



<p>Kim K confirmed her imminent arrival in Fortnite in a post on social media:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As you can imagine, players were quick to make their witty comments. One user wrote, ‘Those are gonna be some sticky controllers,’ while another quipped, ‘Ma’am, this is a child’s game.’</p>



<p>Another commented on the fairly obvious issue with Fortnite’s target audience: ‘These young kids are about to mature real fast.’</p>



<p>For the earliest unlock possible, you can compete in the Kim Kardashian Icon Cup, which officially kicks off tomorrow, December 12:</p>

<p>What do you think? Are you going to invest in the Kim Kardashian Fortnite skins? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> how desperate you are to acquire this sought-after bundle (or not…)</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sorcerer Battlegrounds Codes (December 2025)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-sorcerer-battlegrounds-codes/</link>
            <guid>1379260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Sorcerer Battlegrounds monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including emotes and much more.</p>



<p>Inspired by Jujutsu Kaisen, Sorcerer Battlegrounds is the perfect <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-midnight-chasers-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game for players who want to combine the hit anime with their love for PvP fighting games. It throws players into the arena from the get-go, as they pick from characters inspired by anime and manga-style sorcerers. Each character comes with their own unique moves, skills, combos, magical attacks and more. From there, players start their PvP battles where the goal is simply to defeat other players using their skills and character with the help of their abilities in an attempt to climb up the ranking while racking up kills.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The combat system rewards skilful play, as mastering the timing of your spells, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different techniques, and learning effective combos is crucial for success. That’ll help players become better because the more wins a player earns, they’ll unlock cosmetics, titles/grades (for ranked modes) and more.&nbsp; While you can grind matches naturally, redeeming codes is a handy shortcut — sometimes the game developers release codes that give emotes, cosmetics, or freebies in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-active-sorcerer-battlegrounds-codes">Active Sorcerer Battlegrounds Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li>0KFAVSTE2 – Redeem the code to get milestone rewards</li>



<li>BUGOOOOO!713 – Redeem the code to get two emotes</li>

<p>While redeeming codes in most Roblox games are straightforward, Sorcerer Battlegrounds is a little bit different as compared to other games. Here’s how to do it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Sorcerer Battlegrounds on Roblox.</li>



<li>Look for the Codes NPC on the edge of the map and then interact with them.</li>



<li>Select Yes to bring up the code redemption box.</li>



<li>Enter the Code and click on submit to receive your rewards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-sorcerer-battlegrounds-codes">How To Get More Sorcerer Battlegrounds Codes</h2>



<p>Sorcerer Battlegrounds codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the creator/developer’s social media pages. That includes the official Roblox group, as the team drops codes during game milestones and special events. However, keeping track of the multiple sources can be time-consuming, especially with no notification system in place when the codes hit their expiration date.</p>



<p>Thus, we suggest bookmarking this guide in your browser, as we refresh it as soon as new Sorcerer Battlegrounds codes are released and remove expired codes once they are no longer valid.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Trailer At The Game Awards Costs Developers Up to $1 Million, Says New Report]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-1-million/</link>
            <guid>1379083</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report has revealed that a trailer at the annual Game Awards could cost developers up to $1 million ot have their game featured.</p>







<p>The news comes from a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> report, which cites two anonymous sources who told the outlet that a three-minute trailer now costs over $1 million to be featured during The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley. That’s double the price of what it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-can-cost-up-to-500000-for-a-spot-on-opening-night-live-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly costs developers</a> to be featured at Opening Night Live, another show run by Geoff Keighley… Now that’s The Game Business!</p>



<p>Two video game publishers tell Kotaku that although they were not familiar with this year’s rates, it “sounded in line with what they’d expect from previous years.”</p>



<p>The Game Awards last year amassed 14 million views on its YouTube channel, meaning that, as a rough estimate (assuming all 14 million watched all the way through, which is doubtful), that’d be approximately a $70 CPM.</p>



<p>Whether the rates are worth it for developers and publishers is a question only they can answer, but it’s known that Geoff Keighley likes to offer free placements for major announcements and some indie titles here and there. So, unless more sources come forward, it’s somewhat difficult to gauge if such placements are worthwhile.</p>







<p>It’s also worth pointing out that the $1 million figure, despite being eye-catching, is for the longest-running trailers, with lesser run-time trailers costing less. Opening Night Live 2025 was reportedly approximately $500 for a 3-minute ad, $150,000 for a 30-second ad, or $210,000 for a 1-minute ad. </p>



<p>So, assuming the rates for The Game Awards are double, that should be around $300,000 for 30 seconds, or $420,000 for 1 minute.</p>
