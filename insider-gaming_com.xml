<p>Palworld’s update version v0.4.14 is live now, bringing new Spring Festivals skins, specific adjustments, balancing changes and bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palworld has introduced 5 new Spring Festival Skins in this update, each featuring unique elements reminiscent of the Chinese New Year. However, players should have the corresponding Pals to equip the skins. The new collection includes Lucky Cattiva, Fortune-Bringer Lyleen, Fortune-Bringer Lyleen Noct, Lion-Dancer Chillet and Lion-Dancer Chillet Ignis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the new skins, Palworld has introduced some specific adjustments that change Pals’ behaviours and add new elements to some world regions. After the latest adjustments, Pals will attack the nearest enemy after being summoned. The behaviour of large pals at bases has been made the same as that of small pals to allow them to pass through narrow areas. Lastly, earth and water elements were added in various places.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding balancing, Palworld has adjusted rewards, expanded the range of area near the reticle, and made some enhancements to crude oil production, along with other changes. In terms of bug fixes, a game-crashing bug was fixed. Also, some issues with UIs, treasure chests, PS5s and more have been resolved.

<p>The director of Assassin’s Creed Shadows has revealed that the game was delayed a second time due to ‘polishing’ and ‘complex roofs.’</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is finally set to arrive on March 20, 2025, and now we know why the game was delayed a second time. During a conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-says-recent-delay-was-to-polish-parkour-especially-on-super-complex-roofs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Charles Benoit, AC Shadows’ Game Director, revealed that the month-long delay was “mostly about polishing,” “a couple of things in progression” to make the game more engaging and balanced, and Japan’s “super complex” roofs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game director explained that Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ roofs and other Japanese architecture might be the “most complex thing” he has worked on compared to AC Odyssey and Syndicate. The developers had to work on “specific codes and specific animations” to make the parkour transition for these areas more fluid. The roofs and parkour around Japanese Architecture were feedback they wanted to address, and they believe that they have “improved since the last few months.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was initially scheduled to be released in November 2024, but two delays pushed the release to February 2025 and the second to March 2025. Players hope this month-long extension will end up being the final obstacle in the game’s release. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-sniper-elite-games-in-release-order-release-dates/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve crafted a comprehensive list of every Sniper Elite game, their release dates, and a little bit about why they’re so significant. The series isn’t lauded like other third-person shooter contemporaries, but it deserves acclaim. 2025 brings the latest sequel, so let’s give Sniper Elite its dues after 20 years of World War warfare.</p>



<p>Sniper Elite’s niche combat mechanics and sometimes punishing difficulty make it unique. This is a good thing in a market saturated and overpopulated with hero shooters (look what happened to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a>) and FPS gameplay. Missions usually take around an hour or so, with your mileage varying based on how thorough you are and how often you give away your position—causing half of Germany to rain down its wrath on you.</p>



<p>The scenery has changed from time to time, as has reality and the aliveness of the inhabitants. But Sniper Elite constantly retains its identity, and it’s been a hell of a journey so far, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> being the latest target in our sights.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-sniper-elite-games-are-there">How Many Sniper Elite Games Are There?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 10 mainline Sniper Elite games with two mini-Zombie Army expansions.</strong></p>



<p>The franchise has ebbed and flowed throughout history from the first <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>. We’ve had VR and Zombie games, explored tropical climates, and even more Zombies games. Nazi Zombie Army and Nazi Zombie Army 2 are not considered full releases and joined Zombie Army Trilogy anyway.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-sniper-elite-game-in-order">Every Sniper Elite Game In Order</h2>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-released-on-sept-30-2005">Sniper Elite — Released on Sept. 30, 2005</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The beginning of something beautiful. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>It all started with 2005’s Sniper Elite. Rebellion tried something new, and it was a different take on other war shooters like Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Medal of Honor. It’s very primitive compared to its successors and a product of its time, but we’ll always be thankful it was made.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-v2-released-on-may-2-2012">Sniper Elite V2 — Released on May 2, 2012</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We’re back again. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sniper Elite sequels became more frequent as time went on, but it wasn’t always the case. Rebellion was dipping its toes in several properties, so it took <strong>seven years before Sniper Elite V2 saw the light of day</strong>. The title’s clever wordplay aside, the now-famous X-Ray bullet feature played a prominent role in the sequel’s gameplay and marketing, and the series was starting to hot up.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-3-released-on-june-27-2014">Sniper Elite 3 — Released on June 27, 2014</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Boy, sure is a hot one today. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sniper Elite 3 only needed two years, not seven. However, we get a big change of location here as we venture into North Africa’s sizzling scorch. The third game proved to be <strong>my entry point</strong>, and its inconsistent AI and focus on gameplay rather than character development and story are complaints I still have with sequels to this day. However, Sniper Elite had a market, and as a result, more games were commissioned.</p>



<h3 id="h-zombie-army-trilogy-released-on-mar-6-2015">Zombie Army Trilogy — Released on Mar. 6, 2015</h3>



<figure><figcaption>No words. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Zombie Army Trilogy arrived a few months later to revamp the formula. I reviewed this elsewhere in my early writing days, and it was an effort to capitalize on the growing Zombie game trend. It packaged all three Zombie Army games in a more linear and narrow-sighted effort. Repetition does creep in as you progress, but it was a welcome change to the Sniper Elite name.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-4-released-on-feb-14-2017">Sniper Elite 4 — Released on Feb. 14, 2017</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Numbers are racking up now. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Zombies are asleep for now as Sniper Elite 4 brings back the classic sandbox-based gameplay from the dead. The fourth mainline entry is the best-received release to this point from a critical standpoint, with reviewers enjoying the improved AI and enhancement of X-Ray kills. It sold well, meaning Sniper Elite 5 was an absolute given to be the next game.</p>



<h3 id="h-zombie-army-4-dead-war-released-on-feb-4-2020">Zombie Army 4: Dead War — Released on Feb. 4, 2020</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Is this even Sniper Elite anymore? Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Had you for a moment, didn’t I? Zombie Army 4: Dead War comes next and adds many new ideas compared to Trilogy. New enemy types look to mutilate you (see the image above) and you gain ways to combat demons. We’ll see if <strong>Rebellion ever does another Zombie spin-off</strong>, and if not, Zombie Army 4 is a fine auf Wiedersehen. </p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-vr-released-on-july-8-2021">Sniper Elite VR — Released on July 8, 2021</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A first crackshot at VR. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s time for another Sniper Elite first with VR! Rebellion understands trends, and 2021 had the PSVR headset in full flow with competing headsets. When it comes to VR, how do you make the thrill of looking down the lens of a Sniper Rifle more immersive? The short and sweet affair wouldn’t be the last in the virtual space.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-5-released-on-may-26-2022">Sniper Elite 5 — Released on May 26, 2022</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Karl is boss. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-5-kraken-awakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite 5</a> represents the series’ next-gen bow. The graphics are noticeably sharper (as is Karl’s aim) and the content hits harder in all the right places. Yes, I sound like a broken record, but the gameplay feels consistent and fun. I had a great time, but it feels like some key improvements are needed to elevate the franchise. SE5 is a great starting point for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S era, and Rebellion has used the hardware well.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-vr-winter-warrior-released-on-nov-30-2023">Sniper Elite VR Winter Warrior — Released on Nov. 30, 2023</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A winter wonderland. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-vr-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Winter Warrior</a> arrived two years later, featuring a limited release schedule on Meta Quest devices. It’s the first time a SE title has embraced snow. Like the Zombies spin-offs, we’ll have to see if Rebellion goes cold with future Sniper Elite VR titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-released-on-jan-30-2025">Sniper Elite Resistance — Released on Jan. 30, 2025</h3>



<figure><figcaption>And here we are. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p>And now we’ve come full circle to Sniper Elite Resistance. The sequel is a spin-off of sorts of the fifth main game, putting us in the shoes of Harry Hawker. Whatever happens, the Sniper Elite legacy is established at this point. Millions of copies have been sold, countless fans are vying for new releases, and as long as Rebellion is about, a Sniper Rifle won’t be too far away.</p>

<p>BioWare seems to be moving on from Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Just three months after its release in October, BioWare has released a new update for the game featuring a number of bug fixes. While that’s not out of the ordinary, it’s what the post on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a> says that suggests EA and BioWare are done with the game.</p>



<p>“Thank you all for playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard; we were so happy with the game’s stability&nbsp;at launch and hope you have enjoyed our Quality of Life patches since then,” the post reads. “With the game being in a stable place, we are moving to monitor for any game-breaking bugs should those occur. Dareth shiral!”</p>



<p>“Dareth shiral”, for those unaware, translates to “farewell” in the game’s language.</p>



<p>The idea that BioWare and EA are moving on from the game shouldn’t come as a surprise. Recently, EA confirmed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">missed its internal expectations</a> by nearly 50% with roughly 1.5 million players during the three months after the game’s release.</p>
