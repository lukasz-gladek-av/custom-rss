<p>This weekend, the VCT Game Changers Championship unravelled in Berlin, with ten of the greatest teams in the VALORANT space battling it out for the lion’s share of a $500,000 prize pool. By the time the dust had settled, Shopify Rebellion stood victorious, claiming the trophy without dropping a single map in an epic upper-bracket run.</p>



<p>The team proved to be an unstoppable force, effortlessly walking through all comers to secure the $180,000 grand prize and beating MIBR GC in the grand final.</p>

<h2 id="h-epic-win">Epic Win</h2>



<p>This is Shopify Rebellion’s second VCT Game Changers Championship win in as many years. Last year, the team showed up strong in Sao Paolo, beating Team Liquid in the grand final and taking home one of the biggest prizes in VALORANT esports. The year before that, during the inaugural event, SR managed to pick up a second-place finish.</p>



<p>Now that SR has secured back-to-back championship wins, nobody can doubt that the organisation is a contender for the title of the best team in the Game Changers space. Only G2 Gozen comes close, but the European team finished in third place this time around.</p>



<p>According to Esports Charts, this year’s Game Changers Championship set a new viewership record, pulling in a peak concurrent viewer count of just over 460,000 users. By comparison, last year’s event secured just 293,000 peak viewers. </p>



<p>To put that into perspective, Rainbow Six Siege’s BLAST R6 Major Montreal took place this weekend, and viewership for that event peaked at around 169,000 viewers – and this is one of Rainbow Six’s best years on record.</p>



<p>Since being introduced not too long after VALORANT was released, the Game Changers tournament space has grown immeasurably. It’s arguably the finest representation of a female-led esports ecosystem in the industry, and it’s continuing to expand.</p>

<p>The BLAST R6 Major Montreal has wrapped, and at the end of all things sat a redemption story for Brazil’s w7m Esports. The team went up against BDS in the grand final in Canada, mere weeks after the EU side eliminated w7m at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh in the final series.</p>



<p>Fortunately, as the match unravelled, w7m Esports found immense traction against Team BDS, losing the first map but closing out the next three back-to-back-to-back without much fuss.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-brazil-wins-big">Brazil Wins Big</h2>



<p>It has been a mixy year for w7m Esports. In February, the organisation won the Six Invitational in Sao Paolo then promptly dropped the entire roster before starting over again. In August, the team finished in second place at the Esports World Cup but still managed to net a $350,000 prize after being knocked out at the final post by Team BDS.</p>



<p>This latest win was a revenge story for w7m Esports, but it also marked the third BLAST R6 Major in just over a year that the organisation has won. In May 2023, the org won in Copenhagen, and in November 2023, the BLAST R6 Major Atlanta was ripe for the taking for the Brazilian squad.</p>



<p>This weekend, the BLAST R6 Major in Montreal played out as most people predicted. Team BDS came hard and knocked out Team Secret and FaZe Clan to make it into the grand final, while w7m swept Spacestation and beat Virtus.pro to quality for the title shot.</p>



<p>The last match in the tournament was an intense one.</p>



<p>As the series opened on Consulate, Team BDS pushed for an early win, but w7m immediately fired back on Nighthaven with a retaliatory point. From there, it was effortless for the Brazilian squad, as the following two matches on Clubhouse and Kafe were tidied up without too much resistance.</p>



<p>The stunning set pieces put out by w7m’s DoDez earned him MVP of the grand final.</p>



<p>That marks the end of the 2024 competitive schedule for Rainbow Six Siege – what’s next is the Six Invitational 2025, which will be held in Boston in February.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/actor-resume-reveals-%E2%80%98back-4-blood-2%E2%80%99-is-in-development.1038237/</guid>

<p>An actor’s resume has revealed that Back 4 Blood 2 by Turtle Rock Studios could be in active development.</p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-back-4-blood-2-in-development-with-codename-gobi-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mp1st</a>, the information was spotted on the <a href="https://www.istunt.com/jesse-hutch-4776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">resume of actor Jesse Hutch</a>, who lists ‘Gobi 2’ as a part of his motion capture performances. Gobi was the codename for the original Back 4 Blood, so it doesn’t take a genius to assume that a sequel under the name ‘Gobi 2’ could also be in development.</p>



<p>As spotted by mp1st, back4blood2.com was also registered by the developers in May 2023, suggesting that the company could be lining up for an announcement at some point.</p>



<p>In February 2023, the developers announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/back-4-blood-shelved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Back 4 Blood would cease further development</a> and post-launch content.</p>



<p>In the statement that was&nbsp;<a href="https://turtlerockstudios.com/news/b4b-2223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on the studio’s website</a>, the future of the firm was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Turtle Rock Studios is actually pretty small for a studio making AAA games. We don’t have quite enough folks to continue working on Back 4 Blood content while we spin up another game – yes, another game! Given this, it’s time for us to put our heads down, get back in the lab, and get to work on the next big thing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Turtle Rock Studios is the developer behind the game. Seven developers worked on the demo that would become Left 4 Dead. Back 4 Blood was announced in March 2019 and later revealed during The Game Awards in 2020. </p>



<p><span>Back 4 Blood w</span>as first released in October 2021 for&nbsp;PlayStation 4,&nbsp;PlayStation 5,&nbsp;Windows,&nbsp;Xbox One, and&nbsp;Xbox Series X/S. The game received mixed reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic, but in February 2022, Warner Bros. announced that the game had over 10 million players and was one of the fastest-selling original IPs in 2021.</p>
