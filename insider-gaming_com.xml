            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-cs2-active-duty-map-pool/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Valve and numerous community creators have created hundreds of Counter-Strike maps over the years, but CS2 currently utilizes what’s called the Active Duty map pool. Active Duty maps, in Valve’s own words, represent the most balanced and competitive maps in the total pool.</p>



<p>But the Active Duty pool is subject to change, in order to keep the iconic first-person shooter gameplay from feeling too stale.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-current-cs2-active-duty-map-pool">What is the current CS2 Active Duty map pool?</h2>



<p>The Active Duty map pool consists of seven maps that are used in CS2’s primary competitive mode, Premier. The Active Duty map pool is also the selection of maps used at every competitive tournament, from smaller online and local events to the illustrious Majors.</p>



<p>While Valve doesn’t always make a change to the Active Duty pool after every Major, the changes do occur then. This gives pro teams time to get used to the current map pool before the start of the next Major.</p>



<p><strong>Here is the current Active Duty map pool in Counter-Strike 2:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Ancient</li>



<li>Anubis</li>



<li>Dust II</li>



<li>Inferno</li>



<li>Mirage</li>



<li>Nuke</li>



<li>Train</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-adds-train-to-map-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Train is the newest addition to the Active Duty pool</a>, having been added in January 2025 after making its CS2 debut months earlier. Mirage is the longest standing map in the Active Duty pool, and it is the only map that has never been rotated out. Mirage has been played at every single Counter-Strike Major, dating back to DreamHack Winter 2013. Overpass, Cobblestone, Vertigo, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-is-cache-in-counter-strike-2-answered/">and Cache</a> have also spent time in the Active Duty pool.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Active Duty pool is only a fraction of the total number of maps available in Counter-Strike 2. CS2 also features newer community creations like Edin and Basalt, or the maps specifically made for modes like Wingman or Arms Race. Still, Active Duty maps are the most recognizable ones to most Counter-Strike players.</p>



<p>How would you change the Active Duty map pool after the next Major? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The tease of wireless mouse functionality for the new Joy-Cons on the Nintendo Switch 2 appears to be more than just that. A recently <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">discovered patent</a> seems to explain the feature while also providing drawings of the mouse functionality.</p>



<p>According to the patent, the Joy-Con features a “mouse operation sensor” that “detects reflected light from the detected surface that changes by moving on the detected surface with one of the first side surface and the second side surface placed on the detected surface.”</p>







<p>The sensor is located under the side of the Joy-Con—callout 170 in the images below. Based on the images, it appears players will be able to use one Joy-Con as a mouse while using the other in a standard way. Both Joy-Cons, however, appear to have the mouse sensor feature.</p>



<p>You can see the patent drawings depicting the feature below (click the image to enlarge).</p>

<p>Full details on how this new use for the Joy-Con have yet to be revealed. However, it could be assumed that Nintendo will go into more detail on that when it hosts its Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-direct-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">direct event on April 2</a>. During the show, Nintendo is expected to reveal full specs about the console as well as show the first set of games for the system. A price and release date announcement is also anticipated.</p>

<p>Ubisoft is releasing a manga that will dive into the prequel story of Assassin’s Creed Shadows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The official Assassin’s Creed <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1887426010427089267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) announced the arrival of this Shadows Prequel Manga today. Interested players can purchase it in Japan when the game releases on March 20, 2025. Availability for other regions will arrive later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows prequel manga will focus on the journey of “a young Assassin apprentice.” It isn’t clear whether Naoe is this “Assassin apprentice,” as the cover art features a different woman. This Assassin will fight “against the growing presence of the Templars order in Japan.” The cover art features a woman perched on a roof, wearing the famed white Assassin hood. She holds a katana in her right hand and the iconic Hidden Blade in her left.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some commenters have predicted that the woman featured in the cover art could be “<a href="https://x.com/SuperDropKick17/status/1887532530879942672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Naoe’s Mom</a>.” Others wonder why nothing related to <a href="https://x.com/readonlyac36188/status/1887451162103763304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yasuke</a> was included in the cover art. More details about the manga should be revealed closer to release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows can now be pre-ordered for $69.99 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and Ubisoft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">file size</a> of Assassin’s Creed Shadows was revealed through its listing on the Mac App Store. The game’s art book, which showcases new art, also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-artwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked recently on an 18+ website</a>. What are your thoughts on the Assassin’s Creed Shadows prequel manga?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>“With the ARK x&nbsp;Power&nbsp;Rangers&nbsp;Wave 2 Premium Mod, we aim to offer players a unique blend of nostalgic and modern gameplay, filled with detailed cosmetics and epic game styles that bring iconic IPs to life like never before,””” Alex Seropian, Founder and CEO of Look North World, said.</p>
