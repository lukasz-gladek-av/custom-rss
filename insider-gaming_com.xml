<p>I saw a few people mark down STALKER 2 in the game’s earliest reviews because it’s ‘too difficult’. As a relatively casual gamer, I’m playing on STALKER 2’s easiest difficulty, and in almost 50 hours, I’ve died plenty – so it’s tough, but it’s an <strong>enjoyable </strong>kind of challenge.</p>



<p>That’s too much for some. In the last couple of days, dozens of mods have surfaced on platforms like Nexus Mods, many of which are aimed at making the game easier by scrapping some ‘troublesome’ features or toning down the difficulty of some more suffocating enemies.</p>



<p>It’s not the way The Zone is meant to be explored.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-giving-in">Giving In</h2>



<p>STALKER 2 isn’t supposed to be a cakewalk. You’re plunged into a near-post-apocalyptic environment overflowing with elemental anomalies and mutants out for your blood. Every two minutes, you’re hunkering down amidst a brutal gunfight between factions, and even trying to track down a stash or a hidden backpack could lead to an untimely death.</p>



<p>But that’s how it was designed – it doesn’t hold your hand too much, and that’s how fans like it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl?tab=popular+%28all+time%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Nexus</a>, STALKER 2 mods have already been downloaded more than 350,000 times.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the game’s fifth most popular mod turns down the difficulty of Bloodsuckers and Poltergeists, some of the more finicky enemies in the game. As you explore The Zone, you’ll regularly brush up against both, but Bloodsuckers are much more common.</p>



<p>The next mod down the line removes weapon and outfit durability, which means you’ll never need to pay to repair your weapons in STALKER 2. It can admittedly get very expensive as you work your way through the game, but it’s also easy enough to earn money, so that shouldn’t be a problem for a gamer willing to <strong>try</strong>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you’ve got mods like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Low Mutant Health</li>



<li>No Weight for Resources</li>



<li>Longer Sprinting</li>



<li>Unlimited Carry Weight</li>
</ul>



<p>If you spend a few minutes downloading STALKER 2 mods on Nexus, you’ll end up with a game that looks and runs a little better, but it’ll also likely be much easier – and that’s going to ruin the point of the game.</p>



<p>Do you think STALKER 2 is too tough? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The first FIFA game since the organization’s breakup from EA has officially been announced. FIFA and developer <a href="https://fifa.rivals.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mythical Games</a> have revealed FIFA Rivals, a new mobile soccer game.</p>



<p>Launching in summer 2025 for iOS and Android, FIFA Rivals will be an arcade experience similar to that of the popular NFL Rivals mobile game. According to Mythical Games, FIFA Rivals allows players to create and manage their own clubs with the ability to level up and enhance their lineups as well as play with other players.</p>



<p>The game will be free-to-play and feature in-game transactions backed by Mythical’s Mythos blockchain.</p>

<p>The announcement of FIFA Rivals comes seven months after FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that a new “e-game” was being developed. While it’s not confirmed that this is the game he was referring to, it’s not the only gaming venture FIFA is involved with.</p>



<p>The organization <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fifa-partners-with-konami-for-the-fifae-world-cup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">partnered with Konami</a> to use eFootball as the official game for the FIFAe World Cup. There have also been continued talks between FIFA and Take-Two Interactive and 2K <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regarding a licensing agreement</a> in some from. There’s been no official update or announcement on where those talks stand or if they’ve happened, but Insider Gaming understands that they were ongoing as of summer 2024. What’s more, rumors have continued to circulate that FIFA would like to see a new console title released some time around the 2026 FIFA World Cup. </p>



<p>What do you think of FIFA Rivals being the first announced FIFA title for the organization after leaving EA and EA Sports?

<p>Bethesda Game Studios revealed months ago that a fresh and imminent update will allow players to assume control of Ghouls in Fallout 76. Far from being a simple cosmetic redesign, taking on the role of a Ghoul comes with several benefits and disadvantages that will make playing as a rotting, irradiated individual quite interesting indeed.</p>



<p>In a recent update, the team shared the unique abilities and perks coming to Ghoul characters, but until now, they neglected to say when they’d arrive in Fallout 76.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-little-longer-to-wait">A Little Longer to Wait</h2>



<p>Bethesda is rolling out the ‘Player Ghoul’ update in March 2025, alongside the game’s 20th season. On December 3, the 19th season of Fallout 76 will be deployed worldwide, bringing players more than two months of content, events, and special promotions.</p>



<p>In October, I broke down the idea of a Ghoul character in Fallout 76, listing the unique attributes, such as healing by radiation, that players following this path will be able to soak up.</p>



<p>There’s almost nothing in the way of becoming a Ghoul, either. If you’ve hit level 50, you’re free to transform into one, and at any point, you can switch back – just in case you don’t like the way it plays.</p>



<p>There’s still quite a while to wait, unfortunately. It seemed as though it was right on the horizon, but Bethesda Game Studios typically drags its feet when Fallout 76 updates are pending. At the end of the day, this is a live service game, and that means that it’s not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>



<p>It’ll be worth it when it’s finally here. Are you going to play as a Ghoul in Fallout 76? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Just a few months after its announcement, Rebellion has canceled its Sniper Elite Battle Royale game, Archipelago.</p>



<p>First announced in August 2024, Project Archipelago, internally known as Sniper Island, was a team-based multiplayer Battle Royale in which teams of three battled it out to be the last to survive. The game had its last Alpha playtests in mid-August 2024.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the game was canceled because Tencent decided not to continue funding the project. While we’ve not been able to pinpoint the exact reason, Rebellion higher-ups implied in meetings with staff that funding was pulled due to the disastrous launch of Firewalk Studios’ Concord, which caused Tencent to get skittish about some of its projects.</p>



<p>Archipelago’s announcement didn’t necessarily go down well with Sniper Elite fans, either. Its reveal was criticized on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gulSkpVklx4&amp;ab_channel=Rebellion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebellion YouTube channel</a>, with fans confused over Rebellion’s decision to move from single-player games to a Battle Royale. </p>



<p><span>It’s understood that despite the game’s canc</span>ellation, no one’s employment was affected, with staff being moved to other projects, including&nbsp;Sniper Elite: Resistance, its next mainline Sniper Elite game.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming asked Rebellion to comment before publication, but they declined to comment.</p>
