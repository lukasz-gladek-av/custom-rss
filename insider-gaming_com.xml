<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the most highly-anticipated games of 2025. It’s an open-world RPG with epic proportions, giving players a massive story to explore in one of the most immersive environments ever concocted by a developer. It sounds great at first blush, but is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on PlayStation 5, or are PS players locked out of the experience?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-kingdom-come-2-be-on-ps5">Will Kingdom Come 2 Be on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on PS5 </strong>when it goes live worldwide on February 4, 2024.</p>



<p>It’ll also be available on PC and Xbox Series X|S consoles – but it’s <strong>not </strong>being released on Game Pass – yet.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018) was available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, so Warhorse Studios has followed suit in releasing the follow-up title across the same spread. In March 2024, the first game in the series was also released on Nintendo Switch, which was nothing short of an engineering marvel.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-much-will-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-cost-on-ps5">How much will Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Cost on PS5?</h3>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a full-priced, premium release. This expansive game has a gargantuan map (or two) to explore, as well as a story and side content that’ll easily require a 100-hour investment to capture everything. </p>



<p>With that being said, <strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will cost $69.99 for the standard edition of the game</strong>. If you want more content, you can buy Kingdom Come 2 on PS5 for $89.99, securing the ‘Gold Edition’.</p>



<h3 id="h-will-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-be-on-ps-plus">Will Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Be on PS Plus?</h3>



<p>It’s impossible to say if Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will surface on PS Plus. The first game had a stint on the subscription service, but that was a few years after it hit the open market. It arrived much earlier on Game Pass, and who’s to say that it won’t happen again with KCD2?</p>



<p>I’d recommend that you don’t wait to see if it’ll appear on PlayStation Plus, as you run the risk of having a marvellous game spoiled by those streaming it and talking about it online. This game has a masterful story that must be experienced first-hand, so it’s worth the initial investment.</p>
