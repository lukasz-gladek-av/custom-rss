<p>A series of articles that were seemingly posted too early have revealed a new studio founded by former Metro developers from 4A Games. The studio, dubbed ‘Reburn’, is developing a futuristic sci-fi shooter that looks as though it could be straight out of the Killzone series. It’s named ‘La Quimera’, and an announcement trailer for the game was <strong>almost </strong>grabbed by eagle-eyed users.</p>



<p>Instead, we have a series of screencaps to go on. These images showcase an attractive, intense first-person shooter, the origins of which are hard to pinpoint. One screenshot shows the player character fighting with soldiers who have bright orange eyes on their helmets, which utterly smacks of Killzone, the long-abandoned PlayStation FPS series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-out-of-nowhere">From Out of Nowhere</h2>



<p>La Quimera translates directly from Spanish to English as ‘The Chimera’. That’s a mythological monster created by combining elements from multiple creatures, which immediately gives La Quimera a kind of ‘experiment gone wrong’ vibe. The game’s story has reportedly been penned by Nicolas Winding Refn (<em>Drive</em>, <em>The Neon Demon</em>).</p>



<p>One Spanish-speaking publication revealed several details about the game. First, it’s set ‘in a Latin American megalopolis’, </p>



<p>The screenshots that were captured and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-metro-series-devs-form-new-game-studio-reburn-reveal-new-sc-fi-shooter-la-quimera-trailer.1118565/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared on ResetEra</a> showcase a futuristic first-person shooter that could be Killzone 4 if you weren’t privy to this news.</p>



<p>In the post on ResetEra, users shared several screenshots that reveal what looks like a remarkable game at first blush. From hulking, animalistic robot enemies to dramatic showdowns between what looks like a resistance group and heavily armoured soldiers, a lot of lore is already being established for La Quimera.</p>



<p>In some scenes, we get a look at a world that appears to be somewhat devastated and overgrown, suggesting some post-apocalyptic vibes might be present. That theme fits perfectly into the wheelhouse of these developers, given that they worked on Metro.</p>



<p>There’s also a title splash that reveals the player character, an armoured individual reminiscent of a Halo Spartan or ‘Prophet’ from the Crysis series. This title splash suggests the game is only coming to PC platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-imminent-reveal">Imminent Reveal</h2>



<p>It has been claimed that La Quimera is an ‘ambitious’ game that fuses ‘exoticism and Latin folklore’ with ‘weapons and technology of the future’. The ‘Metro touch’ is front and centre from the 110 developers working on the project, many of whom have acquired experience from years of working at 4A Games.</p>



<p>It has been mentioned that it’s set to be a narrative-driven adventure playable either solo or in a group of up to four players.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known when Reburn plans to fully reveal La Quimera, but given that at least three outlets have their hands on a trailer and screenshots, it could be any day now. Studios and publishers will rarely share content like this too long before an announcement is made, for <strong>this very reason that we’re discussing</strong>.</p>



<p>Remember – <strong>it’s not confirmed until it’s confirmed, and this content is all subject to change.</strong></p>



<p>What do you think about La Quimera? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>You’ve just hit a beautiful clip in Counter-Strike 2. A 1v4 or a 1v5 in the final rounds of regulation to give your team the win. Your voice chat crackles to life with the sounds of your jubilant teammates. But then reality sets in: you don’t have any program to clip it with.</p>



<p>So many CS2 players have lost clips to the void because they don’t have any clipping software. With all the choices, it can feel overwhelming to pick one, but most provide the same basic features while offering some neat additional ones. Here are our recommendations for the best clipping software to capture your CS2 highlights.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-clipping-software">Best CS2 Clipping Software</h2>



<h3 id="h-medal">Medal</h3>



<p>Medal is a popular choice for clipping highlights from CS2 and other titles. There are several features that Medal utilizes that are attractive to players, including built-in editor tools and an activity feed where you can share and view other clips. Medal lets players hit a shortcut key to save footage from the past 15 seconds up all the way to the past 20 minutes, or the entirety of the gameplay session. You can also use the editing tools on video that wasn’t captured through Medal.</p>



<p>Medal offers a premium the enables cloud sync and larger uploads to the feed, but it’s also a free-to-use application.</p>



<h3 id="h-steelseries-gg">SteelSeries GG</h3>



<p>The SteelSeries GG application, which is used for managing your SteelSeries devices, also features a Moments section for clipping highlights of CS2 and other games. What sets it apart from other pieces of software is an auto-clip feature that automatically slips specific moments. For CS2 in particular, it will automatically detect and clip 3-kill rounds, headshot kills, and knife kills, but you can adjust it to only include one or two of these events. Additionally, after your game closes, a window pops up of all the clips generated, letting you quickly delete ones not worth keeping.</p>



<h3 id="h-steam-game-recording">Steam Game Recording</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Steam introduced Steam Game Recording back in June 2024, giving players the option to sign up for the program beta and clip highlights through Steam. Steam Game Recording offers two recording options: manual recording that starts and stops with a keyboard recording, or automatic “background recording” that saves your most recent two hours of gameplay. After recording, players can use the built-in clip editor to trim down recordings into clips.</p>
