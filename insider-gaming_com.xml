<p>Whenever a game is delayed, the desire to play it as soon as possible intensifies. Dying Light: The Beast fans have had to experience this pain, which is why early access would be a terrific boon to lessen the wait.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> was delayed by 4 weeks. If it was the game you were most looking forward to in 2025, I can imagine you’ve been in your own zombie-like state throughout August and the early parts of September. Techland seems confident in The Beast’s revised release date. I can tell you that Insider Gaming’s recent hands-on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-preview-evolution-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview</a> should give you cause for excitement.</p>



<p>It’s hit and miss if single-player games have early access—which is where Dying Light: The Beast comes into the undead equation.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A hop, a skip, and a thump. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of writing, there is no Dying Light: The Beast early access, meaning the first real opportunity to play the game is via its September 19 release date.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/the-beast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dying Light: The Beast</a> <em>does </em>have a special deluxe edition. But it doesn’t feature 24, 48, or even 7-day early access. It includes special cosmetic skins, the game’s official soundtrack, and other handy in-game items. But there’s definitely no early access to get you to part ways with more money.</p>



<p>In fairness, the deluxe edition is only a handful of dollars more than the standard edition. If it did offer early access, I expect there’d be a greater discrepancy in price. As an old-school gamer, I’m happy when games don’t offer this, as it’s better when everyone can jump in together on the same day, avoid spoilers, and get a chance to experience the hilarious and bizarre antics in unison.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-dying-light-the-beast-demo">Is There A Dying Light: The Beast Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s not even a Dying Light: The Beast demo for you to get a small taster of what’s to come.</strong></p>



<p>Techland is adamant about the game’s content. The only way you play Dying Light: The Beast is on release day. If you need snippets of gameplay and details on the game and its development, though, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderGamingTrailers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Trailers</a> YouTube page has a ton of Dyihng Light: The Beast content to watch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isnt-a-hitman-reskin/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isn%E2%80%99t-a-hitman-%E2%80%9Creskin%E2%80%9D.1288581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light developers have clarified that it isn’t a reskin of Hitman and is different in many aspects. </p>



<p>007 First Light received an exclusive State of Play event yesterday, which featured 30 minutes of gameplay along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date announcement</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-deluxe-edition-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order details</a>. Since then, a new interview has emerged in which the developers have clarified that the James Bond game is distinct from Hitman. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-s-driving-was-a-huge-challenge">007 First Light’s Driving Was A “Huge Challenge”</h2>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/007-first-light-is-not-a-reskin-of-hitman-io-interactive-says-again-and-the-team-brought-in-amazing-fresh-talent-including-devs-with-specific-driving-expertise-to-help-build-car-missions/">GamesRadar+</a>, senior licensing producer Theuns Smit explained how Hitman and 007 First Light are two different games. Smit first talked about how they have a very talented team that has expanded significantly since the game was announced. They were able to bring in fresh talent, which, along with the existing staff, became “a really big growth moment” for the studio. </p>



<p>The new developers were able to bring in “fresh eyes, fresh expertise, all of that” while also relying on IO Interactive’s strengths and their 25 years of massive experience. However, Smit explains that it is about the game and experience first, stating, “If you’re looking at Hitman, it’s the way it is for a particular reason, because that’s the gameplay experience we want to give. For Bond, it’s not exactly that. It’s not a reskin of that.”</p>



<p>Smit then spoke about driving, describing it as “absolutely a huge challenge,” and they had to bring on developers with driving expertise, which included “people that had experience coding, setting up, tweaking, balancing.” He added that it is “a balancing act of making a vehicle feel both exciting, credible, and dangerous at the same time as being approachable and fun for a wide audience.” Finding this balance was difficult and a “new adventure” for them, but they feel they have “landed in an amazing space.” </p>

<p>Techland is set to make us all feel alive again with Dying Light: The Beast—the third mainline entry in the survival horror series. If you want to know Dying Light: The Beast’s release date and launch times, you’ve come to the right, safe place.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-dying-light-docket-codes-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> has been a long time coming. What started as DLC has become a beast within its own right. The Beast is smaller but more focused and dense compared to Dying Light 2. Old-school fans are thrilled to learn that OG protagonist Kyle Crane is back—even if he has become an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpected thirst trap</a>!</p>



<p>We’ve loved Dying Light: The Beast in our initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-preview-evolution-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming previews</a>. So let’s see its release date and what to expect.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Ready for some more? Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast is locked in for a September 19 release date across various platforms.</strong></p>



<p>The hearts of the Dying Light community were broken back in July 2025 when Techland announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast was delayed by 4 weeks</a>. The official reasons given were “To allow for extra polishing work” and “Finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscene and player animations further.”</p>



<p>Again, we’ve played The Beast, and the improvements are noticeable. Expectations are very high for Dying Light: The Beast, and its release date (and start times) can’t come soon enough.</p>

<p>Despite The Roblox Corporation’s best intentions to protect children with new age verification tools, Kidas CEO Ron Kerbs believes it’s not enough, and has told Insider Gaming that Roblox needs to incorporate “Real-time behavioral monitoring.”</p>



<p>A new wave of age verification has emerged in the last 12 months, with businesses worldwide beginning to clamp down on who can access specific content. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online</a> is reportedly getting age verification, for example, and Roblox has added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-adding-video-selfie-security-measures-to-protect-teenagers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">security measures to protect teenagers</a> in 2025.</p>



<p>There have been concerns that while this is a good start, a lot more needs to be done.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-requires-real-time-behavioral-monitoring-says-kidas-ceo">Roblox Requires Real-Time Behavioral Monitoring, Says Kidas CEO</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No Roblox game or community is truly safe! Image credit: Roblox Corporation</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ron Kerbs is the CEO of <a href="https://getkidas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kidas</a>: A “Cybersecurity company committed to enhancing the safety of young gamers in the digital realm. Employing advanced AI technology, ProtectMe monitors and mitigates cyberbullying, online predators, and other digital threats in real time.</p>



<p>The company’s goal is simple: Protect kids and young gamers from online predators and harassment so they can enjoy video games with safety and peace of mind.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has obtained an exclusive quote from Ron discussing Roblox’s recent age verification measures:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Roblox’s new age verification effort is a step in the right direction—but it’s not the full answer. While technology like facial analysis and ID scans can help restrict access to mature content, these tools are still easily bypassed and don’t address the most pressing safety issues kids face online every day.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kidas has seen evidence of how predators operate and take advantage of younger children, and is doing all it can to increase security measures:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that no verification method—AI or otherwise—can guarantee that the person behind a screen is who they claim to be. We’ve seen kids be groomed and scammed by individuals who pass verification checks but still engage in harmful behavior. What’s needed isn’t just more gates, but better guardrails. Roblox and platforms like it must invest in real-time behavioral monitoring, not just one-time identity checks. Protecting kids isn’t about proving you’re over 13—it’s about detecting when a conversation is going dangerously off track and stepping in fast. We applaud the intention. Now let’s raise the standard for execution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We definitely need to see more action like this and companies paying greater attention to child safety. Kidas says it’s protected over 400,000 gamers and counting and issues an alarming statistic on its home page: “3&nbsp;out of&nbsp;5 U.S. kids who play online games will be scammed or harassed before age 18.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming wants to know what <em>you </em>think. Is enough being done to protect young gamers who just want to experience the joys and thrills we all had growing up playing games without the fear of strangers and predators on the internet? Please let us know.</p>
