<p>New information claims that Bungie’s upcoming MOBA, Gummy Bears, is inspired by Smash Bros and is being developed by a new PlayStation Studio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/exclusive-details-bungie-moba-smash-bros-gummybears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, sources close to the project have revealed that Bungie’s Gummy Bears will introduce several elements from Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. franchise while being a “MOBA at its core.” Aspects such as a “percentage-based damaged system,” players being knocked off the map, and more will seemingly be incorporated into the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Bungie’s Gummy Bears has been in development for three years and aims to target a younger audience by incorporating “vibrant and colourful visuals.” The title is called the “most fun” project from incubation, and multiple game modes are in the works. The title will also feature a class system with roles such as Support, Attack, and Defence. There will also be a social aspect to the game, where players can interact with each other between matches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last we heard about Bungie’s Gummy Bears MOBA was in 2023 when it was revealed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-new-game-to-use-unreal-engine-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PvP title was being developed in Unreal Engine 5</a>. Since then, the project has been handed over to a new PlayStation Studio, where 40 Bungie devs have joined the team to carry out the development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a former executive claimed that Bungie hired fans <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-hired-fans-as-they-would-work-for-less-former-exec-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as they would work for less money</a>. Also, the former Marathon Director has sued Bungie and Sony <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-denies-conduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over alleged inappropriate contact</a>.
