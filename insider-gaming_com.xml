<p>It’s Saturday, and as we usher in a new weekend, it’s time to present you with the best NYT Connections solutions you’ll find anywhere. Today’s puzzle is a tricky one, but the hints I’ve got below will help you find the answers as quickly as possible. With that done, you can get on with your weekend!</p>



<p>Read on to check out today’s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-18">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 18)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #860:</p>



<ul>
<li>HAND</li>



<li>HOCK</li>



<li>PEDAL</li>



<li>SKATE</li>



<li>BACON</li>



<li>CELL</li>



<li>PICKLE</li>



<li>CAGE</li>



<li>DODGE</li>



<li>COAST</li>



<li>FORD</li>



<li>BREEZE</li>



<li>CRUISE</li>



<li>RACQUET</li>



<li>FLOAT</li>



<li>TRAYED</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Think effortless motion across surfaces — air, water, ice, or pavement.</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Each word sets the stage for a different sport or quirky pastime</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – These names rack up IMDb credits like it’s a competition.</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Each word echoes a term for ‘to sell,’ but plays a phonetic trick.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 18.</p>
