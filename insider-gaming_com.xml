<p>The Minecraft Movie is proving to be a cultural phenomenon. It’s Chicken Jockeying for position in 2025’s list of box office hits, but the fandom is going overboard to the point theaters are issuing a warning disclaimer to Minecraft Movie patrons.</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie was always going to be a success. Mojang’s Minecraft is far too big and has resonated with hundreds of millions of players for years. So it doesn’t shock me (or anyone) that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/">A Minecraft Movie is the biggest opening day ever for a Video Game Movie</a>.</p>



<p>It made over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$300 million in its opening weekend</a>, and people are flocking to see the movie every day. Its success has already put the wheels in motion for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>. It’s fair to say the filmmakers—and theaters—will be looking for viewers to control themselves more with a follow-up. For some reason, people are throwing popcorn around rather than eating it.</p>

<p>Movie popcorn isn’t exactly cheap, so it baffles me why people are yeeting it around like there’s no tomorrow. However, this is exactly what’s happening in theaters around the world right now.</p>



<p>The “Chicken Jockey” viral Trend sees attendees start hollering and throwing popcorn everywhere when a certain action in the movie happens. Some of the social media scenes are a real “must be seen to be believed” type of deal. But it probably needs to stop, which is why more recent showings now come with a disclaimer.</p>



<p>X user <a href="https://x.com/ScaredGirlTweet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ScaredGirlTweet</a> shared a video of the new disclaimer. It says: “<strong>Welcome to the Block Party. Please remember, be kind, be respectful, and most of all, remember that popcorn buckets are not to be used as Ender Pearls.</strong>“</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those who don’t get the reference, Ender Pearls are items that can be thrown in Minecraft—the more you know!</p>

<p>Another indie games studio is closing its doors. It  has been announced that Makea Games, the studio behind the game Supermoves, is shutting down “effective immediately”.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/toikka_activity-7317524349664509953-Y8MO?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement was made</a> on Monday morning by the studio’s CEO and founder Tomi Toikka.</p>



<p>“After over three incredible years building Supermoves and bringing the vision of the Makeaverse to life through user-generated content, we’ve reached the end of the road for Makea Games,” Toikka said. “Despite our team’s best efforts — and the unwavering support of our community, collaborators, and partners — we are deeply saddened to announce that Makea Games is officially winding down, effective immediately.”</p>



<p>He closed his statement thanking those who believed “in a small team with big dreams” while adding that there is a “fire to build again”.</p>



<p>Makea Games’ first, and only, game called Supermoves: World of Parkour launched in August 2024. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1959580/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game’s playerbase peaked at just 50 players with a recent 24-hour peak of just two players.</p>



<p>What do you make of Makea Games shutting down less than a year after releasing its first game? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>It was recently claimed that a slew of characters from popular franchises were heading to Fortnite, which isn’t by any means a reach for the game. The list featured the likes of Agent 47, Mortal Kombat fighters, Jack Black, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 characters.</p>



<p>The latter title was a bit out of left field, as aside from having a successful launch in February, there’s no real reason why Fortnite would accommodate characters from the medieval RPG epic.</p>



<p>I caught up with one of the game’s actors and tuned into the Warhorse team on socials to see this claim debunked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-henry-of-tilted-towers">Henry of Tilted Towers</h2>



<p>We recently reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-characters-list-leaked/">on a claim that aired</a> during an episode of the XboxEra Podcast. During a brief segment, ShpeshalNick claimed that a string of characters is coming to Fortnite, some more bizarre than others. Amongst the list sat ‘Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’ characters.</p>



<p>I leapt straight over to catch up with Luke Dale, the talent behind Hans Capon in KCDII, and he was none the wiser about the leak. He suggested that KCDII’s publisher might <span>b</span>e <strong>making moves </strong>without anyone knowing, but the team at Warhorse Studios, KCDII’s developer, echoed the sentiment:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The claim hasn’t been corroborated by any of the ‘typical’ Fortnite leakers and insiders, so for now, I’d advise taking this with a pinch of salt. The folks at Warhorse might be trying to subvert our expectations by playing it down, or they could genuinely have no idea what this claim is taking about.</p>



<p>It’s not unheard of for a popular franchise or release to make it into Fortnite <strong>just because </strong>it’s successful, but out of the entire list provided by ShpeshalNick, Kingdom Come just stands out as being too out of left field.</p>
