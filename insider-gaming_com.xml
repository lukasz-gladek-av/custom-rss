            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release of the PlayStation 6 (PS6) is only two years away. That, according to a known gaming hardware leaker.</p>



<p>After a recent video featuring PlayStation’s Mark Cerny and AMD’s Jack Huynh was posted, discussing the future of technology between the two parties, questions began to mount about when the next PlayStation console would be released. On the discussion forum <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/from-project-amethyst-to-the-future-of-play-amd-and-sony-interactive-entertainment%E2%80%99s-shared-vision.1688947/page-4#post-270885018">NeoGAF</a>, a user mentioned 2027 being “on the table” for the new system. That led to KeplerL2, who’s been accurate with hardware information in the past, to chime in.</p>



<p><strong>“Not just on the table,”</strong> they said, <strong>“it’s the plan unless any unexpected delays happen.”</strong></p>



<p>A 2027 release date shouldn’t surprise too many people. Rumors have long suggested that Sony’s next-gen console is expected in either late 2027 or early 2028. As far as what to expect from the system, there have been claims that Sony is planning to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release a standard</a> PS6 along <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a dockable</a> PS6 handheld. </p>



<p>Rumored specs for the PS6 include 40-48 RDNA 5 compute units, 160W TBP, 8 x Zen 6 Cores, a 160- or 192-bit memory bus, and backwards compatibility with PS5 and PS4 games, among others.</p>



<p>As with any claim like this, please take the information with a grain of salt until Insider Gaming can independently verify the plans or Sony confirms them itself.</p>



<p>Do you believe the release of the PS6 will happen sometime in 2027, or will it be later? Leave your thoughts down in the comments below, and&nbsp;join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t normally associate Battlefield 6 with Star Wars. This is the case, though, as a fascinating video has shown how easy it is to use Battlefield 6’s Portal tools to create Star Wars Star Destroyers to engulf the sky.</p>



<p>The force is with Battlefield 6 players. Well, it’s with those who have the imagination to use it. We’ve already reported on people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaking classic Call of Duty maps</a> within hours of the game’s launch. If you thought to yourself, ‘How do you better this?’ the answer is simple: Make Star Destroyers, of course.</p>



<h2 id="h-people-are-making-star-destroyers-in-battlefield-6-portal-mode">People Are Making Star Destroyers in Battlefield 6 Portal Mode</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re going to see a lot of crazy creations. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even if you’ve never watched a Star Wars movie, chances are you’ve seen the mammoth Star Destroyers, which are comically large, and their construction is used for a sole purpose: Occupying space.</p>



<p>We’ve seen Star Destroyers for decades in Star Wars movies, and they’ve been a prominent presence in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>. It’s time for the behemoth-like vehicles to enter the fray in Battlefield 6—as shown by <a href="https://x.com/Matavatar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Matavatar</a>.</p>



<p>As you can see in the video below, using basic Battlefield 6 Portal assets, you can easily make a Star Destroyer. It feels on brand with what Portal is going for, but it remains to be seen if the content is allowed to remain.</p>



<p>Disney is infamously hard on copyright and licensing infringements, and this could be considered such. Hopefully, this isn’t the case, and we can have custom Battlefield Star Wars maps!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What wild and wacky creations have you seen in Battlefield 6 so far? Is there anything on his level or scale?

            <title><![CDATA[Is Little Nightmares 3 on PS4 or Xbox One? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-ps4-xbox-one-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-little-nightmares-3-on-ps4-or-xbox-one-all-platforms-explained.1321681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You only have to look at the previous platforms the Little Nightmares franchise has appeared on to see how inclusive the series is. As time moves on, so do business decisions. We’re seeing if Little Nightmares 3 is available on PS4, Xbox One, as well as current-gen consoles, and PC.</p>



<p>We remember the PS4 and Xbox One era like it was yesterday. It was a better time in many ways, with regular exclusive releases, brands genuinely competing to be the best, and before game and console price increases became the norm. Titles releasing on old-gen hardware—like the PS4 and Xbox One—are becoming more antiquated by the second, which brings us to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>



<p>You’re here to see if Little Nightmares 3 is on PS4 and Xbox One—as well as other platforms—and we have the answer you seek.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-little-nightmares-3-on-xbox-one-or-ps4">Can You Play Little Nightmares 3 on Xbox One or PS4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This one certainly isn’t floating away from anyone. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Little Nightmares 3 is available to buy digitally and physically on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles.</strong></p>



<p>The love for old-gen continues with <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>. It’s hard to believe that the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S came out five years ago. The PS4 and Xbox One generation feels like a lifetime ago. As such, many companies are foregoing old-gen development as it costs too much money, and the de-optimization required can be time-consuming.</p>



<p>We’d argue it’s easier for a title like Little Nightmares 3 to make this transition. Not to disrespect its graphics, it still clearly boasts a premium, high-quality polish—but not having to generate a large open-world should make development easier.</p>



<p>You only have to look at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-game-size-pre-load-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s file size</a> to see this. With the Little Nightmares franchise already past the 20 million mark in lifetime sales, having PS4 and Xbox One versions will help bolster this number. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-little-nightmares-3-platforms-explained">All Little Nightmares 3 Platforms, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>You can buy and play Little Nightmares 3 on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>Short of a mobile port, or even VR, this is as complete as a release gets in 2025! PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, and PC owners can all procure and play! Its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-little-nightmares-3-cost-price-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price</a> is slightly greater than recent games, but it’s still a fair price for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-to-beat-little-nightmares-3-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game of its length</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>You certainly aren’t starved of options when it comes to buying Little Nightmares 3, then. With even more content on the way—thanks to previously announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-chapters-dlc-guide-secrets-of-the-spiral-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC chapters</a>—this is as good a time as ever to jump on the LN3 bandwagon.

<p>Little Nightmares 3 offers a new world with new characters. As this is the third game in the series, onlookers finally peeking into the franchise are curious as to whether this is a direct sequel, if the worlds are reconnected, and also if you need to play either of the first two games before hopping into Little Nightmares 3 for the first time.</p>



<p>This might surprise you, but the Little Nightmares franchise has sold over 20 million units worldwide! This is a phenomenal achievement for an indie title. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-little-nightmares-3-have-crossplay-cross-platform-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> is moving closer to AA territory with the introduction of Supermassive Games—a renowned horror expert.</p>



<p>But today, we’re seeing if there’s a disconnect between Little Nightmares 3 and the titles that came before it, and tell you everything you need to know if you’re on the fence about buying.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-to-play-little-nightmares-1-or-2-before-playing-little-nightmares-3">Do You Need To Play Little Nightmares 1 or 2 Before Playing Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A lot to explore, but you’re not Alone. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You do not need to play Little Nightmares 1 or Little Nightmares 2 before playing Little Nightmares 3, as this is a new adventure independent of the first two games.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> features two brand-new characters—Low and Alone. The side-scrolling puzzle-platformer also takes place in a fresh location—The Nowhere. None of these properties has featured in previous Little Nightmares games. </p>



<p>So if you’re worried about missing out on crucial story lore or not understanding the game due to missing a piece of the puzzle, we can assure you that everything is learned and uncovered as you play.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-little-nightmares-3-connected-to-the-first-two-games">Is Little Nightmares 3 Connected To The First Two Games?</h2>



<p><strong>The short is no, we don’t think Little Nightmares 3 is directly connected to either of the first two games.</strong></p>



<p>At best, there’s a loose sense that Low and Alone share the same world, although it’s not directly implied. Whereas Little Nightmares 1 and 2 are more overt, as Six—the main character in Little Nightmares 1—also appears alongside Mono in Little Nightmares 2.</p>



<p>The second game is a prequel to the first, which is why they tie together so nicely and fittingly. But Little Nightmare 2 is its own entity. Everything about it is fresh, and we think it symbolizes the new beginning as the series’ development shifts away from Tarsier Games to Supermassive Games.</p>



<p>There could be some subtle clues we’ve missed throughout our playthrough—which we discussed in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3 review</a>—otherwise, you should be fine if this is your first LN experience!</p>



<hr>



<p>To recap, you don’t need to play either of the first two games before playing Little Nightmares 3. The world may be faintly connected, but this is a new adventure, and a new story. Let us know how you get on with Little Nightmares 3 via the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
