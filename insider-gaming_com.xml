<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled a series of images showcasing the in-progress rework of Customs, one of the most iconic and popular maps in the pioneering extraction shooter title. It has been years since Customs was first added to the game, and it already been altered a few times, but this latest change is nothing short of an overhaul.</p>



<p>Check out the images below.</p>

<h2 id="h-mad-changes">Mad Changes</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games is taking Customs and turning it on its head, implementing some major changes that’ll make it seem like an entirely new map. That’s what the team did recently with Factory, adding new areas and adjusting what was existing to make it feel much bigger and more detailed.</p>



<p>The latest images reveal the opening of buildings that were previously inaccessible, or adding extra details to those that were. </p>

<p>It looks like the Repair Shop and the area around it have been upgraded immeasurably, and some of the smaller interiors around the Scav Checkpoint have been altered. Further underground portions have been added, which will add more depth to the relatively one-dimensional map. </p>



<p>Battlestate flicked through <strong>many </strong>changes coming to Escape from Tarkov in the next and future updates, including a rework to hipfire and ADS mechanics, winter clothing, new weapons, and an array of grenades and attachments. It’s a tasty package, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s super-spooky Halloween event is live now, and it’s forcing players to contend with bloodthirsty zombies on Labs. As if the map wasn’t tough enough already, the latest update has pumped the undead into The Lab, and entry to the map, which is usually locked behind a keycard, is free.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-locked-and-loaded">Locked and Loaded</h2>



<p>If you’re heading to Labs, you’ll need to go loaded for action – zombies are running rampant and taking no prisoners.</p>



<p>Because zombies don’t really do that.</p>



<p>When you enter the map, you’ll be hit by a blast of radiation that doesn’t dissipate and surprise, surprise – there are no gas masks to be found anywhere within easy reach. </p>



<p>Presently, it seems like there are no special tactics involved in taking them down, but they are tanky. It’s best to go with the age-old tactic of shooting them in the head with some large-calibre weapons if you want the most successful journey through the map.</p>



<p>Players are still discovering the event as we speak, so more secrets may be revealed as the night goes on and Halloween hits in earnest.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Escape from Tarkov and are eager to explore the Halloween update? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In a fitting reveal for Halloween, NetherRealm Studios has revealed the first look at gameplay for Ghostface in Mortal Kombat 1. The gameplay was revealed by franchise co-creator Ed Boon on <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1851993028170219571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>.</p>



<p>Ghostface, for those who don’t know, is the main antagonist from the popular Scream series. What makes them so unique is that it’s never the same person under the mask in the movies. In total, there have been 14 people behind the mask.</p>



<p>In the clip, which you can see below, Ghostface fights Johnny Cage. They have their distinct voice-changer that keeps their identity hidden while also equipped with a knife.</p>



<p>Ghostface will be available in Mortal Kombat 1 starting November 19 for those with Early Access. Everyone else can start slashing away on November 26.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eeum7kp35B-QY9tv.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Ghostface is just the latest fighter to be added to Mortal Kombat since the game’s release in September 2023. He is the 10th overall addition, and a part of the game’s Kombat Pack 2. Future additions to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster will include Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2.</p>



<p>NetherRealm will announce those releases at a later date. Whether there will be a Kombat Pack 3 also remains to be announced.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ghostface coming to Mortal Kombat 1? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>If you’re looking for the best SWAT 5.56 loadout in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, we have recommended the ideal attachments, Perks, and Equipment to deal the maximum damage.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-swat-5-56-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-swat-5-56">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-swat-5-56">Best Secondary for SWAT 5.56</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock SWAT 5.56</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-swat-5-56-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the SWAT 5.56 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-swat-5-56-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best SWAT 5.56 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Attach the <strong>Suppressor</strong> for reduced gunfire sounds and to hide yourself from the minimap. The <strong>Vertical Foregrip</strong> will drastically reduce horizontal recoil, so that will come in handy while using this DMR.</p>



<p>The <strong>Long Barrel</strong> will increase the damage range while the <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> will improve the aiming speed of the weapon. Lastly, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> mod will increase the fire rate of the weapon but comes at a cost of reduced damage range, horizontal and vertical recoil control, and bullet velocity.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-swat-5-56">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for SWAT 5.56</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Enforcer</strong> is the best Specialty for the SWAT 5.56 and to get that, use Gung-Ho, Assassin, and Double Time in the respective Perk slots. This will give you a temporary buff to your movement speeds and health regeneration rate.</p>



<p>You can equip the <strong>Perk Greed </strong>Wildcard and keep <strong>Dexterity</strong> in the fourth Perk slot for reduced weapon motion while jumping, sliding, or diving.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-swat-5-56">Best Secondary for SWAT 5.56</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon option for the SWAT 5.56 is <strong>Grekhova</strong> as this fully automatic pistol will add more firepower to your loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock SWAT 5.56 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The SWAT 5.56 is unlocked immediately and you can start creating custom loadouts after reaching <strong>player level 4</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-swat-5-56-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the SWAT 5.56 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The SWAT 5.56 is a decent weapon choice as there are better options available. The things that set this weapon back are its slow TTK and mobility – two crucial aspects of multiplayer.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the SWAT 5.56 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-dm-10-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DM-10</a> is a great alternative to the SWAT 5.56 in BO6. However, if you want full-automatic options, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS VAL</a> are two meta weapons you can use right now.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino, the two CEOs at the top of Sony Interactive Entertainment, appeared in the same chat for the first time since being appointed. It’s not the most conventional way to run a company, but Sony’s CEO believes it’s a recipe for success.</p>



<p>Hulst manages the studio side of things while Nishino oversees the platform operations. In a recent chat with Variety, the pair was grilled about all things PlayStation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-our-duty-to-run-a-sustainable-business">“It’s Our Duty to Run a Sustainable Business”</h2>



<p>In Variety’s interview, the pair of CEOs first addressed the PS5 Pro, the next iteration of the PlayStation 5 that’s emerging at a very sketchy time for Sony. In recent months, the company has suffered under the weight of layoffs, studio closures, and scrutiny regarding the pricing point for this new powerhouse of a console.</p>



<p>Despite that, Hideaki Nishino remains optimistic:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We started working on PS5 Pro even before PS5 launches — it was another five-year project for us.</p>



<p>… we’re kind of happy to see, like most engaged gaming users are interested in the PS5 Pro, and then I’m pretty sure new users will grab the PS5 Pro as well. If it’s the PlayStation you want to get, that’s the thing. So that’s where we designed the generation at this moment. We design everything with having one ahead in our mind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hermen Hulst turned the talk away from hardware to what’s lined up in PlayStation’s portfolio, including new titles like Ghost of Yotei and live-action adaptations. He revealed that The Last of Us (HBO) was such a roaring success that it has been considered a ‘game changer’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We learned a lot from that.</p>



<p>At PlayStation productions, we have 10 productions now in the works: “The Last of Us,” “Twisted Metal,” a few others that we’re very excited about.</p>



<p>We’re talking about adaptations, but in adaptations, that’s taking the game and then see what else you can do with it. We’re actually looking to build from the ground up — as we tried to do originally with “Horizon,” in creating this world and creating this storyline — and how can you tell stories in this world on various mediums?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rounding out the interview with Variety, Hulst touched on a sore spot – the recent layoffs that hit PlayStation’s subsidiaries, including the shutdown of Concord and Firewalk Studios.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s our duty to look at our our resource planning, and make sure that we run a sustainable business. That’s part of being CEO. We never take that lightly, because we know these people personally, and it’s very close to our hearts and the teams and good working atmospheres. But yes, we’ve had some layoffs.</p>



<p>But it’s also important to realize that on the content side, PlayStation Studios is now a much bigger organization than when it started. It’s grown tremendously. And that is organic growth that our existing teams, I think, hired quite aggressively, as well as through M&amp;A. So the organization, the employment is much greater now than it was, let’s say, for example, five years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
