<p>Overwatch’s spotlight showcase on February 12 included <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-adds-ability-altering-perks-brings-back-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive amount of content planned for the next couple seasons</a>. Among that content is a huge new competitive mode, Stadium, that borrows from other popular titles, and provides a completely unique experience.</p>



<p>This is Stadium, and it’s coming to Overwatch 2 in Season 16.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-stadium-mode-in-overwatch">What is Stadium Mode in Overwatch?</h2>



<p><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24177197/overwatch-2-spotlight-a-new-era-of-innovation-and-excitement/#:~:text=Stadium%3A%20The%20Ultimate%20Battleground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stadium</a> is a best-of-seven-rounds competitive mode, where players use currency earned from previous rounds to buy new items and upgrades. The upgrades menu is strikingly similar to the one used in Deadlock, in that players have a finite amount of slots for traits and items. There are even starter builds that let players pick predetermined items and powers, but only for new players. Like in games such as VALORANT or Counter-Strike, players are limited to what they can afford in early rounds, but can save up for more powerful abilities later on.</p>



<p>Players will have the ability to buy, trade, and sell their abilities during any round. There abilities provide dozens of different effects, like extra projectiles, ability cooldown reductions, extra damage, extra charges, and slowing effects.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Each round of Stadium will consist of a game of one of three core modes: Control, Push, or Clash. While Stadium is a best-of-seven, a “mercy rule” will end the match if a team loses the first three rounds. There’s also a bounty system that rewards taking down dominating players.</p>



<p>Stadium will give the players the choice of playing either first-person or third-person on restructured maps. It will also feature its own ranked mode. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-i-play-stadium-in-overwatch">When Can I Play Stadium in Overwatch?</h2>



<p>Stadium mode will launch in April 2025, as part of the Season 16 update to Overwatch 2. When the mode launches in Season 16, there will be 14 core heroes available to play. More heroes, maps, and modes will be added over time, and Stadium will be subject to changes stemming from player feedback.</p>



<p>Is Stadium a mode you must try out when it launches later this year? Let us know down below and in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1197/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Two major changes to Overwatch are coming in Season 15 of the long-running hero shooter from Blizzard: the debut of gameplay perks and the return of loot boxes. Billed as the “boldest gameplay evolution yet,” perks let players level up their hero abilities with new effects mid-match.</p>



<p>Check out the full details on all the <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24177197/overwatch-2-spotlight-a-new-era-of-innovation-and-excitement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new changes</a> coming to Overwatch in Season 15 below.</p>



<h2 id="h-overwatch-s-biggest-content-change-arguably-since-the-sequel">Overwatch’s Biggest Content Change Arguably Since the Sequel</h2>



<p>The new perk system allows player to upgrade their hero’s kit during a match by earning level experience. Players can earn level experience by getting kills, dealing damage, and healing. The perks are similar to Reality Augments in Fortnite: when a player unlocks the ability to get a perk, they can use their controls to select one of the two options. If a player switches heroes during a match, their hero level will reset, but they will earn experience faster. Players can equip three perks per match: two Minor perks, and one Major perk.</p>



<p>In addition to the new perks system, Season 15 will re-introduce loot boxes. Players will be able to earn loot boxes from weekly and event rewards, as well as one Legendary loot box from the free battle pass, and two more from the Premium pass. A Rare or better item will drop in every box, an Epic item is guaranteed within five consecutive boxes, and a Legendary it guaranteed within 20 consecutive boxes. If an item you already own is in the box, it will re-roll it with an item of the same rarity.</p>
