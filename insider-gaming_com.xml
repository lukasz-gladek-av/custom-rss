<p>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A has a different approach to other Pok√©mon games regarding spawn locations, with some fixed odds available across Lumiose City, and we‚Äôve got a breakdown of all the Pok√©mon you can encounter in Wild Zone 3.</p>



<p>In total, Lumiose City has 20 Wild Zones to explore in Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A, which are unlocked periodically throughout story progression, with unique spawns scattered throughout, with many Pok√©mon only being obtainable at one specific location.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre on the hunt for missing Pok√©mon from Wild Zone 3, we‚Äôve got all the important details here.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Lots to find. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Just like Wild Zone 2, Wild Zone 4 is unlocked in Pok√©mon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A as soon as you reach Main Mission 5 and progress through the introductory points of the game.</strong></p>



<p>There are six species in total that are found in Wild Zone 3, all of which need to be caught to complete Mable‚Äôs Research Tasks, one of which has Mega Evolution potential later in the story. However, others can still be core members of your party, particularly through early periodsd of the game.</p>



<p>In the table below, we‚Äôve listed all the Pok√©mon that spawn in Wild Zone 3, the time of day they appear, and notes on the specific location where they can be found.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pok√©mon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Espurr</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Northeast corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Flabebe</td><td data-align="center">Day</td><td data-align="center">Central</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Litleo</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Northwest corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pancham</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Northwest corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Southeast corner</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Skiddo</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Southwest corner</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>Wild Zone 3 in Pok√©mon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A has one guaranteed Alpha Pok√©mon</strong> <strong>that is present in the same spot both day and night.</strong></p>



<p>However, every Pok√©mon in Legends: Z-A has a fixed chance of spawning as an Alpha, while others have set spawns that can be rotated with other Pok√©mon. In WIld Zone 3, however, there‚Äôs only one guaranteed Alpha spawn that you will encounter whenever you visit the area.</p>



<p>All the details you need on Alpha Pok√©mon in Wild Zone 4 are below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pok√©mon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Litleo</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Eastern building</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It‚Äôs no secret how popular ARC Raiders has been all year. The extraction shooter has undergone a bunch of playtests and betas, and the Server Slam open beta arrived just before launch. If you‚Äôre wondering whether the latest ARC Raiders playtest is still going, when it ends, and if there‚Äôs another on the way, we‚Äôve got answers to every question.</p>



<p>You only have to look at how many playtests Embark Studios has conducted this year to see how steadfast the developer is in its desire to get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> right. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov is finally ready for its 1.0 release</a>, but this has possibly been pushed forward by the success and interest in ARC Raiders‚Äîits new extraction shooter competition.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôve enjoyed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam playtest</a> and want to play more, we‚Äôve got details on the beta and the game‚Äôs future.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-over">Is The ARC Raiders Server Slam Playtest Over?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You don‚Äôt have to look over your shoulder for a while. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The ARC Raiders Server Slam Playtest officially ended on October 20, and confirmation came from official ARC Raiders social media to end all hopes of the beta being extended.</strong></p>



<p>There‚Äôs always an optimistic instinct in all of us that we might get more. An extra day off, a bit more money in a paycheck, or anything equivalent. That was the feeling in the ARC Raiders community with the Server Slam test. Even though this was a last-minute beta before launch, the thought of waiting nearly two weeks for the game is probably an eternity.</p>



<p>We‚Äôve seen people frantically looking up to see if the playtest had been extended. This is where we break your heart and say that this particular beta has conclusively ended.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-another-arc-raiders-playtest">Will There Be Another ARC Raiders Playtest?</h2>



<p><strong>Embark Studios‚Äô stance is that the Server Slam playtest was the final beta of any sort before ARC Raiders finally launches on October 30.</strong></p>



<p>Here‚Äôs what the official <a href="https://x.com/arcraidersgame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders</a> account on X had to say: ‚ÄúThe Server Slam has now officially ended. Thank you so much for joining us to test the servers before the big day. Speranza awaits you on October 30th, Raiders!‚Äù</p>



<p>As you can see, there‚Äôs no mention of a final final playtest. It‚Äôs safe to say we‚Äôre ready to go for launch. It‚Äôs been a long journey to get there‚Äîwhat the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-delay-explained-embark-game-not-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay</a> and all‚Äîbut, hopefully, it‚Äôs all worth it!</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>üì°The Server Slam has now officially ended.<br>Thank you so much for joining us to test the servers before the big day.</p><p>Speranza awaits you on October 30th, Raiders! <a href="https://t.co/U3rCPTjctn">pic.twitter.com/U3rCPTjctn</a></p></div>‚Äî ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1980191120442441772?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-price-explained%E2%80%94will-arc-raiders-be-free-to-play.1329382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios is bringing serious competition to the extraction shooter genre in 2025 with ARC Raiders. The futuristic shooter has all the hallmarks of a classic PvPvE experience, and it would score more points if it were free to play and didn‚Äôt have a price to pay. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-steams-most-popular-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders became Steam‚Äôs most popular Extraction Shooter</a> with the release of its final test phase before launch‚Äîthe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta Server Slam Test</a>. Developer Embark Studios (known for The Finals) has worked very hard to ensure it learns from its mistakes and stands a chance of survival at release.</p>



<p>One way to get more people on board is to make ARC Raiders free-to-play. Foregoing a price might be a financial gamble, but there would be benefits. Let‚Äôs raid the information cabinet for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-arc-raiders-free-to-play">Is ARC Raiders Free-to-Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nothing is free in this world. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders will not be a free-to-play online multiplayer experience, and you will have to pay an initial one-time fee to set foot in Speranza and beyond!</strong></p>



<p>There‚Äôs a definite line in the sand when it comes to online shooters now: Those that are free-to-play, and those that want a fee upfront. Naturally, games like Concord have only stoked the fires of the debate more. When you have a Warzone, a Fortnite, a Marvel Rivals, or an Apex Legends charging nothing to play the base game, it‚Äôs only natural to question if other new releases should follow suit.</p>



<p>However, EA and Embark Studios have decided against making ARC Raiders free-to-play. It doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt make the transition in the future, but for now, you need to dip into your pockets to play it.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-price-explained">ARC Raiders Price, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The base edition of ARC Raiders costs $39.99 or ¬£30.99, whereas you need to stump up $59.99 or ¬£49.99 for the more expensive Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, you don‚Äôt need to buy the upgraded version, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-deluxe-edition-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deluxe Edition content and bonus rewards</a> are pretty tempting. The Standard Edition offers the thing you‚Äôre after the most‚Äîthe game. If you go early, you might even be able to get your hands on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pre-order-bonuses-revealed-prices-explained/">ARC Raiders pre-order bonuses</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable insider has speculated that development of the Final Fantasy 9 Remake may have been put on hold for the time being. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy 9 Remake‚Äôs development has gone through several significant hurdles since we first heard about it. Most recently, we were told earlier this year that the game‚Äôs development is ‚Äòin trouble‚Äô and there‚Äôs a chance of it being cancelled. Now, more news that fans will not be happy about has surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-9-remake-s-future-is-unknown">Final Fantasy 9 Remake‚Äôs Future is Unknown</h2>



<p>Recently, NateTheHate was asked on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1979261183820431479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) whether he had heard anything new about Final Fantasy 9 Remake‚Äôs plans. The insider replied that, for now, he assumes ‚Äúthe game is on ice‚Äù and that development may have been paused for the title. Moreover, the post states that it is ‚Äúunknown‚Äù whether Square Enix will decide to ‚Äúreturn to it or not.‚Äù Seems like Final Fantasy 9‚Äôs remake is in real trouble. </p>



<p>Things seemed to be looking bright for Final Fantasy 9 Remake earlier this year, when rumours started to heat up with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-rumors-heat-up-with-new-ff9-website-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new website launch</a> for the 25th Anniversary. A few days later, it seemed like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-seemingly-teased-by-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix was also teasing the title</a>, as they posted a quote from the original game‚Äôs ending. However, since then we have only been receiving bad news, with it seeming like FF9 remake will never see the light of day. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Twin Pack Physical Edition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-twin-pack-physical-edition-pre-orders-now-available-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-orders are now available</a> for PlayStation 5.

<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn‚Äôt fully released until 2021. The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>
