<p>Many of Japan’s top gaming companies have seen their share prices decline recently. </p>



<p>Just a few days ago, it was revealed that shares of some of the biggest gaming companies fell right after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gaming-stocks-fall-drastically-google-project-genie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Project Genie announcement</a>. Companies like Unity, Roblox, Take-Two, CD Projekt Red, and others are experiencing significant declines, and it seems the effect has extended to Japan as well. </p>











<p>Spotted on <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/2018921195136229462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) by Japanese gaming industry analyst, Dr. Serkan Toto, Japanese gaming companies like Nintendo, Capcom, Sony, Konami, Bandai Namco, Square Enix, and more have seen their share prices fall. Check out the exact dip for each company at the time of writing below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Nintendo is down by 10.98%</li>



<li>Sony is down by 4.56% </li>



<li>SEGA is down by 2.11%</li>



<li>Capcom is down by 9.86%</li>



<li>Bandai Namco is down by 2.92%</li>



<li>Square Enix is down by 2.96%</li>



<li>Konami is down by 8.28%</li>



<li>Koei Tecmo is down by 6.57%</li>



<li>Kadokawa (Parent) is down by 4.40%</li>
</ul>



<p>The reason for their stock drop has not been highlighted; it could be due to the rise in memory prices, or it could be the Google Project Genie announcement messing with these stock prices. However, these are just speculative reasons. </p>



<p>Nintendo held its earnings call yesterday, during which it was revealed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-crosses-17-million-units-sold-to-remain-fastest-selling-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 has remained the company’s fastest-selling platform</a>. Moreover, Sony, Bandai Namco, and SEGA’s earnings calls are scheduled for this week. </p>







<p>In other news, Ubisoft shares crashed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by more than 30%</a> after the restructuring was announced.

            <title><![CDATA[NetEase Has Told Their Studios Not To Use AI “At All”]]></title>

<p>The co-founder of Grasshopper Manufacture has stated that NetEase doesn’t allow any of their studios to use AI. </p>



<div><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>In a statement sent to Insider Gaming, NetEase has denied telling its studios to no longer use AI. </p><p><strong>“The situation described did not occur, and we have not published any related policies,” </strong>a NetEase spokesperson said. </p></div>



<p>Due to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), the gaming industry has become increasingly concerned about its application in games. Opinions on this matter vary: some support AI for its ability to expedite mundane tasks, while others argue that it should not be utilized in any artistic capacity. Additionally, some have outright rejected the use of AI altogether. Recently, Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-genai-has-zero-part-in-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed</a> generative AI in relation to GTA 6, and now we also know NetEase’s stance on the issue. </p>







<h2 id="h-netease-shuts-down-ai-usage-across-all-internal-game-studios">NetEase Shuts Down AI Usage Across All Internal Game Studios</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romeo-is-a-dead-man-suda-51-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the co-founder of Grasshopper Manufacture (NetEase acquired it in 2021) and the director of Romeo is a Dead Man, Goichi “Suda 51” Suda, elaborated on his perspective on AI use in games. Talking about his game first, Suda 51 stated that Romeo would be “fake”, “hard to relate to”, and “kind of creepy” if he were made with AI. The director also stated that the work and passion developerss put into creating can be felt by players, whereas AI won’t invoke the same feeling.</p>



<p>Suda 51 then spoke about NetEase banning AI use, stating that they “originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff.” However, they decided not to work on that section anymore, shutting it down and telling “their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all.”</p>



<p>When asked why, Suda 51 said he doesn’t know the exact reason but speculates there could be two. First, a vast majority of players “don’t like AI and having it in their games,” and second, “issues with copyright infringement” also come into play. Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase Games for clarification and will update this story once a response is received.</p>
