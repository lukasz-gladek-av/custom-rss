<p>Activision has unveiled a poster for this year’s iteration of The Haunting, the annual Halloween-themed event that hits the Call of Duty platform every October. This time around, players will come face-to-face with Predator.</p>



<p>The first news regarding this year’s The Haunting event was featured in a blog post published yesterday on the Call of Duty site. It was mentioned that The Haunting lands with the final season of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and that <strong>all</strong> studio partners have weighed in on the event in some capacity.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-happening-with-the-haunting-this-year">What’s Happening with The Haunting This Year?</h2>



<p>The recent <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty blog post</a> didn’t do much to clear up what’s coming in The Haunting 2025:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Haunting will return with Season 06 of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and we (including all our studio partners) have some Halloween fun just around the corner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All we know is that The Haunting starts this week, on October 9th. It arrives as the Black Ops 7 beta comes to an end, marking the closure of a divisive, debate-laden trial period that has produced mixed feelings about this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>Here’s the post (and poster) that was uploaded to social media by Activision:</p>

<p>Shortly after announcing The Haunting 2025 with the poster, the Call of Duty team responded ‘ok’ <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1975327267858293053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a post</a> from September 2023 requesting that Activision add a Predator skin to the game. It was a strange throwback, but perhaps it reveals how long the team has been considering this idea.</p>



<p>Last year’s The Haunting event ran between September and October and introduced Mike Myers, a character tied to the Call of Duty series, in a rather nostalgic way (IYKYK). Activision’s studios prepared spooky map variants, new modes including Zombie Royale and Hordepoint, and a fresh reward path for those participating in the event.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that The Haunting 2025 will be a similar affair.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The announcement for PowerWash Simulator 2’s release date was slated to drop this week, but in an early trailer upload, the beans have been spilled. It has been three years since the first PowerWash Simulator game dropped, entertaining gamers everywhere and allowing them to clean everything from skateparks to carnival rides, and from trains to planes, with high-powered power washers.</p>



<p>The trailer has since been removed from YouTube, but not before eagle-eyed gamers were able to capture the release date for PowerWash Simulator 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-powerwash-simulator-2-coming-out">When is PowerWash Simulator 2 Coming Out?</h2>



<p>In the leaked trailer (which no longer exists), <strong>it was revealed that PowerWash Simulator 2 is coming out on October 26</strong>.</p>



<p>Early impressions of PowerWash Simulator 2 have been positive, even if it’s understandably tough to improve upon such a simple concept. In PowerWash Simulator 2, you’re still cleaning things with power washers and utilizing an array of attachments and cleaning liquids, but previews have remarked on how ‘different’ it manages to feel.</p>



<p>The news regarding the leaked trailer was published on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nzlvtg/powerwash_simulator_2_release_date_trailer_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, with one user sharing the link to the now removed release date trailer for PowerWash Simulator 2. Using an archive platform simply reveals that the video now sits in a private state, ready to go live soon.</p>



<p>In the comments under the original post on Reddit, fans of the original PowerWash Simulator game were raving about how good it was. There are recollections of users pouring over 100 hours into the game, spraying endlessly, and cleaning dirt from surfaces in a game that’s pure relaxation and satisfaction.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed it an incoming Game of the Year contender, but that’s tongue-in-cheek at best.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is getting the cross-generational treatment, releasing on both the Nintendo Switch 1 and the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Sure, most people are going to focus on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-starters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s starters</a> or the new mega evolutions, but, as with many other Switch games, the performance is going to matter.</p>



<p>Here is a breakdown of the Switch 1 and Switch 2 performance differences in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and which version you should consider buying.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-different-in-pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-and-switch-2">What’s Different in Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Switch 2 gives a smoother experience. Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The difference in the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions is purely based on performance. The Switch 2 version has a better framerate and resolution. Outside of that, both versions have the same content.</strong></p>



<p>On the original Switch, games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were criticized a lot for the performance issues both had. Luckily, the Switch 2 is more powerful, and that power allows Game Freak to get more out of their game with the new hardware.</p>







<p><strong>The version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A you should buy comes down to your situation</strong>.</p>



<p>Obviously, if you only own a Switch 1 and have not upgraded to a Switch 2, you should buy the Switch 1 version. However, it’s not a full guarantee that you should go with the upgraded version if you have the newer console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with many Switch 1 games, and this includes Pokémon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-pokemon-legends-z-a-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The cost of the game</a> is $10 more expensive on the Switch 2 for that bump in performance. If you need to save money, you are fully capable of buying the Switch 1 version and then <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upgrading later in the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 version does have the performance enhancements over the Switch 1, some people might not tell a drastic difference between the two. We are sure the difference is notable when shown side by side, but that isn’t as applicable when you only see one version.</p>



<p>To sum it up, if you are a Switch 2 owner, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-exclusive-platform-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 version</a> will give you the best performance. However, if you are in a spot where you need to save a little money, buying the Switch 1 version will still give you the full Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, with maybe a negligible performance difference when played on a Switch 2.</p>
