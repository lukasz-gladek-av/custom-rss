<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>

<p>Another Fortnite crossover is in the rumor mill, and it’s The Vampire Diaries. The show was a teenage dream with spectacular-looking humans (and vampires), captivating audiences for eight seasons.</p>



<p>It’s conceivable that every franchise in gaming, TV, and movie history could arrive in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>. That said, a The Vampire Diaries crossover would’ve been quite low down the Fortnite crossover list. Let’s see if there’s any bite to the rumor.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-the-vampire-diaries-come-to-fortnite">Will The Vampire Diaries Come To Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It couldn’t, could it? Credit to Outerbanks Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A Fortnite and Vampire Diaries crossover is a rumor and nothing more right now, and it appears to be one source claiming that it’s happening.</strong></p>



<p>It’s incredible how quickly speculation can spread like wildfire. There are many leakers in the world of Fortnite, but even the major ones, for the time being—haven’t outed a The Vampire Diaries and Fortnite crossover.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-week-11-quests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Week 11 Quests &amp; How To Complete Them (February 12)</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Does this mean it’s not happening? Nope, but the evidence isn’t strong enough to confirm the fascinating collaboration.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-fortnite-amp-the-vampire-diaries-rumor">What Is The Fortnite &amp; The Vampire Diaries Rumor?</h2>



<p><strong>Content creator Incitable posted to Facebook <strong>on February 16</strong> saying: “FORTNITE x VAMPIRE DIARIES is COMING!”</strong></p>



<p>Arguably, the biggest sources for Fortnite rumors and leaks are Shiina and HYPEX, neither of which has said The Vampire Diaries is coming to Fortnite; this could be significant.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-has-a-kingdom-hearts-collab-in-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Has A Kingdom Hearts Collab in Development, It’s Claimed</a></li>
</ul>



<p>HYPEX has even outed lots of upcoming crossover leaks, but it doesn’t mention anything about vampires.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXPECTED FORTNITE COLLABS THIS SEASON</p><p>• LUNA &amp; MAGIK → Likely Valentine's Day<br>• HONKAI STAR RAIL → February 26<br>• RESIDENT EVIL REQUIEM → Early March<br>• SOLO LEVELING → Likely Next Update<br>• KERNEL HEARTS → ??<br>• OLIVIA DEAN EMOTE → ??<br>• 1-3 MORE COLLABS → ?? <a href="https://t.co/Bp1lEG058t">pic.twitter.com/Bp1lEG058t</a></p></div>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/2020906649301479642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Incitable says a lot of The Vampire Diaries content is on the way, including Damon Salvatore and Stefan Salvatore skins:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Damon and Stefan Salvatore are officially coming to Fortnite as part of the Fortnitemares update scheduled for Fortnitemares 2026. It was heavily rumored collab, but has seemed to gain traction and it is in the works along with the Twilight collab which many players are hyped for!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crossover could happen, and it might be confirmed sooner rather than later. Until it is, take the news with a pinch of salt, as no one can confirm if the image is real.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows Update Finally Lets You… Jump?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-update-jump/</link>
            <guid>1437751</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft isn’t finished with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which dropped last year to a positive reception and a few controversies, particularly those concerning historical inaccuracies. It became a talking point within the Japanese government, amongst other things, which was pretty insane to see.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, February 17, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ubisoft/" id="26">Ubisoft</a> will release title update 1.1.8 for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, kick-starting a special, limited-time parkour challenge, and adding a feature that many think should have been there the entire time.</p>



<p>Yes, that’s the ability to <strong>jump</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-manual-jump-coming-to-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Manual Jump Coming to Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>Forced automatic parkour will be a thing of the past in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" id="1478">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> with update 1.1.8. Ubisoft is encouraging those still playing the game to participate in a social-driven parkour challenge, creating an unedited shot that they can share to showcase their freerunning abilities in Feudal Japan.</p>



<p>There are prizes up for grabs, but only the cleanest routes will be in with a chance of winning.</p>



<p>To facilitate the challenge, Ubisoft has added <strong>manual jumping </strong>to Assassin’s Creed Shadows. That now means that, at the press of a button, you can <strong>jump</strong>. How’s about that for an update?</p>



<p>If you want to enable manual jumping, you’ll need to hop into <strong>Advanced Options </strong>in the gameplay settings menu and switch the feature <strong>on</strong>. Otherwise, you’ll still be locked in a creative box by automatic parkour.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Ubisoft is adding a detailed statistics page <strong>and </strong>new ‘visual feedback’ for crit hits landed in combat.</p>



<p>Next month, Claws of Awaji, the game’s major expansion, will be released on Nintendo Switch 2. Then, on March 20, the game’s first anniversary rolls around, and Ubisoft has promised something of a small celebration.</p>



<p>Tomorrow’s update will drop at 14:00 UTC and will measure up to 15.77 GB for Xbox users, and as little as 1.7 GB for PS5 users.</p>







<p>Are you looking forward to making some sweet parkour content in Assassin’s Creed Shadows with <strong>manual jumping? </strong>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1437679</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> brings a new MyGM draft format, additional playable GMs, expanded match types, and more, as a deeper level of control takes center stage.</p>



<p>WWE 2K has released a new <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/mygm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report, </a>giving players an in-depth look at the changes coming to the popular game mode. Major changes include more match types for players to select, a longer season mode than ever before, and new choices for the authority figure on your show.</p>







<h2 id="h-default-seasons-are-now-50-weeks-in-wwe-2k26-mygm">Default Seasons Are Now 50 Weeks in WWE 2K26 MyGM</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 features 50-week seasons by default in MyGM. Also, starting budgets have increased and now range from $3 million to $7 million. Everyone’s budget is $5 million by default. </p>



<p>It is expected that higher budgets will increase the average roster size per brand by up to 35 Superstars. There’s also a new difficulty setting, Immortal, for experienced players looking for a new challenge.</p>







<h2 id="h-players-can-choose-to-double-book-stars">Players Can Choose to Double-Book Stars</h2>



<p>Another new feature is the ability to double-book wrestlers in both promos and matches on a single show. This means players will need to manage their roster members’ stamina more closely and pay closer attention to the show’s format, but it adds more realism.</p>



<p>Speaking of promos, invasion promises are new to WWE 2K26. Players can now send a star to attack the opposing brand when playing against friends. A good promo will earn you fans; a bad promo will make your brand look bad and could cost you fans.</p>



<p>As for match types, players can now book wrestlers for a variety of options, including the new 3 Stages of Hell. There’s also now support for 5-way, 6-way, and 8-way matches.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-legendary-gms-are-added-in-this-year-s-game">New Legendary GMs Are Added in This Year’s Game</h2>



<p>This year, MyGM Mode added new playable general managers, including the legendary Bobby “The Brain” Heenan, Stacy Keibler, and the Anonymous General Manager from 2011. They join Eric Bischoff, Adam Pearce, Mick Foley, and Ava.</p>
