<p>The sequel to the incredibly popular deck-building roguelike Slay The Spire was officially announced back in April, 2024, and now almost two years later, its release date has officially been announced. </p>







<p>However, that comes with a major caveat: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a> is first releasing in Early Access, with an official full release date still unconfirmed. But if you’re eager to tackle the mysteries of the Spire, then you won’t have to wait long, as Early Access is right around the corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date">What Is The Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you play as? Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mega Crit announced that Slay The Spire 2 will enter Early Access on March 5, 2026, though the full release date remains unknown. </strong></p>



<p>Whilst it might sound confusing to some, the original Slay The Spire was actually released in the same way. It arrived in Early Access, and after almost two years’ worth of community-led finetuning and balancing, the game was officially released as the complete package.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is Pokémon Pokopia?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Mega Crit mentioned on Slay The Spire 2’s Steam page that they expect to follow a similar schedule with the sequel. So, if all goes according to plan, Slay The Spire 2 should ideally officially launch as a complete package by late 2027 or early 2028. Of course, these dates are speculation, so don’t put too much trust in them, but fingers crossed that it arrives sooner rather than later.</p>



<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-start-times">Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>You’ll want to be up and ready in the morning, as Slay The Spire 2 will be launching in Early Access on Steam at 10 AM PT on March 5.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Of course, not everyone diving into Slay The Spire 2’s Early Access will be native to the PT time zone, so for everybody else, Insider Gaming has adjusted the release time for your convenience. If you don’t see your time zone, let a staff member know, and it’ll be added! </p>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 23, 2026, Quordle is the #1491 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 24</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>
