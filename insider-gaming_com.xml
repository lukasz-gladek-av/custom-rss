            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Borderlands 4 is one of the biggest launches taking place before the end of 2025, and part of modern gaming means some players are probably wondering whether it will be included on Xbox Game Pass. We have the details.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 12</a>, Borderlands 4 will have more than enough to whet the appetite with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 30 billion guns</a>, and we were impressed with the title after a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re yet to secure a copy of Borderlands 4 and are wondering if you can avoid splashing out due to a Game Pass subscription, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-borderlands-4-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Borderlands 4 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Borderlands 4 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 12th</strong>.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is not a first-party Xbox title, which would result in automatic inclusion in the service, and there has not been any announcement of it joining the catalog.</p>



<p>Though Microsoft has not announced the first wave of titles coming to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> in September, any announcement for Borderlands 4’s inclusion would have likely been made well in advance, as it would have been a huge coup.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-borderlands-4-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Borderlands 4 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Borderlands 4 is likely to come to Xbox Game Pass in the future, although any inclusion is likely to be a long way away.</strong></p>



<p>Gearbox has a history of releasing titles on Game Pass, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-more-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 3 leaving the service</a> on August 31 ahead of the launch of the new title. Borderlands 3, including all of the DLC for the title, joined the Game Pass catalog in April, resulting in a four-month stint on the service.</p>



<p>That shows that Gearbox is more than happy to embrace the platform, though it’s likely the inclusion period was decided upon to raise interest in Borderlands 4. Therefore, it would be surprising if the new title were to join the service anytime soon.</p>



<p>Given Borderlands 3 was first released in 2019, it took six years for the title to join Game Pass earlier this year. As such, don’t expect Borderlands 4 to feature for a long time, potentially not until post-2030, especially with plenty of DLC planned for the future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon GO Level Cap Being Massively Raised For The First Time in Five Years]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-raising-the-level-cap/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-go-level-cap-being-massively-raised-for-the-first-time-in-five-years.1279848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Avid Pokémon GO players have been desperate for the level cap to be raised for ages. Niantic has sounded the klaxon and is finally making it happen. An October 2025 update will see Pokémon GO’s level cap receive a huge increase.</p>



<p>It’s hard to remember a time when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-water-festival-2025-all-spawns-timed-research-collection-challenges-raids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon GO</a> level cap wasn’t 50. This is because the level cap has remained this way since it was increased in November 2020—just under five years ago. We moved from 40 to 50, and it’s stayed like this. Not for long, though.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A seismic leap. Credit to Niantic</figcaption></figure>



<p>The shocking announcement came from the Pokémon GO X account on August 25: “This October, we’re increasing the level cap from 50 to 80, while rebalancing the overall leveling up journey.”</p>



<p>Closer inspection of the Pokémon GO <a href="https://pokemongo.com/en/post/pgo-leveling-update-announce-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> reveals even more details: ”&nbsp;On Wednesday, October 15, 2025, Pokémon GO will release an update that increases the level cap from 50 to 80. This update will make the leveling journey more fun and engaging by celebrating leveling milestones with new rewards, new cosmetics, and more. And with this update, a number of players can expect to jump in level based on their total earned XP. But don’t worry, no player will go down in level!”</p>



<p>The leveling system is being tweaked overall. According to the blog: “Players can earn levels more frequently,” and “some players may automatically jump in level on October 15.” </p>



<p>No one will move down levels, so you don’t need to worry about this.</p>

<p>Delta Force is finally available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and while many had been excited for the free-to-play shooter, there is one feature missing that has fans concerned. Black Hawk Down, Delta Force’s campaign mode, offers players the option to either go alone or play in co-op. At least, that’s what it is on PC.</p>



<p>Loading into the mode on console only gives players the option of “Fighting Alone”. A visit to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2507950/discussions/0/608668448981185838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s community page</a> on Steam and Discord reveal multiple discussions on the matter. However, neither the game’s developer Team Jade or publisher TiMi Studio Group have commented publicly.</p>



<p>“[It’s] sad because they said on 3 months ago crossplay and co-op campaign on consoles,” one user on the game’s Discord wrote. “[It’s] like they lie us [sic]”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Delta Force’s developer and publisher for comment on the missing co-op option. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think of Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down campaign not having co-op at launch? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-voyagers-hands-on-preview-for-lovers-of-split-fiction-and-it-takes-two.1279809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Co-op gaming isn’t, has never been, and will never die. Local co-op, especially, isn’t going anywhere, and many developers and publishers, thankfully, know what people want. LEGO is about as notable as any leader in the genre, and its new co-op adventure—LEGO Voyagers—seems to get everything right. Walk with me as I explain all in my Gamescom 2025 LEGO Voyagers preview.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Star Wars</a>: The Video Game was a landmark moment in gaming: Super-popular licenses working hand-in-hand with one another. The ability to relive famous Star Wars moments with another player was the tip of the lightsaber. It spawned annual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a> games (sometimes multiple releases a year) and gave friends, couples, and families the chance to enjoy cooperative play.</p>



<p>In LEGO Voyagers, you and a <em>human </em>friend need to learn every trick (and brick) in the book to overcome obstacles, move forward, and rescue a spaceship. I walked away from my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-2025-awards-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025</a> demo with a big compliment to the game—Hazelight Studios would likely be proud of this.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-stud-in-its-own-right">A Stud in Its Own Right</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Creating a bridge not too far. Credit to Annapurna</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/games/lego-voyagers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Voyagers</a> is a mandatory two-player game with a Friends Pass system, similar to Split Fiction, It Takes Two, and A Way Out. This means you only need to buy one copy of the game, and two players can join forces. There’s no AI or computer-controlled co-op cohort here.</p>



<p>I had the privilege of teaming up with Light Build Studios’ creative director, Karsten Lund, and got to hear his insight into the game as he led me every step of the way. The control scheme is simple enough, as one button lets you jump, and the action button attaches your character to most creations in the environment.</p>



<p>You’ll cling to planks to form a bridge, attach to fallen lights and structures to cross gaps, and even form a literal attachment with your partner as you become a giant poking device you’d only find in Olympic Pole Vault competitions to reach new heights. The handful of platforming sections I conquered won’t have you consulting help manuals or scouring YouTube for walkthroughs, but there’s just enough there to have you thinking. Voyagers could be a great learning tool for young ones.</p>



<p>Lund assured me that some of the game’s later challenges will ramp up the difficulty, though. Making this a co-op game for both young and old to enjoy—more than likely together. You also can’t help but admire how cute the game is. Our muted LEGO bricks are aesthetically endearing and are likely to be a merchandising masterstroke if the game sells—which I think it will.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-voyagers-steps-into-the-hazelight">LEGO Voyagers Steps Into The Hazelight</h2>



<p>I’m desperate to avoid the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hazelight-is-already-working-on-its-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a> comparison. The Josef Fares-founded company is seen as a modern-day pioneer of co-op-only gameplay. Creating intertwining adventures where two players must work together to prevail in the face of adversity and swat away negativity in search of the ultimate cathartic conclusion.</p>



<p>LEGO Voyagers gameplay has a similar vibe, and it’s hard to ignore. On the plus side, is this a bad thing? I don’t think so. I adore what Hazelight is doing, and the roughly 30-40 million copies sold across the studio’s first three games are symptomatic of a public that feels the same way.</p>



<p>I love to play co-op games with my fiancé. Always have done. LEGO Voyagers appeals to a wide-ranging demographic and is extremely accessible. From what I played, I don’t think LEGO Voyagers is going to break new ground, but it doesn’t need to, as it’s LEGO, it’s charming, pleasing on the eye, and a lot of fun.</p>



<hr>



<p>Make your way to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to share your thoughts on co-op gaming. Do we need more efforts like we’re seeing from Hazelight and Annapurna/Light Brick Studio? Also, let me know what you thought of my LEGO Voyagers preview.</p>

<p>You can seemingly play Doom on any device with a screen. A modder named Aaron Christophel has managed to get the 1993 classic running on a portable Anker Prime charging station.</p>



<p>The charging station features a Synwit SWM34S SoC(system on a chip) with 8MB SDRam and 16MB of external flash memory. These specs allow Doom to be played on the built-in 200×480 LCD screen.</p>



<p>The controls are also pretty straight forward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdOU8SqCqeY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for what Christophel</a> had to work with. You can move forward and backward by turning the dial; pushing the dial in and turning rotates you left and right; pushing the dial in without turning allows you to fire and open doors.</p>



<p>Christophel says that it was done without making any modifications to the internal hardware of the device. He was able to get it running using the debugging header connected to another device. </p>



<p>It may not be the most convenient way to play Doom, but the fact that you can is impressive in and of itself. Who knows, maybe this will also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">become an Xbox</a>.</p>
