<p>Battlefield 6 REDSEC Battle Royale is the game’s marquee BR mode. A Solo playlist is the ideal avenue for BF 6 owners who prefer to walk in isolation like calculated lone wolves. Let’s check out the latest Solo news for Battlefield 6 BR. </p>



<p>Even though it can be an absolute sweatfast full of campers and players desperate to occupy most windows and keep bathroom corners warm, Solos has a certain charm to it in battle royale. You’re relying on yourself, so it’s technically <em>your </em>fault if you die. There’s also an added feeling of anxiety knowing there are over 100 of you all vying to be the final player left standing—knowing every footstep could be one move toward your next elimination, or your own demise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-bf-pro-battle-pass-worth-it-battlefield-6-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> introduced the fabled REDSEC battle royale mode after launch. It has the electric <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gauntlet-mode-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gauntlet mode</a>, but let’s see if Solos gets any love.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-solos-in-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-right-now">Can You Play Solos In Battlefield 6 REDSEC Battle Royale Right Now?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>But, why? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield Studios has opted not to include a Solo playlist at Battlefield 6’s REDSEC battle royale launch.</strong></p>



<p>Don’t shoot the messenger! We’re just as disappointed as you are, and it really is a glaring oversight and an odd omission from REDSEC. There are no figures to back this up, but don’t be surprised if Solos is the most popular battle royale mode across all BR games.</p>



<p>It’s just easier for an individual player to pop in, without needing a squad, and trust their own survival instincts. REDSEC’s launch debuted with two playlist options: <strong>Duos and Quads</strong>—but no Solos.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-solo-in-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale">Is There Any Way To Play Solo In Battlefield 6 REDSEC Battle Royale?</h2>



<p><strong>The only way to sort of play Solos is to join a random team in Duos or Quads and play your own game in Battlefield 6 REDSEC battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>No, this isn’t genuine Solos, and yes, we know—but what else are you going to do? Duos is about as close as you’re going to get for the time being, and, to be honest, there’s a good chance <strong>many players will do the same thing</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s likely many Duos lobbies will be full of teams in name only, and both players are acting independently of one another. You too can do this, and go to the opposite end of the map to your ally if you want to prove a point.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-solo-playlist-coming-to-battlefield-6-redsec-br">When Is Solo Playlist Coming To Battlefield 6 REDSEC BR?</h2>



<p><strong>EA or Battlefield Studios hasn’t specifically mentioned Solos in any of its press releases or blog posts, but the use of “at launch” in a blog post is a dead giveaway that a Solo mode is coming.</strong></p>



<p>Logically, more content will be added to Battlefield 6’s REDSEC BR. There’s no direct mention of Solos in the Battlefield 6 Season 1 roadmap, and, again, we still find the lack of Solos bizarre.</p>



<p>However, a Season 1 roadmap <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-full-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> does say this: “REDSEC’s Battle Royale experience is built on Battlefield’s foundation of iconic all-out warfare, tactical destruction, and squad-based gameplay defined by its Class System. The standard Battle Royale match holds up to 100 players in either four-player squad or duo formats <strong>at launch</strong>.”</p>



<p>It’s coming, we all know it’s coming. Once it does, or it gets leaked, we’ll be the first to update you.</p>



<p>You can now vent your anger in the comments about Battlefield 6’s crazy decision to leave out a Solo playlist. Is Solos the best way to play battle royale?

<p>Battlefield’s REDSEC Battle Royale mode has launched, with plenty to sink your teeth into, and completing missions is a vital step to obtaining the best loot and securing victory.</p>



<p>Landing at the start of season 1, REDSEC in Battlefield has a variety of modes, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gauntlet-mode-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mission-focused Gauntlet</a>, but these missions are also available in the standard Battle Royale modes.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a breakdown of all the missions available in REDSEC Battle Royale inside Battlefield, we’ve got the definitive guide you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-redsec-battle-royale-missions">All REDSEC Battle Royale Missions</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Heavy support. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Missions are optional side quests that appear during a REDSEC match, providing a bunch of XP and valuable rewards to help you in the fight.</strong></p>



<p>Only one mission can be activated at a time, with any squad member able to select one to be completed. Once a mission is accepted by one player, no missions can be selected by another player in the squad until later in the match.</p>



<p>Rewards are available for successfully completing each mission, ranging from Rare Weapons and Drop-Ins to immediate access to Custom Weapon Drops, and a Vehicle Key Card required for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-tanks-in-battlefield-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaining access to a Tank</a>. Missions can be both PvP and PvE in nature, though the PvP aspects with other players in the Battle Royale will be constant.</p>



<p>Additionally, some missions will appear as a ‘Counter Mission’, which indicates a nearby squad is completing a mission and tasks you with disrupting their plans. This almost always involves head-to-head combat with enemy players, however, so only dive into these when you feel you are prepared for a battle.</p>



<p>The table below details all of the mission types that can appear in REDSEC Battle Royale, and details on how to complete them.</p>

<p>Amazon is laying off more than 14,000 corporate employees. Within those layoffs, Amazon Games and Twitch will be hit in some capacity.</p>



<p>Bloomberg says, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTY2Nzc5MywiZXhwIjoxNzYyMjcyNTkzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNFVOSThHUTdMSEIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.gpW2CyZmAypCDjxGr-gBHrW6EnUxZkFspCrjiLV-dwc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">without going into</a> specifics, that both video games and the cloud-computing area of the company will be affected. Insider Gaming has reached out to Amazon to ask how many people were set to be let go from the gaming division and Twitch. As of publishing, a response has not been received.</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the cuts “would largely fall on its offices in Irvine and San Diego, as well as its central publishing division.”</p>



<p><strong>“The company will reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly surrounding massively multiplayer online games or MMOs,”</strong> the report reads.</p>



<p><strong>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,”</strong> an email sent by vice president of audio, Twitch, and games Steve Boom to employees said.</p>



<p>Included in the layoffs was Tarfu, who had been with Twitch for 11 years.</p>



<p><strong>“I started off working in trust &amp; safety, then moved to customer experience,” </strong><a href="https://x.com/Tarfu/status/1983196834698015164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he shared.</a> <strong>“I was the person who built the entire fraud program at Twitch. One of the reasons I never told people what I did for work.</strong></p>



<p>“<strong>I was the one keeping bad actors off Twitch who steal and abuse revenue on the platform. I guess I did my job too well since they let me go. But do I have some great stories of being there over a decade.”</strong></p>



<p>News of the mass layoffs was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-targets-many-30000-corporate-job-cuts-sources-say-2025-10-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first reported</a> by Reuters. The cuts would be, according to the outlet, the largest cut since 2022, when Amazon let go of roughly 27,000 people. This new set of layoffs would be the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/amazon-to-announce-sweeping-corporate-job-cuts-starting-tuesday.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">largest in company history</a>, with impacted employees to be notified via email.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have more coverage of the layoffs, including what happens to Amazon Games, as it becomes available.</p>
