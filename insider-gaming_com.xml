<p>According to a new report, it seems that Square Enix is planning to release the Switch 2 port for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth in the Summer of 2026. </p>



<p>A reliable insider recently claimed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still scheduled to release for Xbox</a> in 2026, and the director of the series also spoke about both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-gameplay-experience-will-be-similar-to-other-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 2 and Part 3 being in development</a> for the Switch 2. Now, the new development indicates that the port could be released sooner than expected. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-release-window-reportedly-revealed-for-2026">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Switch 2 Release Window Reportedly Revealed for 2026</h2>



<p>The Summer release window for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s Switch 2 port comes through a report by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-summer-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>. According to their sources, that’s the launch window Square Enix is planning for part 2 of the series. However, the schedule may change or be delayed due to additional development time. However, as of now, it seems like they aim to release it this summer. </p>



<p>If that is indeed true, then it is exciting news for Final Fantasy 7 Remake series fans across other platforms, considering Intergrade was released for Xbox Series X/S just over a week ago. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-also-release-for-xbox-this-summer">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Could Also Release for Xbox This Summer </h2>



<p>Additionally, it seems Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth might also release for Xbox Series X/S this Summer, along with the Switch 2 port. Reliable source, NateTheHate, stated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-gamer-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-switch-2-port-could-release-this-summer.1418122/#post-150602587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> that the Xbox and Switch 2 ports “should release at the same time just as Remake did.” So, fans on other platforms might be getting the second part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series very soon. </p>







<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-stick-to-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sticking to Unreal Engine 4 </a>for development. Additionally, Part 3 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-bring-back-the-snowboarding-mini-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring back the snowboarding minigame</a> and enhance Queen’s Blood.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier today, images surfaced online of a system message apparently sent by PlayStation direct to users on PlayStation <strong>4 </strong>consoles. The message was suggesting they take a look at the latest deals on PlayStation 5 consoles to upgrade and avoid missing out on some of the biggest games set to launch in 2026.</p>



<p>Midway through 2024, the split between PS4 and PS5 players was around 50-50, with tens of millions of gamers worldwide still using the 2013 console as their flagship gaming device.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-time-to-give-up-the-playstation-4">It’s Time To Give Up the PlayStation 4</h2>



<p>The PlayStation 5 has been on the market for more than five years, and the first PlayStation 4 console dropped in 2013, so perhaps it’s time to finally bite the bullet and make that upgrade. That is, unless you’re holding out for the launch of the PlayStation 6 and are prepared to skip a generation.</p>



<p>In a recent image that surfaced on social media, one user claimed to have received a message from PlayStation that was quietly encouraging them to upgrade from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5. The <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/2016232719949189348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message read</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Whether you’re catching up with hits from 2025 like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, ARC Raiders, and Ghost of Yotei, or getting ready for the most-anticipated games of 2026, including SAROS, 007 First Light, Nioh 3, and so much more, now’s the perfect time to upgrade to a PS5 console.</em></p>



<p><em>Scan the QR code to see the latest deals on PS5 consoles.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Perhaps it’s good guy Sony trying to pull players in the right direction with their gaming hardware, or maybe it’s a method designed to coax players away from a withdrawing platform that they’ve started sunsetting.</p>



<p>In October 2025, it was revealed that some PlayStation 4 titles would have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-is-sunsetting-some-playstation-4-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certain PSN features switched off</a> in 2026. It’s an effort by Sony to start winding down what has fast become legacy hardware and software, especially as eyes turn to whatever comes next in the PlayStation 6.</p>

<p>Wildlight Entertainment is working hard to address player concerns regarding some of the quality-of-life mechanics in Highguard. Or rather, some of the <strong>missing </strong>quality-of-life mechanics. The game came out just two days ago, and players quickly discovered that some settings they expected to be there simply weren’t.</p>



<p>The Highguard team posted a message on social media addressing the issue and stated that player feedback will be addressed with some rapid patching.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-fov-sliders-incoming">Highguard FOV Sliders Incoming</h2>



<p>Highguard has already had a tough time since jumping onto the market on Monday. It was a bold experiment by Wildlight Entertainment to fuse multiple genres in a bid to create something innovative, but a lot of the effort appears to have been lost in the delivery of the thing.</p>



<p>The launch of Highguard followed more than a month of radio silence after the game’s first trailer landed at The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley, who is also being burned after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop/">promoting the game at length</a>.</p>



<p>In a recent social media post, the team at Wildlight stressed that some quality-of-life improvements are coming to address what players are asking for the most:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been listening to feedback and working to add some highly requested features, including FoV sliders for consoles, toggle settings for ADS &amp; crouch, and more graphics scaling options for PC. We’re targeting to release a patch tomorrow, with full patch notes once it’s live.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For some, it’s bizarre that Highguard was released with some of these options missing. Regardless, Wildlight is going to right that wrong with a patch that promises to be pushed out today.</p>



<p>For those hanging around, Highguard has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/">a year-long roadmap</a> stacked up and waiting to be delivered. Time will tell how many players are present to see all the content drops unravel this year, though.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Employee Claims He’s Placed on Unpaid Suspension for Criticising Return-to-Office Policy]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employee-suspension/</link>

<p>A long-time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> employee has taken to social media to claim that he has been placed on an unpaid disciplinary suspension for comments regarding the recent return-to-office mandates.</p>







<p>Posting on LinkedIn, David Michaud-Cromp, who has worked at Ubisoft for more than 13 years, says the company notified him that he would receive a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension.</p>



<p>According to Michaud-Cromp, the suspension, which is set to start tomorrow, was issued in response to public comments he made about Ubisoft’s return-to-office policy and an “alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.”</p>



<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-forcing-full-return-office-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5-day return-to-office mandate</a>, which Insider Gaming understands has proven to be an extremely unpopular move with employees, David took to LinkedIn to say:</p>



<p>“So… Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office… because they “believe in collaboration”… but c’mon, we’re not completely stupid… we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office…”</p>



<p>Michaud-Cromp alleges that these comments led to the three-day suspension.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, and should one be received, we will update this article.</p>
