<p>Resident Evil Requiem’s game length could stop you from buying the game—don’t lie, it’s because you’re too scared. If you are legitimately concerned about how long Capcom’s latest entry is, this guide should provide clarity.</p>



<p>Previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> games have always had a decent length to them, with some being way longer than others. The RE speedruns are legendary, with players mopping up the main story in one brief sitting. If this is putting you off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, let’s take a look at what you can expect.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-resident-evil-requiem">How Many Hours To Beat Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Say Grace. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There have been conflicting reports about Resident Evil Requiem’s game length, but based on sources, you should expect around 10-16 hours of main-game content, with completionist save files expected to clock in around 30-40 hours.</strong></p>



<p>Reports have been circling about the game’s length, but truth be told, no one has an <em>exact </em>bearing on Requiem’s game length yet.</p>



<p>Three voices have managed to give a ballpark region for the game’s runtime: The director, the producer, and long-time leaker Dusk Golem.</p>



<p>Initially, it was suggested by the game’s producer that Requiem would be comparable to Resident Evil 4 in terms of game length. Everyone’s mileage varies, but the fourth main game is up there with one of the longest runtimes for main content. It’s amazing how much extra time is added for having crazy chainsaw people cut Leon’s head off.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-director-explains-leons-ruthless-anger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Director Talks Leon’s ‘Ruthless Anger’</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This gave everyone hope that Resident Evil 9 would also be a meaty adventure. Since then, the game’s director has come out and said the horror title’s length is hard to gauge. Finally, Dusk Golem—who provided details on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-embargo-date/" id="177337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem’s review embargo date</a>—gave information on what they knew:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve heard myself it’s longer than Village, but a bit shorter than RE:4.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Village’s game length (particularly for a first-time playthrough) is around the 10-hour mark. So, even if Requiem finds a healthy middle ground, the first playthrough should be around 12-14 hours, with a wider margin of 10-16 hours capturing everything—not too shabby.</p>



<p>Obviously, the details are more hit and miss than the original Resident Evil’s dialogue. The expected game length mark shouldn’t be too far short if it is.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/3)-The producer claims the game is "roughly" the length of RE:4, though the director stepped in to say that estimating game time is hard, so to just expect a "Resident Evil" amount of content.<br>-Separately, I've heard myself it's longer than Village, but a bit shorter than RE:4</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2020691307052859637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-does-resident-evil-9-compare-to-other-resident-evil-games">How Does Resident Evil 9 Compare To Other Resident Evil Games?</h2>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem’s game length sounds like it’s more in keeping with recent Resident Evil games, rather than the earlier entries, which were very short in comparison.</strong></p>



<p>You get indie horror games nowadays that are longer than the original Resident Evil trilogy entries! Resi 4 really advanced the series and gave players a long and winding adventure. It’s been fairly consistent ever since.</p>

</ul>



<p>According to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HowLongToBeat</a> (which aggregates playthrough from hundreds and thousands of players), here’s the average playtime for every mainline Resident Evil game—and we’re using the remakes where applicable.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 is bringing plenty of changes to the popular Universe Mode.</p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/universe-and-community-creations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report</a> feature on WWE 2K26 showcased the wide variety of changes coming to Universe Mode. The name of the game is control in WWE 2K26, and this year’s Universe Mode provides even more options for players to meticulously manipulate the in-game sandbox while also allowing for set-it-and-forget-it options for those who just want to kick back and watch a simulated Universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-re-a-wizard-wwe">You’re a Wizard, WWE</h2>



<p>This year’s WWE Universe Mode features a new Universe Wizard that lets players choose which weekly shows and PLEs to feature, assign Superstars to each show and their champions, and set the calendar start month. Players can choose an existing show, such as WWE Monday Night Raw. However, they can also either import a show they downloaded or start from scratch with a brand-new creation.</p>



<p>Players can edit details for default shows like Raw and SmackDown, including rosters, championships, and divisions. Each show supports up to eight titles across men’s and women’s divisions, including tag team and intergender titles, plus two Money in the Bank briefcases.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-more-customization-options-in-universe-mode-for-wwe-2k26">More Customization Options in Universe Mode for WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 expands Universe mode with new match setup options, including enhanced settings and sliders. Players can now adjust matchmaking sliders to fine-tune match card sorting, scoring, and bonuses for title matches, rivalries, and match types. </p>



<p>For those who want to start from scratch, there are settings to remove all default rivalry options and start with a blank canvas.</p>











<p>Promo options are also updated. This year, players have even more control over the outcome of Universe Mode promos. When challenging a rival to a match, the challenger can now directly select the match stipulations. Players can take the direction of their promos in new avenues, including babyface and heel turns.</p>



<p>There are also customization options for wrestlers’ attire for weekly shows, pay-per-view events, and WrestleMania. Once again, allowing even more customization options.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-deck-out-of-stock-explained/</link>
            <guid>1438450</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gamers hoping to pick up a Steam Deck in 2026 could face quite a battle, as Valve is among those who have been hit by the widespread RAM issues, leading to stock shortages.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-deck-out-of-stock-alerts-ram-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Out-of-stock alerts for Steam Deck models</a> in the United States have caused a stir, with uncertainty about when Steam Decks will be available for purchase again.</p>



<p>If you’ve encountered stock shortages when trying to purchase a Steam Deck, Insider Gaming has all the details on the availability of the console and when it could be available to purchase.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-steam-deck-be-back-in-stock">When Will Steam Deck Be Back in Stock?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Limited options. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Valve has provided no indication of when Steam Decks will be back available, and it could be a while until the systems are back on the first-hand market.</strong></p>



<p>Like most tech companies, Valve is having to cope with the lack of available RAM, which is also affecting the likes of Nintendo, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/should-you-buy-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potentially pushing up the price of the Switch 2</a>. Unfortunately, this is completely out of their hands, and there is no indication that demand will be reduced anytime soon.</p>



<p>Valve’s storefront in the US states that Steam Deck models may be unavailable “intermittently in some regions,” and there’s no indication of when products will be back on the market.</p>



<p>The shortage of RAM is expected to remain a problem throughout 2026 and potentially into 2027, with it expected that it will cause a delay to the release date for next-generation consoles from the likes of Xbox and PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-steam-deck-lcd-model-be-available-again">Will The Steam Deck LCD Model be Available Again?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Valve will not have the LCD Steam Deck model available again, as the console has been discontinued entirely.</strong></p>



<p>Valve is no longer making the LCD Steam Deck models, which were a cheaper entry point for fans, and will not be restocking the console on its website.</p>



<p>This means that if you’re on the hunt for a Steam Deck LCD Model, the only options available are the second-hand market, which is likely seeing a price increase, too, given the demand for the consoles.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> completely overhauls elements of the Creation Suite, including new additions exclusive to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2.</a></p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/universe-and-community-creations/">WWE 2K Ringside Report</a> features updates to the Creation Suite. It was previously announced that the number of created wrestler slots would increase from 100 to 200. That is twice as many opportunities to create new wrestlers and bring existing non-WWE stars to your roster, either by creating your own versions or by downloading them in Community Creations.</p>



<p>It’s also now known that Create-an-Image slots have doubled. This means there are now 2,000 free slots available to create custom images. You can also find custom images on Community Creations. Nintendo Switch 2 now features the image uploader for the first time. They’ve also added the ability to use the Joy-Con 2’s mouse controls for greater precision when customizing your wrestler.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Create-a-Superstar offers many more direct control options. The layer system has been improved. Previously, there were 60 layers across the entire Custom Superstar. Now, the head and body are in separate sections, while the attire options are drawn from separate pools. In total, there are 60 layers for attire and 40 for head and body. Players can also choose from 40+ body templates as a starting point and further customize the body with morphing tools.</p>



<p>Plus, there are all-new two-tone hair blending options for even more creativity and authenticity.</p>







<h2 id="h-that-s-not-all-coming-to-creation-in-wwe-2k26">That’s Not All Coming to Creation in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>Additional updates to the Creation Suite include a revamped menu for Create-a-Championship and Money in the Bank. This section also includes new available championship parts. </p>



<p>They also added advanced timelines to entrance customizations and the ability to create victory and entrance motions for four-person and five-person stables.</p>

<p>Hasbro has provided confirmation that the highly anticipated GI Joe game featuring Snake Eyes has not been cancelled. </p>



<p>Atomic Arcade’s GI Joe Snake Eyes title is something that players have heard close to nothing about since its announcement. We have only heard that the game moved to pre-production in 2023, and there was a listing in 2024 that hinted at an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gi-joe-could-be-an-open-world-game-according-to-recent-job-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world setting</a>. No other update since then, but it seems the title has survived. </p>







<h2 id="h-atomic-arcade-reportedly-shut-down-but-gi-joe-snake-eyes-is-not-cancelled">Atomic Arcade Reportedly Shut Down, But GI Joe Snake Eyes is Not Cancelled</h2>



<p>The confirmation that GI Joe Snake Eyes is not cancelled comes from a Hasbro statement to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wccftech</a>. Hasbro has stated that the game is not cancelled, but the development team is in the process of determining the way forward for the title. No decisions are final as of now, and updates will be provided as soon as they can. Interested readers can check out the full statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<em>The Snake Eyes game is&nbsp;not cancelled. The team is currently taking time to evaluate the path forward for the game. While decisions haven’t been finalized, we’re committed to providing updates as soon as we’re able</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The statement came in response to the original report, which discussed a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominicbraun_opentowork-ugcPost-7429184369929539585-DIod?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAADh_g-QBx3rdrvALH0qxv35Q0muLbIQKclU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post by Atomic Arcade’s gameplay programmer, Dominic Braun. Braun’s post states that he was “affected by Hasbro’s and Wizards of the Coast’s decision to close Atomic Arcade.” Hasbro has not provided clarity on whether Atomic Arcade has been shut down. </p>
