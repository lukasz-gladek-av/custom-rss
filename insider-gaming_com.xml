<p>A new Chapter in Fortnite has begun, and significant changes have arrived alongside it, including the absence of the Battle Bus when launching into a game of Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Rather than the familar approach of hitching a ride on the Battle Bus, players instead ride a huge wave to arrive at the island, which impacts landing zones as the maximum distance of travelling is shorter.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering what has happened to the Battle Bus and whether the change is permanent, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-is-the-battle-bus-in-fortnite">Where is The Battle Bus in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>RIP. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battle Bus in Fortnite is no more, having been destroyed at the end of the launch trailer for Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, marking the end of an era.</strong></p>



<p>After the climatic battle to defeat the Dark Presence in the Zero Point event, which saw a who’s who of collabs featuring the likes of Star Wars, Marvel, Superman, K-Pop Demon Hunters, Homer Simpson, Godzilla, Hatsune Miku, and more, it appeared that the band of misfits had gotten by unscathed.</p>



<p>However, that was not the case as in the closing seconds of the Chapter 7 Season 1 launch trailer, the Battle Bus was blown out of the sky, and now, instead of thanking the bus driver when entering a match, you pay respects instead as you surf the waves on the way to the island.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-battle-bus-coming-back">Is the Battle Bus Coming Back?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, the Battle Bus is returning to Fortnite and is not gone permanently, and the absence of the Battle Bus is only for a few days, as it will be back in commission on December 4.</strong></p>



<p>The wreckage of the Battle Bus can be found on the island in Chapter 7, Season 1, and interacting with Dummy, an NPC, nearby results in a mini quest to gather materials to repair the bus, which Dummy intends to do.</p>



<p>At the start of Chapter 7, popular alternative modes to Battle Royale like Reload, Blitz, and Fortnite OG are not available, due to the bus being destroyed, but they will be back in the near future—which implies the bus will also be returning.</p>



<p>Expect the repair of the Battle Bus to play a major part in the early parts of the story in Chapter 7, Season 1, with more to be revealed in the coming weeks.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-most-subscribed-streamers-tarkov-creators/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is once again blowing up as the game pushes through the 1.0 release window and into whatever comes next. Two weeks ago, the game graduated from a beta state it had sat in for almost eight years, moving into a full release format and being listed on Steam for the first time.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to an ongoing Twitch Drops campaign, the game is bigger than ever on the popular streaming platform, and the most-subscribed creators on the site are dedicated solely to Escape from Tarkov. They beat everyone from Kai Cenat to Caseoh, and from Jynxzi to Jason the Ween.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-on-top-by-almost-double">Escape from Tarkov On Top… By Almost Double</h2>



<p>The biggest streamer in the world right now by active subscriptions on Twitch is Pestily, arguably the most prolific Escape from Tarkov streamer in the business. Pestily has been streaming Tarkov since the earliest days and is almost synonymous with the extraction shooter, having become something of a personal friend to the title’s developers at Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Pestily boasted a whopping 132,310 subscriptions, all thanks to an ongoing Twitch Drops campaign that sees Escape from Tarkov players rewarded for gifting subs to streamers broadcasting the game.</p>



<p>This makes Pestily the most-subscribed streamer on the planet.</p>



<p>He’s closely followed by LVNDMARK (read: Landmark), a North American creator who sat on 90,404 subscriptions at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>The list doesn’t end there, though, as here are some other Escape from Tarkov creators <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">topping the leaderboard</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>SheefGG – 53,942</li>



<li>Glorious_E – 31,240</li>



<li>WillerZ – 17,579</li>



<li>Gingy – 15,781</li>



<li>StankRat – 10,121</li>
</ul>



<p>Behind Pestily, the next closest streamer in terms of subscriptions is Kai Cenat, with 70,097.</p>



<p>Sure, most of these subscriptions will be short-lived, as they’ll have been gifted on a one-month basis that will see tens of thousands of them disappear when the renewal window rolls around next month, but it’s nothing if not indicative of the sheer power of Escape from Tarkov, even ten years after it hit the market in alpha.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Escape from Tarkov Code Unlocks Nikita’s Voice, But You Need to Hurry]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-nikita-voice-hurry/</link>
            <guid>1368469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has skipped over the issues plaguing one of the rarest rewards in Escape from Tarkov and just issued a code that will give you <strong>Nikita’s voicelines </strong>instantly in the spearhead extraction shooter title. This is in response to waves of people complaining that Twitch drops, which are supposed to unlock the voice, simply aren’t working as intended.</p>



<p>If you want to unlock Nikita Buyanov’s voicelines in Escape from Tarkov, the code you need is right down below.</p>







<h2 id="h-nikita-voice-code-for-escape-from-tarkov">Nikita Voice Code for Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>If you want to unlock Nikita’s voicelines in Escape from Tarkov, you need to use the following code: <strong>WILWILBE</strong>.</p>



<p>Like any other code, this <span>can be redeemed via the escapefromtarkov.com site&nbsp;<strong>or&nbsp;</strong>through</span> the launcher. Once you’ve entered the code, you’ll be met with a <strong>green message </strong>if it worked, just like the one below:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, there’s a huge catch. You’ve only got <strong>three days </strong>until the code becomes invalid, so if you’re reading this guide after December 2nd or 3rd, you’re out of luck, and you might never get the voicelines.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov recently launched into a 1.0 state after more than a decade in development. It was the biggest milestone in the game’s history, but it was somewhat marred by network issues, server instability, and a hefty assortment of bugs, all of which led to Battlestate Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bsg-apologize-escape-from-tarkov-launch-problems/">issuing a public apology</a>.</p>



<p>That being said, the game has now become more accessible and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-getting-easier-first-time-decade/">easier for newcomers</a>, and in our recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-review-ultimate-extraction-shooter/">Escape from Tarkov review</a> (which scored maximum marks), we wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Through thick and thin, Escape from Tarkov has prevailed. It’s an enormous, deep, and rich game that’s still evolving, it offers unparalleled emotional experiences, and it looks, sounds, and feels great while doing all that. It’s the most punishing game you’ll ever play, but if you put enough hours into understanding this gem of a title, you’ll come to appreciate that it is a generational masterpiece of the extraction shooter market.</p>
</blockquote>
