<p>I was fortunate enough to get hands-on with Splitgate 2 a month before the game entered the current open alpha. I also had the chance to sit down with Ian Proulx, the co-founder and CEO of 1047 Studios, the developer behind this high-octane shooter. As I explored the intense mechanics of Splitgate 2, I found myself gelling <strong>very nicely </strong>with what was on offer.</p>



<p>As questions were put to Proulx, I learned about the future of Splitgate 2, which is a direct follow-on from the shooter that was released in 2019 on PC, and then later on console. In this sequel, evolution is the order of the day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-to-do">More To Do</h2>



<p>Ian Proulx was very transparent about the areas in which Splitgate (the first game) fell short. The title had awesome short-term retention, but players dropped off alarmingly fast after realising that there wasn’t much ‘to do’ or chase in the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was super fun, super simple, but it lacked variety and that staying power. </p>



<p>We had really strong short-term retention, our day one and day seven was world class – better than many of the top shooters you’ll see today. </p>



<p>But what we saw is players would come on, play for 3 or 4 weeks, and then say, ‘now what?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at 1047 Games has addressed those concerns in the follow-up title.</p>



<p>There will be more things to unlock, and as Proulx said, ‘We can keep you on the hook for longer by giving you more content over time.’ This will include seasonal events, ‘lots of live-ops stuff’, and customisation elements. </p>



<p>The game has been bolstered immeasurably by new movement mechanics, like sliding, and a massive 24-player multi-team mode inspired by Halo’s Big Team Battle mode. It’s also being released on PS4 and Xbox One to serve the last generation of players quite nicely, which is a solid touch from the team.</p>



<p>In the last few years, Splitgate 2’s potential has allowed 1047 Games to expand from a team of 10 to almost 200 employees, all of which are stoked about the impending launch of this fantastic shooter.</p>



<p>I asked Ian Proulx about the proposed operating model for the game, given that so many free-to-play shooters have launched in recent years – and not all of them have succeeded.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Splitgate 2 will be free-to-play.</p>



<p>We’re innovating on gameplay, we’re not innovating on monetisation.</p>



<p>(It’ll feature) traditional industry elements and no pay-to-win or gacha mechanics.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to play the Splitgate 2 alpha ahead of the release, thanks to 1047 Games. Before the session took place, I sat down with the studio’s CEO to talk about the development – and more importantly, the future – of this innovative first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Given my passion for the industry, I was eager to learn whether esports plans sat in the pipeline for Splitgate 2. My discussion with Ian Proulx, also one of the studio’s founders, revealed exciting things about the competitive future of Splitgate 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-future-is-competitive">The Future is Competitive</h2>



<p>Splitgate 2 is a phenomenal shooter with stacks of potential. When I got hands-on with the title a month before it entered the current alpha playtest, I was instantly hooked. The fast-paced gameplay twinned with genuinely enjoyable weapon mechanics had me by the throat – in a good way. I was <strong>enthused </strong>by what I experienced.</p>



<p>In a brief conversation with Ian Proulx, I dove into the competitive landscape for Splitgate 2, learning about the potential for this game to slot nicely into the esports landscape.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I would say it’s not a priority for launch, but I definitely see this game being an esport one day.</p>



<p>We like games that are fair, and that falls under the ‘fun category’ for me. We also like the fact that the game has a lot of skill expression, which nautrally lends itself to esports.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Splitgate 2 uses genius ‘portal mechanics’ that allow players to warp around the battlefield like never before. It adds a unique element to the pacing, which is otherwise built around a typical run-and-gun operating model.</p>



<p>Proulx continued:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For us, the top priority is, ‘Let’s just go and make a fun shooter.’</p>



<p>If we do that and it turns into an esport, that’s great – but if it’s just a casual thing, that’s great too.</p>



<p>That said, I would love for this to be an esport one day. It’s a post-launch thing and not something I want to force or prioritise, though.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s typically quite tough for new games to elbow their way into the esports market. It has been dominated for so long by The Big Three: Counter-Strike, League of Legends, and Dota 2. Other titles have cut their way into the wider business, but it’s tough.</p>



<p>In recent years, the most successful <strong>new </strong>game was VALORANT, but that’s backed by Riot Games, so the foothold was already there. For a new IP to break into the market successfully, a perfect storm of positive circumstances must unfold.</p>
