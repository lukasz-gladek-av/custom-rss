<p>Fallout fans worldwide are preparing to <strong>potentially </strong>step into a real-world vault to live out their post-apocalyptic dreams in the <strong>all-new </strong>Fallout Shelter reality show. The new project was recently unveiled by Prime Video, alongside a casting call for participants. The successful applicants will live with others in a ‘real vault’ and complete challenges to hopefully be the last one left in the shelter.</p>



<p>It looks like Bethesda Game Studios and Prime Video plan to make the ‘experiment’ as close to a Vault-Tec test as possible. The casting call stressed that vault dwellers will be tested with ‘escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral conundrums.’</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-shelter-s-new-reality-show-starts-production-soon">Fallout Shelter’s New Reality Show Starts Production Soon</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Prime Video wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Good morning, prospective Vault Dwellers! In order to best serve you in What Comes Next, we need volunteers for a very real, very scientific opportunity to beta test a better society. Visit this website if you’d like to join Fallout Shelter, a new series full of escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral conundrums. Good luck!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you head to the <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website for the casting call</a>, you’ll be hit with all the information you need. </p>



<p>To apply, you must be at least 21 years of age, must hold a valid passport, and will need to be free for three weeks in June 2026 for filming. The casting call form is <strong>huge</strong> and asks for a heck of a lot of information, and it’s there to allow applicants to really sell themselves to Fallout Shelter’s casting team.</p>



<p>In December 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-shelter-reality-show-adaptation-claim/">it was claimed by</a> an industry insider that Fallout Shelter would be getting a live-action adaptation, but not like the Fallout television series that has been running since April 2024. Instead, it would be getting a ‘reality show’ approach, taking everyday people and throwing them into a vault to complete challenges.</p>



<p>This has materialized as fact, with Bethesda Game Studios and Prime Video officially unveiling the project.</p>



<p>Don’t be deterred, but the short trailer for the casting call stresses that ‘Vault-Tec assumes no liability for injury, dismemberment, or decapitation,’ but that’s just a joke… right?</p>



<p>It was said that the show will take on a ‘Squid Game’ or ‘MrBeast Games’ approach, whittling down the survivors as they’re eliminated one by one. There’s a cash prize for the ultimate victor, but it hasn’t been made clear yet how much that will be.</p>



<p>Fallout is exploding once again (no pun intended) as the second season of the award-winning television show started up again in December and is set to run until February 4th. There are claims of Fallout 3 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-coming-claimed/">Fallout: New Vegas remakes</a> on the horizon, and Fallout 76 just got its biggest update <strong>ever</strong>.</p>

<p>Mario’s modern-day voice actor, Kevin Afghani, debunks a rumor about his involvement with Nintendo before taking on the role of voicing several iconic Nintendo characters. He’s also discussing what it means to him to carry on the legacy of Mario, Luigi, and others.</p>



<p>Kevin Afghani began voicing Mario and Luigi with the 2023 release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder on the Nintendo Switch. He also voices the nefarious Wario. He replaced the retired Charles Martinet, the legendary voice actor who had voiced the characters for decades. However, he recently stated that, despite an online narrative, he had never worked for Nintendo before 2023. Specifically, he denied ever narrating the Nintendo Direct presentations.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ll give you one. I was never in Nintendo Direct,” he told <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/14/nintendo-new-mario-kevin-afghani-video-games/88185428007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>. There’s this weird narrative online I was in Nintendo Directs, I narrated Nintendo Directs. I never worked for Nintendo before being Mario.”</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-kevin-afghani-has-nothing-but-respect-for-the-og-mario-charles-martinet">Kevin Afghani Has Nothing But Respect For The OG Mario, Charles Martinet</h2>



<p>Discussing his fandom that led him to this dream role, he says he’s living his dream, but he has nothing but respect for the man who came before him, and in his mind, Charles Martinet is Mario.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Look, Charles, as far as I’m concerned, IS Mario. He created something that is so unbelievably iconic. And he did it so masterfully. If I wasn’t nervous, then I’m the wrong guy,” he said. “I’m the second guy who’s doing Mario. Charles is THE guy. There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Kevin Afghani will be back in the roles of Mario, Luigi, and Wario in the upcoming Mario Tennis Fever game, set to release in February 2026 on the Nintendo Switch 2.

<p>Ubisoft says its recent upload of the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag soundtrack to Ubisoft Music’s YouTube account was due to technical issues with some of its videos.</p>



<p>On January 14, 2026, the Ubisoft music account on YouTube uploaded 18 songs from the Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag soundtrack. Naturally, the move excited fans and sparked speculation that the game developer may be preparing to announce the much-anticipated remake of the 2013 game, dubbed Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag Resynced.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has now commented on the uploads, stating in <a href="https://t.co/WYPZTZZtZW">a community post on their music YouTube channel</a> that the songs were re-uploaded due to technical issues with some of their prior videos.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hi there music lovers! We encountered some technical issues with a few of our videos, which we had to reupload. Apologies for the trouble, and hope you enjoy the music.</p>
</blockquote>
