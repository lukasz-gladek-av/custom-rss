<p>A new announcement reveals that the original Final Fantasy 7 is re-releasing on Steam, replacing the 2013 version. </p>



<p>Nowadays, all we hear about Final Fantasy 7 is the remake instalments, Intergrade has already been released for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-series/" id="3453">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-part-3-confirmed-for-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth and Part 3 </a>have been confirmed for both platforms as well. However, today we aren’t talking about any of the remakes; instead, we are talking about the original Final Fantasy 7 title. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-re-releasing-to-replace-2013-version-on-steam">Final Fantasy 7 Re-Releasing to Replace 2013 Version on Steam </h2>



<p>According to a recent post on <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2016920806258069772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/square-enix/" id="149">Square Enix</a> has posted a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39140/view/514107648813039662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> on Steam regarding Final Fantasy 7’s re-release. The new version will rename the current version to FINAL FANTASY VII – 2013 Edition, and this version will no longer be available for purchase once the new version is released. </p>



<p>Existing owners of the 2013 version of Final Fantasy 7 don’t need to worry, as they will both retain access to the previous version and gain access to the new version at no additional cost. This means players can have both versions in their library, but there is no save data compatibility between them. Players with FF7 2013 save data can only use it for the 2013 edition, and the same for the new release. </p>



<p>Moreover, Square Enix has yet to provide a release date or an explanation for re-releasing Final Fantasy 7 on Steam. From what I can see, there are no noticeable upgrades in this version. </p>







<p>In other news, a new claim states that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth could release for Xbox and Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-arrive-for-switch-2-this-summer-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this summer</a>. Additionally, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 will bring back the iconic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-bring-back-the-snowboarding-mini-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowboarding mini game</a>.

            <guid>1420528</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> features a much older Leon Kennedy. As such, the ninth mainline entry into the long-running horror video game series is set to explore how his past adventures have changed him, and in this case, made him cold and angry towards the world.</p>



<p>The game’s director, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom’s </a>Koshi Nakanishi, was recently interviewed by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/260127r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DenNicoFamiGamer</a>. In the interview, Nakanishi notes that Leon’s years fighting the undead have made him more cynical about the world, saying he exudes a “ruthless anger.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Leon is making a reappearance in this game, and this is the result of us digging deep into the idea of ‘what type of person would Leon grow into? What would he be thinking?” Nakanishi says (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/resident-evil-requiem-director-wants-you-to-think-whats-wrong-with-you-leon-when-you-see-the-hot-uncle-swinging-his-bloody-ax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">h/t: Games Radar+</a>).</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-leon-has-an-ax-to-grind-in-resident-evil-requiem">Leon Has An Ax to Grind in Resident Evil Requiem</h2>



<p>Furthermore, it’s noted that one key way Leon’s personality change is on display is in how he attacks the zombies. In the upcoming game, his main weapon will be an ax, which is said to symbolize how he has changed over the years.</p>



<p>Nakanishi says he wants players to question why Leon made this choice and why he is acting with such aggression and anger. He wants players to ponder what is wrong with the character they’ve known for over two decades.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This game’s Leon fights by swinging his bloody ax in a way where you might start thinking, ‘What’s wrong with you, Leon?’ while playing. That is what we’re aiming for.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Resident Evil Requiem will release on February 27 for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/pc/" id="4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/xbox-series-x/" id="28">Xbox Series</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ted Timmins, the design director of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, has commented on players’ desires for new content, changes to the development team for the longstanding Battle Royale pillar, and teased some major updates to come in the next couple of months.</p>



<p>When a game reaches the level of success Fortnite has, listening to your audience is key. In the first season of its 7th chapter, Fortnite continues to draw interest through collaborations with popular IPs such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leak-reveals-the-office-collab-skins/" id="171628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>. However, core gameplay will always be a focal point.</p>



<p>In a tweet, Ted Timmins, responding to a video from SypherPK, noted that he understands the community is seeking new content. He also stated that there was always an understood risk when focusing on battle Royale mode and going back to basics with the first season of Chapter 7.</p>



<p>He then teased a fun update coming in February, possibly hinting at the inclusion of Self-Revives lives and Shockwaves, before noting that March would see the launch of season 2 for chapter 7.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey folks!</p><p>So, we need to talk 🙂 Seeing some of the responses from <a href="https://twitter.com/SypherPK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SypherPK</a>’s video (thank you for sharing your constructive feedback!), thought I'd jump in to join the conversation. </p><p>Totally hear the comments that the community is eager for new content.

<h2 id="h-fortnite-s-stability-was-also-addressed">Fortnite’s Stability Was Also Addressed</h2>



<p>After teasing fun updates, Timmins also revealed the creation of a “multi-discipline live-ops strike team.” This is a new addition to the development team, whose focus is on improving the player experience and general quality-of-life updates. He notes that this is a permanent addition to the development team.</p>



<p>The message concludes with a reminder to players that they can get a guaranteed Stick of Truth if they join this weekend’s Power Hour.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/no-rest-for-the-wicked/" id="2611">No Rest for the Wicked</a> is currently an action role-playing game in Early Access. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/moon-studios/" id="1402">Moon Studios</a>, known for the Ori series, plans to increase the game’s price from $40 to $60 after it leaves Steam Early Access and launches version 1.0.</p>



<p>The game is currently on sale at 40% off. Thomas Mahler, Creative Director of the game, <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/2016906516754808905?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted </a>to explain the sale and reiterate plans to move the game to $60 once it’s released in full.</p>



<p>“I’’m not trying to do any FOMO marketing here, but yes: when we hit 1.0, No Rest for the Wicked will move to $60, because it’s a premium title,” he said.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Since I’m getting a lot of messages about this, just to clarify:</p><p>The current 40% sale is a one-time promotion to celebrate and support No Rest for the Wicked Together.

<h2 id="h-mahler-compares-no-rest-for-the-wicked-to-baldur-s-gate-3">Mahler Compares No Rest for the Wicked to Baldur’s Gate 3</h2>



<p>Furthermore, he explained that the game launched in Early Access at $40 because he did not feel it was right to charge early supporters full price before it was properly ready. </p>



<p>He compared his strategy to that of Baldur’s Gate 3, which launched into Early Access at full price, explaining that he was never a fan of that approach.</p>



<p>“BG3 launched into Early Access at full price, and personally, I never loved that approach. If you support a game early, you should get some extra love,” he’d add.</p>



<p>Those interested can currently pick up the game on <a href="https://t.co/QiT6by7r2R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam </a>for $23.99.</p>

            <guid>1420483</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>issues a statement on image-sharing features in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream/" id="3535">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo/" id="22">Nintendo </a>recently held a dedicated Nintendo Direct for the upcoming Tomodachi Life sequel headed to the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. In addition to announcing the game’s April 16 release, the presentation showcased how players could customize their Miis and the island they inhabit.</p>



<p>However, Nintendo has issued a statement regarding limitations to image sharing in the upcoming game.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-is-committed-to-creating-experiences-that-are-welcoming-for-everyone">Nintendo Is Committed to Creating Experiences That Are Welcoming for Everyone</h2>



<p>Following the Nintendo Direct, the official <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo blog</a> issued a statement saying that restrictions have been placed on certain image-sharing features to create a safe environment for all players.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nintendo did, however, decide to expand players’ ability to express their gender and sexuality through their Tomodachi Life Mii characters. Players can now choose to make characters non-binary and date anyone of any gender. This follows a 2014 statement promising that future efforts would aim to design a more inclusive gameplay experience after players questioned the omission of same-sex relationships in the original Tomodachi Life.</p>



<p>The trailer released on January 29 showed that certain characters will experience heartbreak multiple times in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, while others may find marriage after bonding over monster trucks. Truly different strokes for different folks.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/</link>
            <guid>1420453</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The prices for all four editions of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26 </a>have leaked ahead of the official start of pre-orders on January 30.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 will be released in four versions, and according to a new report from billbil-kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/wwe-2k26-switch-2-plateformes-date-de-sortie-ce-que-lon-sait-60917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, the prices for the upcoming game have been released. The Standard Edition, which includes only the base game, will be priced at $69.99. The King of Kings Edition, the second-tier “Deluxe” edition, will be priced at $99.99.</p>



<p>Then, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" id="171784" rel="nofollow">Attitude Era Edition</a>, the “Premium” Edition of the game, will release for $129.99. Finally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" id="171836" rel="nofollow">Monday Night War Edition </a>will provide access to the most content throughout the game’s lifecycle and will be priced at $149.99.</p>



<p>In addition to providing players with more content at no additional cost, all higher-priced tiers will grant access to the game on March 6. Reportedly, this is 7 days earlier than when players who purchased only the standard tier will be able to play.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-leaves-last-gen-consoles-behind">WWE 2K26 Leaves Last-Gen Consoles Behind</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>After years of the current WWE game line releasing on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the ESRB rating for WWE 2K26 confirms that this year’s release will be limited to current-gen consoles.</p>



<p>Ironically, while WWE 2K26 leaves the past behind with its console releases, much of the game’s marketing has been rooted in WWE’s past. The Attitude Era and Monday Night War Editions focus heavily on the peak of WWE popularity in the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>



<p>Also, all three covers for the higher-priced tiers feature WWE Legends, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-king-of-kings-edition-cover-features-triple-h/" id="171834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one legend in particular on all three covers: Triple H.</a></p>







<h2>WWE 2K26’s Showcase Focuses on CM Punk</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As first reported by Insider Gaming, this year’s 2K Showcase campaign focuses on CM Punk. Players will get to relive some of CM Punk’s greatest moments from his WWE career.</p>



<p>Also, fans can experience fantasy scenarios that may have occurred if CM Punk not left WWE in 2014 before returning in 2023. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
