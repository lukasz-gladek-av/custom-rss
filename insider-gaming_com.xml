            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been two months since Death Stranding 2: On The Beach was released, with Hideo Kojima delivering big on yet another cinematic masterpiece that turned heads worldwide. In the short time that has followed, Kojima has busied himself promoting every angle of the game on social media and at the world tour events set up to showcase the game.</p>



<p>Many have wondered where the series goes from here, especially given the increasingly large window between releases. The first Death Stranding title dropped in 2019, and it took <strong>six years </strong>to produce a second game. Will Kojima be around for the third game? He has written a concept, but doesn’t think it’ll be him who makes Death Stranding 3.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hideo-kojima-make-another-death-stranding-game">Will Hideo Kojima Make Another Death Stranding Game?</h2>



<p>The Death Stranding series is equal parts emotional, action-packed, and bizarre. To outsiders, it represents a kind of walking or delivery guy simulator, but to those who have experienced it, Death Stranding is something phenomenal, tumultuous, and mind-bending.</p>



<p>That’s a touch of the sentiments handed down by fans over the last two months, anyway.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/AwQDoD9TK6w?t=3114s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent appearance</a> on the ‘World Strand Tour’, Hideo Kojima and his team stopped off in Saudi Arabia to further promote Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. In one segment, the interviewer asked the crowd, ‘Who wants Death Stranding 3?’</p>



<p>That prompted a telling response from Kojima:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m not planning to do that at the moment, because the ending of Death Stranding 2 was my finale of 1 and 2, but I already wrote the concept of DS3, so I have that in data.</p>



<p>I hope that someone will create it for me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/hideo-kojima-says-hes-already-written-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-he-wants-someone-else-to-make-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>Kojima went on to dive into the creation of Death Stranding 2, stressing that the COVID-19 pandemic threw a major spanner into the works, something that he has mentioned plenty of times in the past.</p>



<p>In June, Hideo Kojima spoke frankly about his health and the future of his company, Kojima Productions. He stressed that if his team tries to outright replicate his work when he has passed on, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-company-fail-replicate-work/">the company will fail</a>. For the last few years, Kojima has been stressing acute awareness of the fragility of life, showing a vulnerability that has made him more endearing, if nothing else.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We may have gotten our first look at Noah Centineo’s Ken in the upcoming Street Fighter film. Last week, we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-photo-teases-wwe-superstar-cody-rhodes-as-guile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a shadowy glimpse</a> at Cody Rhodes’ Guile on set. While we didn’t see much outside his lore-accurate hair, it was enough for fans to go crazy. Now, a new picture, thanks to Noah Centineo’s social media, shows us what his Ken may look like.</p>



<p>Legendary’s Street Fighter, directed by Kitao Sakurai (Bad Trip, Twisted Metal), started filming earlier this month. After it announced the loaded cast, including Warrior’s Andrew Koji as Ryu, Aquaman’s Jason Momoa as Blanka, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-has-reportedly-lined-up-chun-li-balrog-actors/">50 Cent as Balrog</a>, many were cautiously optimistic about the adaptation. While no official release date is set yet, it’s not stopping some teases on set on social media, like with Noah Centineo.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In a new photo from the Black Adam actor, Noah Centineo shows off his muscles in his trailer. We can also see that his hair, unknown if real or fake, is down and dyed yellow. To further confirm it’s Ken, Centineo captioned the post “Road brawler”, which is a cheeky hint at the title Street Fighter. Considering how Ken looks in the games, he does seem to resemble the American-born rival of Ryu rather well. </p>



<p>Of course, it’s one thing to look the part and another to act it out. Though considering Centineo’s burgeoning action career with The Recruit, he may be a perfect fit for Ken Masters. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see if more set photos regarding Street Fighter will be seen as they film in Australia. The fighting franchise is no stranger to adaptations, but many are hopeful that Legendary’s take will succeed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Demonschool Delayed to November Due To Silksong]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/demonschool-delayed-november-silksong/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/demonschool-delayed-to-november-due-to-silksong.1280115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Demonschool, which was planned to release September 3rd, 2025, has now been delayed, due in part to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. The indie RPG from Necrosoft Games, has been hotly anticipated since 2022, and was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fazy1L9KXFQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to drop next week</a>, with codes for the title already given to press. </p>



<p>Despite that, the game won’t come out at that time for a number of reasons, including one rather large one.</p>



<p>If you haven’t heard of Demonschool, it is a strategy RPG more in line with Persona 1 and 2 than newer ones. Still, the game has been in development for quite a bit and garnered attention for its 2D graphics and fun gameplay. Unfortunately, it looks like fans won’t be able to get to play it next week as anticipated.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-s-surprise-release-gets-blame-for-demonschool-s-delay">Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Surprise Release Gets Blame for Demonschool’s Delay</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In a press release from publisher Ysbyrd Games, the team announced Demonschool’s sudden delay from September 3rd to November 19th. As to why it’s now two months out, it says that Hollow Knight: Silksong is to blame. Via the official press release, it states:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025, on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game. Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that&nbsp;Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;will launch just one day after our planned release for&nbsp;Demonschool.</p>



<p>We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for&nbsp;Demonschool&nbsp;is our main goal. Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red. If the September period is going to be&nbsp;Silksong’s&nbsp;moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give&nbsp;Demonschool&nbsp;its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Demonschool already gave out codes for PC reviewers, so now they’ll have plenty of time to play the title. Still, this is the fourth game to vacate its spot due to Hollow Knight: Silksong’s surprise release. While it may not all have to do with Silksong, it’s certainly proven to be an issue for some. </p>



<p>Are you sad about Demonschool’s delay to November 19th? Will more games get delayed because of Silksong? Let us know in the comments and on the forums.</p>

<p>REPLACED has been delayed yet again, though its new window is more promising. After a troubled development, as the team was located near the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, there is a bit more hope for the game’s future.</p>



<p>The game, created by indie team Sad Cat Studios, is a cyberpunk action platformer. Rendered in a 2.5D style, REPLACED has been highly anticipated by many since its 2021 reveal. Fortunately, while it won’t come out in 2025, the team has shared some good news on when we will.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoyEkQePA4">video from IGN</a>, the team at Sad Cat Studios and publisher Thunderful Games goes over many of the improvements since the last update. REPLACED, according to the team, is close to finishing production, but won’t make the planned 2025 release date. Instead, they announced at the end of the video that the game will launch in Spring 2026. </p>



<p>In a statement from game director Yura Zhdanovich, provided via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/replaced-delayed-to-spring-2026">a press release</a>, he says, </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We know that our community is incredibly excited to play&nbsp;<em>REPLACED</em>&nbsp;and it’s no secret that it’s taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all—we apologize for that,” states Zhdanovich. “We’ve always been trying to do what’s right for the project, which in turn, means delivering to you a truly special experience. The good news is that we now are very close to finishing production and&nbsp;<em>REPLACED</em>&nbsp;will be coming to PC and&nbsp;Xbox Series X|S&nbsp;in spring 2026.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While no exact date was mentioned, the video does state that the final trailer will premiere later this year. Therefore, it won’t be long before we know when the game will arrive. Given that it will also release on Xbox Game Pass, many are sure to join in on the cyberpunk fun that awaits.</p>
