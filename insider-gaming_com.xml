            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been a week since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> announced its massive restructuring, which saw six projects cancelled, seven titles delayed, and two studios closed. The company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-12-year-low-amid-company-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stock price dropped to a 15-year low</a>, a 95% decline from its peak valuation. </p>



<p>The company’s announcement revolved around its new ‘Creative Houses’ structure, which will see its IPs placed into five different categories, organized around distinct genres and franchises. As announced by Ubisoft, each Creative House will have its own leadership structure and will be responsible for brand development, content strategy, and editorial direction for that particular Creative House.</p>







<p>A ‘Creative Network’ of studios will strengthen these Creative Houses, providing technical support, QA, and other development resources. It’s a change that Ubisoft say will bring more structure, speedy game development, and the ability to deploy technical resources across its portfolio. </p>



<p>It’s yet another change enforced at the publisher that has made employees feel uneasy. Some tell me that they feel like this is just a way to eventually sell off their IPs, while others theorise it’s a means to get cash injections into creating more subsidiaries with other companies more easily. Very few think that’s a meaningful change that will make much of a difference because, at the end of the day, it’s still the same people in charge who put the company is this place in the first place.</p>



<h2 id="h-creative-network-employees-are-worried">Creative Network Employees Are Worried</h2>



<p>For the most part, and understandably so, most employees who currently work at Ubisoft are frustrated, confused, and worried about the future. Ubisoft’s third, and apparently final, cost-cutting measure will aim to save another 200 million euros by March 2028, a move that could result in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands of developers being laid off.</a> But the most noticeable of the worried employees come from Ubisoft’s new ‘Creative Network’, who tell me that the restructuring feels like it only applies to half of the company and suggests that they are easy targets for future layoffs.</p>



<p>That’s because, while not released to the public, Ubisoft has already outlined and assigned studios to each Creative House and the Creative Network, with around 20 studios now in the Creative Network. But internally, nothing has been set in stone or assigned regarding how they will assist the Houses.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has been sent documentation outlining which Ubisoft Studios will go to which Creative House.</p>







<h3 id="h-creative-house-1-vantage-studios">Creative House 1 (Vantage Studios)</h3>



<p><strong>Games </strong>– Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six</p>



<p><strong>Studios –</strong> Barcelona, Montreal Vantage, Quedec, Saguenay, Sherbrooke, Sofia</p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-2">Creative House 2</h3>



<p><strong>Games –</strong> Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, The Division, Avatar</p>



<p><strong>Studios </strong>– Paris (Ghost Recon), Massive, Montreal CH2, Toronto</p>



<p><em>Avatar was missing from the publicly released documents. When asked for comment about the future of Avatar, a Ubisoft spokesperson told Insider Gaming, “Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a live game with internal teams working on it.”</em></p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-3">Creative House 3</h3>



<p><strong>Games –</strong> Brawlhalla, For Honor, Riders Republic, Skull &amp; Bones, The Crew</p>



<p><strong>Studios –</strong> Blue Mammoth Games, Ivory Tower, Montreal CH3</p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-4">Creative House 4</h3>



<p><strong>Games –</strong> Anno, Beyond Good and Evil, Might &amp; Magic, Prince of Persia, Rayman, Trackmania</p>



<p><strong>Studios – </strong>Mainz, Milan, Montepellier, Montreal CH4, Nadeo</p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-5">Creative House 5</h3>



<div><p><strong>Games – </strong>Growtopia, Hasbro Games, Howrse, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Glode, Just Dance, Kolibri’s portfolio, Ketchapp’s portfolio, UNO</p><p><strong>Studios –</strong> Abu Dhabi, Barcelona Mobile, Ketchapp, Kolibrio Games, Paris (Just Dance), Ubisoft Mobile Games, Ubisoft Paris Mobile</p></div>



<p><em>Ubisoft also has four unannounced IP’s in development, which will fall into Creative House 2, 3, or 4, depending on the IP’s theme.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-creative-network">Creative Network</h3>



<p>The following studios are all within the Creative Network:</p>



<ul>
<li>Annecy</li>



<li>Belgrade</li>



<li>Berlin</li>



<li>Bordeaux</li>



<li>Bucharest</li>



<li>Chengdu</li>



<li>Da Nang</li>



<li>Dusseldorf</li>



<li>Kyiv</li>

<li>Warsaw</li>

<li>Red Storm</li>



<li>RedLynx</li>



<li>Reflections</li>



<li>Shanghai</li>



<li>Singapore</li>



<li>Winnipeg</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-darker-days-to-come">Darker Days to Come</h2>



<p>It’s unfortunate to say, but despite an insane amount of good IPs and games to hopefully come, it still feels like Ubisoft’s darkest days aren’t yet over. Officially, it’ll be March 2028 before the cost-cutting will stop, but it feels like Ubisoft’s rollercoaster story of twists and turns are only just beginning.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, and even before the impending announcement of more layoffs in February, Ubisoft announced it aims to cut <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 jobs at Ubisoft Paris’ headquarters</a>, a move that has seen the French <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-vote-to-strike-against-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft unions propose a strike from February 10-12</a>. </p>



<p>The unfortunate thing about all this is that, as always, it will be the developers who suffer the conseqeven before the impending announcement of more layoffs in February, Ubisoft announced it aims to cut 200 jobs at its Paris headquarters, a move that has prompted the French Ubisoft unions touences of years of misleadership. </p>

<p>The French Ubisoft unions have unanimously agreed to organize a strike against the company between February 10 and 12, 2026.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft recently announced a major restructure to the organisation, which would lead to multiple studio closures and layoffs. The first set of dismissals has already been revealed, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 job cuts proposed</a> at the Paris Headquarters. The French unions have agreed to strike and are coordinating with international counterparts. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-strike-to-take-place-this-february">Ubisoft Strike to Take Place this February </h2>



<p>According to a report by the French publication <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Les Echos</a>, several unions representing Ubisoft workers—namely the Video Game Workers’ Union (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, CFE-CGC, CGT, and Printemps Écologique—have unanimously agreed to strike from February 10 to 12. The unions also plan to collaborate with their international counterparts to raise awareness of the situation on a global scale.</p>



<p>The reason for the strike is the new austerity measures aimed at reducing the company’s fixed costs by €200 million over the next two years, along with&nbsp;stricter remote working conditions. This decision is expected to result in layoffs, with the first voluntary mutual termination already proposed. The layoffs could affect 20% of Ubisoft’s headquarters workforce and 5% of its total workforce in France.</p>



<p>The Ubisoft restructure has already led to the cancellation of the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, along with five other games. The new operating model will focus on open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences, featuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 creative houses</a>. The restructuring has already led to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major decline in the company’s share price</a>. </p>
