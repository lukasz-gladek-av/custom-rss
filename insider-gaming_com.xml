            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Some people may wonder, “Is Hellcase a scam or legit?” The answer is clear: Hellcase is completely legit, as it not only offers fair and transparent terms of use, for example, its Provably Fair algorithms, but also has an excellent security system that prevents attackers from getting hold of any information about you or your account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The real question isn’t “is Hellcase a legit site,” but “how do I spot the fake sites that impersonate Hellcase?”</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonating-scam-alerts"><strong>Hellcase Impersonating Scam Alerts</strong></h2>



<p>Users sometimes encounter information suggesting that Hellcase might be a scam. In reality, any large brand or website often faces this problem. Because of their popularity, they attract the attention of not only honest players but also scammers. The “Hellcase is a scam” myth you see online is almost always fueled by people who, unfortunately, got tricked by one of these fake sites.</p>



<p>Scammers often create various fraudulent methods to get hold of information. They create various bots, fake websites that may look similar to a Hellcase page, or anything else that can help them steal your personal or account information. These scammers are counting on you to be in a hurry. They want you to click a link from a fake email, a shady Discord message, or a random Steam friend without checking the address bar. Therefore, before entering any personal or account details, always double-check the website and be attentive to the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonators-on-steam"><strong>Hellcase impersonators on Steam</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to fake websites, scammers also frequently use Steam to deceive users. They often create lookalike accounts, using names such as “Hellcase Admin,” “Hellcase Support,” or “Hellcase Bot.” All of this can confuse users, and scammers exploit that trust to deceive them.</p>



<p>Their method is simple: they add players as friends or send a direct message, posing as employees. They might send you a link or directly ask for access to your account, often claiming it’s for security purposes. The message might mention fake winnings, payment issues, fraudulent transactions, or various other topics. However, remember that Hellcase never asks its customers for this type of information, nor does it communicate with them via Steam accounts. This is 100% of the time, always, a scam. So, stay vigilant and be careful.</p>



<p>How do you avoid this? It’s simple:</p>



<ul>
<li>Do not accept the friend request.</li>



<li>Do not click any links they send you.</li>



<li>Never give them any information.</li>



<li>Block the user.</li>



<li>Report the profile to Steam for impersonation.</li>
</ul>



<p>And remember: all official communication takes place EXCLUSIVELY through the support system on the official <a href="https://hellcase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellcase</a> website.</p>



<h2 id="h-real-life-scenarios-of-scam-victims"><strong>Real-Life Scenarios of Scam Victims</strong></h2>



<p>Picture this: you’ve just finished a game, and as you’re closing Steam, you see a friend request from an account named “Hellcase_Moderator” or something similar, complete with the official Hellcase logo. Without suspecting anything, you add the account as a friend. A little while later, you get a message claiming you’ve won a giveaway. To get your skin, you just need to click a link.</p>



<p>After clicking the link, you land on a site that looks just like Hellcase. You enter your details, but nothing happens. When you go back to Steam and message the account to ask why it’s not working, you get no reply. That’s because the scammers created a phishing site to steal your data and, ultimately, your skins.</p>



<p>Let us be 100% clear: OUR STAFF WILL NEVER DM YOU ON STEAM. EVER.</p>



<p>This is one of the real cases that, unfortunately, happen to users simply due to inattention.</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonator-scam-examples"><strong>Hellcase Impersonator Scam Examples</strong></h2>



<p>Scammers register dozens of domains hoping to catch you off guard. Here are just a few examples of fake, scammer-owned domains that are<strong> NOT Hellcase</strong>. If you see any of these, stay away:</p>



<ul>
<li>helfcase(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase(.)com(.)de</li>



<li>Hellcases(.)site</li>



<li>helluese(.)com</li>



<li>hellcasc(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase(.)shop</li>



<li>hellcase-es(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-cz(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-br(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-csgo(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-hu(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-fr(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-de(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-tr(.)com</li>



<li>heffcase(.)com</li>



<li>hellcsee(.)com</li>



<li>cs2hellcase(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase(.)space</li>



<li>helluese(.)com</li>
</ul>



<p>Look closely. They rely on typos, extra dashes, or different domain endings like .shop or .space instead of .com or .org.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-only-official-hellcase-websites"><strong>The Only Official Hellcase Websites</strong></h2>



<p>This is the most crucial part of this message, so please pay attention.</p>



<p>There are <strong>ONLY TWO</strong> official, legitimate, and safe Hellcase domains. They are:</p>



<ul>
<li>https://hellcase.com</li>



<li>https://hellcase.org</li>
</ul>



<p>You will also sometimes encounter hellcs2.com, which is also one of the official websites, but it is more often used for advertising purposes.</p>



<p>That’s it. No dashes. No extra letters. No “.shop,” “.space,” or “.de.”</p>



<p>Just .com and .org.</p>



<p>Please, before you log in, before you deposit, before you do anything, look at your browser’s address bar. If you’re ever asking yourself, “is Hellcase a legit site?”, the first thing you must do is check that URL. If you are on hellcase.com or hellcase.org, then yes, Hellcase is a legit site. If you are anywhere else, you are on a scam site.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-nintendo-switch-games-to-gift">Best Nintendo Switch Games to Gift</h2>







<figure></figure>



<p>The newest entry in the long-standing Pokémon franchise, Legends: Z-A brings players back to Kalos’ Lumiose City and features the return of Mega Evolutions, including favorites from the past and new additions. With open-world exploration and real-time balance mechanics, Legends: Z-A breaks off from the standard Pokémon script, yet impresses as one of the best games in the franchise’s history.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mario Kart 8 seemed to go on forever, but, after many years of waiting, 2025 finally saw the arrival of Mario Kart World on Nintendo Switch 2. While it’s not available on the original Switch console, Mario Kart World is a must-have for any Switch 2 owner, providing plenty of enjoyment solo or against other players.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>After an extended stint in early access, Hades 2 fully released a 1.0 version this year and Switch players are the first to be able to jump in as the title is a timed console exclusive. The roguelike game is great to play on Switch, with the ability to play on the go, and the biggest challenge you’ll likely face is putting it down.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although now five years old, Animal Crossing: New Horizons continues to be a must-play title, standing as one of the best available on the Switch, and there’s even more content right around the corner. The big 3.0 update next year brings Switch 2 improvements to the game, but there’s also a bunch of new free additions for players across both generations of console.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another title that stands as a must-have for any Switch player, Tears of the Kingdom is widely regarded to be one of the greatest games of all time. There’s so much to do that you’ll lose hours and hours in the game, with a gripping story to complete and a near-endless amount of side quests and exploration to tick off.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros Ultimate</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though it celebrates a seventh birthday this year, and is likely due to be replaced by a successor in the coming years, Super Smash Bros Ultimate remains the best in show in the brawler scene, and has a stacked roster like no other. Unlocking everyone is quite an undertaking, but it’s worth it and provides a fun challenge to the single-player push.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>This two-in-one bundle has hours of entertainment through arguably the best Mario titles ever created, and the fact it’s at an affordable price makes it even more enticing. Super Mario Galaxy paved the way for the modern generation of titles and, while they may be old news by now, they’re worth picking up if you haven’t already.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it. On paper, PowerWash Simulator 2 may not sound like the most thrilling adventure, and you’d be right, but what it does offer is relaxing gameplay that hits the spot every time you boot it up. There’s nothing else quite as satisfying as finally finishing a big job in PowerWash Simulator 2, and it’s well worth trying out.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree is the latest instalment in the beloved franchise that has been testing friendships for generations, and it’s another must-have title for any Switch owner. With an array of mini games, plenty of boards to work through in matches, and unrivalled multiplayer, Super Mario Party Jamboree needs to be near the top of your wishlist.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Epic Games CEO Says AI Disclosure ‘Makes No Sense for Game Stores’]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Epic Games CEO recently commented on AI disclosure for game stores, stating it makes no sense as it will be involved in almost all future production. </p>



<p>The gaming industry has conflicting views about AI use in development at the moment. Some seem to be for it, with companies like Ubisoft pushing for full-scale AI-driven <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-ai-teammates-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research projects</a>. The Witcher 3 director also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about</a> AI in development, stating he doesn’t feel “that games created with only AI will have soul.” Now Tim Sweeney has shared his two cents on AI in game development and store disclosure. </p>







<h2 id="h-epic-games-ceo-says-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production">Epic Games CEO Says AI Will Be Involved in Nearly All Future Production</h2>



<p>The CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, recently responded to a comment on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that said Steam and other digital marketplaces “need to drop the ‘Made with AI’ label.” Sweeney said that he agrees with that comment, adding that the AI tag is “relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation.”</p>



<p>Sweeney added that AI disclosure “makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.” When another user spoke about customers deserving to know, Sweeney poked fun at those statements, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993890431462166818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stating</a>, “Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses. Customers deserve to know lol.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses.

<p>Talking about AI in game development, Activision was recently under fire by the community for using generative AI <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to create their calling cards</a> for Black Ops 7. The controversy received so much attention that it prompted a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response from US Congressman Ro Khanna</a>. He stated that “we need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits.”</p>

<p>The Pokémon TCG has seen a popularity boom once again in 2025, making products harder and harder to source, but there are some Black Friday deals to take advantage of.</p>

<p>Sets continue to come out thick and fast, but, with the first line of Ascended Heroes products not landing until the end of January, there’s a bit of breathing room to take a look at the best Black Friday deals available—and don’t forget to look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s other holiday guides</a>.</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red has told fans not to expect any new showcases of The Witcher 4 during The Game Awards next month, despite being nominated for an award.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 faces stiff competition with the likes of Marvel’s Wolverine and Grand Theft Auto 6 to be crowned the Most Anticipated Game at the 2025 awards show, but no matter the outcome, there won’t be any Witcher 4 reveals.</p>







<h2 id="h-witcher-4-skipping-the-game-awards">Witcher 4 Skipping The Game Awards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No show. Image via CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure>
