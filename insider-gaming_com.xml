<p>It’s not often that any game gets a new peak player count years after release, and it’s even rarer when it happens to a driving simulation title <strong>thirteen years </strong>after hitting the market. That’s what happened recently with Euro Truck Simulator 2, which skyrocketed on Steam to reach a new peak player count years after its release in October 2012.</p>



<p>On Steam, Euro Truck Simulator 2 soared to 72,678 concurrent players, all because of two new DLC packs that took players to the Nordics.</p>







<h2 id="h-euro-truck-simulator-2-reaches-new-heights">Euro Truck Simulator 2 Reaches New Heights</h2>



<p>Euro Truck Simulator 2 has always been one of the most popular driving sims, with some players going to extreme lengths to replicate a truck cab in their gaming room to immerse themselves in the hyper-realistic driving experience fully.</p>



<p>Days ago, SCS Software released two new pieces of DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2, Nordic Horizons and the Forest Machinery expansion. The former takes players to the gorgeous, rural vistas of Scandinavia, presenting them with mountainside roads, forest tracks, and scenic drives around lakes and fjords.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the expansion:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>SCS Software has made leaps and bounds with Euro Truck Simulator 2 over the years, constantly adding new locations and ways to explore the game through a staggering array of expansions.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Steam</a>, users can invest in the Euro Truck Simulator 2 <strong>Ultimate Edition bundle </strong>to secure the base game and a whopping 34 expansions and pieces of DLC. This includes Greece, France, Italy, the Balkans, and of course, Scandinavia.</p>



<p>The game has remained a consistent hit since 2012, generating ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ reviews to make Euro Truck Simulator 2 one of the top-rated titles on Steam.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ninja Reveals What He Thinks Would Ruin ARC Raiders]]></title>

            <guid>1370032</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ninja has been streaming ARC Raiders since the game came out, participating in the recent ‘streamer war’ and exploring every facet of the all-new extraction adventure from Embark Studios. The game has proven to be a monumental success, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers from across the streaming space.</p>



<p>The popular creator, with origins in games like Fortnite, revealed the one thing that he thinks would <strong>ruin </strong>ARC Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-make-arc-raiders-competitive">Don’t Make ARC Raiders Competitive</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, Ninja stressed that making ARC Raiders competitive and introducing tournaments would make the game unbearable, simply because people would start ‘min-maxing’ to sweat the game and become the best they could be at it.</p>



<p>Right now, it’s the most casual extraction title on the market, boasting accessible mechanics, a socially-focused gameplay loop, and forgiving combat elements.</p>



<p>Ninja’s concern is that if you add tournaments and the ability to earn money from playing ARC Raiders at a ‘pro level’, you’ll destroy those elements and just make the game too challenging for casual players.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nah, the second they try to make this game competitive, it would be so bad. I hope there are never tournaments for it.</p>



<p>I want them to keep it as casual as possible.</p>



<p>Also, there’s too much desync for this game to legitimately be competitive. They better never make this game competitive, ever.</p>



<p>Even like, joke tournaments. Like Escape from Tarkov has tournaments and stuff, I don’t know how they work, but like… The second you start throwing money in this game, people are going to start competing and it just encourages people to just min-max and become the best at this game, and…</p>



<p>It rapidly increases how quickly people get good at games when you start throwing tournaments in, it’s what happened to Fortnite.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full clip:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"The second they try to make this game competitive it would be so bad, I hope there's never tournaments for it, I want them to keep it as casual as possible… it rapidly increases how quickly people get good at games"</p><p>Ninja doesn't want ARC Raiders to go down the same path as… <a href="https://t.co/OUgGCULTrH">pic.twitter.com/OUgGCULTrH</a></p></div>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1995652260735713387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Players appreciate how approachable ARC Raiders is compared to other extraction titles, and while there’s definitely a skill gap, it feels like every weapon and approach is viable when it comes to combat. Introducing a strict meta and pushing for a competitive or ranked loop might push out the more casual players who are enjoying this game because of that fact.</p>



<p>That being said, Embark Studios also developed The Finals, a competitive arena shooter title with a more traditional ranked loop that includes high-stakes tournaments. It’s unlikely that any official tournaments would surface in ARC Raiders while the team is focused on making The Finals a competitive, esports-backed product.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that Hideo Kojima, the legendary game creator, has joined the cast of Zootopia 2 to provide a Japanese dub for Paul Moldebrandt, a mole who works in the Zootopia Police Department. His cameo appearance reportedly comes after he was directly approached by Jared Bush, the film’s director, to request his voiceover talents.</p>



<p>Zootopia 2 is set to hit screens in just a few days, launching on Friday, December 5.</p>







<h2 id="h-an-unexpected-cameo">An Unexpected Cameo</h2>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded by Famitsu</a>, Hideo Kojima expressed his delight at being invited to voice a character in Zootopia 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have plenty of experience with cameo appearances in live-action films and games, but this will be my first time dubbing an animated feature film. And it’s from Disney, to my surprise!</p>



<p>And since it came directly from director Jared Bush, I was incredibly honored and accepted without hesitation</p>



<p>My participation was limited to a small scene, but even at the recording stage, the level of detail was impressive. Thanks to the illustrations, the recording went smoothly. I’m usually on the directing side, so I learned a lot from actually acting. I was reminded of how much attention voice actors pay to basic things like turning pages in the script and adding noise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Kojima said, this isn’t his first time acting. He has appeared in a few small roles over the years, most notably in Cyberpunk 2077 and Control. He also assumed roles in Metal Gear Solid games and has made cameos in Death Stranding.</p>



<p>The report from Famitsu suggests that Kojima was a huge fan of the first Zootopia movie, released in 2016, and when he saw it, he was left wondering how they could ‘surpass’ it with a sequel.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-film-director-fast-and-furious-it-writer/</link>
            <guid>1369876</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Justin Lin, the director of several Fast and Furious films, has been announced as the director of the live-action Helldivers film. In addition, the writer of several horror films, like Annabelle and I,t wrote the script for the video game adaptation. </p>



<p>As one of PlayStation’s newer series, Helldivers didn’t seem to hit its stride until 2024, when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-brings-in-around-2-5-million-players-every-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it became a worldwide phenomenon</a>. The multiplayer sci-fi shooter was a viral sensation and still is in some ways. With constant updates and a recent port to Xbox, Arrowhead Studios’ hit felt primed for Hollywood. In January 2025, it was announced that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be brought to film</a> by Sony Pictures. Updates went silent for a bit until now, where it’s been revealed that a high-profile director and writer are attached.</p>







<h2 id="h-justin-lin-directing-helldivers-film-for-sony-pictures-written-by-gary-dauberman">Justin Lin Directing Helldivers Film for Sony Pictures, Written by Gary Dauberman</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive from The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the outlet revealed that <strong>Justin Lin has joined the Helldivers film as director</strong>. He will be adapting the project from a script <strong>written by Gary Dauberman</strong>. While additional crew and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-ceo-wants-a-list-to-be-violently-killed-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casting</a> have yet to be revealed, the report says that Lin <strong>plans to bring out the ‘humanity’ of the game</strong> with <strong>timely themes</strong> and <strong>a built-out world</strong>. It also seems like the story will <strong>revolve around a squad of elite Helldivers taking on various creatures and the Super Earth</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve watched any Fast and Furious movie from the 2010s, it’s likely been directed by Justin Lin. The filmmaker is a hit with action-film fans and a notable name in the genre. Currently, Lin is set to direct Keanu Reeves in BRZRKR and adapt One Punch Man into a film. For Gary Dauberman, the scribe has been behind some of horror’s recent hits like It (and its sequel, It Chapter Two), Annabelle, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn</a>. All that said, it’ll be interesting to see how Helldivers shapes up.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-director/</link>
            <guid>1369813</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splinter Cell Remake director David Grivel has returned to Ubisoft to finish what he started in 2021.</p>



<p>Announced on his LinkedIn profile, David Grivel announced that he’s rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as the project’s Game Director for the Splinter Cell Remake. </p>







<p>The Splinter Cell Remake originally started development in 2021 under the codename ‘North’, with not much else being said on the game since. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> in 2024 that the game is currently in development on the Snowdrop engine, with a tentative release date of 2026. It’s likely given the projects (and Ubisoft as a whole) issues that this release date is no longer accurate, but we will update our readers when we learn more.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming received footage of the project in early 2025, which showed Irving Lambert speaking to Sam Fisher in a superb cinematic. As it’s understood, the Splinter Cell Remake is a fully-fledged remake from the ground up, which will include being built around a modern audience from the ground up, rather than a simple graphic rehaul.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the game is in development for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>



<p>As for what Grivel’s return to the game means for the game’s immediate future is unclear, but the news that development continues on the game will be a warm welcome to those who were skeptical of the project’s future.</p>
