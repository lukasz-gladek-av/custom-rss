<p>Episode 7 is the upcoming continuation of Amazon’s Fallout Season 2. The smash-hit adaptation is currently on pace to outshine and dethrone S1 as the superior series, so make sure you don’t miss Fallout Season 2 Episode 7, with this release date and start time hub.</p>



<p>Video game adaptations are hit or miss. The Last of Us Season 1 is a masterpiece, whereas Halo bombed. Arcane is sensational, but Return to Silent Hill is a dumpster fire of epic proportions. Fallout has been a revelation, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-score-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Season 2</a> continues to deliver for Amazon and fans.</p>



<p>If you’re looking forward to the follow-up to Episode 6’s ‘The Other Player,’ here’s the latest Episode 7 info.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-season-2-episode-7-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been a blast. Credit to Amazon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 will release on January 28, carrying on Season 2’s regular weekly release schedule.</strong></p>



<p>Episode 6 was released on January 21, so Episode 7 is coming on January 28. Shows on Amazon and Netflix are very consistent with episode release patterns, and Episode 7 should be no different.</p>



<p>However, Insider Gaming will be on the ball and the first to update you if any Radroaches or Deathclaws decide you need to take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apply-for-fallout-shelter-reality-show-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(Fallout) shelter</a> for another week.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-episode-7-start-times-amp-date">Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 Start Times &amp; Date</h2>



<p><strong>Pacific Time-based viewers can start watching Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 from midnight on January 21, and it will be available later for everyone else around the world.</strong></p>



<p>While it would be good if the sun could somehow light up the planet in the same way worldwide, we have to settle for time zones, regions, and scattered releases.</p>



<p>Check out if your region is listed below and what time you can start watching Episode 7.</p>

<p>Konami’s Silent Hill 2 has been brought to life through Return to Silent Hill. The 2026 movie adaptation looked quite impressive in its prerelease trailers and screenshots, and Pyramid Head looks as dangerous as he should, but all the effort appears to be in vain.</p>



<p>The 2024 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/konami-says-more-silent-hill-remakes-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> gave the franchise new life. It recaptured some of the love and nostalgia from the late 90s and early 2000s era. Silent Hill f went in a different but equally compelling direction. It was full steam ahead for a new Silent Hill movie, but unfortunately, Return to Silent Hill has gotten lost in the fog.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-reviews-are-in-for-return-to-silent-hill-and-it-s-not-good">The Reviews Are In For Return To Silent Hill, And It’s Not Good</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The reviews are just as horrifying. Credit to Davis Films, Electric Shadow, Supernix, and WIP.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Currently, Return to Silent Hill has a jaw-droppingly low score of just <strong>6% on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rotten Tomatoes</a></strong> based on 17 reviews. There’s a chance more reviews will be added, but it’s hard to see a route back for the movie—and further reviews could bring the score down further.</p>







<p>Critics have described it as a “Massively disappointing adaptation of a classic horror video game,” “An atmospheric, supernatural horror thriller that offers no surprises, thrills or palpable scares,” and “An adaptation that fails to improve upon the source material or do anything particularly new and interesting.”</p>



<p>This makes it the worst-reviewed Silent Hill movie in the franchise, and this isn’t saying much.</p>



<p>The 2006 adaptation with Sean Bean is a Scorsese epic, in comparison, with its 33% Rotten Tomatoes score (and generally isn’t a bad watch), whereas 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation sees reception plunge to 8%.</p>



<p>Return to Silent Hill beats them all, as it stands. This is likely to affect box office numbers, and it could be the final nail in the coffin for any future Silent Hill movies.</p>



<p>If you already have tickets booked for Return to Silent Hill, please let the community know what you think of it.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-could-spend-up-to-800-million-on-the-witcher-4-its-estimated/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An analyst has predicted that CD Projekt Red could end up spending close to $800 million on the development and marketing of The Witcher 4. </p>



<p>The Witcher 4 will be the next big instalment from CD Projekt Red, and we already know it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t release in 2026</a>. The new trilogy will follow a 6-year plan. As we wait for more news about the title, analysts have predicted the budget that the developers might be targeting for this game. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-4-could-cost-close-to-400-million-with-an-additional-400-million-to-be-spent-on-marketing">The Witcher 4 Could Cost Close to $400 Million, With An Additional $400 Million to be Spent on Marketing </h2>



<p>The estimate of The Witcher 4 costing $800 million comes from a post on Polish platform <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Strefa Inwestorów</a> (via <a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/analyst-estimates-800-million-budget-for-the-witcher-4-10x-higher-than-cost-of-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Clawsome Gamer</a>). The prediction comes from a Noble Securities Analyst, Mateusz Chrzanowski, who has stated that The Witcher 4 could cost PLN 1.4 billion (USD 388 million) to make, and that CDPR could spend a similar amount on marketing, bringing the total cost of the title close to $800 million. </p>



<p>Additionally, the analyst has predicted that the trilogy’s budget has increased from PLN 2.1 billion (USD 583 million) previously to PLN 3.2 billion (USD 861 million). </p>



<p>Additionally, the report discusses the budget and release window for Project Orion (the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel). It seems this title could cost around PLN 1.5 billion (USD 416 million) to develop, largely due to the apparent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2-could-feature-online-multiplayer-new-job-listing-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer integration</a>. This integration has also apparently pushed the release date to Q4 2030, which will be Cyberpunk 2077’s 10th Anniversary. </p>



<p>Readers should note that these are analyst predictions and not official numbers from CDPR, so take this information with a grain of salt. </p>







<p>In other news, CD Projekt Red has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-adds-senior-baldurs-gate-3-developer-to-the-witcher-4-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought on a senior Baldur’s Gate 3 developer</a> to The Witcher 4 team.
