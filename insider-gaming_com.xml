<p>Warzone is in a bad spot right now. We’re a long way since the heyday of 2020 when Verdansk was on everyone’s minds, and what remains today is a shell of what was once the most popular battle royale game in the business. The competitive scene is in bits, pro players have waited months for payments, and cheaters are harassing the global community with increasing abandon.</p>



<p>But fear not – in the recent patch notes published ahead of Warzone Season 02, Activision’s teams revealed that you now have the <strong>correct number of rocks to throw in the Gulag.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-warzone-in-tatters">Warzone in Tatters</h2>



<p>Last week, I covered the news that many Warzone pro players still chase hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments owed by Activision and Co. </p>



<p>Following the World Series of Warzone last year, players from the top down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-series-of-warzone-players-winnings/">failed to secure their winnings</a>. The state of play for Warzone esports was already rough enough, but this revelation extinguished any hope fans had for a resurgence of sorts in the coming months.</p>



<p>On social and streaming platforms, sentiments are at an all-time low.</p>



<p>On Twitch, the game’s <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/512710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">peak of 1.6 million viewers</a> (in April 2021) seems like little more than a fever dream now. The average peak viewer count in the last seven days was around 24,000 users at the time of writing. That could be a symptom of the wider comedown of the battle royale genre, though – other games aren’t faring much better:</p>



<ul>
<li>PUBG – 12,800 avg</li>



<li>Apex Legends – 16,100 avg</li>
</ul>



<p>Only Fortnite stays strong, boasting a 65,800 average peak viewer count over the last seven days – but given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-count-record-broken-juice-wrld/">the game’s rampant success</a> in recent years, that’s hardly a surprise.</p>



<p>The recent patch notes for Warzone’s Season 02 update revealed plenty of bug fixes and tweaks, but one that stood out and drew some jibes on social media read:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Fixed an issue where players only had one Gulag Rock instead of five in the Gulag.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This prompted many users to throw jabs at Activision’s prioritisation matrix, suggesting that this fix is but a grain of sand amid a beach of problems. </p>



<p>In a post on Twitter (X), CouRage suggested what needs to be done to revive Warzone:</p>



<div><article><p><span>It’s so sad to see the state of Warzone.

Call of Duty is one of the mismanaged IPs on the planet. Too many cooks in the kitchen. Too many egos. Too much greed from Activision.

Pull the plug. Reset from Warzone 1.0 and let it be it’s own standalone experience. Only additive…</span></p></article></div>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<p>In a spread of comments echoing the general sentiment, content creators across the net expressed their concerns:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Warzone has gotta be one of the biggest embarrassments ever right now…’ – Timmy2Cans</li>



<li>‘The mismanagement of Warzone will go down as one of gaming’s biggest blunders when all is said and done.’ – Loochy</li>



<li>‘Perhaps the magic of Warzone is just gone and we all have grown tired of playing the game.’ – DougDagnabbit</li>
</ul>

<p>In major news that was revealed by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/sony-corp-shake-up-hiroki-totoki-ceo-hideaki-nishino-playstation-1236289299/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> on Tuesday night—Wednesday morning in Japan—, Sony Corp. has made unexpected changes to its organizational chart.  Hideaki Nishino, who was appointed co-CEO and handled the platform side in 2024, will now act as sole president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE). </p>



<p>Hermen Hulst, who was named Co-CEO of SIE last year no longer overseeing the entire company alongside Nishino. However, he remains in his position as CEO of the Studio Business Group, a subdivision created to run the PlayStation studios.</p>



<h2 id="h-sony-s-structural-changes-at-sie">Sony’s Structural Changes At SIE</h2>



<ul>
<li>Hideaki Totoki has been promoted to CEO of Sony Corp.</li>



<li>Hideaki Nishino has been promoted to president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment. He also will hold his positions as CEO of the Platform Business Group.</li>



<li>Hermen Hulst is no longer co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment as a whole. He will remain as CEO of the Studio Business Group and will lead PlayStation Productions.</li>
</ul>



<p>The change represents the second major leadership change over the last year at SIE. Previously, the position of CEO was held by a single person, Jim Ryan, who retired after 30 years of service. With his departure, Sony announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-hires-two-new-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the position would be filled by two people</a>, the aforementioned Hulst and Nishino.</p>



<p>Now, the company has gone back on its decision, in a way. Another notable change was in the position of CEO of Sony Corp. Hideaki Totoki, a 38-year veteran of the company, will take over the position previously held by Kenichiro Yoshida. All of the above decisions were approved by the board and take effect on April 1st.</p>



<p>Totoki said the following:</p>



<p><em>“I am incredibly honored and humbled to have been entrusted with the important role of President and CEO,</em>” Totoki said. “<em>My predecessors as CEO, Kazuo Hirai and Kenichiro Yoshida, have greatly enhanced Sony’s value, and I will do my utmost to further build on this success and pass on an even better Sony to the next generation. At our Corporate Strategy Meeting in May of last year, we newly announced our `Creative Entertainment Vision,’ which outlines where we want Sony to be in 10 years, with our Purpose as the guiding principle. Our greatest driver in achieving this is the diversity of our businesses and people, which is part of Sony’s DNA, and our boundary spanners that transcend organizational barriers and organically connect that diversity to create new value. Together with our employees, creators, partners, and our new leadership team, I will work to create a bright future filled with a boundless sense of Kando (emotion).</em>”</p>



<p>Hideaki Nishino also commented on his promotion:</p>



<p>“<em>I am truly honored to take the helm at Sony Interactive Entertainment. Technology and creativity are two of our biggest strengths as we continue to focus on developing experiences that deliver entertainment for everyone. We will continue to grow the PlayStation community in new ways, such as IP expansion, while also delivering the best in technology innovation,</em>” Nishino said. “<em>I want to thank Hermen for his expertise and leadership as he continues his role as CEO, Studio Business Group. I am deeply grateful for the PlayStation community and their continued support and I am very excited for what the future holds,</em>“</p>

<p>After announcing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-makes-surprise-premier-season-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the end of Counter-Strike 2 Premier Season 1 last week</a>, Valve has officially started Season 2. Season 2 will not last nearly as long as Season 1, but CS2 players will have to contend with the highly anticipated map pool changes and the tweaks to rifles.</p>



<p>Get your buddies and get into the Premier queue, the newest season of Counter-Strike 2 is now live.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cs2-premier-season-2-patch-notes">CS2 Premier Season 2 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Now that CS2 Premier Season 2 has begun, the active duty map pool will introduce Train and sub out Vertigo. Train made its CS2 debut and its anticipated return to Counter-Strike back in November, with a number of layout changes, a fresh coat of paint, and even some satisfying rain effects. Vertigo had become increasingly unpopular amongst pro players, though because it’s so new there have been no selections of Train at top tier tournaments yet.</p>



<p>Two major changes to rifles are now live as well. The M4A4 has received a price reduction, dropping down to the $2900 price point that its counterpart the M4A1-S has. Both M4s have been popular amongst players, with some preferring the controlled spray of the silenced M4A1-S, while other prefer the damage and larger magazine of the M4A4. For now, cost will no longer weigh be a decider. The FAMAS now only costs $1,950, and it received an accuracy improvement.</p>



<p>Additionally, the AUG and the SG received an adjusted scope dot to “be more useable at range,” while the MP9, the MP5-SF, and the MP7 all received reduced crouching accuracy, making them less effective for long-range duels. The <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/news/updates#:~:text=UPDATES-,JANUARY%2028%2C%202025,-Counter%2DStrike%202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full patch notes</a> also include some minor changes to the UI and Train.</p>



<p>As for the Premier season itself, players that earned a CS Rating while playing in Season 1 will receive a commemorative with detailed season stats. To be eligible for a medal in Season 2, players will need to refresh their CS Rating by winning 10 Premier matches. Season 2 will end at the conclusion of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAST.tv Austin CS2 Major</a>.</p>
