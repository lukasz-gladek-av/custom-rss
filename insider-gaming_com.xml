            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Proposes 200 Job Cuts At Paris Headquarters]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/</link>
            <guid>1416454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> is already looking at cutting jobs, just days after its announced company-wide restructuring.</p>



<p>According to a new report, Ubisoft is proposing cutting up to 200 jobs at its Paris headquarters. These jobs would be filed under a Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) that allows employees to come to a “mutual termination agreement.”</p>



<p>Ubisoft currently employees 1,100 people at its Paris office.</p>







<p><strong>“In line with last week’s announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives, Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France,”</strong>&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft spokesperson said to IGN</a> on the matter. </p>



<p>Ubisoft says that this remains just a proposal at this point. A final decision can’t come until an agreement is made between the company and employees. It then has to be “validated by French authorities”.</p>



<p><strong>“The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide,”</strong> Ubisoft said.</p>







<p>It’s unclear exactly how many jobs could be lost across the entire company over the next two years. Based on past history, it wouldn’t be surprising to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see another 2,000 or more people</a> lose their jobs during that time span. </p>



<p>On January 21, Ubisoft announced that it was going through a company-wide restructure. These plans called for the cancelation of six games, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>. It also saw the company split into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five “creative houses”</a> that would oversee various Ubisoft franchises. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-trailer-leak-reveals-solos-squads/</link>
            <guid>1416388</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Headwinds, the first major ARC Raiders update of 2026, is set to drop tomorrow. It’ll introduce a new matchmaking option, a fresh player project, some hot new cosmetics, <strong>and </strong>probably a few new quests. Earlier today, the trailer for that update was ‘leaked’ early, with a Japanese Embark Studios social profile posting the short video ahead of whatever the intended drop time was.</p>



<p>The trailer was taken down, but not before users managed to capture the footage and circulate it on social media. Above all else, it reveals that a bizarre new ‘solos vs squads’ matchmaking option is coming into effect with Headwinds.</p>







<h2 id="h-headwinds-will-be-here-in-24-hours">Headwinds Will Be Here in 24 Hours</h2>



<p>Headwinds is an all-new update coming to ARC Raiders tomorrow. Embark Studios’ extraction adventure title suffered a little over the festive break with stagnation and some issues with cheaters and exploits, but now it’s all systems go. The team recently published a roadmap that covers four months of content, including tomorrow’s Headwinds update.</p>



<p>We’re not getting a new ARC Raiders map or large-scale enemy until <strong>April</strong>, but there’s still plenty on the way.</p>



<p>Per the ‘leaked’ trailer, we know that Headwinds is set to include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Solos vs Squads matchmaking mechanics</li>



<li>New map condition – Bird City</li>



<li>Project: ARC Trophy Display</li>



<li>New cosmetics: The Sandwalker set</li>
</ul>



<p>The first item on the list was previously known as the ‘LVL 40+ Matchmaking Option’, which left players wondering what that might look like. Nobody predicted it would be a solos vs squads mode, but it’s certainly a place for the most capable players to strut their stuff.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, we can imagine that Sandstorm will be an offensive map condition that forces players indoors, much like Cold Snap did, while the Sandwalker set will be themed very much <strong>on </strong>that condition.</p>



<p>The ARC Trophy Display project will give players something to aim for over the next few weeks. It’s likely a construct that pops up in your Raider Den that gives you the option to display literal trophies from the ARC enemies you slay outside Speranza.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> Direct of the year could be coming next week.</p>



<p>In his latest video on Monday, known insider NateTheHate spoke about when Nintendo fans should expect the first full Nintendo Direct showcase. </p>







<p><strong>“From what I have been told, the first Direct of 2026 will be held during the opening week of February,”</strong> he said. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He then said</a> that the expectation is that the show will take place on Thursday, February 5.</p>



<p>While he mentions next week as being the time, NateTheHate did leave it a bit open. He said that that he had yet to confirm the information with his “best contacts just yet”. Should he have to give an update or amend anything, he says, he’ll do it on social media when he can. </p>







<p>He added that he didn’t know the type of Nintendo Direct it would be, nor did he mention any possible games. </p>



<p><strong>“While I hope it will be a general direct so Nintendo can really start the year with strong momentum—begin to detail some of those brand new first party games coming out in 2026, let us know what they have planned for The Legend of Zelda’s 40th anniversary—it could just as easily be a partner showcase,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>As with all rumors, please take this information on the Nintendo Direct with a grain of salt until it’s been independently verified by Insider Gaming or confirmed by Nintendo.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Nintendo isn’t leaving fans waiting too long for some news regarding its games. The company announced on Monday that it was holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomodachi-life-nintendo-direct-arriving-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomodachi Life-specific Direct</a> on January 29.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is YAPYAP on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-playstation-xbox-nintendo-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>1416319</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re starting to get into the meat of 2026, and everyone is looking forward to seeing what games appear out of nowhere to suddenly steal hearts (and player counts from other games). YAPYAP could be that, and if you’re a console player desperate to play it, let’s check its PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo status for you.</p>



<p>Everything about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-official-release-date-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAPYAP</a> screams success. One thing to shout home about is that it’s coming to Steam and PC, that’s almost a given. If you’re looking for clarification about its console platforms, then come quietly.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-yapyap-on-ps5-consoles">Can You Play YAPYAP On PS5 Consoles?</h2>

<p><strong>YAPYAP is not on the agenda for PlayStation 5 owners, nor any PS4 players who haven’t upgraded yet.</strong></p>



<p>It appears as if YAPYAP is staying the course on PC for now. The game can be purchased through Steam—more details about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-cost-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAPYAP’s price here</a>—and there will be no yelling down PS5 microphones for the time being.</p>



<p>As with all Steam games, if there’s a strong demand, it could come to PS5. It also depends on the developer and publisher, too. You only have to look at Content Warning as the perfect subject here.</p>



<p>Whereas games like Lethal Company and REPO—which are arguably more popular—have opted against a console release for the time being, Landfall is bringing Content Warning to console. It’s another of the recent ‘Friendslop’ trend, and should be a hit party game on console.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-yapyap-on-xbox-series-x-s-consoles">Can You Play YAPYAP On Xbox Series X|S Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>There will be no Xbox Series X|S console launch for YAPYAP either.</strong></p>



<p>The Xbox and PC link has been a popular one for many years. However, there’s still an element of separation where certain game releases are concerned, in this case, low-budget indie Steam titles.</p>



<p>YAPYAP has plenty of appeal and could be perfect for Xbox owners. If you want to play it with your friends and use knock-off Wingardium Leviosa spells to annoy them, you need a PC and Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-yapyap-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2-consoles">Can You Play YAPYAP On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All quiet on this front. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nintendo consoles commonly get a lot of low-key indie titles and third-party releases, but you won’t find YAPYAP on either the Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 anytime soon.</strong></p>



<p>The Switch 2’s stunning 4K, HDR, 120 FPS screen and setup won’t have you flying around YAPYAP. It’s a full-scale Steam release for YAPYAP, and there have been no messages or signals of intent to bring it to consoles yet.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates, and keep checking back in case it does get a console port down the line.</p>







<p>Have you not been able to shut your traptrap about YAPYAP? It does look fun. Whether you played the demo or like the look of it, discuss YAPYAP via the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
