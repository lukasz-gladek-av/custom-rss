<p>It appears as though future content for Mortal Kombat 1 is ending after Kombat Pack 2 wraps up. According to new claims, developer NetherRealm Studios has cancelled DLC plans for a Kombat Pack 3 and second story expansion for Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>Known Mortal Kombat 1 leaker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mortalkombatleaks/comments/1h0c1lo/comment/lz2xyr9/?share_id=xUcvJ-sw8qJXVkTAM75be&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FateUnknown posted</a> on Reddit that the cancellations happened recently after the Khaos Reigns expansion sold poorly.</p>



<p>It’s not all bad for Mortal Kombat 1 fans as there are still characters from Kombat Pack 2 to join the roster such as Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2. FateUnknown also said that its possible a “kameo or two” make it to the game due to work that had already been done on them but he “didn’t know yet”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetherRealm Studios for comment on the claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated.</p>



<p>Recently, Warner Bros. showed commitment to the Mortal Kombat series  when CEO David Zaslav said that future game development efforts was going to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focused on its core franchises</a> with Mortal Kombat being listed among them. Series head Ed Boon has already said, as well, that NetherRealm had been working on its next game even before Mortal Kombat 1 was released.</p>

<p>NetEase Games should be celebrating Marvel Rivals’ impending launch, instead, the Chinese company has been left reeling following the dramatic arrest of several key officials in the company due to a money laundering controversy.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals could be the shooter to break the online multiplayer dominance of other shooters: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a>, Fortnite, Overwatch, and Apex Legends (amongst others.) Other newcomers—such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadlock-was-the-top-game-on-steam-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadlock</a>—are doing their best to make an impact, but Marvel Rivals’ superhero star power has the potential to supersede all.</p>



<p>Money laundering, arrests, and an intense investigation and scrutiny were likely not on the Marvel Rivals bingo card though. If you’re confused, it’s understandable—so let’s explain all.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-money-laundering-controversy-explained">Marvel Rivals Money Laundering Controversy—Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An explosive situation. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Marvel Rivals money laundering Controversy potentially involves <strong>several high-ranking NetEase officials who have been arrested due to allegations of money laundering amounting to potentially $300 million</strong>.</p>



<p>I appreciate this is a lot to take in, so let’s start from the top. The original story was broken by Chinese outlet <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Leifeng</a>, and on Nov. 7, 2024, the <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/category/industrynews/D1r2qIXu83HaLD5q.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">translated exclusive</a> said this, “Multiple sources said that Xiang Lang, the GM (general manager) of NetEase Games in charge of marketing, was taken away by NetEase’s internal integrity department for investigation, and it is said that the police have intervened, and the specific case is under investigation.”</p>



<p>The story continues and reports the potentially laundered amount equates to <strong>Two Billion Yuan</strong>—or <strong>$275,800,000</strong>, as of writing. It does go on to say the full amount is actually closer to <strong>800 Million to 1 Billion Yuan</strong>—making the final amount in the region of <strong>$111.4 million to $139.3 million</strong>.</p>



<p>Leifeng also says Xiang Lang—the general manager of NetEase—was taken away by NetEase’s internal integrity department for investigation, and it is said the <strong>police have intervened, and the specific case is under investigation</strong>.” The money laundered reportedly affects up to <strong>28 companies</strong>, and the investigation is set to continue.</p>



<p>If you’re worried this affects Marvel Rivals, you can put those doubts to rest. Despite the ongoing controversy, Marvel Rivals is still gearing up for its Dec. 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>, and production on the shooter seems to be unaffected. Whatever is going on behind the scenes at NetEase, we can put these alleged business indiscretions to one side, and look forward to a fully fledged superhero title in the Marvel universe.</p>



<hr>

<p>Donkey Kong Land 2 is the latest Game Boy title <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1861215895873298613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now playable</a> through the Nintendo Switch Online membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Land 2 is a platformer released for Nintendo Game Boy in 1996. It is a sequel to Donkey Kong Land, sometimes called Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong’s Quest. This game features Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong as the playable characters, both with different gameplay mechanics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game’s main characters have different movement systems, and players can control only one at a time. With Diddy Kong, players will be able to ride train tracks, cartwheel their enemies and swing on grappling hooks. On the other hand, Dixie Kong can float in the air using her Helicopter Spin and throw barrels at enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The end goal of Donkey Kong Land 2 is saving Donkey Kong from K. Rool, and players must go through 40 levels filled with traps, collectables, Kremlings, barrels, and bananas to do that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2K has announced a ‘Complete Sunset’ of their launcher, removing it from every Epic Games Store and Steam game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sunset of the 2K Launcher was <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9YXRZ3YFJBHS1QPZ5DP40N" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> on November 18; however, a follow-up update on November 25 led to its complete removal from Steam. The “2K Launcher Beta” created for Sid Meier’s Civilization V was also removed. Players will see that their 2KLauncher folder has been turned into a text file called 2kLauncherRemoved.tx, which can now be deleted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players might still find the 2K Launcher pop-up even after this update, and there are some troubleshooting procedures that they can follow to remove it entirely. The first method is closing and reopening Steam completely. Next, rebooting the PC is always a good idea. Also, for Epic Games, you will need the game to be updated to its most recent version. Check out this <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/32209414429203--2K-Launcher-Removing-2K-Launcher-Files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">guide</a> to learn how to remove all the additional launcher files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After 2K Launcher’s shutdown, games like Bioshock Remastered, Bioshock 2 Remastered, Bioshock Infinite, The Quarry, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns will launch directly when you click Play. Other games like Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, Civilisation V, and more will use Steam and Epic’s launchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a new PGA Tour 2K game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been confirmed for 2025</a>.
