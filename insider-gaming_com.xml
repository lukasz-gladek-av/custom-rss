<p>Bungie has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released an official</a> update on the status of Marathon. The update came in the form of a nearly 10-minute long video on the game’s official YouTube channel.</p>



<p>In the video, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-replaces-marathon-game-director-with-former-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Director Joe Ziegler</a> gives an update on what’s been worked on since the last update on Marathon. He covers the direction of the game as well as plans for future updates about the game.</p>



<p>The update also doesn’t include any look at official gameplay, but does come with some concept art for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/">few of the game’s heroes</a>. If you want to watch the video for yourself, you can below.</p>



<p>As far as what was covered, Ziegler discusses the game being an extraction shooter, including diving into to what an extraction shooter is for those who may be unfamiliar with the subgenre. Ziegler also talks about taking elements from the original Marathon and expanding them for a new game with a modern audience. </p>



<p>“We’re taking a lot of familiar elements, especially a lot of the mysterious and kind of eeriness and the — how do I put it —  the psychological kind of the entire IP as it exists before,” he said. </p>



<p>“But we’re layering on some elements that we think really help modernize it, and also bring it to a new story and new world that we can sort of continue to update and delight all of you with over the course of time.”</p>



<p>Regarding how the game’s been changing during development and where things currently stand, Ziegler says that changes to the game have been “aggressive” for the past couple years along with holding multiple playtests.</p>



<p>“We’ve been testing with a lot of players,” he said. “A lot of players like yourself, also with creators. It’s sort of insanely awesome and I’m filled with gratitude when I think about it because there’s so many people who contributed by telling us, ‘Hey, this thing sucks’ or ‘This thing’s great’.”</p>



<p>He then added that there are a number of things within the game that are at different states of development. Things like the game’s environments are in a more complete state while the character models continue to be iterated through.  Marathon’s enemy models, he said, are “still kind of a little bit in an early state.”</p>



<p>Back to the characters, Ziegler gave a sneak peak at a couple of the characters in development: a runner codenamed Thief and one codenamed Stealth..</p>



<p>Ziegler then wrapped up the video stating that more content reveals are coming in 2025 for Marathon. Also coming in 2025 will be an expansion of Bungie’s playtests for Marathon to include more players. There was no hint as to when that would happen, however.</p>



<p>As far as an official release date update, that information wasn’t provided.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surprise-surprise-%E2%80%93-nuketown-24-7-is-coming-to-black-ops-6.1021269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-24-7-playlist-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s a given at this point; an expectation that we all foster when a new Call of Duty title launches. It’s axiomatic: within a matter of days following the release of a new game, there <strong>will be </strong>a 24/7 playlist. On November 1, Nuketown lands in Black Ops 6 – and dataminers have found that when it does, a 24/7 playlist for the map will go live.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-written-in-the-stars">Written in the Stars</h2>



<p>On Twitter, ‘SemtexLeaks’ uncovered a reference to a Nuketown 24/7 playlist in Black Ops 6, which will assumedly arrive when the map is added to the public pool on November 1. That means that players far and wide will be spending hours grinding the iconic, small-form map – just as our Call of Duty masters intended.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This year’s Nuketown is a ‘reimagining’ of the original map that surfaced in 2010, and by all accounts, it looks fantastic while at the same time retaining the familiar feel of the decade-and-a-bit-old environment that has re-appeared in every Black Ops game.</p>



<p>From the code uncovered in the game’s files, Nuketown 24/7 will feature a rotation of Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, Domination, Hardpoint, and Kill Order. Except for Kill Order, which is new for Black Ops 6, this is a fairly standard rotation that players have come to expect from Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>Most of the maps in Black Ops 6 have proven to be troublesome for one reason or another, so perhaps the familiarity of Nuketown will give some players a feeling of comfort after this first week of struggling.</p>



<p>Will you be jumping into Nuketown 24/7 when it drops on November 1? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Are you excited about Berlin’s VCT Game Changers Championship? The relatively new tournament series has become increasingly popular among Valorant fans. The co-ed series features both women and male players from various esports organizations. Here is the upcoming VCT Game Changers Championship format being used.</p>



<h2 id="h-berlin-s-vct-game-changers-championship-format">Berlin’s VCT Game Changers Championship Format</h2>



<p>The popular event will feature some of the best Valorant players in the world facing off against each other in Berlin. However, no official prize pool has been announced.</p>



<p>Still, fans are gearing up for a legendary event to see who takes home the 2024 Game Changers Championship title.</p>



<p>So, what about the format? Well, Riot Games just released the tournament format today on Twitter, let’s break it down:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>10 Teams Competing</strong></li>



<li><strong>Double-Elimination</strong></li>



<li><strong>Best-of-3 Brackets</strong></li>



<li><strong>Top Seeds From NA and EMEA Will Get a Buy Into 2nd Round</strong></li>



<li><strong>Final Matches: Best-of-5</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The series will feature competitors from the following regions of the world:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>North America</strong></li>



<li><strong>Latin America</strong></li>



<li><strong>EMEA</strong></li>



<li><strong>China</strong></li>



<li><strong>APAC</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brazil</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Grand Finals will be streamed live on the <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/status/1850930070640324947">official Valorant Twitch.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-tournament-dates">Tournament Dates</h2>



<p>Here are the official VCT Game Changers Championship dates:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>November 8 – 17, 2024.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The tournament series is meant to give Valorant fans and competitors the gaming action they need during the official VCT off-season. The actual VCT season ended in South Korea back in August of 2024 when EDward Gaming was awarded first place.</p>



<p>Luckily, Valorant understands that waiting until 2025 for more competitive Valorant action will not go over well with fans and players. </p>



<p>But what about the teams competing? Here is a list of every esports team playing in the 2024 VCT Game Changers Championship:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>G2 Gozen</strong></li>

<p>Quickscoping is an incredibly popular playstyle in Call of Duty, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a> players are already testing out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snipers</a> to see which gun provides the fast ADS speeds and one-shot capabilities. </p>



<p>If you’re looking for the best quickscoping Sniper loadout in Black Ops 6, look no further, as we have all the attachments, Perks, and Equipment you’ll need to build an accurate and fast one-shot class setup.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-quickscoping-sniper-in-black-ops-6">Best quickscoping Sniper in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-lw3a1-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LW3A1 Frostline</a> is the best Sniper for quickscoping in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> due to its fast mobility and handling. It’s a bolt-action Sniper  Rifle, so it requires an accurate shot, which is extremely satisfying when it hits. It will one-shot enemies to the head, upper chest, and upper arms, so you’ll need to retain accuracy while quickscoping in order to drop enemies quickly.</p>



<p>The SVD may have better handling and mobility, however, it’s a semi-auto rifle, which means it lacks one-shot capabilities, making it a worse option.</p>



<h3 id="h-is-the-lw3a1-frostline-better-than-the-lr-7-62">Is the LW3A1 Frostline better than the LR 7.62?</h3>



<p>The LW3A1 is better for quickscoping, but the LR 7.62 is the best Sniper in terms of damage and one-shot kill consistency. </p>



<p>The LR 7.62 will drop an enemy in one bullet so long as you hit the arms, chest, or head. The Frostline is less forgiving, as you need to hit the upper chest and arms to secure a one-shot kill. That said, the LR 7.62 is slower and has worse handling, so as far as quickscoping goes, I prefer the fast and weightless feel of the LW3A1.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-attachments-for-quickscoping-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments for quickscoping in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Short Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Comb: </strong>Commando Riser</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Laser: </strong>Target Laser</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong> 7.62 Nato FMJ</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Short Barrel </strong>provides a boost to the jumping aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds, which I found incredibly useful with Ominimovement in Black Ops 6, as you’ll often find yourself jumping around to avoid bullets and hit shots.</p>



<p>To increase aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds, the <strong>Commando Riser </strong>Comb is a great choice, while the <strong>Combat Stock</strong> provides some flinch resistance and aim walking movement speed.</p>



<p>Arguably the most important attachment for quickscoping in Black Ops 6 is the <strong>Target Laser</strong>, which drastically reduces aiming idle sway and improves your aim walking steadiness. This means that when you aim in, your aim will be more accurate to where your crosshairs were before aiming down sight, leading to more accurate quickscopes.</p>



<p>Lastly, to add some flair to your shots, the <strong>7.62 Nato FMJ </strong>Fire Mod will allow you to hit wallbangs with an improvement to penetration damage.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-perks-for-quickscoping">Best Perks for quickscoping</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong> Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong> Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Cold Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong> Overkill</li>
</ul>



<p>For the best quickscoping loadout in Black Ops 6, you’ll want <strong>Ghost</strong> to keep you off the enemy radar, <strong>Forward Intel </strong>for more information on the enemy team’s position, and <strong>Cold Blooded</strong> to avoid enemy scorestreaks. These combine to give you the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong> too, which will reveal enemies through walls when you spawn, giving you a good idea of where to set up.</p>



<p>As for the Wildcard, <strong>Overkill</strong> is the best option, as you can then run an SMG like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-c9-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C9</a> or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ksv-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KSV</a> as your Secondary to cover those close-range engagements. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-equipment-to-use-with-sniper">Best Equipment to use with Sniper</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tactical:</strong> Concussion</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong> Combat Axe</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong> Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>The Concussion is perfect for breaching rooms and stopping enemies from pushing you while you have a Sniper out. It also gives you the time you need to quickscope an enemy while they’re hunting you down, stunning them in their tracks. The Combat Axe is a classic and it should be on every Sniper loadout just for style points. It’s not the easiest to hit, but once you master the COmbat Axe, it can be very useful tool for close-range engagements.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Field Upgrade, whenever you’re set up in a nice spot on any of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a>, you’ll want to cover yourself to prevent any flanker from shooting you in the back, so the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> is a great pick.</p>
