<p>Pokémon collectors around the world may have just started their recovery following the release of Phantasmal Flames, but there is no time to rest as the next TCG set is on the horizon—and it’s going to be a master set nightmare.</p>



<p>Mega Dream ex releases in Japan on November 28, with the English version of the set, Ascended Heroes, due to release at the back-end of January 2026, and it’s going to be problematic for those who want to catch ’em all.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Variety of types. Images via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ahead of the Japanese release, teasers for Mega Dream ex have started to emerge on social media, showcasing eye-catching cards that are going to jump straight to the summit of collectors’ want-lists, including a stunning Psyduck Art Rare.</p>



<p>Other details of the set, reported by the likes of <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/11/mega-dream-ex-special-set-officially-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokebeach</a>, have revealed several types of reverse holo cards will be in packs, with reveals showing various Pokéball designs and reverse holos reflecting a Pokémon’s type.</p>



<p>Additionally, Team Rocket’s Pokémon return in the set and will have an exclusive type of reverse holo featuring the Team Rocket logo, which puts the total of different types of reverse holo in the set to three—and that’s before the inevitable Master Ball holo is also revealed.</p>



<p>The finer details of the reverse holos are yet to be detailed, specifically how many types each card in the set will have, and it remains to be seen whether the English version of the set follows suit.</p>







<p>A precedent has been set with the release of Black Bolt and White Flare earlier this year, however, which introduced Pokéball and Master Ball reverse holos for the first time in the language.</p>



<p>Given how difficult it has become to get hands on Pokémon TCG products, the potential of various types of reverse holos to collect may give collectors a headache.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-map-visit-25-million/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders%E2%80%99-new-map-has-been-visited-over-25-million-times.1357783/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last week, Embark Studios released the North Line update for ARC Raiders, the electrifying new extraction shooter. This update introduced the Stella Montis map, an intense facility carved into a mountainside high above all the other maps.</p>



<p>Despite being a PvP haven and a massive threat that features the new deadly ARC enemy, the Shredder, Stella Montis has been visited ‘over 25 million’ times.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-players-love-stella-montis">ARC Raiders Players Love Stella Montis</h2>



<p>Stella Montis is a stark contrast to the other maps in ARC Raiders, simply because it’s all internal and highly scientific. It’s not representative of the ruined world that sits in the Rust Belt, reflected in the likes of Blue Gate and Buried City. Instead, Stella Montis is a harsh, industrial, clinical environment with tight corridors, multiple levels, and plenty of PvP opportunities.</p>



<p>In a recent graphic published by Embark Studios, it was revealed that the new map has been visited more than 25 million times. It’s a fan favorite where PvP is concerned, so that’s most likely what the majority of those visits were for. There are also some new quests on Stella Montis that need to be completed, as well as stacks of loot <strong>unique </strong>to that map.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Elsewhere in the numbers, we learned that a whopping 26,923 Matriarch enemies have been eliminated, and a whopping 2.2 million Raiders (including myself) have been knocked down by the Shredder, the <strong>newest </strong>minor ARC enemy.</p>



<p>It’s small but extremely mighty.</p>



<p>Additionally, 37,218 Raiders managed to down themselves with the Deadline, the new hyper-powerful mine added with the North Line update, and a further 117 downed themselves with… rocks.</p>







<p>That’s right – <strong>rocks</strong>. Embark has no idea how they did that either.</p>



<p>What’s your fondest moment from Stella Montis? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> how you’re enjoying the map.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The journey in Pokémon Legends: Z-A is not yet over, with additional content coming in the Mega Dimension DLC, and we’ve got all the release date details you need.</p>



<p>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A is bringing a bunch of returning Pokémon to the game, alongside a new story to uncover and new legends to hunt down, expanding on the hours of content the game already has to offer.</p>



<p>If you can’t wait for the release date of Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s Mega Dimension DLC and want to know what time it will be available, we have all the details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Jump in. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A will be released on December 10, bringing a host of new content to the game.</strong></p>



<p>The paid-for DLC, which was initially announced before the game’s launch, and the full release date were announced earlier this month alongside a new trailer.</p>



<p>In the Mega Dimension DLC, a new adventure across a weird zone known as Hyperspace Lumiose beckons, with new Mega Evolution Pokémon to discover, including two Mega Raichu forms, and battles against powerful Pokémon that exceed the level 100 cap for the first time in the franchise’s history.</p>







<p><strong>The official start time for the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC has not been announced. However, based on past DLCs on Nintendo Switch platforms, we’ve got a fairly solid estimate.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike the main releases of Legends: Z-A, which had a staggered release globally, the Mega Dimension DLC will be released simultaneously worldwide, meaning you won’t be able to take advantage of a New Zealand or Australian Nintendo account to jump in early.</p>



<p>Based on previous DLC releases on Switch consoles, including Scarlet and Violet’s The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk, we expect the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC to be available from 8 PM PT on December 9. </p>



<p>These times are not confirmed, however, and we’ll update this article accordingly if Pokémon provides an official release time.</p>



<p>The table below shows the expected start time for the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Mega Dimension DLC Expected Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 AM – Dec. 10</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – Dec. 10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steams-highest-peak-player-count-game-of-2025-might-surprise-you/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam%E2%80%99s-highest-peak-player-count-game-of-2025-might-surprise-you.1357756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We can picture it now: You’ve come into this news story all guns blazing, thinking you’ve cracked it. Steam is one of the biggest and most consistent metrics for measuring player numbers, but the platform’s biggest peak game of 2025 shocked us a bit.</p>



<p>What another incredible year for gaming releases. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> proves once again that it’s the king (Queen, in this case) of roguelikes, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a game for the ages, and the list honestly goes on. But everyone is always amped up by a game’s first week of release and what its peak player count is—using it as a barometer for success.</p>



<p>Pretty much every major release of 2025 has happened now, and Steam’s highest-peak game might raise an eyebrow or two.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-has-the-highest-steam-peak-of-any-new-2025-game">Monster Hunter Wilds Has The Highest Steam Peak Of Any New 2025 Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption> Wild(s). Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Capcom takes the crown for a new game with the highest Steam peak in 2025! Monster Hunter Wilds continued its mainstream success spectacularly in 2025. The action game reached an all-time peak of 1,384,608, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>To put this into context, this is the fifth-highest peak in Steam history!</p>



<p>Another incredible fact is that one of the games you’d think might have been the peak game barely managed half of Wilds’ total—Battlefield 6. The return of EA’s shooter has blown everyone away, and we’d argue it’s taken the crown as the shooter of 2025: We can hear angry ARC Raiders fans sharpening tools in the background.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s highest Steam peak is <strong>747,440</strong>, and other big games in 2025 haven’t fared too badly either: Hollow Knight: Silksong hit <strong>587,150</strong>, ARC Raiders stole <strong>481,966</strong> of you at once, and even indie hit Schedule 1 cooked up an impressive <strong>459,075</strong> players.</p>



<p>Nothing even got close to 1 million, but Monster Hunter Wilds shrugged off the challenge in style. It is also still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-still-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025’s best-selling game</a>, which probably helps.</p>

The usual grinding route will not only drain countless hours but also slow down your overall progress. That’s when the active <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-anime-infinity-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Ants Empire codes appear in the form of a useful crosscut.

<p>Hytale was the once-canceled dream that is now fully back in development. A new, lengthy gameplay trailer has been released, not only showing more of the game, but also saying that early access is on the horizon.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games shut down Hypixel Studios</a> in June 2025, effectively ceasing Hytale’s development. It was showing a lot of promise, but the game—based on the Minecraft&nbsp;multiplayer server&nbsp;Hypixel—suddenly went up in smoke. The dream was revived in November 2025, and to show that the game is back, a new gameplay trailer is out.</p>

<p>We reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was back after being reacquired by Hypixel Studios</a>—rebought by founder Simon “Hypixel” Collins-Laflamme. The new ‘Breaking the Curse’ gameplay trailer shows off 16 minutes of pixel-perfect gameplay.</p>



<p>It has sword and shield action, combat rolling, exploration, tree chopping, dark and spooky forests, and everything you’re likely looking for.</p>



<p>Check out the full 16 minutes of Hytale gameplay right here.</p>

<p>We checked the video’s description to look for any extra action or developments. Our pixelated jaws dropped when we read: “This is the original legacy engine from the 2018 trailer, running on a four-year-old build as we push Hytale forward again. There’s a long road ahead, <strong>but early access is coming soon.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s vague, which is understandable considering how fast this is all happening, but it offers assurances that Hytale is moving in the right direction.</p>



<p>Founder Simon also added this to the Hytale gameplay video:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I promised players videos, screenshots and blog posts. One day after the acquisition, I’m keeping that promise. Now that you’ve seen the first gameplay footage in a long time, I’m heading back to work on the early access launch. The team will share more clips and screenshots as we go. It mattered to me to release raw footage today so we break the curse once and for all.”</p>
</blockquote>
