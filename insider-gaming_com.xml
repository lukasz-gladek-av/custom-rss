<p>Marvel Rivals was released yesterday, and it wasted no time skyrocketing up the charts with reckless abandon. On Steam, the game managed to secure a whopping peak player count of 444,000 users, marking the game as one of the most successful free-to-play titles on the platform right off the rip.</p>



<p>That performance continued throughout the day, and going into the weekend, player numbers, streaming figures, and the social sentiment around the game continued to grow heading into the weekend.</p>

<h2 id="h-marvel-rivalling-blizzard">Marvel Rivalling Blizzard</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is perhaps the most potent Overwatch competitor to ever surface – considering Deadlock isn’t here yet, anyway.</p>



<p>In this superhero-themed title, players are treated to the classic hero shooter elements found in and arguably popularised by Overwatch, but the entire roster is made up of instantly recognisable Marvel heroes. From Iron Man to The Punisher and from Groot to Storm, there’s a veritable plethora of performers for players to assume control of.</p>



<p>I <strong>hate </strong>hero shooters, but I’m pleased to say that, being a Marvel fan, Rivals has me hooked.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky year for live-service shooters, what with the loss of Concord and the impending shutdown of XDefiant, so it’s enriching to see a similar title emerge with such gusto into the gaming space.</p>



<p>The reviews <strong>could be better</strong>, but most of the negative press seems centred around Marvel Rivals not doing enough to distance itself from Overwatch, but that’s kind of the point of the game. It’s an alternative option and a competitor – it’d be tough to replace Overwatch if it wasn’t a lick like the game.</p>



<p>NetEase, the developer behind Marvel Rivals, has already revealed some innovative features that are going to help the game stand out. For instance, just days ago, the team stressed that season-based battle passes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-mechanic-change-monetisation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be time-bound</a>, so you’ll be able to unlock missed rewards long after the season has ended.</p>

<p>Myth returned to Twitch recently, with audiences welcoming him back after a lengthy hiatus. It was his first stream on the platform since June 2022, and it saw the popular content creator play Fortnite as OG was ushered back into the game.</p>



<p>His return to the site wasn’t the most successful resurfacing ever, with Myth netting a peak viewer count of just 19,500, prompting many to suggest he’s forever his profile on the platform. He did take the time to reveal why he was away for so long, though – and it’s because he was securing a bag from YouTube, of course.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-bucks">Big Bucks</h2>



<p>Myth confirmed mid-stream that YouTube paid him $4 million for two years of work on the platform. That’s alongside all the paid subscriptions and donations he’d have earned while streaming on the site. </p>



<p>To put that into perspective, xQc signed a $100 million deal to stream on Kick.com.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Since 2022, Myth has been exclusive to YouTube, on which he currently boasts a whopping 4.5 million subscribers.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many will say that Myth has ‘fallen off’ over the last year. In August, he announced he would be taking a lengthy break from streaming, and it was only yesterday that he resurfaced. In this game, you can become irrelevant <strong>very </strong>quickly, and plenty claim that the pause in producing content left a mark.</p>



<p>Back in February, the streamer was broadcasting to little more than 100 viewers, prompting fans to surmise what could be wrong behind the scenes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/otvandfriendsrumors/comments/1ah5i3r/seeing_myth_stream_to_193_viewers_yesterday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">platforms like Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty League 2025 season is finally here. Last night, the first round of matches kicked off, but in typically COD League fashion, the evening was marred by technical issues and shattered expectations. Only one match out of four went as predicted, with some huge upsets being dealt very early on.</p>



<p>This opening night could have set the tone for the tournament ahead, but it’s just bizarre to make a statement like that at this point.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-upset">Big Upset</h2>



<p>The season’s opening match saw the all-new Guerrillas M8 take on Minnesota Rokkr, which also boasted a refreshed roster. It went down to the wire, but Rokkr unexpectedly secured the finish in the eleventh round of the final game of Search.</p>



<p>Thanks to Guerrillas M8’s new roster, bolstered by three world champions, the predictions were in favour of the squad. It was far too close a match for those expectations to be delivered on, though.</p>



<p>That trend continued throughout the evening.</p>



<p>Boston Breach dominated OpTic Texas, the COD League’s reigning champion. That marks four years in a row that OpTic has lost its opening fixture in a new CDL season.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Toronto Ultra decimated Atlanta FaZe, the forever favourite. The only match that went as expected was Vegas Falcons vs. Carolina Royal Ravens. That was a 1 – 3 scoreline in favour of the Ravens, which everyone saw coming a mile off.</p>



<p>Before the evening could commence, the CDL 2025 season had to undergo a few technical issues, which is typical for the League. The first match was 20 minutes late starting, and when it was halfway through the first round of Search, the lobby froze, kicking everyone out.</p>



<p>There are plenty more matches yet to land this weekend, but we could be seeing something of a paradigm shift unfolding this year.</p>

<p>Deck Nine Games, the developers of Life is Stange: Double Exposure as well as other Life is Strange games, have announced that it is laying off more staff. It’s the second time this year Deck Nine has held layoffs.</p>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/DeckNineGames/status/1865138496601575468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> late Friday afternoon, CEO Mark Lyons said he was “sad to share” the latest developments happening at the Colorado-based studio.</p>







<p>“Today, we are sad to share the news that we must say goodbye to some of our talented team members,” he said. “This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing. We are extremely grateful to every individual who has dedicated their hard work, passion and commitment to making transformative entertainment with us.”</p>



<p>He continued: “To those of you leaving the studio due to these changes, thank you for sharing your talents with us. We are proud of what we were able to accomplish together and we are committed to supporting you in this transition in any way we can. To the community, we ask for your support and understanding during this difficult time.”</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a>&nbsp;lost across 175+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000. Earlier this week, it was announced that nearly 300 people at Ubisoft were being let go as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio shuts down XDefiant</a>.</p>
