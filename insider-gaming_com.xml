<p>SEGA’s unwavering commitment to the Yazkuza/Like a Dragon series shows no signs of stopping. Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is the newest release—arriving quite soon after Infinite Wealth—and we’ve put together an all-in-one guide to its key details.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-gets-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> is a new, fully-fledged Like a Dragon game. It’s one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2025-is-the-year-of-the-rpg-upcoming-rpg-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025’s biggest RPGs</a> and Goro Majima is the leading man again as we journey through the franchise’s bizarre new direction. If you thought 2024’s Infinite Wealth was starting to get wacky with its foray into Hawaii, you’ve seen nothing yet.</p>



<p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii gives overboard on the pirate theme. It looks to be the most swashbuckling entry in the series’ illustrious history and looks to be a cutlass above the rest.</p>

<p><strong>February 21 is the release date for Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not sure how developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has managed this, but the predecessor Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth was released on Jan. 26, 2024. This means it’s only a <strong>13-month turnaround for the sequel</strong> to happen.</p>



<p>Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii isn’t going to be a 100+ hour marathon like many Yakuza games, however, expect to spend a good chunk of time roaming around Hawaii—pillaging and pirating.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch is the only major platform missing out as it stands. The power of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-nintendo-switch-2-direct-reveal-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> might mean a future port isn’t out of the question though.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers are going back on their decision of rank resets for the second half of the first season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals recently released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-detail-season-and-half-season-ranks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer update</a> for the second half of the upcoming season. In it, we learned about the release date, forthcoming changes, and a rank reset that drops players by four divisions. This worried many players, as they would have to drop four ranks now and another six ranks when the second season begins. Naturally, there was a huge uproar, and due to the massive feedback, Netease decided to reverse the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from Marvel Rivals delves deeper into the concerns around rank reset. NetEase understands that a rank drop every half-season will make the “competitive mode less enjoyable” for the community. Hence, rather than a rank reset, players must “complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet the relevant conditions by the end of the season” to earn new rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rewards for the end of the second half will be the same as those they just received. Players will be eligible to earn “a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.” The Marvel Rivals community is <a href="https://x.com/Valennxxte/status/1889209660822970688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">happy</a> their concerns received a swift response from the devs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals has its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-section-disney-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own section on Disney Plus</a>. Also, Ninja thinks NetEase’s new game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-dead-ninja-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has killed Overwatch</a>.
