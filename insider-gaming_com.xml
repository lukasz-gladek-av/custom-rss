<p>After the skin briefly appeared during the Marvel Rivals early access tests, the beloved Spider-Man Spider-Punk suit is arriving to the store on March 20th. The skin has received a tune-up featuring some rocking new audio effects, meaning you‚Äôll want headphones on to fully appreciate it.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals confirmed today that Spider-Man‚Äôs Spider-Punk 2099 suit will make its official debut on March 20th at 2:00 UTC. The skin was one of a few that were playable during the early access tests for the game, such as the President Loki skin just recently officially released. The Spider-Punk character first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man comic series in 2015, and a version of them appeared in the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse film.</p>



<p>The Spider-Punk 2099 suit will, naturally, be sold as a bundle that will include a suit-specific emote and MVP screen. The bundle will likely include a spray and a player card as well. It will hit the store at the same time as another skin that originally debuted during the closed tests: Iron Man‚Äôs Steam Power suit. According to Marvel Rivals insider Miller Ross, the bundle will <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1902374511829512306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost</a> 2,200 store units.</p>

<p>Unlike the Spider-Punk 2099 suit that was playable during the closed test, the soon-to-be-released official version appears to include a handful of electric guitar licks and riffs accompanying Spider-Man‚Äôs attacks and abilities. Skins have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major focal point in Marvel Rivals‚Äô ability to generate massive amounts of revenue</a>. However, some fans are already expressing irritation that some heroes are getting favorable treatment. Spider-Man is getting their second Legendary skin, but heroes like Squirrel Girl, Black Panther, Groot, and several others have yet to receive one.</p>
