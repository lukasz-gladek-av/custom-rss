<p>Like General Khazan and the power of the Blade Phantom, you are likely to form a strong connection to The First Berserker Khazan Trophy List. It features a tough and unenviable test of Trophies and Achievements.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> has the makings of a great action game. Khazan’s assortment of reality-defying powers mesh well with the environments and their rich color palette. The action looks intense, and some might say contains a lot of <em>soul</em>. If you’re keen on The First Berserker Khazan, you might want to consider acquiring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>—although you might need to know its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-pc-system-requirements-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC requirements</a> first.</p>



<p>Once you’ve confirmed your ticket for the carnage of Khazan, you should check out the complete Trophy List.</p>



<p><strong>*This is an early spoiler warning as we have two separate lists here: One for the Trophies revealed from the start, and a separate list of hidden Achievements. So take care if you want to keep some of these a surprise.* </strong></p>

<p><strong>58 PlayStation Trophies and 57 Xbox Achievements await The First Berserker Khazan players.</strong></p>



<p>An extra PlayStation Trophy lies in wait for hardened collectors—the Platinum Trophy. An extra intangible reward for earning the other 57 Trophies (and Achievements). If you’re on Xbox, you don’t get a Platinum, but you still get the pride from earning every achievement.</p>

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s upcoming competitor is none other than its decades-old rival, Digimon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-card-game-con-mobile-phone-app-teaser-renamon-1851770444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, a new post on the digimon_tcg account on <a href="https://x.com/digimon_tcg/status/1901112392492478758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> teased an upcoming digital card game for the franchise. The post includes a short 10-second teaser, where we see Renamon hovering over a smartphone before the Digimon is suddenly sucked into the phone. That’s all that was revealed. However, more information about the game will be shown during Digimon Con on March 20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon and Digimon have been rivals for decades, with the former eventually taking the lead. However, seeing how Pokemon TCG Pocket has amassed so much success within such a short time, earning over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$120 million</a> within the first seventeen days and crossing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 million downloads</a> within the first nine, Digimon seems to want a cut of that success too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like the Pokemon Trading Card Game, Digimon has also had a card game since 2020, so they already have an established base for the digital version. However, the title’s success ultimately depends on the audience’s reception of another digital trading card game based on a different franchise. However, fans in the r/digimon subreddit seem ecstatic about the new digital trading card game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Niantic, Pokemon Go’s developer, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired by Scopely</a> for $3.5 billion. Also, here’s everything we know about Pokemon Champions, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-champions-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its release window, platforms</a> and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Palworld devs recently spoke about how Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit “came as a shock” for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-came-as-a-shock-to-pocketpair-because-patent-infringement-was-something-that-no-one-even-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Pocketpair’s communications director and publishing manager, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, addressed Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld during a panel at GDC 2025. Bucky first spoke about the “little thing that happened in September”, where a company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to come for them</a>. Bucky explained that he doesn’t want to talk about it too much as it is “an active lawsuit”, and he doesn’t want to get “wrapped up” in the situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bucky added that Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit “came as a shock” to them, considering they had received a green signal for all the legal checks in Japan before the game was released. The lawsuit was a shock for many people, as it was something the devs had never “considered” and is something they are “still hashing out basically.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bucky elaborated that the lawsuit didn’t “feel good” considering they had been “pretty vocal” about Palworld before the game was released. However, after contacting lawyers and courts, they realised that the lawsuit was for patents. When the information was released to the public, it was a “pretty depressing day” for the devs as “pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan”. At the same time, they were gearing up for the PlayStation release and a showcase at the Tokyo Game Show, which had to be scaled back due to legal problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired a new patent</a> that helps their lawsuit against Palworld. Also, Pocketpair publishing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has warned gamers</a> not to expect “more Palworld”.

<p>Amazon has greenlit the God of War series for two seasons, reveals showrunner, as he speaks about how he had to stop playing the games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/god-of-war-tv-show-writer-reveals-amazon-has-already-ordered-two-seasons-and-that-he-cant-play-the-video-games-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>, God of War series showrunner&nbsp; Ronald D. Moore recently appeared on Katee Sackhoff’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu704p568-Y&amp;list=PLiHvVvKZ9lt6_mIcI0YwKPY1CgSYUvORQ&amp;index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sackhoff Show</a>, where he revealed more details about the upcoming adaptation. Moore first revealed that “Amazon has ordered two seasons” of the God of War series. Moore said it is a more challenging project as he is “not a gamer”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore revealed that he “tried” to play the God of War games but is not a gamer. He grew up in the “arcade era,” and he would always be up to playing a game like Defender or Asteroid. However, Moore hasn’t overcome one obstacle with recent games: the modern controller. Moore elaborates that he has trouble with the button layout and cannot find the right buttons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, Moore’s family is filled with avid gamers. His children play constantly, and his wife has played Skyrim for “probably 15 years.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moore is the new showrunner for Amazon’s God of War series after the previous executive producers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-series-redone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exited the show</a> late last year. Moore is best known for his work on projects like Star Trek and the Battlestar Galactica series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the next God of War game is reportedly centred around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egyptian mythology</a>.

<p>Marvel Rivals devs recently spoke about drawing inspiration from Hazelight Studios’ It Takes Two when they had performance issues with Dr Strange’s portals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Strange’s portals in Marvel Rivals are one of the strongest abilities for strategic gameplay. The character can create a portal between any two points on the map, providing a direct line between those two points. However, while developing this ability for the character, Marvel Rivals developers were worried about the performance issues it might cause in the game, and to bypass this issue, they took inspiration from It Takes Two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-surprising-game-helped-improve-doctor-strange-portals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Marvel Rivals senior graphic designer Tieyi Zhang recently spoke about drawing inspiration from It Takes Two at a panel at GDC 2025. Zhang talked about how the Unreal Engine game (It Takes Two) “simultaneously renders two views without catastrophic overhead”, which made him wonder whether this game uses “some magic” he doesn’t know about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Marvel Rivals’ breakthrough came after “discovering the local function, creating a local player.” Zhang realised that adding a local player “automatically enables split-screen rendering via distant cameras.” The report reveals that Marvel Rivals devs didn’t go through It Takes Two’s source code. The problems were solved by researching how Hazelight addressed its performance issues and using a similar strategy for Marvel Rivals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While speaking on a panel at GDC, Pocketpair’s John Buckley, who leads the Pocketpair Publishing arm of the firm, took a deep dive into the rampant and overwhelming success of Palworld. In January 2024, Palworld – which was dubbed ‘Pokémon with guns’ – was released to the open market, going on to secure <strong>25 million players </strong>in a single month.</p>



<p>To this day, Pocketpair still has no idea how or why Palworld was such a roaring success, as Buckley revealed at GDC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-things-started-to-get-weird">‘Things Started To Get Weird’</h2>



<p>On the panel at the Game Developer’s Conference, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley reeled off his impression of the release of Palworld, which took place a little more than a year ago:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We quickly go over a million wishlists within the first year, so we knew that something was happening, and it kept going.</p>



<p>2023 was when things got really weird – we rose to number three on Steam wishlists, then we hit a crazy peak around November 2023. People always ask us, ‘Why? What happened? How did you get so much attention?’ But we don’t know. If we knew how to do it, we’d do it again, but we have no idea what happened.</p>



<p>Within this first week, we hit this disgusting number that makes me feel sick when I see it.</p>



<p>Why did we get this many players? I don’t know, please don’t ask me. I know someone will ask me after, but I promise you we don’t know the answer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/we-hit-this-disgusting-number-that-makes-me-feel-sick-palworld-devs-dont-know-why-their-survival-game-was-so-successful-if-we-knew-how-to-do-it-wed-do-it-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>Palworld became one of the best-selling games in history, shattering player count records and skyrocketing up the charts on social and streaming platforms worldwide. It was an overnight sensation, and it became the talk of the town mere hours after hitting the market.</p>



<p>Pocketpair could barely handle the weight – and Epic Games struggled as well. The popularity of the game brought servers offline, struggling under the stress of the sheer volume of people trying to play the game.</p>



<p>While the player count has understandably petered off by now, Palworld remains a popular title that’s being updated by Pocketpair all the time. It wasn’t exactly a flash in the pan.</p>



<p>It’s tough to understand exactly why Palworld was such a success. Perhaps it’s the disbelief that it was ‘allowed’ to exist or the sheer inanity of the concept that pulled players in. Pocketpair doesn’t know, and I don’t know either.</p>

<p>Ark: Survival Ascended, the controversial upgrade of the 2015 survival game, is getting a major expansion in November titled ‘Lost Colony’. It’s the first expansion designed specifically for the evolved version of the game, and it’s laying the foundations for the eventual release of Ark 2, which still doesn’t have a date.</p>



<p>It was mentioned by Studio Wildcard, the developer behind the Ark ecosystem, that Lost Colony will ‘connect the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and lead into the events of Ark 2.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-connections">Connections</h2>



<p>The link between Ark: Survival Ascended and Ark 2 is front and centre in Lost Colony, which features the vocal talents of Auli’i Cravalho, of Moana fame. She represents Meeka, a character revealed in the 2022 trailer for Ark 2, which also starred Vin Diesel. </p>



<p>To kick off 2025, Studio Wildcard revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2399830/view/526457668016013820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a two-year roadmap</a> for Ark: Survival Ascended that runs until December 2026. It’s relatively safe to assume that Ark 2 won’t be released before then, but if the later updates for Survival Ascended aren’t all that meaningful, perhaps Studio Wildcard could manage with a skeleton crew working on the ‘old game’.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583650/ARK_Lost_Colony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lost Colony</a> looks like a unique expansion at first blush. It’s fused with anime-style cutscene pieced together by MAPPA, a Japanese studio famed for the likes of Attack on Titan and Chainsaw Man. It’s being dubbed a ‘massive canonical expansion pack’ that’ll ease players into the impending world of Ark 2.</p>



<p>Players will get to explore Arat Prime, a frozen wasteland while battling their way through new enemies, exclusive ability trees, and fresh building systems. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Lost Colony and the release of Ark 2? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with Epic Games around Escape from Tarkov Arena, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov explained just how long it takes to develop a single weapon for the popular extraction shooter series. Escape from Tarkov has been on the market for almost a decade, and in that time, it has amassed a staggering arsenal of weaponry, but it’s not all that easy to add <strong>more</strong>.</p>



<p>Typically, new weapons will be introduced with major updates to the game – otherwise known as ‘wipes’. The weapons, Buyanov says, can take <strong>several months </strong>to be designed, created, coded, and balanced in Escape from Tarkov, and by association, Arena.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-putting-in-the-effort">Putting in the Effort</h2>



<p>In the discussion <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/fr/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-interview-nikita-buyanov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Epic Games</a>, Buyanov, who heads the studio at Battlestate Games, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a long and complex process that requires many iterations. We have a large team of game designers and testers who constantly check and refine the balance. We also carefully listen to feedback from our community. Many people are passionate about&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>&nbsp;and eagerly share their comments and impressions with us.</p>



<p>It’s a very slow and meticulous process.</p>



<p>To fully implement a single weapon in the game, with textures, animations, and all the details, takes about two to three months. It depends on the specific weapon. The fastest one we ever made took about a month, but we already had the animations ready. However, for example, belt-fed machine guns <strong>take an average of four months</strong> to complete.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He stressed that the team has a perfectionist attitude towards new weapons because they’re all ‘gun nerds’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We shoot real firearms very often. This is especially helpful for our programmers who work on the gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p>When you fire a real weapon, you hear it, smell the gunpowder, feel the weight, and experience the recoil, something in your mind shifts, and you start approaching weapon creation in the game with much greater attention to detail.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the extraction shooter might not agree with the perfectionist claims, but the weapons in Escape from Tarkov are being adjusted and balanced all the time in a bid to keep as many people as possible happy. Every time a major update surfaces, it seems a new meta emerges, and that’s often by design.</p>
