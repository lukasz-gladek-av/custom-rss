<p>During CES 2025, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku revealed a 35-second snippet of in-engine gameplay from the ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’ that was unveiled during The Game Awards 2024. The glimpse of this developing title <strong>isn’t </strong>a gameplay sequence, but it’s a perfect representation of what RGG is aiming for with the first new Virtua Fighter game in almost 20 years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pre-development-only-no-gameplay">Pre-Development Only, No Gameplay</h2>



<p>It’s important to stress that the 35-second clip aired by Sega <strong>is not </strong>gameplay. It’s pre-development footage taken from the game’s engine.</p>



<p>In the short video, we get a look at two characters fighting in a marketplace after a brief introduction,. They trade blows for a few seconds, kicking each other into destructible elements of the environment before the sequence fades to black and the Sega logo flashes up.</p>



<p>Check it out here:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>It’s little more than a conceptual thing, but it admittedly looks brilliant, and that’s coming from someone who has never enjoyed a fighting game. The small details like the NPCs milling around in the background are super, and the intro sequence is interesting, taking players outside of the typically tiny environments that players fight in.</p>



<p>At The Game Awards 2024, RGG unveiled the ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’, which will be the first new VF game in the series since 2006. </p>



<p>What do you think about the clip? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Acer’s recently revealed Nitro Blaze 11 is a new handheld, but they’re cutting it close with the dimensions of this thing. With a massive 10.95-inch display, the Nitro Blaze 11 is by far the chunkiest gaming handheld on the market, and it weighs more than three times as much as a Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>It’ll be a forearm workout just wielding the thing, regardless of how powerful or capable it is under the hood.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-performance-portable-gaming">‘High-Performance Portable Gaming’</h2>



<p>Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11 is a certified handheld device, but the portable aspect might be coming under question, given the size and weight of the thing. Once you’ve factored in the casing, the Nitro Blaze 11 is going to be 12 or 13 inches across, which trumps the ASUS ROG Ally X by a couple of inches.</p>



<p>It also weighs a staggering 1050g, while the Ally X, which is widely seen as the industry leader, weighs just 670g. That means a lot when it comes to a portable device. Do you really want to spend a lot of time gaming on something that weighs more than a kilo?</p>



<p>Size aside, the Nitro Blaze 11 is more than capable. It features a 120Hz display, an AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS processor, and up to 2 TB of storage. It also has detachable controllers in case you want to take the weight off, and it accommodates WiFi 6E and USB 4.</p>



<p>In the product’s blurb, Acer wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nitro Blaze 11 smoothly transitions between daily tasks and gaming. Whether you’re browsing, working, or playing, this handheld adapts seamlessly with precise Hall Effect sticks, a sturdy built-in stand, and detachable controllers that provide flexibility for solo or connected play with the included connector. The front camera makes video calls and streaming easy, ensuring you stay connected wherever you are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Also, the gigantic screen will likely be a monumental drain on the relatively small battery. The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 comes with a 55 Wh battery, which is nothing compared to the Ally X’s 80 Wh battery.</p>



<p>Finally, the price point isn’t ideal. The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 will set you back a whopping $1199, making it the most expensive gaming handheld on the market right now. It’s hard to see a real selling point for this device if I’m being honest.</p>
