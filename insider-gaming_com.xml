<p>You’ve made it to the end of another week, and to celebrate, you should smash another NYT Connections puzzle. Below, you’ll find the NYT Connections hints, answers, and explanations you’ll need to cap off another busy week and coast into the weekend happy. Of course, that yields more NYT Connections puzzles… But that’s why I’m here!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-27">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 27)</h2>



<p>Here are the words from today’s NYT Connections puzzle:</p>



<ul>
<li>JUDAS</li>

<li>AIR</li>



<li>RIPPLE</li>



<li>SNAKE</li>

<li>MANNER</li>



<li>DOMINO</li>



<li>PRINTING</li>



<li>IMPRESSION</li>



<li>TURNCOAT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Words associated with betrayal</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Words you’d associate with someone’s aura</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Words you’d associate with chain reactions</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words you’d associate with different kinds of ‘press’</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 27:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<p>PS5 Pro has received an upgraded version of the PSSR, and it’s rolling out in the coming weeks, and Resident Evil Requiem will be the first to use it.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem has finally released today and has already climbed the charts, becoming the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-becomes-series-biggest-steam-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">series’ biggest Steam launch</a>. The launch includes a special surprise for PS5 Pro users: they will be able to use an enhanced version of the console’s upscaling technology in the coming weeks.</p>







<h2 id="h-ps5-pro-update-will-come-with-a-new-enhance-pssr-image-quality-option">PS5 Pro Update Will Come with a New ‘Enhance PSSR Image Quality’ Option</h2>



<p>Revealed through the latest PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/27/upgraded-pssr-upscaler-is-coming-to-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, PS5 Pro is getting upgraded PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) soon, with Resident Evil Requiem becoming the first game to use it. Capcom’s Masaru Ijuin has stated that the upgraded PSSR has allowed them to “elevate our expressiveness by successfully processing these details and textural particularities, which are traditionally difficult to upscale because of their intricacy.”</p>



<p>The report explains that the enhanced PSSR algorithm and neural network are derived from the Project Amethyst partnership with AMD. The upgraded version will provide the very latest of this co-developed technology. Multiple games will be able to access the improved PSSR in March 2026.</p>



<p>The post also stated that the PS5 Pro’s Upgraded PSSR will come with a software update that provides a new option in the settings called ‘Enhance PSSR Image Quality’. This tool will allow players to experience the improved PSSR in any compatible PS5 Pro game, and some titles will have “noticeably crisper graphics.”</p>







<p>In other news, Sony could be considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-could-be-backing-away-from-releasing-single-player-titles-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stopping the release of its single-player games on PC.</a> Additionally, PlayStation Plus&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-free-monthly-games-for-march-2026-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free monthly games for March 2026</a>&nbsp;have been officially revealed.
