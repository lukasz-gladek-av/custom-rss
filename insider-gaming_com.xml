<p>Riot Games has committed to changing VALORANT’s map pool every single act, but the next map swap set for Patch 10.04 is not being well received. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-2025-new-agents-more-map-variety-ranked-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second act of the 2025 season</a> will see the removal of Abyss and Bind, and the return of Ascent and Icebox.</p>



<p>While many players won’t miss Abyss, there is a widespread feeling of disappointment that both Ascent and Icebox are returning. That is, unless they return with some changes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-valorant-patch-10-04-map-changes">VALORANT Patch 10.04 Map Changes</h2>



<p>As part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT’s new yearly season model</a>, the team at Riot has pledged to making map pool changes each act. There are currently 11 standard maps, with seven making up the active pool. Riot said at the beginning of the year that the initial plan is to swap two each act, but noted that number “might change” throughout the year.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>When the second act of 2025 begins on March 4, Patch 10.04 will replace Abyss and Bind with Icebox and Ascent. This change has not sat well with the community though, especially on the pro side. Prior to this current act, Ascent was the only map that had never been rotated out, and now it’s being reinstated after just a few weeks. Icebox has also been one of the more disliked maps across the community, but <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1879198967541764168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most of the replies</a> to the official announcement are upset about Ascent’s fast return.</p>



<p>Fans and members of the VALORANT pro scene are also not pleased about the impending changes. Sentinels’ coach Adam Kaplan <a href="https://x.com/itskaplan/status/1879214468674277613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is frustrated</a> with announcing the map changes ahead of time, claiming teams that don’t make the first Masters event of the year will have twice as much time to prepare for the new maps. Kaplan also says this will lead to an increase in burnout, as teams that attend Masters will have no time to rest if they don’t want to get out-prepped for Ascent and Icebox.</p>



<p>Is it too soon to bring Ascent back? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Fortnite’s long-awaited Godzilla event is nearly here. With a King Kong appearance and special skins, the event is hotly anticipated. Its release date is known, so here’s a rundown.</p>



<p>I’m having deja vu from Warzone Caldera’s epic Godzilla and King Kong event. But Epic is having a crack with Fortnite’s Godzilla event featuring the two titanic creatures. Godzilla and King Kong are arguably at the top of the food chain when it comes to monster movies, and their presence is sure to be felt in Fortnite. Does anyone fancy a trip to Skull Island while King Kong is away?</p>



<p>If not, I’ll instead break down this King Kong-sized collaboration.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-fortnite-godzilla-live-event-release-date">When is the Fortnite Godzilla Live Event Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A Godzilla-sized event approaches. Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Godzilla x Kong event is expected to launch on January 17.</strong></p>



<p>January 14 featured downtime for the shooter as Epic prepares for the upcoming heavyweight battle. Maintenance provided enough time to complete the transition to version 33.20. But it’s also the first hurdle (a big one) as we prepare for the arrival of Godzilla and King Kong.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we learn its exact start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-godzilla-evolved-and-mecha-godzilla-skins-in-fortnite">How to Get Godzilla Evolved and Mecha Godzilla Skins in Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What are you looking at? Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Godzilla Evolved Skin and Mecha Godzilla Skins are available to obtain from the Chapter 6, Season 1 Battle Pass</strong> <strong>on January 17.</strong></p>



<p>It’s no surprise to learn both Godzilla skins go live along with the event start date. Here’s a quick guide in case you’re unaware of the Godzilla skins:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open up Fortnite.</li>



<li>Purchase the Chapter 6, Season 1 Battle Pass.</li>



<li>Wait for the Locked Pages to become available on January 17.</li>



<li>Complete the objectives to earn the special, limited-time skins.</li>
</ol>



<p>Many Fortnite skins are locked away for a long time after their initial appearance. I would recommend you <strong>act quickly</strong> if you want the Godzilla Evolved and Mecha Godzilla Skins. </p>



<p>They’re likely to be available for purchase later down the line, but it’s not worth risking the wrath of the mega-tall monsters.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-the-fortnite-godzilla-event">What to Expect From the Fortnite Godzilla Event</h2>



<p><strong>It’s unconfirmed, but full-scale interactions with both Godzilla and King Kong are expected in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-godzilla-transformation-mythic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Godzilla Transformation Mythic</a> has leaked (thanks to <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hypex</a>). It’s thought you can <strong>turn into Godzilla</strong> and use its “Beam, Stomp, and Roar” abilities. Plus, a “throw banana” ability has been outed by the leaker too—meaning <strong>control of King Kong</strong> is also swinging its way into Fortnite!</p>



<p>The consensus is a <strong>fight is brewing between King Kong and Godzilla</strong>—à la the movies. We’re not sure if it plays out via a cutscene, or if we have the incredible honor of getting caught in the fire, fists, and swinging tails. All I am certain of is it’s going to be Epic (pun intended).</p>



<hr>



<p>Where does the Fortnite Godzilla Event rank in terms of all-time hype? Is it one of Epic’s better efforts? What’s a crossover the company desperately needs to do that Fortnite hasn’t done yet?</p>



<p>Speaking of which, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-cyberpunk-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite and Cyberpunk 2077 crossover</a> is coming, so make sure to read up on the collab. Plus, check out the addition of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hatsune-miku-fortnite-skin-leaks-online-before-fortnite-festival-season-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hatsune Miku Fortnite Skin</a>.</p>
