<p>Last year was a great year for sports video games. In 2024, we saw the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-response-to-college-football-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">college football</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/undisputed-review-redefining-the-boxing-game-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boxing console games</a>, fantastic new indie titles, and some of the highest-rated games in the history of long-running franchises. But if 2024 was that great, just how much better could 2025 be? If what’s expected to release in any indication, sports fans could be in for another stellar year. So, let’s take a look at the biggest sports video games expected to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Whether you want to hit the links, drive around the track, or get back on the football field, there’s going to be no shortage of options for your this year.</p>

<h2 id="h-biggest-sports-games-of-2025">Biggest Sports Games Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-college-football-26">College Football 26</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>College Football 25 took the world by storm in 2024, and became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling sports video game</a> in United States history. What’s more, the game has remained at the top of the 2024 sales charts in the United States, even keeping games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at bay. So, naturally, it’s time to think about just how EA Sports will follow up with this year’s game.</p>



<p>We know it’s coming, but what will College Football 26 do to improve on the first college football game in 11 years? Will Road to Glory see added depth? Will Team Builder allow for custom stadiums? Facility improvements in Dynasty Mode? Will it come to PC? There’s a lot that can be done to keep the momentum going in 2025.</p>

<h3 id="h-pga-tour-2k25">PGA Tour 2K25</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A game that hasn’t officially been announced yet, PGA Tour 2K25 is currently planned for a release by March 31, 2025. At least, that’s what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two CFO Laine Goldstein let slip</a> during the company’s Q2 FY2025 earnings call last November. Since then, there has been no mention of the upcoming game in any capacity, seemingly confirming that it wasn’t supposed to be mentioned on the call. However, now that the game’s out there in the open, it seems like it’s only a matter of time before fans find out how it’ll improve upon PGA Tour 2K23.</p>



<h3 id="h-wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>WWE 2K24 was the best-selling and highest-rated game in the WWE 2K franchise since Take-Two acquired the WWE license in 2013. The game wasn’t without it’s issues, however, which makes WWE 2K25 all the more anticipated. Sources have told Insider Gaming that due to the success of 2024, Take-Two is investing more into the game. So, the hope is that it translates into improvements that fans have been hoping for for years, such as updates to the game’s Universe Mode.</p>

<h3 id="h-iracing-nascar-25">iRacing NASCAR 25</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s been over three years since NASCAR fans have received a proper video game — if you want to call NASCAR 21: Ignition a proper game. That’s what makes this year so exciting. A new NASCAR console game is scheduled for the fall, and it’s the first one coming from iRacing since it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-announces-new-console-game-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased the license</a> from Motorsport Games. </p>



<p>The deal was announced in October 2023, and it’s been pretty quiet on the update front from the team working on the game. We know it’s going to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-iracing-nascar-console-game-monster-games-in-unreal-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built in Unreal Engine with Monster Games</a> leading the way as well as it being available on PS5, Xbox Series, PC, and, as of today, Nintendo Switch. With the 2025 NASCAR season right around the corner, we should start getting more information on what to expect sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Esports remains a relatively divisive topic going into 2025. Many still see the esports industry as a fledgeling thing doomed to fail, while others believe it’s a titanic powerhouse of potential with untapped avenues of income left, right, and centre.</p>



<p>In recent years, esports has been nothing short of a turbulent space to exist in. It’s still developing – and likely will be for many years to come – and a lot is happening under the hood that the average fan might not see or understand.</p>



<p>In a recent piece covered by Esports Insider, several high-profile stakeholders and leaders in the esports industry were interviewed about their predictions for esports in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mature-and-evolve">‘Mature and Evolve’</h2>



<p>Some of the best answers in Esports Insider’s look-forward piece came from Steve Arhancet, the CEO of Team Liquid, one of the oldest and most successful esports organisations in the world.</p>



<p>When asked about his expectations for 2025, Arhancet said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that in 2025, esports will solidify itself as a cultural force rather than a fleeting trend. The past few years have forced companies to mature and evolve, and the separation between companies that have built real businesses and those who chase empty metrics will grow even more significant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of this, we will see more consolidation, mergers and acquisitions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’ve seen plenty of high-profile mergers and acquisitions in the last few years. For instance, in the Call of Duty League, several teams performed mergers to either stay afloat or bolster their resources, with the likes of Cloud9, Gentle Mates, and Team Falcons working their way into the Call of Duty pro scene in earnest.</p>



<p>Arhancet went on to dip into Tema Liquid’s success in 2024, commenting on what’s coming next:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Team Liquid achieved its 2024 goal of being EBITDA positive.</p>



<p>(In 2025, Team Liquid wants to) be a leader in competitive gaming and build a global and multigenerational sports team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On the topic of ongoing success and sustainability, Arhancet suggested what needs to be done for more organisations to become profitable and hit their EBITDA boosts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Monetisation models remain the Achilles’ heel of esports.&nbsp; We need to find that next gear beyond just ad spend and sponsorships, and create direct fan monetisation systems that feel natural, rewarding and equitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This would go hand-in-hand with improved economics between developers and/or tournament organisers and teams.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full breadth of interviews can be found <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/01/esports-industry-predicts-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in Esports Insider’s complete report</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Could Make $1 Billion Before It’s Even Released]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-could-make-1-billion-before-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-6-could-make-1-billion-before-it%E2%80%99s-even-released.1072641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-could-make-1-billion-before-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been estimated by a gaming research group that Grand Theft Auto 6, the world’s most anticipated game, could secure $1 billion in pre-orders before it hits the market later this year. This monumental figure was expanded by the agency suggesting that GTA 6 could go on to make more than $3 billion in under a year.</p>



<p>It has been predicted that GTA 6 will make around $3.2 billion in 12 months once it launches this year – expectations are currently sitting at an October release date.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>In a report published in the Financial Times, the stability of the games industry was explored. It all began with a deep dive into how much GTA 6 is expected to make when it’s finally released later this year. Per an estimation from DFC Intelligence, GTA 6 could make $1 billion in pre-orders alone. </p>



<p>Ultimately, it has been predicted that GTA 6 will go on to decimate the numbers secured by GTA 5 in 2013.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1413cdb1-aee9-422f-8b78-15aa0bf40dca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Financial Times</a>, Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two (Rockstar Games’ parent company) said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I never claim victory before it occurs. That said, I think Rockstar Games will once again deliver something absolutely phenomenal. Certainly the anticipation is high.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zelnick also contributed to the discussion about the health of the current gaming generation and consumer spending habits:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s way too early to believe that this [console] generation is maturing or has reached its apex.</p>



<p>You’re seeing more consumer demand broadly. And the industry, frankly led by us, has an amazing release schedule coming in 2025 and beyond. A hit coming from one company tends to benefit the entire industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA 6 has already broken viewership records on YouTube. From the moment the first trailer was released in December 2023, fans turned feral, scouring every frame for secrets and hints. Today, it’s still one of the most talked-about videos in the world, and that’s aided by the fact that a high-res version of the trailer recently surfaced online.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arrowhead-studios-cco-dei-comments/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arrowhead-studios%E2%80%99-cco-speaks-out-against-forcing-%E2%80%98dei%E2%80%99-into-games.1072617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/arrowhead-studios-cco-dei-comments/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent social media post, Arrowhead Studios’ CCO and the creative director of Helldivers 2, Johan Pilestedt, revealed he’s working on the high concept for the studio’s next game. Under the post, he engaged in a brief discussion regarding ‘DEI’ and the act of ‘shoehorning’ it into a game <em>just to have it there</em>.</p>



<p>The comments drew a mix of feedback from the community, with some praising Pilestedt’s transparency while others pointed out some potential flaws with what he said.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pure-pursuit-of-amazing-moments">‘Pure Pursuit of Amazing Moments’</h2>



<p>Helldivers 2 turned heads when it was released in February 2024, with the game going on to sell millions of copies with ease. It had a rocky moment when it was review-bombed following a change on PC that required users to have and link a PSN account to play the game, but that wrong was righted quickly enough.</p>



<p>Now, Arrowhead Studios is preparing to piece together something new, and Johan Pilestedt is working on the concept for whatever comes next.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the CCO revealed just that, and in the comments, he engaged with the community. One user made a bold statement: ‘Never add DEI to your games.’</p>



<p>Instead of ignoring the comment, <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1874271801146302738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pilestedt went in with solid responses</a> that kickstarted a wave of comments:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If it doesnt add to the game experience, it detracts. And games should be a pure pursuit of amazing moments.</p>



<p>I don’t like labels. But mankind is united in its extreme xenophobia on Super Earth. #Inclusion so, maybe that’s DEI? I really don’t care. </p>



<p>Make good games, don’t make a contemporary political statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some users were quick to point out that Helldivers 2’s ‘entire setting is a political statement’, while others maintained the stance that Helldivers 2 is more satirical and rooted in absurdism than anything else.</p>



<p>What we can take away from Pilestedt’s comments is that adding DEI elements to a game just to ‘tick a box’ is wrong if it doesn’t add value to the game. In that case, it’s <strong>detracting </strong>value and serves no purpose, potentially spoiling the ‘pure pursuit of amazing moments’. </p>



<p>His latter comment suggests that games with these ‘contemporary political statements’ are inherently ‘not good’.</p>



<p>One game that was heavily criticised under topics like this in recent years was The Last of Us Part II. That game featured two lead female characters, one of whom was outwardly gay, and had a relatively major storyline concerning a trans character. These topics were targeted quite severely by review bombers angry at the game being ‘woke’ and forcing these elements on players.</p>



<p>But The Last of Us Part II is one of the most highly awarded games in history, so perhaps you can make a good game that also makes contemporary political or cultural statements.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-dev-is-%E2%80%98working-on-the-concept%E2%80%99-for-its-next-game.1072611/</guid>

<p>A recent social media post confirmed that Helldivers 2’s developer, Arrowhead Studios, is fleshing out the concept for its next game. On Twitter, Johan Pilestedt, the creative director behind Helldivers 2, mentioned that he’s ‘working on the high concept’ and invited community speculation about the project.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was released almost a year ago to an overwhelmingly positive reception. The game went on to sell millions of copies and win awards throughout the year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-arrowhead">What’s Next for Arrowhead?</h2>



<p>Arrowhead Studios is busying itself with whatever comes next after Helldivers 2, with the firm’s CCO drawing up plans for an all-new project.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/pilestedt/status/1874226763913715938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on social media</a>, Pilestedt wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With 10 minutes to 2025. What are your expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be? I am working on the high concept, but I would love to hear your speculation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pilestedt went on to engage with the community in the comments under the post, many of whom were eagerly pitching their own ideas to the creative director of one of 2024’s most surprising smash hits.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘I would absolutely love to see what Arrowhead could do with a remake of the retro twin-stick shooter “Smash TV”. So much atmosphere in that game!’</p>



<p>By way of a response, Pilestedt revealed that such a game was pitched ‘a long time ago’, sharing an image that contained a blurb for a proposed game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Smash-TV is a top-down reiminaging of the classic arcade game of 1990. The game pits up to four contestants in a violent game show set in the distant future of 1999. The game focuses on the source inspiration for Smash TV to create a game filled with brutal action, death traps, and gladiator-inspired game-shows.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revealed that Arrowhead pieced together a concept for a first-person, on-rails game akin to Star Fox.</p>
