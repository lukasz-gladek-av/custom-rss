<p>Amazon has revealed a wave of new casting announcements for its upcoming live-action Tomb Raider series, expanding the roster around Sophie Turner, who was previously confirmed to play the iconic Lara Croft.</p>



<p>First launched in 1996, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-catalyst-players-will-require-no-homework-before-jumping-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a> has become one of gaming’s most recognisable franchises, spawning multiple film adaptations and animated projects over the years. Now, Amazon is preparing its own take on Lara Croft’s globe-trotting adventures, with casting details beginning to shed light on the shape of the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-sigourney-weaver-jason-isaacs-amp-more-cast-for-amazon-s-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, &amp; More Cast For Amazon’s Tomb Raider Series</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO revealed a brand new platform called SMART Play at CES 2026, which brings more life to each creation. </p>



<p>LEGO is known to provide sets for a variety of franchises, including gaming and other entertainment media. In recent times, we have seen the company unveil sets for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-game-boy-set-releasing-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Game Boy</a> as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda</a>. However, their latest reveal is not a new set, but a platform that will change the way all other sets work.</p>











<p>Revealed in a new <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2026/december/lego-smart-play-announcement?locale=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, LEGO SMART Play is a new platform that features “more than twenty patented world-firsts within its technology.” The centre’s focus is the LEGO SMART Brick, which features a custom-made chip that enables responsive physical play. The SMART Brick comes with technologies like sensors, accelerometers, light sensing, and a sound sensor, along with a miniature speaker driven by an onboard synthesiser. It also features easy wireless charging. </p>



<p>The LEGO SMART Tags and LEGO SMART Minifigures, on the other hand, work in tandem with the SMART Bricks, and they respond to the players’ actions with appropriate sounds and behaviours. LEGO SMART Play will launch on March 1, 2026, and the first SMART Play-enabled sets will be LEGO Star Wars sets. </p>

Players can expect interactive features such as laser shooting, engine, refueling, and repair sounds &amp; lights.  </li>



<li>The second one is LEGO Star Wars SMART Play Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter, a 473-piece set featuring SMART Minifigures of Darth Vader and a Rebel Fleet Trooper. The SMART Play features will bring “the roar of the twin ion engines comes to life.”</li>

<p>Corsair has announced its latest flagship keyboard at CES 2026, and this one includes a built-in Elgato Stream Deck.</p>



<p>The Corsair Galleon 100 SD is a full-sized mechanical keyboard with pre-lubed MLX Pulse keyswitches. It also includes polling rates up to 8,000Hz that “transmits your keystrokes up to eight times faster than standard gaming keyboards.”</p>







<p>Of course, the biggest feature of the keyboard is the addition of the Stream Deck. The attached deck features 12 LCD keys, two dials, and a 5″ full-color display. All of which can be customized within the Stream Deck App.</p>



<p><strong>“The GALLEON 100 SD marks a new era of input that our community has been clamoring for,”</strong> Tobias Brinkmann, Vice President and General Manager of Gaming Peripherals at CORSAIR, said via release. “<strong>This isn’t just a better keyboard. It’s a solution to the reality of modern gaming, where managing apps, info, and devices is just as critical as performance. This level of control has never existed in a single device before, and only CORSAIR could bring the future of input to market now.”</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other features include an aluminum frame with gasket mounting and six layers of internal sound dampening, cushioned palm rest, and an RGB “mood bar”.</p>



<p>The Corsair Galleon 100 SD is available now for $349.99, and can be purchased on the official <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/corsair/CH-912A31I-NA/galleon-100-sd-stream-deck-integrated-mechanical-keyboard-ch-912a31i-na#productDetails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Corsair website</a>. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-new-content/</link>
            <guid>1398322</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After years of waiting, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is receiving a slew of new content in the 3.0 update, releasing alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade of the game.</p>



<p>Six years after it was first released, and four years on from the 2.0 update, Animal Crossing: New Horizons receives the 3<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-switch-2-edition-exact-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">.0 update on January 15</a>, bringing new content, new villagers, and more to the game.</p>



<p>For a complete rundown on everything being added in the update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-new-content-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update">All New Content in Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 Update</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New tasks. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-new-amp-returning-villagers">New &amp; Returning Villagers</h3>



<p>Four additional villagers will become available in Animal Crossing: New Horizons with the 3.0 update, although the process to add them to your island requires using an Amiibo, and they cannot be invited to your island without them.</p>



<p>Mineru and Tulin are the two new additions, from the Legends of Zelda Amiibos, while Cece and Viche are returning villagers, available by scanning Splatoon Amiibos.</p>



<p>Without the use of Amiibos, none of the four additional villagers coming to New Horizons in the 3.0 update can be invited to your island.</p>



<h3 id="h-quality-of-life-improvements">Quality-of-Life Improvements</h3>



<p>Several quality-of-life improvements are introduced in the 3.0 update, increasing the maximum amount of available storage to 9,000, along with the ability to place trees, bushes, andd flowers inside storage.</p>



<p>When crafting, you are able to select the number of items in total you want to craft, rather than having to do one at a time, and crafting now pulls materials from storage, meaning you will no longer have to have all the materials required in your pockets.</p>



<p>Finally, when terraforming, movement changes make it easier to build or remove fences, paths, cliffs, and rivers on a single axis, with quick steps in a single direction.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Design time. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-resort-hotel">Resort Hotel</h3>



<p>The biggest gameplay addition in the New Horizons 3.0 update is the Resort Hotel, where players are tasked to design rooms for guests matching a specified theme.  Tourists will visit the island and can be found wandering around, with the ability to invite specific villagers using Amiibo. </p>



<p>Completing requests earns Hotel Tickets, used to claim goods at the souvenir shop run by Grams, and Hotel Tickets are also earned by fulfilling requests for DIY goods, which also increases the hotel’s international brand recognition.</p>



<p>Additionally, the hotel lobby has two mannequins that can be dressed with custom outfits, which both animal and human visitors can borrow to wear.</p>



<h3 id="h-reset-service">Reset Service</h3>



<p>Mr. Resetti’s island Reset Service is added in the 3.0 update, allowing players to easily clear specific areas of the island. When doing so, you can choose for items to be disposed of, or placed into storage.</p>



<p>The Reset Service can also be used to clear planted flowers and custom designs, making it much easier to give your island a new makeover.</p>



<h3 id="h-slumber-islands">Slumber Islands</h3>



<p>Slumber Islands are available in a new dream world, with each player able to create up to three. There is a selection of random layouts, and three varying sizes.</p>



<p>Islands can be fully terraformed and decorated with items from a player’s catalog, while the time of day and weather can also be set. Lloid is available to construct bridges and inclines on demand.</p>



<p>You can also invite other players to join your Slumber Island via multiplayer and work together crafting the island.</p>



<h3 id="h-collaborations">Collaborations</h3>



<p>Several collaborations are added in the New Horizons 3.0 update, bringing a host of new items, decorations, and rare furniture items into the game.</p>



<p>Grams’ souvenir shop stocks rare furniture items as the Hotel’s brand recognition increases, themed on classic Nintendo consoles and retro toys. With an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription, players can select and play games on the consoles, with Clu Clu Land, ice Climber, Dr. Mario, Panel de Pon, and F-Zero available.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, LEGO-themed furniture is added to Nook Shopping, and can be purchased when it becomes available. There are also themed items from The Legend of Zelda and Splatoon available when compatible Amiibos are scanned.</p>
