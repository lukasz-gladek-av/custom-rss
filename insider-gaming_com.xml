<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans were tossed out thanks to the new protagonist, Hornet. </p>



<p>Team Cherry’s new game, which was finally released today, has been in development for 7 long years. The game started out as a DLC, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grew larger than planned</a>, with the devs adding multiple towns, a deep quest system, and a world much bigger than the original games. Now, the developers have revealed one of the major factors that contributed to the game’s lengthy development. </p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-s-hornet-changed-everything-for-the-developers">Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Hornet Changed Everything for the Developers</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/team-cherry-had-to-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-for-hollow-knight-silksong-for-one-simple-reason-hornet-being-taller-changes-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Team Cherry’s leads, Ari Gibson and William Pellen, explained how Hornet led to changes in Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans. Pellen explained that “Hornet being taller changes everything,” and the devs couldn’t do justice to the new playable character through just a DLC. </p>



<p>In Hollow Knight: Silksong, Hornet is able to travel much faster, jump higher, mantle or clamber onto ledges, and is generally more acrobatic than the previous protagonist. Hence, “the caves around her have to expand to accommodate her height.” Moreover, Hornet’s fighting is faster, and her competence led to a change in enemy design as well. “The core of the world is mainly a reflection” of this character and her nature “is echoed in the way the world is set up.”</p>



<p>If Hornet were straight placed in Hollow Knight’s world, she would be easily able to maneuver through the “would-be hazards,” and the extended attack range changes things as well. Silksong, on the other hand, brings “greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making.”</p>



<p>Gibson also elaborated that Hornet is half-bug, which not only makes the character more physical, but the world as well. Which means players will see “less glowy orb things, and magic bursts of light, and many more blades and traps.”</p>



<p>In other news, Hollow Knight: Silksong developers are offering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-offer-free-switch-2-upgrades-for-switch-1-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Switch 2 upgrades</a> to Switch 1 players. Also, the game releases today. Here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-confirms-hollow-knight-silksong-price-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price details and release times</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-dying-light-the-beast-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1288665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass is one of the pillars of subscription-based gaming services. With Dying Light: The Beast looking to cause an explosive ruckus, it would be apocalyptic if The Beast jumped over the odd rooftop to get onto Game Pass.</p>



<p>Dying Light is looking to unleash the animal in all of us with The Beast. The game is a sequel to Dying Light 2, and brings back long-time hero <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle Crane</a>. Techland has worked on the third full game, to the extent of delaying the horror title. The Beast resumes the series’ on-brand cocktail of parkour and dishing out pain.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> arrives during a busy September 2025. But if you’ve only got eyes for The Beast, you should know its Xbox Game Pass status in case you can save a penny or two.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dying-light-the-beast-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Dying Light: The Beast On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’ll be hell to pay for this. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Neither Techland nor Microsoft has said Dying Light: The Beast is coming to Xbox Game Pass as either a day-one launch or as a freebie at some point in the future.</strong></p>



<p>It’s very telling if you approach a game’s release date and there’s nothing about <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a>. In 99% of cases, this means the game won’t be a day-one launch title. Xbox has had some third-party winners in 2025, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and even the Soulslike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>.</p>



<p>However, unless you’re an Xbox Game Studios title, there’s a good chance you’re paying full whack for the game—as is the case with Dying Light: The Beast. It’s not had a Game Pass logo slapped onto any of its trailers, and the Xbox store listing doesn’t bat even the slightest eyelid at the prospect.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-dying-light-the-beast-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Dying Light: The Beast Come To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>I’d say the chances of Dying Light: The Beast coming to Xbox Game Pass are pretty slim right now, given the franchise’s lack of history with the service.</strong></p>



<p>When you’ve enquired about enough games and their Xbox Game Pass chances, you learn a thing or two. I don’t think a Dying Light game has ever been on Xbox Game Pass. I can’t find the history of this, but Microsoft does have a habit of removing games after a while.</p>



<p>As of writing, you can’t find Dying Light or Dying Light 2 on Xbox Game Pass. That could be a big indicator of the game’s future on Game Pass. It’s not like these are niche indie titles after all. There have been rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-pass-killed-by-first-party-development-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass being unsustainable due to first-party development costs</a>.</p>



<p>It’s one of those: If The Beast is announced for Game Pass, you’ll hear it from us first. On the other hand, I suggest keeping your expectations in check on this one.</p>

<p>007 First Light developers have just confirmed that they used Daniel Craig’s head on Agent 47 to pitch the game.</p>



<p>007 First Light received its first gameplay yesterday at the exclusive State of Play event, along with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. Since then, players have begun forming impressions about the game, and the developers have also come forward to say it isn’t a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isnt-a-hitman-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reskin</a>” of Hitman. Now, new details have been revealed about how Daniel Craig’s likeness was used when pitching 007 First Light. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-was-pitched-with-daniel-craig-s-head-on-agent-47">007 First Light Was Pitched with Daniel Craig’s Head on Agent 47</h2>



<p>IOI CEO, Hakan Abrak, confirmed during an interview with <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-007/240656/news/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Daniel Craig’s head was placed on Agent 47 and put into World of Assassination when they demoed 007 First Light. Abrak reveals, “We actually did put Daniel Craig in there”, and they modeled his head and placed it instead of Agent 47. This was done for demo purposes only, to provide “an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game.”</p>



<p>Abrak adds that players who are familiar with a level called “Sapienza with the virus in the caves underneath the compound”, should know that some things were shown off there and “it was well received” The CEO explained that they were trying to convey that this is a “360 experience”, which is not just shooting and cutscenes, but also explores the “Bond Fantasy” in social spaces where the character needs to use his “charms and bluff” instead of his fists.</p>



<p>Abrak revealed that this was the first time they had worked on something other than original worlds and characters, and it was essential for them to put their “creative fingerprints” on it. They weren’t interested in “a gamification of a movie or maybe where it’s about technical prowess only, like pushing the pixels on Pierce Brosnan, for example, or just taking some bespoke scenes from a movie and realizing them in gaming.”</p>



<p>Instead, the developers want to create a “game for gamers” which brings players “a genuine Bond experience” where Bond is yet to become the world’s most famous spy and is still learning the ropes of the trade. </p>



<p>In other news, 007 First Light’s collector’s edition will&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-collectors-edition-will-set-you-back-300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set players back $300</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Whenever a game is delayed, the desire to play it as soon as possible intensifies. Dying Light: The Beast fans have had to experience this pain, which is why early access would be a terrific boon to lessen the wait.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> was delayed by 4 weeks. If it was the game you were most looking forward to in 2025, I can imagine you’ve been in your own zombie-like state throughout August and the early parts of September. Techland seems confident in The Beast’s revised release date. I can tell you that Insider Gaming’s recent hands-on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-preview-evolution-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview</a> should give you cause for excitement.</p>



<p>It’s hit and miss if single-player games have early access—which is where Dying Light: The Beast comes into the undead equation.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dying-light-the-beast-with-early-access">Can You Play Dying Light: The Beast With Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A hop, a skip, and a thump. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of writing, there is no Dying Light: The Beast early access, meaning the first real opportunity to play the game is via its September 19 release date.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/the-beast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dying Light: The Beast</a> <em>does </em>have a special deluxe edition. But it doesn’t feature 24, 48, or even 7-day early access. It includes special cosmetic skins, the game’s official soundtrack, and other handy in-game items. But there’s definitely no early access to get you to part ways with more money.</p>



<p>In fairness, the deluxe edition is only a handful of dollars more than the standard edition. If it did offer early access, I expect there’d be a greater discrepancy in price. As an old-school gamer, I’m happy when games don’t offer this, as it’s better when everyone can jump in together on the same day, avoid spoilers, and get a chance to experience the hilarious and bizarre antics in unison.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-dying-light-the-beast-demo">Is There A Dying Light: The Beast Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s not even a Dying Light: The Beast demo for you to get a small taster of what’s to come.</strong></p>



<p>Techland is adamant about the game’s content. The only way you play Dying Light: The Beast is on release day. If you need snippets of gameplay and details on the game and its development, though, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderGamingTrailers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Trailers</a> YouTube page has a ton of Dyihng Light: The Beast content to watch.</p>

<p>007 First Light developers have clarified that it isn’t a reskin of Hitman and is different in many aspects. </p>



<p>007 First Light received an exclusive State of Play event yesterday, which featured 30 minutes of gameplay along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date announcement</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-deluxe-edition-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order details</a>. Since then, a new interview has emerged in which the developers have clarified that the James Bond game is distinct from Hitman. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-s-driving-was-a-huge-challenge">007 First Light’s Driving Was A “Huge Challenge”</h2>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/007-first-light-is-not-a-reskin-of-hitman-io-interactive-says-again-and-the-team-brought-in-amazing-fresh-talent-including-devs-with-specific-driving-expertise-to-help-build-car-missions/">GamesRadar+</a>, senior licensing producer Theuns Smit explained how Hitman and 007 First Light are two different games. Smit first talked about how they have a very talented team that has expanded significantly since the game was announced. They were able to bring in fresh talent, which, along with the existing staff, became “a really big growth moment” for the studio. </p>



<p>The new developers were able to bring in “fresh eyes, fresh expertise, all of that” while also relying on IO Interactive’s strengths and their 25 years of massive experience. However, Smit explains that it is about the game and experience first, stating, “If you’re looking at Hitman, it’s the way it is for a particular reason, because that’s the gameplay experience we want to give. For Bond, it’s not exactly that. It’s not a reskin of that.”</p>



<p>Smit then spoke about driving, describing it as “absolutely a huge challenge,” and they had to bring on developers with driving expertise, which included “people that had experience coding, setting up, tweaking, balancing.” He added that it is “a balancing act of making a vehicle feel both exciting, credible, and dangerous at the same time as being approachable and fun for a wide audience.” Finding this balance was difficult and a “new adventure” for them, but they feel they have “landed in an amazing space.” </p>
