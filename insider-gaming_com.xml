            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 Season 1 is here, and that means the arrival of new maps, modes, weapons, and the battle royale platform known as REDSEC. It also means that the game’s first Battle Pass is here, and as you probably predicted, it’s split into <strong>two tiers</strong>. In this guide, I’ll help you figure out if the Battlefield 6 <strong>BF Pro </strong>Battle Pass is worth your money.</p>



<p>The Battlefield Pro Battle Pass will set you back £21.99 (or your local equivalent), and the content found within will last for <strong>12 weeks</strong>. Let’s figure out if it’s worth your time, effort, and money to invest in the rewards found in the BF Pro Battle Pass in Battlefield 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-comes-with-the-battlefield-pro-battle-pass">What Comes With the Battlefield Pro Battle Pass?</h2>



<p>REDSEC might be free to access, but if you want to get the most from <a href="https://amzn.to/47BLy9s">Battlefield 6</a>, you’ll need to get a Battle Pass. There are two variants: Standard and Battlefield Pro. The former costs 1,100 Battlefield Coins (£8.99 or your local equivalent), but the BF Pro Battle Pass can only be bought with cold, hard cash.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter how many BF Coins you have; you can’t use them to buy the BF Pro Battle Pass, but the rewards in the Pro Pass are <strong>much greater</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you get for investing in the Battlefield Pro Battle Pass:</p>



<ul>
<li>Free Rewards</li>



<li>Battle Pass Rewards</li>



<li>Battle Pass Instant Unlock Rewards</li>



<li>Battle Pass 15% Progression Boost</li>



<li>100 Max Portal Persistent Server Hosts</li>



<li>BF Pro Instant Unlock Rewards</li>



<li>25 Battle Pass Tier Skips</li>



<li>In-Game Vehicle Radio Station</li>



<li>BF Pro Battle Pass Path</li>



<li>BF Pro Assignments</li>
</ul>



<p>It all begins with five instant unlocks, including the new GGH-22 pistol (modelled on the Glock 22). Your 25 free tier skips will enable you to power through almost the entire first section of the Battle Pass – ‘Rogue Operators’. This puts you <strong>one step away </strong>from the new SOR-300SC carbine.</p>



<p>In the Instant Unlock section (for both Battle Pass and BF Pro users), you’ll get <strong>twelve items </strong>immediately, including four new operators, two weapon packages, a knife skin, a parachute skin, calling cards, and XP boosters.</p>



<p>Before you get too far, be sure to check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-update-1-1-1-0-patch-notes-full/">patch notes for Battlefield 6’s 1.1.1.0 update</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-battle-pass-max-rewards">Battlefield 6 Battle Pass Max Rewards</h2>



<p>There’s a tasty reward at the end of each section in the Battle Pass:</p>



<ul>
<li>Rogue Operators</li>



<li>Deniable Ops</li>



<li>Soldiers of Fortune</li>



<li>Pacific Ghosts</li>
</ul>



<p>And then you hit the <strong>Ultimate </strong>tiers, and finally the <strong>Prestige </strong>tiers.</p>



<p>Here’s the final reward in each portion of the Battlefield 6 Battle Pass.</p>



<h3 id="h-rogue-operators-forest-sentry">Rogue Operators – Forest Sentry</h3>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-deniable-ops-mackenzie">Deniable Ops – Mackenzie</h3>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-soldiers-of-fortune-health-is-wealth">Soldiers of Fortune – Health is Wealth</h3>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-pacific-ghosts-divided-patterns">Pacific Ghosts – Divided Patterns</h3>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-can-you-skip-sections-in-the-battle-pass-in-battlefield-6">Can You Skip Sections in the Battle Pass in Battlefield 6?</h2>



<p>If you don’t like the current path you’re on or want to target different rewards, you can switch paths at any time, making headway towards other rewards in different channels.</p>



<p>Only once you’ve unlocked everything can you access Ultimate and Prestige rewards. Here are the final rewards in those channels:</p>



<h3 id="h-ultimate-spiteful-mirage">Ultimate – Spiteful Mirage</h3>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-prestige-battlefield-coins">Prestige – Battlefield Coins</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>With stacks of exclusive rewards, challenges, unlocks, and the chunky experience boost being set aside for BF Pro subscribers, I think it’s more than worth the money. However, if you’re not going to invest a lot of time in Battlefield 6, then perhaps the standard edition is for you.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you can unlock enough BF Coins in one full Battle Pass to purchase <strong>the next </strong>Battle Pass, so bear that in mind.</p>

<p>Talking about the most unexpected collaborations, a Borderlands 4 x PGA Tour 2K25 crossover is happening tomorrow. </p>



<p>Borderlands 4 has had a highly successful launch, becoming the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-was-the-best-selling-game-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game</a> in its first month. However, to keep the hype going, the developers will keep adding more content and doing some crossovers as well. And the first crossover has been announced —it’s with another 2K title. </p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-x-pga-tour-2k25-post-teases-new-content-for-the-game">Borderlands 4 x PGA Tour 2K25 Post Teases New Content for the Game</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/borderlands-4-confirms-pga-tour-2k25-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, the official confirmation about the Borderlands 4 and PGA Tour 2K25 crossover comes from the latter’s official <a href="https://x.com/PGATOUR2K/status/1982858198425235500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The official post, however, doesn’t provide any concrete information about the content of this crossover. The only thing confirmed is the release date for the collaboration, set for Wednesday, October 29, 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even though no information about the crossover has been revealed, players can make some predictions based on the image in the announcement post. First things first, it seems like PGA Tour 2K25 players will get their hands on a Psycho skin. On top of that, the character is seen holding a golf club, which includes some form of cybernetic enhancement. Lastly, if the background is a hint, then a new golf course inspired by Kairos might be on the cards as well.</p>



<p>However, this is just speculation based on the teaser image; none of the details have been officially confirmed by the developers. </p>



<p>In other news, a new Borderlands 4 Vault Hunter has been revealed as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-borderlands-4-vault-hunter-revealed-as-part-of-first-dlc-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of the first DLC</a>. Additionally, NBA 2K26 has become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game</a> in the United States.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) employees are reportedly frustrated and even mocking the company internally over its push to use more AI in its development and other areas of work.</p>



<p>According to a new report from Business Insider, higher-ups at EA have<strong> “spent the past year urging its nearly 15,000&nbsp;employees to use AI for just about everything.”</strong> This includes anything from code to concept art to even <strong>“scripting conversations with direct reports about sensitive topics such as pay and promotions.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-employees-are-worried-about-their-jobs">Employees Are Worried About Their Jobs</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Employees who spoke anonymously</a> to the outlet say that they are encouraged to use the in-house chatbot called “ReefGPT”, despite it producing “flawed code and other so-called hallucinations that they need to correct.” Those on the creative side, like character and level design, say that they are expected to train the AI software on their own created work. It’s led to a belief and frustration that these decisions will ultimately lead to the company no longer needing that type of talent, with layoffs to come.</p>



<p>Even one former employee, a senior QA staffer at Respawn, believes that AI was at least partly to blame for his job loss this year. He told the outlet that AI was <strong>“able to perform a key part of his job — reviewing and summarizing feedback from hundreds of play testers.”</strong></p>



<p>This mandate within EA to use AI has even led to mocking among employees. One meme sent within the company Slack, according to Business Insider, depicts the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>A meme posted last month to a Slack channel for employees at Electronic Arts shows a cartoon man asking a trio of CEOs what they want. They answer in unison: “AI!” Then the man asks, “AI to do what?” The CEOs reply, “We don’t know!” The man follows, “When do we want it?” The CEOs cheer again: “Right now!” Dozens of the video-game company’s staff responded with crying laughing emojis.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>EA declined to comment to Business Insider for the story. They also haven’t responded to Insider Gaming’s request for comment. Should any public statement be made, it will be added to this story.</p>
