            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cheating-in-valorant-spiked-during-riots-holiday-break/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the the weeks before and after the start of 2025, when Riot Games employees are taking their annual holiday rest, recorded instances of cheating in VALORANT doubled across all regions. While the rise in cheating is now under control, the spike shows that it is a never-ending battle between developer and cheater.</p>



<p>But how did cheating in VALORANT get so bad during the holiday break? The head of VALORANT’s anti-cheat explained in a <a href="https://x.com/deteccphilippe/status/1883945555102957617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy post</a> yesterday.</p>



<h2 id="h-cheating-in-valorant-reached-historic-levels-in-brazil">Cheating in VALORANT Reached Historic Levels in Brazil</h2>



<p>According to head of VALORANT anti-cheat Phillip “mirageofpenguins” Koskinas, Riot’s holiday break opened the door for cheaters to take advantage. During this time, with less resources and people available to detect cheaters and roll out fixes, “the cheaters that weren’t immediately detected started multiplying.”</p>

<p>From the days before Christmas through the first week of January, the percentage of matches with a cheater detected rose in all regions, but none as dramatically as Brazil. In Brazil, which already had the highest percentage of cheaters of any region, the percentage of matches with a cheater spiked from just under 5% to around 12%. According to Riot, Brazil cheaters regularly use a “pixelbot” that reads the screen, identifies enemy outlines and heads, and then submits mouse events to the OS that points the cheater towards that enemy.</p>



<p>The pixelbot cheats popular amongst Brazil cheaters are supposedly cheap and easy to install, but Riot says they’re also easy to spot. Once the Riot holiday break ended and normal anti-cheat detection resumed, the cheater percentage in Brazil (and other regions) dropped dramatically to a lower level than it was before the break. Riot says the the January 10-13 weekend featured its “highest sustained ban velocity on record, with almost seven suspensions occurring every minute.”</p>



<p>In yesterday’s post, Riot admitted that the fight against cheaters will never end. Because VALORANT is free and there’s little to no barrier to entry, no cheater can be truly permanently exiled. While Riot team remains committed to disrupting cheaters, they also plan to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-2025-new-agents-more-map-variety-ranked-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">implement ranked rollback in the next act</a>, which restore rank rating to players that lost against caught cheaters.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-layoffs-memo-to-staff/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<div><p>Following 185 layoffs and a studio shutdown, Ubisoft has sent an internal memo to staff via its Agoro Newsroom about the recent layoffs, saying that the decision was made due to “finding more efficient operating models and to ensure our long-term success.”</p><p>The internal memo confirms that approximately 65 positions where eliminated at Ubisoft Dusseldorf, approximately 100 roles are effected at Ubisoft Leamington and Ubisoft Reflections, and approximately 20 roles at Ubisoft Stockholm, taking the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-another-studio-185-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">total to 185 people laid off</a>. In addition, Ubisoft’s Leamington site would be shut down.</p></div>



<p>The update reads,</p>



<p>“Jeff Combos, Studio Manager of Ubisoft Dusseldorf, informed the studio yesterday about a plan to reduce its headcount by approximately 65 positions. Most of these reductions would affect production roles currently not assigned to active development for a prolonged period of time. The studios in Berlin and Mainz are not affected.</p>



<p>Also yesterday, Lisa Opie, Managing Director of the UK studios informed the teams about planned restructuring measures aimed at ensuring Reflections’ long-term stability and meeting its financial targets. Approximately 100 roles could be made redundant across Ubisoft Leamington and Ubisoft Reflections. Additionally, this proposal also includes the decision to close the Leamington site.</p>



<p>“I understand the uncertainty these changes will bring. We are committed to supporting everyone who may be impacted during this transition. Let me assure you, these decisions were not made lightly. We believe they are essential to improve our operational efficiency and ensure the long-term sustainability of our studios, the zone and the company,” says Benedikt Grindel, Production Zone 4 Managing Director.</p>



<p>In parallel, Ubisoft Stockholm announced yesterday its plan to reduce approximately 20 roles. This step is necessary to secure the studio’s long-term success and refine the studio strategy.</p>



<p>Individual meetings were held with affected employees yesterday.</p>



<p>“We know that this decision impacts more than just the studio and its projects; it impacts people-our colleagues, teammates, and friends. We deeply understand how difficult this is, and supporting everyone through this transition is our utmost priority,” Thomas Andren, Production Zone 3 and Stockholm studio Managing Director, said yesterday in his message to the team.</p>



<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>



<p>All the team members that are affected have already been informed, and necessary processes are underway depending on the labor laws in each country.</p>



<p>While difficult, the changes announced yesterday are targeted at us finding more efficient operating models and to ensure our long-term success. This is driven by a strong conviction: our ability to keep creating and operating unique, powerful, and popular brands that extend beyond video games.”</p>



<p>Speaking with both current and former employee’s at Ubisoft, it’s currently unclear on if any Ubisoft projects where effected with the recent layoffs. It’s understood that Ubisoft Reflections are primarily developing an unannounced WW2 live-service extraction shooter named CREST, which was supported by some staff at Ubisoft Leamington. Ubisoft Leamington staff where working on Avatar content.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Ubisoft is currently in the process of exploring its options to stay afloat, including a potential deal with&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese company Tencent</a>, where both companies are in talks for a new venture centered around Ubisoft’s current assets.</p>



<p>When asked for comment on whether or not any projects were cancelled, a Ubisoft spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
