<p>Counter-Strike 2 keeps breaking the all-time high record for peak concurrent players on Steam. It seems as though a new record is being set every week at this point, and the latest figure is a <strong>doozy</strong>. Hours ago, the game hit 1.82 million peak players, which represents solid growth since the last time the record was broken with 1.74 million peak players.</p>



<p>As I write this, 1.5 million people around the world are playing Counter-Strike 2. The next top title on Steam is PUBG, the free-to-play battle royale game, which has 659,000 people playing.</p>



<p>Nothing comes close to Counter-Strike 2.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 has secured another peak player record, and at this point, it’s becoming <strong>at least </strong>a monthly affair. More people are playing Counter-Strike than ever before, and it never leaves the top spot on Steam unless something remarkable hits the market, like Palworld.</p>

<p>It doesn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 is also the most popular game on Twitch by a mile, boasting 381,000 concurrent viewers at the time of writing. In second place is Just Chatting, with 316,000 viewers – the next top <strong>game </strong>on Twitch is Dota 2, with 183,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It helps that Counter-Strike 2 has a phenomenally popular esports scene, and that’s where much of the viewership and player count records come from. Most of the top channels on Twitch broadcasting Counter-Strike 2 are co-streaming the ESL Pro League, which is unfolding as you read this.</p>



<p>Whenever a top-tier esports tournament unravels in the Counter-Strike 2 space, it makes people flood the game, all eager to replicate what they’ve seen the best Counter-Strike players do on stream.</p>



<p>When did you last play Counter-Strike 2? Perhaps you’re playing it right now, loading into a match as you read this. Let me know in the comments.</p>
