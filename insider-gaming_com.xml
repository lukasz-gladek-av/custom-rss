<p>A 2026 Roadmap for Battlefield 6 has already been laid out, and it includes news on a RedSec Battle Royale Solo mode, and other changes to the core multiplayer gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-is-uss-best-selling-game-of-2025-year-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> worked, and the series is back with all sorts of bangs. Call of Duty needed competition, and Battlefield 6 stepped up to the plate with a welcome return to full-scale military warfare. The game’s launch, the addition of RedSec, and Season 1 injected Battlefield goodness into everyone’s veins, but there’s plenty more scheduled for 2026.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Another great year beckons. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ‘Battlefield 6 – Community Update – Holiday Wrap-Up’ spoke to the BF community going into Christmas. The player base is expected to grow due to the presence of ‘Xmas noobs,’ and the developer wanted to celebrate ‘an incredible year for the team.’</p>







<p>The blog runs through some obligatory thank you messages to all players—give yourselves a pat on the back—and shares some fascinating numbers. Check out some right here:</p>



<ul>
<li>Played over 1.7 billion matches and logged 383.5 million gameplay hours.</li>



<li>Delivered 12.4 billion kills and 871 million revives.</li>



<li>Destroyed 102 million helicopters and jets.</li>
</ul>



<p>After running through community highlights, it was time for the lowdown on what to expect from 2026.</p>



<p>The team will be “Refining core gameplay, balance, and quality-of-life improvements across Multiplayer, REDSEC, and Portal,” there will be new maps to “introduce fresh tactical opportunities and keep the experience evolving in meaningful ways,” and the developer wants to “Expand Battlefield Labs by bringing more of its experimentation into the live experience.”</p>



<p>Battle Royale players might be interested to hear that BR Solos is still in the pipeline: “We are working through the technical details to deliver it at a quality level that feels right for Battlefield. Once we are confident in the plan and timing, we will share more.”</p>



<p>It’s not a guarantee that it’s happening, but its arrival is likely happening.</p>

<p>This time of year is always an exciting time for those with oodles of subscriptions or memberships to various online platforms, because it’s when all the ‘wrapped’ presentations drop. From Spotify to PlayStation and from LinkedIn to YouTube, many platforms partake in the annual wrapped festival, offering key insights into your year as a subscriber or member.</p>



<p>That is, all except for Xbox. In a recent report, it was claimed that Xbox isn’t providing an ‘Xbox Wrapped’ presentation this year because the company has better things to spend its marketing budget on.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-xbox-wrapped-unfortunately">No Xbox Wrapped, Unfortunately</h2>



<p>There were <em>wrapped </em>presentations hailing from all corners of the gaming world this year. The likes of PlayStation, Steam, Discord, and even Nintendo have provided <strong>some kind </strong>of recap for 2025 in gaming. It was a veritable plethora of data for gamers to absorb, but it’s important to stress it’s all just a bit of fun, with some potential bragging rights tacked on.</p>



<p>In a recent report from Windows Central, it was claimed that Xbox isn’t doing a wrapped celebration this year because there’s far too much happening <strong>next year, </strong>and the marketing budget wouldn’t cover it.</p>



<p>Here’s the snippet <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Jez Corden</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My sources suggest that (as you might expect given that it’s now the 18th), that Xbox is not doing a “Wrapped” this year.</p>



<p>A lot of the “marketing budget” that would’ve typically been allocated to something like an “Xbox Wrapped” is being poured into efforts to celebrate these major milestones for Xbox, its brands, and some of its games.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As professed recently by Xbox ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-developer-direct-promises-huge/">upcoming Developer Direct</a>, there are stacks of milestones landing in 2026. For instance, Xbox is celebrating a quarter-century in the business, while Bethesda is ticking off its 40th birthday.</p>



<p>If you were holding out hope that Xbox was just waiting a bit longer than everyone else to release Xbox Wrapped this year, you’re out of luck.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> how <strong>you think </strong>you did this year within the Xbox ecosystem.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 did not land well with fans. It emerged amidst a <strong>packed </strong>schedule that included titans like ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6, a fact that might have hindered the game’s success beyond all belief. It doesn’t help that the campaign was seen as lacklustre, and the multiplayer platform isn’t what most fans were clamouring for.</p>



<p>In what seems like a bout of recognition of the poor review scores and lack of hype around the latest Call of Duty title, Best Buy has slashed the price. Right now, for one day only, you can get Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for just <strong>$34.99</strong>, barely five weeks after release.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-mighty-are-falling">The Mighty Are Falling</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has been on a generational run of bad luck of late. Last year’s Black Ops 6 was pretty good, but the success found at launch tailed off very quickly. It proved to be a good year across the board for activations and the game’s esports scene, but the series floundered hard and continues to do so, with this year’s release.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 just didn’t hit the mark with fans. It fell short in early reviews and managed to dredge up a Metascore of just 67, with a woeful user rating on the same platform of just 1.6. Those are some of the lowest numbers <strong>ever achieved </strong>by a Call of Duty game.</p>



<p>When you align that with the surrounding titles, such as the uber-impressive ARC Raiders and the revitalization of a franchise in Battlefield 6, you paint a clear picture for Activision and Call of Duty.</p>



<p>COD fatigue is alive and well in late 2025.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-already-half-price-at-most-retailers-barely-a-month-after-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> noticed that Best Buy is selling Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for <strong>one day only </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-playstation-5/JJGXPXZ5GX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for just $34.99</a>. That’s a 50% discount, but it’s not too far from what other retailers are selling the game for.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>also </strong>only <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-g2a-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$35 <strong>right now </strong>on G2A</a>, and that’s not a one-day sale. It’s one of the cheapest places to buy Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Even Activision recently came out and stressed that, going forward, the Call of Duty sub-franchises will not <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-back-to-back-releases/">see back-to-back releases</a>. It failed with Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III, and it has now failed again with Black Ops 6 and Black Ops 7.</p>

<p>Hideo Kojima recently spoke about his upcoming horror title, OD, asking fans to watch the trailer numerous times just to get a hint of what it is about. </p>



<p>For those curious, OD is the upcoming game from Hideo Kojima, developed for Xbox Game Studios. The only information we have about the title is that it will be a horror game, along with additional hints revealed in the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/od-gameplay-reveal-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knock</a>‘ teaser earlier this year. However, it appears that the teaser contained more clues than players initially realized.</p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-talks-about-a-big-hint-in-od-s-trailer">Hideo Kojima Talks About a ‘Big Hint’ in OD’s Trailer</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Xtrend</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/hideo-kojima-says-watch-the-od-teaser-trailer-100-times-and-youll-get-a-big-hint-about-what-his-new-horror-game-actually-is-i-cant-say-anything-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima spoke about rewatching OD’s trailer for hints. Kojima first talks about the game being unlike any other and how, at first glance, OD looks like horror: “but the system it uses isn’t ordinary.” The game director adds that everything is made in a game engine, but it’s a “system like no other”, which is why they built “a completely new medium together with Microsoft.” </p>



<p>Hideo Kojima then went on to say that he can’t reveal more details about OD, or “Mr Phil will be mad at me.” However, if players “watch the teaser trailer many times there’s a hint.” Kojima will not be able to reveal what it is, but if players “watch it 100 times… At the end of the trailer it reads ‘for all players and screamers’. That’s also a big hint.”</p>







<p>In other news, Hideo Kojima isn’t sure <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-doesnt-know-if-od-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether OD will work out</a>. Additionally, the game director has compared AI to smartphones, stating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-compares-ai-to-smartphones-says-theres-no-going-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s no going back</a>.

<p>Yes, cars are being integrated with gaming capabilities over time.

<p>Announced in a new <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Afeela will begin deliveries in California in 2026, becoming the first vehicle with PS Remote Play, allowing users to play their PS5 and PS4 games through the car’s infotainment system. The games are not like cloud gaming; instead, they let players play remotely from their console via the vehicle’s integrated display and premium audio system. Check out what the Representative Director, President, and COO, Sony Honda Mobility Inc., Izumi Kawanishi, had to say: </p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies AFEELA’s vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one. Through this integration, we are elevating the customer’s entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The blog post also reveals that players will need a broadband connection of at least 5 Mbps, and a stable connection of at least 15 Mbps is recommended for a smooth PS Remote Play experience. Additionally, players will require a PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4 to access Remote Play. </p>

<p>Hideo Kojima has made new comments about AI, stating there’s no point in saying things like ‘We shouldn’t use AI’ or ‘AI is useless.’</p>



<p>&nbsp;AI in the gaming industry has been a subject of contention since the community started learning about the new tech. Most recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Larian Game Studios has been under fire</a> for using AI. Now, a highly regarded game director has shared his thoughts on it, revealing there’s no running away from it. </p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-talks-about-embracing-ai-as-there-is-no-going-back">Hideo Kojima Talks About Embracing AI, As There is No Going Back</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Xtrend</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/metal-gear-solid-and-death-stranding-creator-hideo-kojima-thinks-we-cant-go-back-to-a-world-without-ai-smartphones-were-the-same/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima shared his thoughts about AI. Kojima first noted that smartphones were also ‘slated’ by everyone when they first came out, and now we live in a world where “there are so many people who can’t live without their smartphones.” Kojima added that AI is similar to that, and it’s essential “to use technology in a way that will make us happy.”</p>



<p>Kojima also added that there is no point in saying things like ‘We shouldn’t use AI’ or ‘AI is useless.’ There is no going back, and smartphones were the same. Kojima also spoke about the possibility of AI changing how we communicate, helping people who aren’t the best at face-to-face interactions. In the same vein, Kojima also talked about how AI could make humans spoiled, so there should be measures to ”&nbsp;reduce the AI’s involvement, or have days where we don’t use it.”</p>







<p>In other news, Kojima had joined the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-zootopia-2-cameo-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zootopia 2 cast</a> just days before the release. Additionally, the director <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-matrix-game-konami-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could have made a Matrix game</a>, but Konami shut it down.
