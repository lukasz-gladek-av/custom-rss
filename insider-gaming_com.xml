<p>ZeniMax Online Studios has revealed in a recent blog post that, going into 2025, it’ll be <strong>halting </strong>the annual chapter updates that have been running since 2017. It all started with <strong>Morrowind</strong>, and most recently, players got their hands on <strong>Gold Road</strong>.</p>



<p>Going forward, that cadence will change, with the team doing away with the larger chapters that are released every June and focusing on a season-based model. This will allow them to sprinkle content throughout the year, rather than crunching to meet the June deadline for a new chapter every year.</p>



<p>Read on to check out this major change coming to Elder Scrolls Online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shaking-things-up">‘Shaking Things Up’</h2>



<p>In a post on the Elder Scrolls Online site, the game’s studio director, Matt Firor, broke down the chapter changes coming to ESO in 2025.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the end of last year, we gave a slight heads up that we would be shaking things up.</p>



<p>We will still do lots of story content, but now, looking into 2025, we need to concentrate on different types of content to support all types of&nbsp;<em>ESO&nbsp;</em>players. So, we are putting Chapters aside and will be focusing on new types of content, and a new release philosophy.</p>



<p>Over the course of 2025 we will be moving more towards a seasonal content model and away from launching massive content updates once a year, as we did with Chapters. We will be talking much more about this in the future, but in 2025 expect to see named Seasons of three or six months duration with a mix of themed story content,&nbsp;events, store items, dungeons and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This overhaul is designed to free up the development team and reduce the stress of keeping to an annual schedule, which has been running consistently for the last seven years. In <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/67321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post</a>, Firor referenced changes in the gaming industry, player habits, and the rise and fall of competing titles as reasons behind this major update.</p>



<p>To that end, players can stop expecting a major update every year, and instead, they’ll get ‘bite-sized’ content drops every few months.</p>



<p>In Firor’s words, it’s a community-led change that will allow the team to become ‘less predictable’. </p>



<p>There’s an ambitious roadmap shaping up for 2025, though. The team is hard at work on new story content in existing territories, boosting the new-starter experience, and bringing more light to ‘hallmark’ factions like The Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild.</p>



<p>Those changes will come hand-in-hand with UI upgrades, visual enhancements, and tweaks to animations and game performance, as you’d expect. Elder Scrolls Online is now more than ten years old, but ZeniMax Online Studios shows no sign of slowing down when it comes to these enhancements.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nadeshot/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98there%E2%80%99s-no-integrity%E2%80%99-nadeshot-stepping-back-from-cod-because-of-failing-anti-cheat.1064097/</guid>

<p>Nadeshot has stressed on stream that he’s stepping away from Call of Duty to play other games until Black Ops 6’s anti-cheat mechanics are ‘fixed’. In recent weeks, pro players worldwide have been writhing in agony every time they play Ranked on Black Ops 6, because the mode is inundated with cheaters.</p>



<p>Recently, Team RICOCHET – Activision’s anti-cheat team – admitted that it ‘missed the mark’ with Black Ops 6’s anti-cheat ecosystem, and promised that upgrades are on the way, but they’re several weeks in the distance at least.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-exodus">Exodus</h2>



<p>Nadeshot is one of many pro players and streamers giving up on Black Ops 6 after a few weeks of dealing with incessant cheating in Ranked Play. He also cited the ongoing network issues and some of the game’s core bugs.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1869174028822564975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent stream</a>, he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The core mechanics of the game are fun. </p>



<p>I enjoy the movement, I enjoy the gunplay, I enjoy some parts of the foundation of the game, but I can’t play it.</p>



<p>I can’t enjoy it; there’s no integrity. Somebody is cheating or the network sucks or the game is broken.</p>



<p>I don’t enjoy it enough to sit here and play it every day.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For a while, it looked as though Black Ops 6 was serving up a redemption story for the Call of Duty franchise. Now we can see that most players entered a honeymoon period with the title as it was just better than what came before, like last year’s shambolic release in Modern Warfare III.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Nadeshot is stepping away from Call of Duty for other games for the time being

Citing server issues, the game being broken, constant cheaters, and more </span></p></article></div>







<p>Despite the game’s core issues being very public, Activision’s teams seem in no hurry to fix them, and some of the baser issues have been present in the Call of Duty ecosystem for years, such as issues with packet burst across almost every game. </p>



<p>Have you experienced these issues in Black Ops 6? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-dlcs-ever-released/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-best-dlcs-ever-released.1063983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-dlcs-ever-released/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For any fan of gaming, a great title becomes even better when it’s subjected to fantastic post-launch content – and that tends to come in the form of top-shelf DLC. This could be anything from a few missions to an entire sub-campaign some ten or fifteen hours in length. In this list, we’re taking a look at the best DLCs ever released, deciding once and for all what the greatest game expansions are. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-dlcs-ever">Best DLCs Ever</h2>



<p>Here’s our representation of the best DLCs ever released in gaming – let us know in the comments if you agree with this breakdown. </p>



<h3 id="h-1-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring">1. Shadow of the Erdtree (Elden Ring)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was such a phenomenal release that it became a candidate for <strong>Game of the Year</strong> at 2024’s edition of The Game Awards. This stellar piece of DLC brought millions of players back into the fold, all ready to fight notoriously difficult bosses in a brand-new section of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-blood-and-wine-the-witcher-3">2. Blood and Wine (The Witcher 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Blood and Wine was effectively a ‘send-off’ for The Witcher 3, taking place long after the main story was completed (chronologically) and serving as a ‘retirement’ of sorts for our hero, Geralt of Rivia. There’s a fourth-wall break at the end of the expansion that is worthy of a chef’s kiss – one of the best DLCs ever, indeed.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-point-lookout-fallout-3">3. Point Lookout (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Point Lookout is one of the creepiest Fallout DLCs ever, plunging players into a foggy, mutant-infested backwoods county and leaving them to fend for themselves. It was one of the largest expansions Bethesda Game Studios had released at the time, boasting a wide, open map and hours of extra content for the best Fallout game ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-left-behind-last-of-us">4. Left Behind (Last of Us)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left Behind was a poignant, emotional expansion to an already heart-wrenching game. It told the backstory of Ellie and explored the journey she took before becoming bitten and discovering she was immune to the Cordyceps infection in The Last of Us. It was a perfect prequel that offered a few solid hours of gameplay.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-burial-at-sea-bioshock-infinite">5. Burial at Sea (BioShock Infinite)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>BioShock Infinite was released back in 2012 and at the time of writing is the last game in the series. It was a phenomenal and beautiful game that was perfectly expanded upon in Burial at Sea, a two-part DLC that spans BioShock’s in-game ‘multiverse’. It takes players back to Rapture, the instantly recognisable location from BioShock and BioShock 2.</p>







<h3 id="h-6-dragonborn-skyrim">6. Dragonborn (Skyrim)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dragonborn was a massive piece of DLC that took players from the province of Skyrim to Solstheim to face off against an ancient dragon priest with a thirst for power. In this expansion, players travel through the likes of Apocrypha, learn new and powerful abilities, and explore a sizeable and dangerous map. </p>



<h3 id="h-7-nuka-world-fallout-4">7. Nuka-World (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s another Fallout DLC, but honestly, Bethesda Game Studios did such a phenomenal job expanding these games that it deserves another spot on this list of the best DLCs ever. At the end of Fallout 4’s lifecycle, BGS released Nuka-World, an expansion that serves as a perfect endgame, ultimately giving players one last opportunity to make a grand choice to impact their ‘status’ in the game for the final time. </p>







<h3 id="h-8-freedom-cry-aciv-black-flag">8. Freedom Cry (ACIV: Black Flag)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Freedom Cry ultimately arrived on the scene as a standalone expansion, telling the story of Adéwalé, the strong and memorable supporting character from 2013’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. It’s one of the most impressive stories in Assassin’s Creed history, with players assuming the role of this former slave turned pirate turned assassin in an adventure that lasts a good few hours. </p>



<h3 id="h-9-phantom-liberty-cyberpunk-2077">9. Phantom Liberty (Cyberpunk 2077)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Phantom Liberty quite literally changed the face of Cyberpunk 2077, going hand-in-hand with an update so large it was dubbed ‘Cyberpunk 2.0’. Phantom Liberty was a star-studded expansion that introduced an entirely new area of Night City and took players through a story so emotional that it broke hearts worldwide when it wrapped up.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-undead-nightmare-red-dead-redemption">10. Undead Nightmare (Red Dead Redemption)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Undead Nightmare is legendary, and these days, fans of the Red Dead Redemption franchise are wondering why Rockstar Games hasn’t released a new version for RDR2. Released in 2010, Undead Nightmare saw players revisit John Marston, gunslinger extraordinaire, as he attempts to survive a brutal and terrifying zombie outbreak. It was a brilliant expansion that boasted its unique multiplayer modes. </p>

<p>Starfield is a great game, but sometimes, using one of the title’s best commands or cheats can make it a more enjoyable experience. If you’re playing on PC, you can lean on <strong>hundreds </strong>of commands and codes to alter your game – sometimes with hilarious results., In this guide, I’m breaking down the best Starfield cheats and commands, just for you.</p>



<p>I’ll also teach you a trick that’ll allow you to unlock Starfield cheats on Xbox.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-starfield-cheats">How to Use Starfield Cheats</h2>



<p>Call them commands, call them cheats, it doesn’t matter – they’re basically the same thing. On PC, it’s seriously easy to use Starfield commands, and it all begins with tapping the key that sits alongside the ‘1’ on the top left of your keyboard, just beneath the ESC key. It might be a tilde or it could be a ‘grave’ symbol, but whatever it is, it’ll produce the same result.</p>



<p>Once you’ve hit the right key, your on-screen console will pop up and you’ll be able to just type in the Starfield cheats you want to enable, hitting enter and applying them at will. For most of these Starfield commands, you’ll be able to type the same thing into the console again to disable them but bear in mind that any save with cheats applied will be locked out of achievements. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-starfield-commands">Best Starfield Commands</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are hundreds of Starfield cheats, but we’ve broken down what we think are the best ones to use.</p>



<ul>
<li>tgm (Enable godmode)</li>



<li>tdetect (NPCs won’t detect you)</li>



<li>tcl (Noclip – fly through walls)</li>



<li>kah (Kill all hostiles in the area)</li>



<li>resurrect (Resurrect targeted NPC)</li>



<li>unlock (Unlock targeted door or container)</li>



<li>showmenu sleepwaitmenu (Sleep or wait without having to have a bed or seat)</li>



<li>saq (Trigger all quests in the menu – can crash your game)</li>



<li>caq (Complete all quests – will almost certainly crash your game)</li>



<li>SetTestPlanetAndBiome (Creates a ‘test planet’ and biome for testing)</li>



<li>additem (Item ID) (Value) (Add items using a code and value – see below)</li>



<li>player.addperk (perk ID) (Add perks at will)</li>



<li>psb (Unlock all available ‘powers’)</li>



<li>tfc (Toggle free-cam to fly around the map with a camera)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-starfield-commands-item-codes">Starfield Commands – Item Codes</h3>



<p>Here are the best Starfield item codes you’ll need.</p>



<ul>
<li>Credits: 0000000F</li>



<li>Digipicks (Lockpicks): 0000000A</li>



<li>Ship Parts (Repair Ships): 0003FB19</li>



<li>Med Pack: 0000ABF9</li>



<li>Trauma Pack: 0029A847</li>



<li>Regulator (Pistol): 0002CB5F</li>



<li>Coachman (Shotgun): 0026D96B</li>



<li>Magpulse (Rifle): 23606</li>



<li>MagSniper (Sniper): 0002EB45</li>



<li>Sidestar (Pistol): 0026D95D</li>



<li>Old Earth Hunting Rifle (Sniper): 0021BBCD</li>



<li>Peacemaker Spacesuit: 0013F97D</li>



<li>Reactive Experimental Nishina Helmet: 65926</li>



<li>.27 Ammo: 002B559C</li>



<li>Caseless Shotgun Ammo: 002B4AFB</li>



<li>6.5mm Ammo: 002B5590</li>



<li>7.77mm Ammo: 0004AD3E</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-starfield-cheats-on-xbox">How to Use Starfield Cheats on Xbox</h2>



<p>If you want to use Starfield cheats and commands on Xbox, you’ll need to have a PC – that’s the caveat at play. As Starfield is ‘Play Anywhere’, you can access your saves across the two different platforms. That means you can open Starfield on PC, enable the cheats, then boot up your save on Xbox, and the commands and cheats will still be applied. </p>



<p>Again, this will still disable achievements and can result in a corrupted save or crashed game. </p>
