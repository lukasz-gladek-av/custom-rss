<p>Battlestate Games has skipped over the issues plaguing one of the rarest rewards in Escape from Tarkov and just issued a code that will give you <strong>Nikita’s voicelines </strong>instantly in the spearhead extraction shooter title. This is in response to waves of people complaining that Twitch drops, which are supposed to unlock the voice, simply aren’t working as intended.</p>



<p>If you want to unlock Nikita Buyanov’s voicelines in Escape from Tarkov, the code you need is right down below.</p>







<h2 id="h-nikita-voice-code-for-escape-from-tarkov">Nikita Voice Code for Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>If you want to unlock Nikita’s voicelines in Escape from Tarkov, you need to use the following code: <strong>WILWILBE</strong>.</p>



<p>Like any other code, this <span>can be redeemed via the escapefromtarkov.com site&nbsp;<strong>or&nbsp;</strong>through</span> the launcher. Once you’ve entered the code, you’ll be met with a <strong>green message </strong>if it worked, just like the one below:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, there’s a huge catch. You’ve only got <strong>three days </strong>until the code becomes invalid, so if you’re reading this guide after December 2nd or 3rd, you’re out of luck, and you might never get the voicelines.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov recently launched into a 1.0 state after more than a decade in development. It was the biggest milestone in the game’s history, but it was somewhat marred by network issues, server instability, and a hefty assortment of bugs, all of which led to Battlestate Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bsg-apologize-escape-from-tarkov-launch-problems/">issuing a public apology</a>.</p>



<p>That being said, the game has now become more accessible and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-getting-easier-first-time-decade/">easier for newcomers</a>, and in our recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-review-ultimate-extraction-shooter/">Escape from Tarkov review</a> (which scored maximum marks), we wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Through thick and thin, Escape from Tarkov has prevailed. It’s an enormous, deep, and rich game that’s still evolving, it offers unparalleled emotional experiences, and it looks, sounds, and feels great while doing all that. It’s the most punishing game you’ll ever play, but if you put enough hours into understanding this gem of a title, you’ll come to appreciate that it is a generational masterpiece of the extraction shooter market.</p>
