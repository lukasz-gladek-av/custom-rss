<p>Retailers are expecting that they will run out of pre-order units for the Nintendo Switch 2 on day 1, despite Nintendo allegedly accumulating a large quantity for launch.</p>



<p>That’s according to internal emails and documents provided to Insider Gaming from a large US retailer, who are anticipating they will sell out of the Switch 2 on the same day they open up the pre-orders due to a limited unit allocation from Nintendo.</p>



<p>According to the documents, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 is scheduled to release in June</a>, a release month that has already been a widely rumoured and was a highly talked about by developers at this year’s GDC.</p>



<p>However, the documents do add a little confusion as to when the pre-orders go live, especially following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Buy Canada “leak” </a>earlier this week that revealed they’d go live on April 2nd.</p>



<p>According to the documents from the US retailer, pre-orders are set to go live on April 9th, one week after the Nintendo Switch 2 direct. The documents include a messaging strategy following the direct to include “Pre-Order Coming Soon” messaging and a Countdown Clock that will end on April 9, with an exact time to be confirmed by Nintendo on April 2.</p>



<p>The documents also included details on a exclusive collectible coin for those who pre-order the console.</p>



<p>Whether or not Best Buy Canada’s “leak” was a mistake or not is unclear, but the company did promptly remove the information after it started circulating online. In any case though, pre-order’s are almost certainly going to live within a week of the direct.</p>

<p>Developer Pearl Abyss has announced that it is ending support for Black Desert Online on last-gen consoles.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.console.playblackdesert.com/News/Notice/Detail?boardNo=19140&amp;countryType=en-US&amp;boardType=0&amp;searchType=&amp;searchText=%C2%A4tPage=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video going over</a> the plans, the studio revealed that the game’s native update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will launch on June 26, 2025. At that point, the game will “shift to an exclusive PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S service”. This will result in support for the game on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4—both of which received the game in 2019—officially coming to an end.</p>



<p>“Gameplay on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will no longer be available after the porting update on June 26,” said Brian Choi, Black Desert console’s live service manager.</p>



<p>He continued to assure players that all game data will be saved and stored. Account information as well as all entitlements to Black Desert Online will be accessible when players decide to make the jump to the current-gen console version of the game.</p>

<p>“We understand that this news may be disappointing to many of you,” Choi said. “Black Desert has been consistently updated to provide a better experience for adventurers. However, as we mentioned in our previous video, despite the ongoing efforts to optimize and update content for older generation consoles, we have reached the point where hardware limitations make it increasingly difficult to deliver the latest content smoothly.”</p>



<p>When the update is released, it will be available at no additional cost for players who are making the jump to the current-gen systems.</p>
