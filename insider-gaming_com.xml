<p>A new PlayStation patent describes a controller that can be charged with solar energy, which might solve all your battery-related problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-solar-power-controllers/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJIDShleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHVwVHGQueVMZZupV-8DT_-KIESWvFQMimNqN7_WL90EACfvjRBhqzmNO1g_aem_pn2iGOc8pztrFDDWfs47hQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment has published a new patent called ‘<a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025046814&amp;_cid=P21-M80ZRL-19120-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Operation Device</a>’. The patent is for a PlayStation controller that features “a plurality of photovoltaic elements” on its housing and a storage area that “accumulates power generated by the plurality of photovoltaic elements”, which in turn will charge the device with solar energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The diagrams provided on the website suggest that the photovoltaic elements will be placed on the top half of the body, around the analogue sticks and the different buttons. This controller can then be placed under sunlight to charge itself.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has also mentioned the problem they are trying to solve with the solar-powered PlayStation controller. Sony has stated that a conventional controller needs a replaceable or rechargeable battery to run, and without this power source, it cannot operate. With their new patent, they wish to solve this problem with technology that charges a controller’s secondary or primary battery through an external power source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first patent PlayStation has published. Last year, we saw a controller concept <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-new-patent-reveals-a-controller-concept-with-conductive-ink/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that uses conductive ink</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-adaptive-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s one-handed ‘adaptive joystick</a>’ controller is now available. What are your thoughts on a solar-powered PlayStation controller? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Atomfall’s world has fallen into chaos and is a windswept wreck thanks to the Windscale disaster. You need to venture into the game to explore and exterminate threats if you hope to complete the Atomfall Trophy list and dust off all Trophies and Achievements along the way.</p>



<p>Rebellion’s 2025 is a hot one with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>. Resistance is a one-man crusade through Nazi-occupied France, whereas Atomfall is an alternate-history England where the infamous Windscale nuclear disaster turned out to have more serious consequences than we all thought.</p>



<p>We’ve called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-played-again-most-anticipated-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall one of our most anticipated games of the year</a>. The setting, the subplots, and the scarily eerie nature of its world all play a factor. There’s a lot to uncover, and you need to undertake a heavy workload for the Atomfall Trophy List.</p>



<p><strong>Spoiler Warning: Atomfall’s list has hidden Trophies and Achievements. We will show you the known objectives first, and it’s up to you if you want to see the rest.</strong></p>

<figure><figcaption>Alright, guv’nor? Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://atomfall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Atomfall</a> Trophy List is split in two—like an atom. You have Achievements and Trophies that appear the second you start up the RPG. But, closer inspection reveals that half of the accomplishments are hidden.</p>



<p>Here’s every Trophy and Achievement shown from the beginning.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Atomfall Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</th><th data-align="center">How to Earn</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pride of Britain</td><td data-align="center">Unlock all other trophies</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Detectorist</td><td data-align="center">Pick up the metal detector</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Where there’s muck there’s brass</td><td data-align="center">Find 10 metal detector caches</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Packed lunch</td><td data-align="center">Find 5 buried lunchboxes</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Avid Collector</td><td data-align="center">Find 10 comics</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Radiophonic</td><td data-align="center">Find 5 audio logs</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mate’s Rates</td><td data-align="center">Find 5 traders in the Quarantine Zone</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">We Want Information</td><td data-align="center">Read 50 notes in the Quarantine Zone</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Refer to Manual</td><td data-align="center">Learn 12 skills</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Orna mental</td><td data-align="center">Find and destroy 10 Garden Gnomes</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Homemade</td><td data-align="center">Find and learn 10 recipes</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Make do and mend</td><td data-align="center">Upgrade a firearm to pristine condition</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Fast Bowl</td><td data-align="center">Kill 10 enemies with a thrown weapon</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hit for Six</td><td data-align="center">Redirect a thrown grenade with the cricket bat</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Burglar</td><td data-align="center">Use the Signal Redirector to unlock 5 doors</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Batteries Not Included</td><td data-align="center">Power up a deactivated robot</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Caught Red-handed</td><td data-align="center">Cause an enemy to drop their Molotov cocktail</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Target Practice</td><td data-align="center">Get 6 kills with the MK.VI Revolver without reloading</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Grand Slam</td><td data-align="center">Take out at least 5 enemies in one explosion</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">High Tea</td><td data-align="center">Consume a Cornish pasty, English tea, and a slice of cake in 30s</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-atomfall">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements in Atomfall?</h2>



<p><strong>A grand total of 37 PlayStation Trophies and 36 Xbox Achievements await you in Atomfall.</strong></p>



<p>Veteran hunters know why there’s a notable difference between PlayStation and Xbox. But if you’re new to this game, PlayStation users are awarded a Platinum Trophy for earning all 36 other Trophies. Microsoft hasn’t implemented a similar system yet, but you still get a hefty amount of Gamerscore instead.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-might-have-set-a-record-with-endgame-credits.1141248/</guid>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is enormous in more ways than one. It has a gigantic open-world map, a staggering array of enemies to assassinate, and branching skill paths spread across two playable characters. It also has a stream of endgame credits that scroll up your screen for a whopping <strong>two hours</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s right – the credits that roll at the end of Assassin’s Creed Shadows will occupy two whole hours of your life if you intend on watching them through to the end, which is a painful thing for any developer wanting to wait around to catch their name in the mix.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-speed-it-up">Speed It Up</h2>



<p>Admittedly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has a two-hour roll of credits because the text goes by so slowly – for no real reason.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, Video Game Credits captured the PC credits and uploaded the full segment to YouTube, with the video totalling <strong>three and a half hours</strong>. The soundtrack that plays behind the credits is pretty impressive, but nobody needs to wait around that long to catch their name.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows (Credits) (Windows)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5VYcPXnuDA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>For reference, Video Game Credits has documented the following feature-length credits segments:</p>



<ul>
<li>GTA V Enhanced – 01h08m</li>



<li>Hearts of Iron IV – 01h06m</li>



<li>Gangstar New Orleans – 01h07m</li>



<li>Battlefield 2042 – 1h15m</li>



<li>The Sims 2: Ultimate Collection – 1hr19m</li>
</ul>



<p>Don’t worry, though. You can speed up the credits by tapping (and holding) fast-forward, just in case you want to scroll through to a team you perhaps worked on for a nice social media snapshot.</p>



<p>If anything, it’s indicative of the sheer scope of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which is going down in reviews as one of the best games the series has seen in many years. It’s great, but it’s not perfect, and if I had to put a number on it, I’d say it’s an 8 out of 10.</p>



<p>The game has had a couple of issues since being released on March 20, though. For instance, a day one patch was released that stripped the ability to damage shrines, which was in response to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/">the Japanese government</a> expressing concerns about ‘imitation attacks’ at shrines across the country.</p>



<p>Do you plan on watching the entire Assassin’s Creed Shadows credits roll? Let me know in the comments why you would and what’s wrong with you.</p>
