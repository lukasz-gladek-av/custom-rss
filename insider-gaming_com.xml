<p>After 11 years, Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 5 continues to do well with players. Not only is it the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-stream-most-popular-in-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most popular game on stream</a>, but GTA 5’s sales continue to reach milestones.</p>



<p>During its <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest earnings call</a> on November 6, Take-Two Interactive announced that GTA 5 sales have passed 205 million copies in its 11-year lifespan. That total is up by five million from the 200 million copies announced during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings.</p>







<p>As a whole, the GTA franchise has sold over 435 million copies.</p>



<p>In addition to the sales success of GTA 5 and elsewhere, Take-Two praised GTA Online, which continued to be a major point for the company despite its age. According to the company, GTA Online continues to be one of the “largest contributors” to their net bookings despite expectations of a decline.</p>



<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that GTA Online has continued to “outperform expectations” thanks to updates and “sustained engagement”.</p>



<p>What do you think of GTA 5 continuing to sell well despite GTA 6 being on the horizon? Join the discussion below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. </p>

<p>Clay is an essential resource in Stardew Valley. While it isn’t used in the Community Center bundles or as gifts to the villagers, it is still used in construction and crafting. It is one of the most overlooked resources, as it isn’t prevalent like stone, wood, and fiber. Let us show you how to obtain clay quickly in your Stardew Valley playthrough!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-clay-in-stardew-valley">How to Get Clay in Stardew Valley</h2>



<p>Clay can be obtained in multiple ways. The tricky-to-find resource can be found by:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tilling dirt (on your farm, throughout Pelican Town, and within the mines)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tilling sand on the beach</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tilling Artifact spots</strong></li>



<li><strong>When opening Geodes at Clint’s shop</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mining clay nodes at the Ginger Island Dig Site</strong></li>



<li><strong>As a gift from Jas, Vincent, or Leo during the Feast of the Winter Star</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vincent sells clay at the Desert Festival shop for a single Calico Egg</strong></li>



<li><strong>Your pet dog may gift you clay once it reaches maximum friendship</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While some of these methods are purely chance, like characters or pets gifting the resource to you, others take more work. For example, tilling dirt, sand, and artifact spots will take you time, and it’s not guaranteed you’ll find clay with every use of your hoe. Of course, tilling the land for clay becomes easier as you upgrade your hoe to higher qualities and can till multiple spaces simultaneously. Out of all the places to dig and till for clay, it is recommended to do so in the mines, as tilling the dirt there can also yield cave carrots, and bombs can be placed to help unearth things faster in the mines.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-you-need-clay-in-stardew-valley">Why You Need Clay in Stardew Valley</h2>



<p>As mentioned, clay isn’t used in any Community Center bundles and isn’t a liked gift. So why bother with it? Well, it’s vital for crafting and construction, of course! To build a silo, an essential building on your farm, if you intend to keep animals, you’ll need ten clay, 100 stone, five copper bars, and 100 gold.</p>



<p>In addition to the construction of a silo, clay is also needed to craft: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Quality Retaining Soil</strong></li>



<li><strong>Garden Pots</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brick Floors</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fiber Seeds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Deluxe Retaining Soil</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bone Mills</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dehydrator</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Some of these items aren’t essential for a playthrough, but you’ll find they can make life on your farm much more manageable.</p>

<p>How often do you make an uninformed purchasing decision regarding video games? Many people wait for reviews—critic and user reviews—before buying a full-price game. Some people refuse to pay the full price. They’ll want for a sale in six to twelve months. But sometimes, you can’t help but play on day one. So, let’s explore a few notable Planet Coaster 2 reviews, many of which offer varying opinions on the theme park management game from Frontier Developments!</p>



<h2 id="h-planet-coaster-2-reviews-paint-a-vivid-picture">Planet Coaster 2 Reviews Paint a Vivid Picture</h2>



<p>If you look on the Planet Coaster 2 Metacritic, you’ll find the park management game currently sits at a ‘Generally Favorable’ score of 82, following 14 critic reviews since its launch on November 6 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. There are notable game reviews from IGN, PC Gamer, TheGamer, and plenty of other outlets that spent a bit of time with the title pre-launch. Here’s a rundown to help you decide whether it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/planet-coaster-2-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worth paying full price</a>!</p>







<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-coaster-2-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Despite how much I enjoy the act of building my ideal park, the original Planet Coaster was neither challenging nor interesting as a management tycoon game, and that has unfortunately not changed. Even after messing with the difficulty settings, of which there are several, I found it almost mindlessly simple to generate infinite money with a small number of flat rides and a high entry fee.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/planet-coaster-2-review-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Overall, Planet Coaster 2 feels like a natural evolution of the first game. Lessons have been learned, features added, mechanics improved, and the customisation of difficulty across the board – career mode has flexible difficulty levels which can be set on a per-scenario basis – really helps tailor the game to your level of experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/planet-coaster-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Structurally, Planet Coaster 2 differs little from the first. You can fix and fiddle with partially built parks in career mode, or construct your own from scratch in variations upon the sandbox. These include unrestrained creativity where money and space are no object, and the more moderated Challenge mode where at least some management skills are required.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/planet-coaster-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 is an ambitious sequel that expands sideways upon the foundation laid by its predecessor. The graphics are stunning, the water slide additions are fun, and the creative potential is immense, but it comes at a cost. The complexity of infrastructure systems interrupts the creative flow, making the impressively customizable experience feel unnecessarily convoluted at times.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/142057/planet-coaster-2-review-score" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShackNews</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>While I was playing Planet Coaster 2 for this review, I kept thinking about RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. Frontier Developments’ initial crack at theme park building and management simulation shares many ideas with their latest attempt. Tinkering with rollercoasters and waterparks in 2024 conjured a sort of nostalgia for this kind of game I didn’t think I’d have. And so, with a heavy heart, I tell you that they got me again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/planet-coaster-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameGrin</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Planet Coaster 2</em>&nbsp;is one of the pinnacles of the theme park simulator genre and while it doesn’t have a smooth learning curve for newcomers, it’s safe to say that those who have already mastered its systems will enjoy it immensely, with the ability to create anything you want the way you like it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now that you’ve seen the critic reviews, why not check out the game yourself? While you can’t play on Game Pass, it is available on Steam, PlayStation Store, and Xbox Store.

<p>If you’re already paying for Xbox Game Pass monthly, doesn’t it make sense to check out every new release to see if it’s available? Why would you spend extra to check out a new game? Unfortunately, it feels like it’s becoming rare for day-one releases on Game Pass. For example, will we see Planet Coaster 2 on Game Pass? It’s likely, but not yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-planet-coaster-2-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Planet Coaster 2 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As of this writing, <strong>Planet Coaster 2 is not yet available on Xbox Game Pass</strong>. Could it happen? Sure! Developer Frontier launched the original Planet Coaster on day one on Game Pass, but they only announced its inclusion 24 hours before launch day. We didn’t get the same notification for its sequel, though. A quick look through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-titles-november-2024-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current Game Pass catalog reveals</a> that, unfortunately, the theme park management sim isn’t available to download for subscribers.</p>



<p>Sadly, the original Planet Coaster is no longer available on Xbox Game Pass. To enjoy Frontier’s unique and colorful management franchise, you must buy a copy. After spending an hour with it after lunch on launch day, I can tell you the sequel is much-improved and genuinely entertaining!</p>

<p>If you can’t wait to get your hands on Planet Coaster 2—I can’t blame you—then you can buy a copy on:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a></li>

<p>There is currently no word on whether the theme park construction and management game will release on Xbox Game Pass, and it appears rather unlikely for now, but at $49.99 for the standard edition, it’s worth the asking price. Most people who fall in love with these types of games tend to enjoy them for hundreds of hours over the years, especially once DLC and mod support really kicks off!</p>

<p>I won’t go into a full-length review of Planet Coaster 2 here, but after spending a little time with it, I can offer first impressions. As someone who spent hundreds of hours playing the original Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo from developer Frontier, I think the sequel to the theme park game is a vastly improved and fun experience overall. </p>



<p>For the most part, the building felt far more intuitive and freeform, allowing me to move and resize entire setpieces to my liking and tweak minute details easily. So, if you lean heavily into freeform and creative construction, you’ll love Planet Coaster 2.</p>



<p>Just be wary of the copious amounts of DLC likely on its way for the game!</p>
