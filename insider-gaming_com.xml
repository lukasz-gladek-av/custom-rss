<p>It’s shaping up to be another big year for Nintendo, and one of the earliest releases of 2026 is the 3.0 update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons and the Switch 2 edition, with the full details of the release date and start times in this guide.</p>



<p>Though it turns six in Spring, having initially released in March 2020, New Horizons continues to be one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-nintendo-switch-games-to-gift-christmas-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Switch games available</a>, and the drop of new content will keep fans occupied until the inevitable release of the next game in the Animal Crossing series.</p>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting the Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update and Switch 2 edition, Insider Gaming has all the release date details, along with the expected start times.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo announced the Switch 2 edition of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and the accompanying 3.0 free update, will be released simultaneously on January 15.</strong></p>



<p>The Switch 2 edition brings graphics enhancements, including 4k resolution, to the game, alongside online support for up to 12 players at a time, a 3x increase on the maximum number of players supported in the game on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Those without a Switch 2 console will still benefit from the update, however, as there’s an array of new content to enjoy, including the Resort Hotel with customizable rooms, tasks to craft special island goods, expanded storage space, and new collaboration items with the likes of LEGO, Nintendo, The Legend of Zelda, and Splatoon.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-amp-switch-2-edition-release">What Time Does Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 &amp; Switch 2 Edition Release?</h2>



<p><strong>The exact start time for the release of the Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update and Switch 2 edition has not been confirmed. However, previous update times suggest the new content will be available from 8 pm ET on January 14.</strong></p>



<p>The January 15 date covers the Japanese release of the update, which means players in the United States should be able to play on the evening of January 14, while those in the UK and Europe will likely see the update drop in the early hours of the morning of January 15.</p>



<p>The estimated release time is based on previous major Animal Crossing: New Horizons updates, including the 2.0 edition; however, that release was almost four years ago, so the timings could be tweaked. This article will be updated if an official release time is confirmed.</p>
