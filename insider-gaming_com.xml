<p>ARC Raiders just keeps on growing, hitting a new milestone in 2026 of over 12 million copies sold, and the devs are offering a free gift to players to celebrate the occasion. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders is definitely one of the most popular releases in 2025, and is still going strong into the new year. The player base also includes a dedicated bunch, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-million-arc-raiders-players-wiped-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 million completing their first Expedition Project</a>. Now, you can grab a free gift for helping the game reach this milestone. </p>











<p>As revealed through the official ARC Raiders <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the developers have confirmed that they have seen “over 12 million Raiders ascend from Speranza to raid the Rust Belt.” The dev team had crafted a special gift to celebrate hitting 10 million players, and this free thank-you gift is a Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool. Any player who has logged in since launch until January 13, 23:59 CET, will receive this gift once the latest update is released. </p>



<p>Since its release, ARC Raiders has slowly and steadily cemented its position as one of the best extraction shooters ever released. <span>Last week, a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank">sales estimate</a>&nbsp;for the</span> game was released, stating that the title had already surpassed 12 million units across Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox. This seemingly helped Embark Studios rake in a whopping $350 million and reach a daily active user count of 3.2 million. </p>







<p>In other news, ARC Raiders players are complaining about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bans-false-block-banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">false account blocks and bans</a>. Additionally, we recently caught a glimpse of what ARC Raiders might have looked like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-first-person-works-well-new-clip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if it were a first-person shooter</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Fired Rockstar Devs Denied Pay While Legal Battle Goes On]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new report, it has been revealed that a UK judge has outright <strong>denied </strong>the 31 fired Rockstar employees interim pay while they tussle with the firm and Take-Two over what they claim was an unfair dismissal. Last year, 31 employees in the United Kingdom were fired from Rockstar Games in one sweep, with the gaming titan claiming that they were leaking confidential information.</p>



<p>Following the sweep, it emerged that Rockstar may have been fighting back against unionization, targeting employees who joined the IWGB union in the United Kingdom. Rockstar has categorically denied these claims.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-s-dismissed-devs-won-t-get-pay">Rockstar’s Dismissed Devs Won’t Get Pay</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a>, it was stated that the UK’s Judge Frances Eccles had <strong>denied </strong>a plea for interim pay for the 31 former Rockstar Games developers. This interim pay would have allowed these employees to jump back on the company’s payroll while the situation with the mass dismissal was being handled through legal channels.</p>



<p>It was stated by the judge that the fired employees could not demonstrate their case enough to have a ‘pretty good chance of success’ at proving they were dismissed in a union-busting effort.</p>



<p>The judge wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>In all the circumstances, the tribunal was unable to conclude that it appears likely that the tribunal will find that the principal reason for the claimants’ dismissal was their membership of the IWGB</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that it’s <strong>unlikely </strong>that the dismissed employees will have the court weigh in their favor over the union-busting allegations. It’s another angle of support for Rockstar’s suggestion that the employees were leaking confidential information.</p>



<p>Days ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-devs-fired-over-leaks-sent-to-influencers-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar claimed</a> that the employees were dismissed because they were leaking information about ‘upcoming and unannounced titles’ to influencers on social channels, including a Discord server.</p>



<p>That server has become the biggest point of contention. The company explained that <strong>25 non-Rockstar employees</strong>, including former workers, competing developers, and even <strong>a video game journalist, </strong>were in that server. This gave them unimpeded access to critical information about Grand Theft Auto 6 and other games.</p>



<p>The court’s ruling now locks these former employees out of any pay while they attempt to resolve the situation with Rockstar Games.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nvidia CEO Says AI “Doomer Narrative” Is “Hurtful”]]></title>

            <guid>1403944</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants everyone to stop being so negative about AI. </p>



<p>The head of the company with the $4.502 trillion market cap—the highest in the world—feels that people spreading a “doomer narrative” are only doing harm to the industry.</p>







<p>Speaking on a recent episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">No Priors podcast</a>, Huang was asked about the idea of “God AI” and the stigma that’s surround the growth of the technology as a whole. </p>



<p>Regarding God AI, Huang doesn’t see researchers “having any reasonable ability to create god AI.” </p>



<p>“The ability&nbsp;to understand human language, genome language, and molecular language and protein language and amino-acid language and physics language all supremely well—that god AI just doesn’t exist,” he says. </p>



<p>He continues to say that there are a lot of industries that “need” AI, which he calls “just the next computer industry”. Huang says that while this God AI isn’t coming next week or next year, the “whole world needs to move forward next week, next year, next decade.”</p>



<p><strong>“I think that the idea of a monolithic, gigantic company, country, nation-state is just…super unhelpful, it’s too extreme,” </strong>he said. <strong>“If you want to take it to that level, we should just stop everything…what’s the point?”</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-a-continued-fear-of-ai">A Continued Fear Of AI</h2>



<p>With the growth of AI continuing at a rapid pace, there are many people out there who are completely against the idea. Whether it be for the fear of losing jobs or the ability to create believable falsehoods, you don’t have to go far to find someone with a negative opinion on the technology. </p>



<p>To that notion, Huang feels that the constant negativity from the general public and prominent figures has been <strong>“extremely hurtful”.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“I think we’ve done a lot of damage lately with very well-respected people who have painted a doomer narrative, end of the world narrative, science fiction narrative,”</strong> he said. <strong>“And I appreciate that most of us grew up enjoying science fiction, but it’s not helpful.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“It’s not helpful to people, it’s not helpful to the industry, it’s not helpful to society, it’s not helpful to the governments.”</strong></p>







<p>Huang then continued to question what the purpose of that type of narrative and what the intentions are of those who spread it. </p>



<p>Of course, the feeling around AI is going to continue to be division both in the general population and within the games industry. Just recently, the use of generative AI resulted in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 seeing its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of the Year award at the Indie Game Awards</a> stripped away. </p>
