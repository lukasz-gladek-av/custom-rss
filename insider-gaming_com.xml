<p>If you’ve been waiting for the chance to play Baldur’s Gate 3 on the go on your Nintendo Switch 2 console, you’re going to want to sit down for this. It’s not happening.</p>



<p>Taking part in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit on Friday, Larian Studios’ Swen Vincke was asked about the game possibly being ported to Nintendo’s latest system. His answer, immediately shut the door on it. </p>







<p><strong>“We would have loved to, but it wasn’t our decision to make,”</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vincke wrote</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-won-t-it-come-to-switch-2">Why Won’t It Come To Switch 2?</h2>



<p>As a follow up to Vincke’s confirmation, known leaker NateTheHate, who had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-could-potentially-come-to-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed in the past</a> there was a possibility to bring the game to Nintendo, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2009691766191165501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gave a bit more insight</a> into why it’s not coming.</p>



<p><strong>“While Larian would love to bring Baldur’s Gate 3 to the Switch 2… their relationship with Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast is not healthy,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Late last year, I heard [Baldur’s Gate 3] for [Switch 2] was no happening….”</strong></p>







<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 first launched in Early Access in August 2020. The full release of the game came in August 2023 on PC. The game would then come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later that year. It would also receive regular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-major-baldurs-gate-3-update-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates until April 2025</a>, when the last major patch was released.</p>



<p>While Baldur’s Gate 3 coming to Switch 2 may not be happening, that doesn’t mean Larian isn’t working on what’s next. The studio is in-development of the next game in the Divinity franchise, which, as part of the same AMA, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/">won’t feature any sort of generative AI</a> artwork.</p>

<p>Layoffs in the video game world seemingly wait for no one. According to recent posts on social media, Warner Bros. Games held layoffs in December at its San Francisco location.</p>



<p>The layoffs, which were first reported on by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-warner-bros-games-eliminates-roles-at-san-francisco-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, point to a number of LinkedIn posts from, now former, employees at the company. Two such employees impacted by the cuts were the San Francisco studio’s Art Director and Director of Design.</p>







<p><strong>“It’s been a helluva ride but all good things must come to an end,”</strong> former Art Director Roland Herran wrote. <strong>“Just wrapped up my time at WB Games San Francisco last month- unfortunately hit by, you guessed it, layoffs. Super appreciative and proud of everything we accomplished at the studio in the last 11 years.”</strong></p>



<p>Tony Perkins, former director of design, said, <strong>“Loved my time here with the San Francisco team and the project we worked on is awesome and something I am super proud of. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Unfortunately, the stars didn’t align, and a great game didn’t find the success it needed!”</strong></p>



<p>There’s no word as to what specific game Perkins is referencing in his statement.</p>







<p>Warner Bros. Games San Francisco has been around since 2013. As a studio, it primarily focused on free-to-play and mobile games over the years.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. Games for more context surrounding the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article. </p>



<p>Currently, Warner Bros. Games is part of a potential sale of that side of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business over to Netflix</a>. Rival company Paramount has continued to make efforts in a “hostile takeover” bid, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-expected-to-reject-paramounts-latest-offer-sticking-with-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been rejected</a> multiple times. </p>
