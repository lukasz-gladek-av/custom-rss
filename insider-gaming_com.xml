<p>The Janitor’s Ending is the second escape route in Dig To Escape. Instead of digging forever to escape your cell, you can simply buy the Keycard and escape through the janitor’s room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This method is not only faster but also demands stealth in the second part of the escape, where you must collect Batteries. Players must also save a staggering 200 Toilet Paper to purchase the Illegal Keycard in the first place. You are advised to dig and even out the surface rectangularly instead of digging a hole straight down. This way, you’ll clear the entire layer and scavenge all available items using your basic spoon Shovel. This guide will explain more about the Janitor’s Ending, important tips, and the late-game scenario.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your primary objective is to save 200 Toilet Paper, the amount required to purchase the Illegal Keycard.</li>



<li>When digging, clear the ground in a rectangular pattern rather than digging straight down. This method helps you find a lot more items, then sell them to earn a minimum of 20–30 Toilet Paper per day.</li>



<li>Trade only for energy-based items (food), as maintaining your digging stamina is essential for quick progression in Dig To Escape.</li>



<li>With consistent digging, eating, and selling, you should be able to save 200 Toilet Paper within roughly 10 in-game days.</li>



<li>Avoid spending Toilet Paper on Energy Surge upgrades, extra Storage, or new Shovels, these are unnecessary for completing this specific escape route.</li>



<li>Do not trespass at night to trade or sell items. The guard patrols aggressively and may easily catch you. Instead, take advantage of the vent system, slip out during the “Afternoon” hour, and use the vent in the main hallway, which gives you access to four nearby cells.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The vent inside your own cell leads to the prison restroom. From there, you can reach both the Janitor’s Room and the adjacent Security Room.</li>



<li>One of the four NPC prisoners will eventually offer the Illegal Keycard for sale. On Hard difficulty, expect the Keycard to appear only after 15–17 days of trading cycles.</li>



<li>Once you’ve saved the required 200 Toilet Paper, purchase the Illegal Keycard.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Wait until morning before making your escape via the Janitor’s room. Escaping at night is risky because the Dig To Escape guard patrols the hall, and getting caught ends the run.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Equip the Keycard, walk up to the lock, and scan it using the interact button.</li>



<li>Grab the ladder, equip it, and carry it over to the Janitor’s room.</li>



<li>Place the ladder right under the vent.</li>



<li>Open the vent, climb the ladder, and crawl inside.</li>



<li>Your prisoner will end up in a small room with a small switchboard, while a guard patrols the hall outside with a flashlight.</li>

<p>You need to be careful and precise with your movement. The guard in this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-midnight-chasers-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game has unorthodox pathing and can easily ruin your escape if you’re not alert. You must collect 12 Batteries and place them inside the switchboard to restore power and escape. The Batteries don’t have fixed spots, they spawn in random places throughout the hall and the rooms connected to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the rooms needs the Keycard, so be ready to equip it and scan the door immediately. Don’t waste time on interactions here because the guard is very fast. Preplan your route first, then act. There’s also a cheeky trick where you can insert Batteries through the wall by standing in the room next to the switchboard. This bug saves you from entering the actual switchboard room.</p>







<p>Batteries usually spawn in a few common spots: the second room on the middle table near the monitor, on the circular table at the end of the hall, along the cabin path, and inside the room you open with the Keycard. Just move safely, stay patient, and gather all 12 Batteries to restore power.</p>

<p>Once you’ve inserted all 12 Batteries into the Switchboard and the power comes back, wait for the guard to move away from the left side of the hall. When the path is clear, make a run towards the bright open elevator to complete Dig To Escape. After you enter, the “JANITOR ENDING” screen will pop up along with your Dig To Escape gameplay time.</p>
