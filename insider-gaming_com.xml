<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 roadmap has revealed new multiplayer maps, modes, additional equipment, and multiplayer ranked play changes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-maps">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Maps</h2>



<p>In Black Ops 6 season 3, players can check out five new maps and a variant. Barrage is a 6v6 medium-sized Core map set in 1968 Vietnam. Nomad is a 6v6/2v2 small-sized Strike map where players battle in the ruins of a fortified settlement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next up is the return of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beloved-cod-maps-coming-back-to-black-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan-favourite map</a>, Firing Range. Black Ops 6 Season 3 has received a remastered version of Firing Range, a 6v6, medium-sized Core map that finally returned to the series after Black Ops 4 in 2018. Next is Haven, a 6v6, medium-sized core map set in a KGB Safehouse in 1991.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last up is Signal, which is again a 6v6/2v2, small-sized Strike Map. Players start their battles from opposing submarine bays while going through the Control room of an ocean rig numbers station. Additionally, a Nuketown variant called Blazetown will be released for a limited time mid-season.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-multiplayer-modes">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Multiplayer Modes</h2>



<p>Coming to the new multiplayer game modes revealed in the Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap, players will see the return of two classic modes, Sharpshooter and Demolition. There’s also a limited-time mode called Joint Operators.</p>



<p>Sharpshooter is a free-for-all party mode where every player needs to use the same loadout, and it changes every 45 seconds. Every time it changes, you will receive a new primary weapon, secondary Weapon, dedicated melee weapon, tactical equipment and lethal equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In Demolition, players will alternate between attacking and defensive positions across two bomb sites. The attacking team wins when it destroys the bomb and receives a time bonus for the first detonation. All the players from the attacking team spawn with bombs, and there are multiple respawns for both teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Joint Operators, players need to test their skills in a gauntlet of five Core mode variants in a single match: Head Stash (TDM), Inhalation (Domination), Hotbox (Hardpoint), Very High Target (HVT), and Munchies (Kill Confirmed). The modes will include some modifiers, too, like double health, low gravity, hallucinations and third-person POV.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-perks">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Perks</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap reveals additional equipment, such as two new perks and a scorestreak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Close Shave is an Enforcer type Perk, which automatically uses the player’s Dedicated Melee attack when they perform a weapon butt attack. Vendetta is a Recon-type perk that arrives mid-season. When the player respawns, it makes their killer’s last known location for a short duration—bonus points for exacting revenge. Death Machine is the new Lethal type Scorestreak.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-multiplayer-ranked-changes">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Multiplayer Ranked Changes</h2>



<p>Lastly, Black Ops 6 Season 3 roadmap has revealed new changes and additions for Multiplayer Ranked Play. Players can take their competitiveness to the next level as the same settings, maps, modes, and weapon restrictions used by the Call of Duty League have been added to the game. Winning matches rewards players with SR (Skill Rating), and progressing through the ranks will reward players with Rank Skins and Win Challenge rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have added Retroactive SR Adjustments to reverse the impact of cheaters. When a Ranked Cheater is banned, any players that lost against them will be refunded their SR. Also, a new feature has been added that lets you rejoin Ranked Matches if they were disconnected. However, players need to rejoin within 5 minutes.

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Employees Worried About Layoffs After Tencent Deal]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Thursday afternoon, Ubisoft announced that it was forming a new subsidiary company with Tencent that will include the company’s three biggest franchises along with a number of studios. This has led to a number of employees within Ubisoft to become worried about mass layoffs happening in the coming months either before or after the deal with Tencent is completed.</p>



<p>Not long after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the deal was announced</a>, multiple current Ubisoft employees reached out to express feelings of uneasiness and concern about the future of the company. Specifically, those not working on Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal email acquired</a> by Insider Gaming, Ubisoft’s Marie-Sophie de Waubert said that she understands that there is uncertainty and questions surrounding what’s going to happen. She also tried to calm any worries about those not working on the three franchises.</p>



<p>“I also want to be clear: if you’re not currently working on these brands, it doesn’t mean your work matters any less,” she said. “This agreement will benefit all of Ubisoft, giving us the means to spark more innovation and creativity across the board. This marks the beginning of a new chapter, and you play a vital role in shaping it.”</p>



<p>Despite the messaging, however, some aren’t buying it.</p>



<p>“We feel [expletive] if we’re not on the big three,” one current Ubisoft employee said under the condition of anonymity. “They can say these things in an email, but when it comes down to it, we feel like we know where priorities are.”</p>



<p>Said another employee currently working on an unannounced project, “I want to think our team is okay right now, but we don’t know. You’d think they’d have at least some sort of clarity for us before publicly announcing the deal.”</p>



<p>The other messages received all relayed similar sentiments. There is some excitement and hope that a turnaround is coming for the company, but until questions about their status are answered, those in various areas of the company don’t want to get happy.</p>



<p>“We just want to know what’s going on,” one source said. “They promised transparency and regular communication with us, but we’ll see if that actually happens.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft regarding what the deal with Tencent means for its employees and the possibility of layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to the article.</p>



<p>Ubisoft anticipates the full deal to be completed before the end of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/r0-z3-skin-call-of-duty-controversial-paywall/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Move over, Terminator – an old familiar face is back in town and standing ready to take the spot of the most overpowered, controversial Call of Duty skin. When Season 03 arrives in Black Ops 6 on April 2, players will be able to unlock R0-Z3, a modern-day recreation of one of the sweatiest Operators in Call of Duty history.</p>



<p>Back in the day, ‘Roze’ was the firm favourite for players looking for an (unfair) edge over the competition. Her skin was darker than dark and made her a shadow in dimly-lit areas, and even a redesign to lighten her up didn’t do much to stem the sales.</p>



<p>There’s a really sneaky catch, though. You can only get the R0-Z3 skin if you own the BlackCell Battle Pass – the most expensive Battle Pass variant in Call of Duty. Surprise, surprise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-signature-sweat">Signature Sweat</h2>



<p>The R0-Z3 skin, which is an all-new take on the classic Roze Operator, will be available exclusively through the BlackCell Battle Pass, which just so happens to be one of the most expensive single purchases you can make in Call of Duty. It’ll set you back $30 to obtain Season 03’s BlackCell Battle Pass, which is more than the average skin pack by far.</p>



<p>Here’s the spiel for R0-Z3, published in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-three-critical-launch-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent Call of Duty blog</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The new BlackCell Operator R0-Z3 arrives in an animated mantle and her signature mask along with her faithful hound, leading an awesome array of Season 03 BlackCell content. She is joined by a roster of teched out Operator Skins, sleek Weapon Blueprints, and sci-fi themed unlocks earned exclusively through BlackCell.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She looks as familiar as ever, but she has some golden splashes that make her fit with the BlackCell brand:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Roze first appeared in Warzone in July 2020, mere months after the game hit the market. She became a staple of the battle royale landscape, with everyone grinding the battle pass to Tier 100 to acquire the legendary Operator skin.</p>



<p>If you’ve got $30 to spare, you’ll be happy enough picking up BlackCell, and admittedly, it comes with heaps of bonus features for the avid Call of Duty fan. There are BlackCell-exclusive weapon blueprints for a range of firearms, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-amax-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMAX</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a>, which are returning for the reappearance of Verdansk in Warzone.</p>



<p>You’ll also get 1,100 COD Points, a 10% XP boost, and several exclusive skins for an array of Operators. They’re not as popular as R0-Z3 will be, but you never know.</p>



<p>Do you plan on getting the R0-Z3 skin as soon as possible, ready for Verdansk’s return? Let me know in the comments.</p>
