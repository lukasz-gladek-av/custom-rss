<p>At the start of last year’s season, reigning VALORANT champion Kelden “Boostio” Pupello was one of several players to leave Evil Geniuses. In his first year with 100 Thieves, Boostio and the team won the first VCT Americas split, and barely missed out on Champions.</p>



<p>Ahead of his second season with 100T, Boostio took the time to talk to Insider Gaming. And rather than just talk about the upside of his own team, he also had something to say about a long-time rival.</p>



<hr>



<p>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</p>



<p><strong>Q: I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eg-coach-potter-says-yay-has-to-prove-hes-not-a-chamber-main/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to your former coach Potter earlier</a></strong>. <strong>We talked about the importance of keeping a roster core together between seasons. From the in-game leader’s perspective, how important is it to you to have that familiarity between players already?</strong></p>



<p>It’s really important. It’s more important for the one or two people joining, because they’re going to be the ones out of comfort coming into our system. So when you keep a core, those players are going to be comfortable and [they] know what needs to happen in order to win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So for us four, we won split one [last year], we know how to win. When we were winning we were considered one of the best teams in the world; we were owning everyone. Since we kept the coach, IGL, and three other players, it makes it easier on us and the new player. We just need to execute like we did before.</p>



<p><strong>Q: How do you avoid replicating the slow start you had at Kickoff last year?</strong></p>



<p>[Smiles] Yeah I hope we don’t go 0-2. I hope we make Masters. This first tournament is so early on in the year, that anyone can really luck out, to be honest. I feel like a lot of teams could get lucky, like LOUD last year. They were clearly not a top team but they ended up making it to [Masters] Madrid.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption>Boaster has never shied away from talking trash. Photo by David Lee/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Q: Did <a href="https://x.com/Sentinels/status/1843418707244265495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bang’s departure</a> catch the rest of the team off guard?</strong></p>



<p>Me, bang, and Asuna all hang out in a Discord all the time, and we knew bang was leaving before the org knew or before the coach knew. When [Sentinels] contacted him, [since] he’s a younger kid and he doesn’t really know what he wants, he asked for advice. And so Peter and I told him: “Bro, go try out. You’re gonna get paid way more, you’re gonna be way more popular on Sentinels, go fucking do it. If you have to leave us, it sucks, but there’s no way you say no to that.”</p>



<p><strong>Q: It was a very light offseason for you guys with just one official series played at an event. With VCT less than a week away, how prepared do you feel you are, especially with the new agent now in play?</strong></p>



<p>I feel good. I think we are strong. Like I said, when we’re playing well, I think we’re the best team in the world, or [at least] one that can contend for a championship. And I think you have to be a pretty special team to even be in the argument to contend.</p>



<p>Like NRG, and this is clickbait but I fully believe it, are going to be a good team, probably. You have FNS on your team, and I think he’s the best NA IGL of all time, but with his mechanics, when you’re playing in championship matches, you’re not gonna win with someone like him on your team. It’s just not possible.</p>



<p>So for us, I think all five players are insane, if we just keep up mechanically like we normally are, which is better than a lot of teams, and keep our team play at a decently high level, we’ll just win.</p>

<p>NetEase has announced that the Advanced Suit 2.0 is coming to Marvel Rivals to celebrate the PC launch of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. The company posted a reveal on Twitter earlier today, stating that the suit will be available for Spider-Man from January 30.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-friendly-neighbourhood-spider-man">Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter (X), NetEase wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Take the first look at Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (2023) in Marvel Rivals, the Advanced Suit 2.0 blends Otto Octavius’s science with Peter Parker’s genius. Crafted for the toughest battles, it symbolizes Spider-Man’s true grit as a hero.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the reveal image used to showcase the Advanced Suit 2.0 in Marvel Rivals:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Spider-Man 2 was released in 2023 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and while Insomniac neglected to follow up with any major expansions, the game has remained popular since. On January 30, the web-slinging hero title will land on PC via Steam.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has been a boon for NetEase since being released in December 2024. It has pulled in tens of millions of players and has become one of the best hero shooters to emerge in recent years. It’s challenging Overwatch in the genre and will be a thorn in the side of Valve’s Deadlock.</p>



<p>In Marvel Rivals, Spider-Man is one of the most challenging Duelists. He has a five-star difficulty rating and relies on unparalleled acrobatic abilities to dominate the playing field.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of Spider-Man 2, you’ll want to snag the Advanced Suit 2.0 when it appears in Marvel Rivals on January 30.</p>

<p>In a recent update posted on Steam, it was revealed that Fortune’s Run, a retro sci-fi indie shooter, will have all development activity put on hold for three years. This is because the sole developer, ‘Dizzie’, will be serving a 36-month prison sentence, which was handed down as a result of the dev living ‘a very different life’ before they started working on Fortune’s Run.</p>



<p>As of today, Fortune’s Run boasts a ‘Very Positive’ rating on Steam, where it has existed since September 2023.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-unclear-what-will-happen">‘It’s Unclear What Will Happen’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on Valve’s PC platform, Steam, the sole developer of Fortune’s Run explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been sentenced to prison for the next 3 years. It’s a long story, but I’ve lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn’t living very well. My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I’ve been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I’m going away next month. </p>



<p>It’s a shame, but it’s the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn’t going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The post went on to explain that Fortune’s Run ‘sold okay’ and that once Dizzie is released from prison, they’ll hopefully be back on their feet and will return to the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I’m never going to stop making games. I’d like to finish this one, but I don’t know what will happen. I’m going to do my best, because I love this game and I want to finish it. Seriously, I just want to finish it. Finish it already, Dizzie!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This news was followed up by a couple more posts explaining some updates and tweaks being made to the game – which will likely be the final changes Fortune’s Run will see for quite some time.</p>
