<p>Modding is a huge part of gaming, and instead of concentrating on the default content, Hypixel Studios encourages the community to download and install the best Hytale mods to make the game even more wild.</p>



<p>Some games actively discourage modding and do their best to avoid having the base game assets be manipulated in any way. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> is the complete polar opposite. Hytale wants you to mod, it wants you to create mods; whatever funky ideas are flowing around in your brainwaves need to be used to create fun and original content.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to mess around with Hytale and implement the best mods to make the game easier, better, or even more entertaining, this guide has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-8-top-hytale-mods-to-install">8 Top Hytale Mods To Install</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios and CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hytale has partnered up with <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CurseForge</a> to deliver official mods. The game’s long-awaited launch was accompanied by well over 80 mods to download and install. Insider Gaming has picked out our favorite ones so far, and keep checking back as the list is updated with new mods to add. </p>



<h3 id="h-advanced-item-info">Advanced Item Info</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is comfortably one of the most (if not <em>the </em>most) downloaded Hytale mods—and for obvious reasons. It tells you much more information about the items and materials you pick up. There’s a certain level of ambiguity when it comes to survival games about the resources you collect, leaving it up to you to decide what they’re for, or discover their main purpose(s). This mod eliminates a lot of the mystery and gets straight to the point.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/advanced-item-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Advanced Item Info mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-ymmersive-foliage">Ymmersive Foliage</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hypixel Studios and founder Simon Collins-Laflamme have been hard on themselves at times in the build-up to launch. It’s in early access, and the team has said that it needs a lot of work. It’s probably true, but the game’s early access launch looked spectacular. However, if you want to spruce and juice up the environment with extra color, depth, and detail, the Ymmersive Foliage mode does that in Hytale.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/ymmersive-foliage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Ymmersive Foliage mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-lucky-mining">Lucky Mining</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>A good way to think about this mod is like hacking away at a material in Fortnite. You get rewarded for consecutive good hits, and it’s kind of the same here. If you keep mining the same material in a row—Ores, in this case—you get more of it. It can make the grind easier, and stock up your inventory with enough Ore to start a new country.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/lucky-mining" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Lucky Mining mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-yung-s-hydungeons">YUNG’s HyDungeons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>This mod might not be for beginners, but if you fancy a devious dungeon-based challenge and upgrade, consider checking out the YUNG’s HyDungeons mod. It adds new dungeons with “procedurally generated dungeon instances.” You do need to hit 100 Memories first, but there will come a point where you can enjoy this fabulous mod.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/yungs-hydungeons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the YUNG’s HyDungeons mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-thorium-furnaces">Thorium Furnaces</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes, a good quality-of-life feature can go a long way. It doesn’t have to be a wild mod that breaks the game. The Thorium Furnaces mode adds 11 new furnaces, and they speed up the smelting process, saving a lot of time. The rarer the furnace, the faster it gets the job done, allowing you to go exploring quicker.</p>

<h3 id="h-wan-s-wonder-weapons">Wan’s Wonder Weapons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to CurseForge</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you are after a wild mod that is just plain fun, look no further than Wan’s Wonder Weapons. When you think of ‘Wonder Weapons,’ you might think of Call of Duty’s Ray Gun, but here, you get special weapons like the Maelstrom anchor, Frostburn sword, or Chromatic Cleaver—the final one looking like it was pulled straight from a unicorn. If a pickaxe or regular sword just isn’t cutting it, download and get yourself Wan’s Wonder Weapons.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/wans-wonder-weapons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Wan’s Wonder Weapons mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-ymmersive-melodies">Ymmersive Melodies</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can “Annoy your friends with custom melodies” using the Ymmersive Melodies mod in Hytale. Does more need to be said? If you’re <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-invite-friends-join-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing with friends in Hytale</a>, why wouldn’t you want to upload custom melodies to make them want to throw Wild Berries or Dark Feathers at you?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/ymmersive-melodies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Ymmersive Melodies mod here.</a></p>



<h3 id="h-wayback-charm">Wayback Charm</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As we come to the home stretch, it makes sense to end with a mod that aptly takes you home. CurseForge says this about the mod: “The Wayback Charm is a magical tool that can help you find your way back home. Simply press the use key (F) while holding the charm, and you will be teleported to the nearest respawn point. Respawn points can be created using blocks like beds. If you do not have a respawn location, or the respawn location is considered invalid, you will be sent to the world spawn.” Sounds good, right?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/wayback-charm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Download the Wayback Charm mod here.</a></p>

If so, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let the staff know, as the mod might end up on this list!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Meta is scaling back its gaming presence with a round of layoffs. A report on Monday from the New York Times said that the company was set to let go roughly 10% of staff from the Reality Labs side of the company. </p>



<p>One day later, and it appears <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that those layoffs</a> have begun with a number of studios being hit. </p>







<p>Reality Labs, if you didn’t know, houses Meta’s Oculus Studios division. Oculus Studios is responsible for managing the various first party studios and teams that develop games for the Meta Quest VR headsets.</p>



<p>Two studios known to be impacted by the layoffs are Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games. In a <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Twitter</a>, designer Andy Gentile revealed that he had been let go. In his post, Gentile added that <strong>“It appears the entire Twisted Pixel games studio has been shut down. Sanzaru Games too.”</strong></p>



<p>Over on LinkedIn, Sanzaru senior level designer Ray West <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">also confirmed that Sanzaru</a>, along with “several Meta game studios” were shut down.</p>



<p><strong>“It was an amazing team of powerhouse talent, and I’m really glad to have gotten to know everyone there,”</strong> he said.</p>







<p>Prior to the layoffs and studio closures, Twisted Pixel Games recently released Deadpool VR for Meta Quest 3. For Sanzaru, they developed the highly regarded Asgard’s Wrath and Asgard’s Wrath 2.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Meta for comment on how many jobs were lost and all of the studios hit as part of these layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[CS2 Transfer Market ‘Out of Control’, apEX Declares]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-transfer-market-out-of-control/</link>
            <guid>1404724</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Vitality’s award-winning IGL, Dan ‘apEX’ Madesclaire, has voiced <strong>strong concerns </strong>about the state of the Counter-Strike 2 transfer market. He has argued that the current pricing climate has made roster changes (especially meaningful ones) almost <strong>impossible </strong>for most organizations in the space.</p>



<p>In the wake of the HLTV Award Show, during which apEX secured an award for IGL of the Year, he suggested that even the biggest organizations in Counter-Strike are being priced out of making key moves.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-the-counter-strike-market">What’s Wrong with the Counter-Strike Market?</h2>



<p>According to apEX, the financial expectations around player buyouts have reached a critical point. Even well-funded organizations can’t engage, and teams that want to ‘shake things up’ simply can’t. They’re backing off because quotes are ‘completely unrealistic’.</p>



<p>He also stated that the Counter-Strike esports ecosystem doesn’t generate enough revenue to justify skyrocketing buyout demands that have surged in the last year.</p>



<p>Here’s the full quote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>So many teams wanted to make a change, I guess, but they couldn’t. The transfer market is crazy. The prices are “What the f**k is going on?” In CS, we don’t make enough money to make changes, all those prizes are crazy. That’s why we hear nothing from NAVI, no MOUZ as well, who wanted to shuffle, I’m pretty sure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/75019-apex-cs2-transfer-market-is-crazy-the-prices-are-on-what-the-f-k-is-going-on-level" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escore</a> for the quote</em>)</p>



<p>ApEX explained that the quiet offseason and the lack of transfers can be attributed specifically to this issue.</p>



<p>The looming shadow over the market remains Team Falcons, the Saudi-backed organization that has the largest coffers in the esports world. In the last few years, the company has soared in the competitive gaming space, buying out killer squads in multiple games.</p>



<p>But even Team Falcons neglected to make any changes during the winter freeze. If Team Falcons is hesitating, then the pricing issue must be <strong>extreme</strong>.</p>



<p>ApEX’s comments reflect the growing concern amongst players that the CS2 transfer market is overheating. If buyout quotes continue to rise faster than team revenues do on a comparative scale, the top organizations willbe forced to delay or abandon roster plans and rebuilds.</p>

<p>EA has announced that it is delaying the start of Battlefield 6 Season 2.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s official subreddit, EA revealed that Season 2 for both Battlefield 6 and Battlefield REDSEC will now start on February 17. Originally, the next season was expected to begin on January 21.</p>







<p><strong>“During our ongoing development, we’ve continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2,” </strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1qbv6tf/battlefield_6_and_redsec_season_1_january_update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA said</a> in their statement.</p>



<p>They continued: <strong>“Season 1 will be extended past its in-game end date of January 20, and we will launch Season 2 on February 17. The Season 1 extension update to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC will be released on January 20, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season 1 Battle Pass until the start date of Season 2.</strong>“</p>







<p>With this delay, EA is giving players a new “Frostfire Bonus Path” starting on January 27. This new path includes new customization rewards along with XP boosts. Free rewards from the path include Hardware XP Boost, a Vehicle Skin and player card customization items. Those with the Battle Pass can get a new weapon package and career XP boost. </p>



<p><strong>“Unlike previous Bonus Paths, all Bonus Path Points for the Frostfire Bonus Path are earned through Weekly Challenges; there are no Bonus Challenges associated with this Bonus Path.,”</strong> EA says.</p>

<p><strong>Playoffs – Round One</strong></p>



<p>The first round of the playoffs will be a behind-closed-doors event, held between <strong>February 8 </strong>and <strong>February 10</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Playoffs – Round Two</strong></p>



<p>The second round of the playoffs will run from <strong>February 13 </strong>to <strong>February 15 </strong>and will be played in front of a live audience in the Adidas Arena.</p>
