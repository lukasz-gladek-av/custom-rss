<p>Gamescom 2025 is right around the corner, so expect a huge surge of reveals and details on some of the biggest upcoming games. If you want to know exactly what to expect, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<p>With E3 dead and gone, Gamescom is the ultimate annual event for gaming fans to soak up the latest news and get their hands on huge titles ahead of launch, and 2025 is shaping up to be a huge year.</p>



<p>From the biggest AAA titles to indie games to keep an eye out for, we’ve highlighted everything announced for Gamescom 2025 in this guide.</p>

<p><strong>Games set to headline Gamescom 2025 include Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Hollow Knight: Silksong, EA FC 26, and lots more—with surprises also set to feature.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-start-date-times-how-to-watch-how-long-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live event</a> will be stacked full of trailers, first-look exclusives, gameplay showcases, and special guests. This includes the reveal for <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-happening-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a></strong>, the opening cinematic from <strong><a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1954528805269221431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>, </strong>and gameplay from <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Resident Evil: Requiem</a>.</strong></p>



<p>With over 1500 exhibitors at the event, there is no shortage of things to look out for, though perhaps the most in-demand will be the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable demo of <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Both Microsoft and Nintendo have announced playable demos on their hardware, the former including the new ROG Ally.</p>



<p>Konami announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both <strong>Silent Hill F </strong>and <strong>Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater </strong>will be at Gamescom</a>, while other partners in attendance include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-first-wave-of-partners-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft and Capcom</a>. Nintendo also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-returns-to-gamescom-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced its attendance</a>, having skipped Gamescom in 2025, with the Switch 2 set to be a highlight.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <strong>EA FC 26 </strong>is among the titles that will be playable at Gamescom, with EA Sports ramping up marketing ahead of the worldwide release in September.</p>

<p>PUBG’s time on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be coming to an end in November with a transition to current-generation consoles, it has been announced.</p>



<p>As previously announced in the 2025 roadmap, preparations have been made to move the console version of PUBG onto current-gen consoles. Unfortunately for those on last-gen devices, it means an end to official support.</p>



<p>Players on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 will benefit from improved visuals, more stable frame rates, and reduced crashes. However, the headline is undoubtedly the end of support for last-gen consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-pubg-moving-to-current-gen-in-november">PUBG Moving to Current-Gen in November</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on the <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, PUBG will no longer be playable or available to download on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on <strong>November 13, 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The end for the platforms will come following live server maintenance on the above date, though the schedule is subject to change depending on the review process for each platform.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that existing account data and purchased items will be “securely preserved,” with players having the ability to log into the game on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S at any time after the change to continue playing on an existing account—with no separate transfer required.</p>



<p>While Xbox Series X|S players will have their version upgraded via the platform’s Smart Delivery process on November 13, PS5 players are required to download the new PS5 version of PUBG from the PlayStation Store when the update is live.</p>



<p>In the announcement, it was added that a goal of “fairness across all platforms” is a major priority, with the intention to provide a stable 60fps experience across all platforms. To enable this, the Xbox Series S will have selectable options of a Resolution Mode and a Performance Mode.</p>



<p>Is the move to current-gen consoles long overdue for PUBG? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3293/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 news and leaks are starting to come thick and thin. A Tac-Sprint rumor suggests that the developer is toying with the idea of removing Tac-Sprint altogether from Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, it’s claimed.</p>



<p>Tac-Sprint is an auto-run mechanic allowing you to move faster in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD</a>. It comes with a strict penalty, though: A slightly slower time to aim. Many skilled players have been able to master the nuances of the movement. But there are also plenty of people who wish it weren’t in the game. If you’re one of those people, you might get your wish.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-reportedly-trying-out-no-tac-sprint">Black Ops 7 Reportedly Trying Out No Tac-Sprint</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could be very divisive. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The leak/report comes from one <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a>—one of Call of Duty’s most renowned insiders—who claims to have new information on Tac-Sprint.</p>



<p>“There’s currently a build of Black Ops 7 being tested right now that has no tac sprint. This doesn’t mean the final game won’t have it but this is a very GOOD sign,” they said on X.</p>



<p>Now, they have previously reported that Tac-Sprint <em>is</em> in the game. This has probably been the case in the past, but new developments can always arise. It’s quite likely that a lack of Tac-Sprint in some capacity is being tested for Black Ops 7.</p>



<div><article><p><span>There’s currently a build of Black Ops 7 being tested right now that has no tac sprint. This doesn’t mean the final game won’t have it but this is a very GOOD sign.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Whether the feature makes it into the full game remains to be seen. We’ll keep you updated on the latest rumors and leaks. Are you hoping Tac-Sprint sits BLOPS 7 out?

<p>A huge flood of gaming news is on the horizon with Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 right around the corner. For all the details you need, look no further than our guide.</p>



<p>The latter months of 2025 have been blown wide open following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-gta-6-delayed-release-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6’s delay</a> until next year, with plenty of new release dates expected to be announced during Opening Night Live. While not all will release this year, it should pack the schedule with a load to be excited about.</p>



<p>To make sure you don’t miss out on any of the fun, use our dedicated guide for a breakdown of all the important information. </p>

<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live takes place on Tuesday, August 19. As the name suggests, it marks the start of the entire Gamescom event.</strong></p>



<p>Gamescom itself runs until Sunday, August 24, with a variety of in-person events and showcases streamed online. This includes several playable titles, ranging from Hollow Knight: Silksong to Borderlands 4, and online showcases from Xbox, Bethesda, and the Future Games Show.</p>







<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 takes place at 11am PT/1pm CT/2pm ET/7pm BST/4am AST (August 20).</strong></p>



<p>The showcase is expected to start bang on time, with no initial countdown beyond the start time, so make sure you’re locked in and ready. If you do miss any of the announcements for one reason or another, we’ll have all of the biggest news and reveals on Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Here’s an easier way to see the times in your timezone.</p>

<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 will be available to watch directly on both YouTube and Twitch.</strong></p>



<p>In our experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamescom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to follow live streams such as this due to the fact that it’s often slightly ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamescom.global" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. So, if you’re scrolling social media at the same time, I highly advise watching through Twitch to avoid spoilers.</p>



<p>Choose whichever platform suits you, though, and remember to keep your eyes peeled to Insider Gaming for all the biggest news as it breaks.</p>



<p>You can also watch ONL through the <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamescom</a> website, while clips and trailers will likely be posted on TikTok.</p>







<p><span><b>Gamescom ON</b></span><strong>L</strong><span><b> 2025 takes place in Cologne, Germany, the home of </b>Gamescom<b>. Specifically, it’s at Hall 1 of the Koelnmesse.</b></span></p>



<p>A live audience is in attendance, with the event ticketed as part of the Gamescom event itself, with fans, media, and streamers in attendance to react to the latest news and reveals. Those with a ticket are advised to arrive by 6pm, with admission closing half an hour before the start.</p>







<p><strong>Gamescom ONL is expected to have a runtime of two hours, as shown by the events schedule on the official website.</strong></p>



<p>Similar to Summer Games Fest and the Game Awards, Geoff Keighley will host the event filled with new game announcements, trailers, gameplay reveals, and special guests. </p>
