<p>The Xbox 360, the most successful video game console from Microsoft, turns 20 years old on November 22. Over its lifespan, the console saw over 2,000 games released including some of the industries greatest games of all time. While the original Xbox was Microsoft’s first attempt at a mainstream video game console, the Xbox 360 was the one that put the industry on notice. It sold nearly three-and-a-half times more systems than the first Xbox (~85.73 million(M)), and, according to the latest known numbers, has even outsold the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S combined.</p>



<p>But what games from the 2nd-generation Xbox went on to become major hits? These are the best-selling Xbox 360 games of all time.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-selling-xbox-360-games-ever">Best-Selling Xbox 360 Games Ever</h2>



<p>The global data you’ll find below comes from custom data firm <a href="https://data40.com/articles/best-selling-xbox-360-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Data40</a>, where the provide numbers for the best-selling Xbox 360 games since the system’s launch in 2005.

<p><strong>10. Grand Theft Auto 4</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>GTA 4 took players back to Liberty City during one of the most memorable eras in the series. Instead of focusing on wild chaos like earlier games, this one leaned into a more grounded story about Niko Bellic trying to start fresh while getting pulled into one bad situation after another. It felt gritty, personal, and completely different from anything the franchise had done before, which is why so many fans still talk about it today.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales</strong>:</strong> 11.1M</p>

<p><strong>9. Halo 3</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Halo 3 was the Xbox Live game everyone seemed to be playing. The campaign delivered huge set pieces and emotional moments, while multiplayer kept people up late night after night. Forge mode and Theater mode were ahead of their time and gave players tools no other shooter offered. For a lot of fans, Halo 3 represents the peak of the franchise.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 12.13M</p>

<p><strong>8. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Call Of Duty- Modern Warfare 2 Official Trailer (Eminem ft Nate Dogg)" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZcsEQPFs_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 arrived with incredible hype and somehow still lived up to it. The campaign had several moments that stuck with players for years, but it was the multiplayer that kept people coming back. Quick scoping battles, chaotic lobbies, and broken loadouts became part of gaming culture. Everyone who played during that era has at least one Modern Warfare 2 story. And most of them, unsurprisingly, involve the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7vBol8wud0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">most controversial and infamous mission</a> in franchise history.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 13.49M</p>

<p><strong>7. The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Skyrim was one of those games you picked up for a quick session and suddenly realized hours had gone by. With dragons flying overhead and a world full of caves, towns, and secrets, every playthrough felt different. Even on Xbox 360, players found creative ways to explore, break, or completely reinvent the game. Almost everyone who touched Skyrim has a unique tale about their time in it.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 13.7M</p>

<p><strong>6. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 changed things up by jumping into a near future setting and giving players choices that affected the campaign. It also delivered some of the most memorable multiplayer the series has ever had. The maps were tight, the pacing was fast, and the competitive scene was extremely active. Zombies mode continued to grow here and became a nightly ritual for many groups of friends.</p>

<p><strong>5. Call of Duty: Black Ops</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The original Call of Duty: Black Ops put players into a Cold War spy thriller with a style that set it apart from other entries in the series. The campaign introduced characters that fans still quote and reference today. Multiplayer became a massive hit thanks to iconic maps and a progression system that kept players hooked. Zombies mode became a lasting obsession for entire friend groups.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 14.55M</p>

<p><strong>4. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 wrapped up the original Modern Warfare storyline with nonstop action and a campaign that kept the pressure high from beginning to end. Multiplayer continued to dominate Xbox Live with fast matches and an enormous amount of customization. Whether players preferred MW2 or MW3, almost everyone spent time in this one when it launched.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 14.72M</p>

<p><strong>3. Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Minecraft on Xbox 360 brought the world of crafting and block building to console players in the best way possible. It quickly became a favorite for families and groups of friends thanks to its simple controls and endless possibilities. To add to it, it allowed friends to play online together in an easier way than the original PC version. Many players who grew up during the 360 era still think of this version as their first real introduction to Minecraft. Fast-forward years later, and Minecraft is the most successful video game of all time with over 350 million copies sold across all platforms.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 21M</p>

<p><strong>2. Grand Theft Auto 5</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>GTA 5 launched on the Xbox 360 in September 2013 and immediately became one a top-selling game. The three-character structure felt fresh, and the world of Los Santos was filled with detail and personality. Even after finishing the story, players kept coming back to explore, find secrets, and try new things. The early days of GTA Online also started here, giving the game a long life on the console. As of October 2025, global sales of the game have hit 220M, putting it behind only Minecraft.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 22.95M</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Kinect Adventures was bundled with the Kinect, which meant almost every Kinect owner tried it at some point. It offered simple but energetic minigames that got people moving and laughing, and it was one of the few games that actually showed what the Kinect could do. It worked well for families and parties and became a surprisingly memorable part of the Xbox 360 era.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 24M</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new video uploaded on social media, Treyarch revealed that Black Ops 7’s aim assist strength will be ‘increased over range’ very soon. This follows a period of monitoring based on community feedback that stressed that the aim assist felt too loose compared to previous games.</p>



<p>This is in addition to a bunch of other tweaks coming in, such as a reduction in the efficacy of the Drone Pod field upgrade, damage tuning for Hardcore modes, and an increase in the visible range of the minimap in multiplayer.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-s-spongy-aim-assist-is-being-adjusted">Black Ops 7’s Spongy Aim Assist is Being Adjusted</h2>



<p>In the clip uploaded earlier today on social media, Treyarch confirmed that aim assist is being adjusted soon:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Aim assist is a big conversation out there; we have been closely monitoring that conversation, and of course, looking at our internal data. We’re fairly happy with where we’re at, but we will be making some very nuanced changes and slightly increasing aim assist strength over range ahead of season one.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team will also perform some fine-tuning of spawns, adjusting spawn logic ‘across the board’ and attacking points of contention on particular maps that have less-than-desirable spawns in certain game modes, including Hardpoint.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Our first post-launch Dev Talk is here with a lot to cover:</p><p>✅ Unlocking Endgame<br>✅ Weapon balancing<br>✅ Aim Assist update<br>✅ Spawn tuning<br>✅ Equipment buffs<br>✅ Drone Pod nerfs<br>✅ Mini-Map range increase<br>✅ Zombies boss fight nerfs<br>✅ Relic updates<br>✅ Cursed in Survival?<br>+ more <a href="https://t.co/Qoc6UOoR1U">pic.twitter.com/Qoc6UOoR1U</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1991582585005437374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Black Ops 7’s aim assist came under fire at launch, even from some of the most capable Call of Duty League pro players. It was dubbed ‘insane and not in a good way’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-no-aim-assist-cod-world-champ/">by Shotzzy</a>, potentially the winningest Call of Duty player in the world right now.</p>



<p>All this is lumped into some major changes, such as Activision’s teams unlocking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-available-campaign-2025/">the ‘Endgame’ mode</a>, which exists at the end of Black Ops 7’s campaign, and making it available universally. This means you no longer need to complete the campaign to access it.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 hasn’t had a terrible launch, but it’s certainly struggling against some tough competition in Battlefield 6, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-breaks-franchise-sales-record/">best-selling shooter in years</a>, and ARC Raiders, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/">most successful extraction shooter</a> ever.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nuketowns-most-popular-easter-egg-isnt-working-in-black-ops-7/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nuketown%E2%80%99s-most-popular-easter-egg-isn%E2%80%99t-working-in-black-ops-7.1359916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s preseason content brings Nuketown. The camo grind really begins now, but there’s a distinct lack of Easter Eggs in Nuketown, including the legendary mannequin heads.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is about to really get going. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> is getting ready to get underway, and this will signal the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-black-ops-7-warzone-coming-out-black-ops-7-warzone-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 &amp; Warzone Integration</a>. Before this, the preseason has started, which includes the debut (again) of Nuketown. This is the latest incarnation of the decade-old map.</p>



<p>But it’s missing one big thing at launch.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-nuketown-mannequins-can-t-be-shot">Black Ops 7 Nuketown Mannequins Can’t Be Shot</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a waiting game. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The mannequin heads can’t be shot in Black Ops 7’s Nuketown right now. The map is live, it has its own playlist option, but the mannequin heads are very resolute, meaning no Nuketown Easter Egg.</p>







<p>Ordinarily, you can shoot the mannequin heads, and if you pop all of them off, a humorous Easter Egg plays out. It varies from game to game, but there’s no such thing in Black Ops 7 right now.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’ve encountered this, don’t worry, it’s probably not permanent. This has happened before, and the mannequin Easter Egg—as well as any others—is usually activated once Season 1 begins.</p>



<p>No one knows why this is the case, but it’s usually what happens. So, be patient, and the time will come for you to furiously dislodge plastic heads from idle mannequin bodies.</p>
