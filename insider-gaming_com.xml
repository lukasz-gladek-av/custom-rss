<p>Battlefield 6 players will be able to access two new game modes and a new map during the upcoming open beta weekend. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s open beta was the biggest beta test yet for the franchise, bringing in over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam alone. However, it did come with some minor issues that developers are figuring out, including “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-are-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-time-to-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpectedly fast</a>” time to death. Developers will try to iron out any problems they can before the next BF6 Open Beta weekend arrives, featuring a new map and modes.</p>

The developer first thanked players for testing out the title and providing feedback. In the upcoming weekend, players get to do it all over again, but on a brand new map, Empire State and two new game modes, Rush and Squad Deathmatch. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-launch-deemed-unsatisfying-and-underperformed-major-update-coming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-launch-deemed-unsatisfying-and-underperformed-major-update-coming.1267905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t deny FBC: Firebreak is ambitious, even if it is a game no one was necessarily clamoring for. The latter part of this is now evident, as Remedy has given deeper insight into FBC: Firebreak’s underwhelming launch and plans for the IP.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-fbc-firebreak-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> was Remedy’s first new release since the Game of the Year-contending <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-over-2-million-copies-and-is-finally-profitable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>. Firebreak is set in Control’s (another Remedy IP) world and is a team-based FPS. This is quite a bold shift from the company’s other games. We’ve seen from gameplay and matches that the game has potential, but its launch has failed to land.</p>



<h2 id="h-fbc-firebreak-receiving-major-update-in-september">FBC: Firebreak Receiving Major Update in September</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Firebreak hasn’t caught yet. Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s quite damning to hear that the FBC: Firebreak “launch underperformed.” This is the official word from Remedy’s Jan-Jun 2025 financial <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>.</p>



<p>“On Steam, which was planned as the primary consumer sales channel on PC, the launch underperformed. The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews.”</p>



<p>The company was happy that “The launch succeeded technically, reaching over 1 million players in its first 10 days,” but goes on to say: “Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak.”</p>



<p>The majority of the shooter’s revenue has come from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-xbox-game-pass-playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus</a>-subscribing users. Firebreak was free on both services at launch.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the adversity, Remedy believes FBC: Firebreak is a “solid game” the team can build on: “Looking ahead, a larger ‘Major Update’ late September will be the next key step for&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak. This will be supported by targeted marketing activities, which we expect to drive interest in the title. We are committed to continuing to work on&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game.”</p>



<p>Do you think Firebreak can bounce back? With so many live-service games out there, it’s tough to stand out. Let me know if you think it can by heading to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Remedy has been distracted by other games in recent years. But Control 2 is one of the company’s biggest upcoming projects, and not only have we learned new details about the game’s progress, but the company has announced a huge milestone for the franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-ultimate-editions-new-update-introduces-hideo-kojima-mission-for-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control</a> felt interesting until the game’s final moments: The puzzles, the paranormal activity in the environment, and your powers. It felt like something was <em>always </em>happening. It could see-saw from horror to hot action in a heartbeat. The demand for a second game has been strong for a while, and it appears the sequel is getting closer.</p>



<h2 id="h-control-2-development-is-on-track-says-remedy-entertainment">Control 2 Development is “On Track,” Says Remedy Entertainment</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More Jessie is a good thing. Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 2025 Remedy Half-year financial report told us several things: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar and Remedy are working together on the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake</a>, the Control franchise has surpassed 5 million lifetime copies sold and counting, and Control 2 is coming along nicely.</p>



<p>Here’s the official <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">word</a> on Control 2’s development: “Control 2&nbsp;development is on track towards meeting its next milestones. The focus is now on the gameplay, environments, and missions. Work continues on developing the game into a strong commercial offering.”</p>



<p>The next milestones could be an official reveal trailer or even a gameplay reveal right out of the gate. I think it’s safe to assume from this that we’re still quite some way off from Control 2 hitting shelves and digital storefronts, though.</p>



<p>One thing’s for sure: Remedy has a lot on its plate with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreaks-new-patch-introduces-faster-progression-and-economy-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, the Max Payne Remake, and Control 2.</p>



<p>What did you love most about the first Control? For me, it was all of it, to be honest. I want to hear what you think, and you can get a conversation underway courtesy of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
