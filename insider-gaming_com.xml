<p>The Call of Duty player base wanted the Prestige back to how it used to be, and Treyarch and Activision have delivered. The old-school setup is back, but you need to reach a certain level to hit Prestige 1 in Black Ops 6—and we know which one. </p>



<p>I fall into the boomer category when it comes to CoD. I miss having fewer attachments, need an abundance of intricately woven three-lane maps, and yearn for the classic Prestige system. Leveling up and earning a new Prestige icon was a joy, and the challenge of unlocking all weapons and equipment again was special. </p>



<p>Activision heard our cries, and the Prestige system many of us grew up with is back with a triumphant bang. For many of you, this way of Prestiging is probably foreign. So, I’m going to run through the level you need to reach to hit Prestige 1—and beyond—and give you a quick run-through of what happens.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-prestige-in-black-ops-6">How to Prestige in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The first of many Prestige screens. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You must complete Level 55 to unlock the ability to Prestige in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a clear set of instructions in case you missed the in-game prompts:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the Black Ops 6 main multiplayer menu.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>Barracks</strong>.</li>



<li>Press on <strong>Progression</strong>.</li>



<li>Now choose <strong>Prestige</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Hold the Triangle on PlayStation, Y on Xbox</strong>, or the applicable button on other formats to see Prestige Details.</li>



<li>When it gives you the option, press <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>



<li>Press <strong>Continue </strong>again.</li>



<li>Finally, <strong>hold the required button for several seconds to officially Prestige</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>To be clear, if you reach Level 55, <strong>this isn’t enough</strong>—you need to get to the <em>end </em>of Level 55 to gain access to the Prestige option. Once you do this, BLOPS 6 informs you, and you’re left with a difficult decision, do you stay, or do you go on?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-when-you-prestige-in-black-ops-6">What Happens When You Prestige in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>If you choose to Prestige,<strong> your player level resets to one</strong>, <strong>your player icon changes to a universal symbol that remains through your Prestige 1 run</strong>, and you can <strong>unlock a heap of goodies for hitting certain milestones</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-player-level">Player Level</h3>



<p>Yes, even though you’ve spent hours increasing your player rank, enabling the Prestige function resets the number straight back to one. Effectively, you start again, and it means you need to re-unlock everything—save for one weapon, piece of equipment, or Perk of your choosing.</p>



<h3 id="h-icon-change">Icon Change</h3>



<p>Your first run through Black Ops 6’s online multiplayer gives you a fresh icon for hitting new levels, However, with Prestige, each time you do it, you’re given a fixed icon from levels 1-55. Per <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-progression-leveling-prestiging-challenges-intel#master" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a>, Black Ops 6 Prestige icons are special though as they are “themed around a title in Black Ops history.”</p>



<h3 id="h-rewards">Rewards</h3>



<p>Prestiging gives you instant <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-prestige-rewards-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige rewards</a> but also offers incentives throughout the entire Prestige journey. For example, you can earn Calling Cards, Emblems, Charms, and even Blueprints. Think of Prestige less like a daunting endeavor, and more challenging and replayable journey to carry you to the ultimate glory—the final Prestige icon!</p>

<p>It’s not every day that we receive a competent “Battlefield-killer,” though Delta Force, from developer Team Jade, is shaping up to take on the crown with its free-to-play first-person shooter. From what we played during past beta periods, it’s an exceptionally good time, with fast-paced, satisfying ground combat, high-speed vehicle encounters, and customization options that keep us grinding for more weapon XP round after round.

<p>Yes! Delta Force is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, though there is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-console-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no official release date</a> for either system yet. Developer Team Jade revealed it’s targeting a Q1 2025 console release for the free-to-play first-person shooter. </p>



<p>Alongside the console release, PC players will receive full controller support.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-delta-force-feature-cross-progression">Does Delta Force Feature Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>When Delta Force is finally available on all systems—PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S—it will feature cross-progression between each platform, allowing you to download and play anywhere you want. If you have multiple systems, download the FPS on PC and Xbox Series X|S, for example, and you’ll find that your stats, weapon XP, and rank all transfer over.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-game-modes-does-delta-force-offer">What Game Modes Does Delta Force Offer?</h2>



<p>On launch, Delta Force will include three game modes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Operations</strong>: An extraction shooter game mode featuring 3-person squads of Operators surviving, looting, and escaping with high-end items, all the while fighting against both AI and other squads of human players.</li>



<li><strong>Warfare</strong>: The iconic, expansive game mode featuring PvP combat with large-scale encounters, including vehicles and Operators, across massive maps.</li>



<li><strong>Black Hawk Down</strong>: An old-school, cinematic experience for those who grew up playing the Delta Force: Black Hawk Down games of old.</li>

<h2 id="h-does-delta-force-feature-vehicle-combat">Does Delta Force Feature Vehicle Combat?</h2>

<p>Delta Force features extensive vehicle combat—land, sea, and air—across its various game modes. On launch, we’ll have access to multiple military vehicles, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>M1A4 Battle Tank</strong></li>

<li><strong>LAV-AA</strong></li>



<li><strong>Assault Vehicles</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>A few of these are generic military vehicles meant for quick insertions. Others, like the M1A4 or AH-1035D, fill more specialized roles on the battlefield.</p>
