<p>Shovel Knight developers have revealed that Mina the Hollower is going to be their ‘make or break’ moment. </p>



<p>A new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment?srnd=homepage-asia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reveals that Shovel Knight dev, Yacht Club Games, might be in trouble if their next title, Mina the Holler, doesn’t perform well. For those unaware, Mina the Hollower was delayed indefinitely last month, just weeks before its previous release date. </p>







<h2 id="h-mina-the-hollower-s-performance-can-make-or-break-it-for-them">Mina the Hollower’s Performance Can Make or Break It for Them</h2>



<p>The new report first describes how the developers invited Schreier over to showcase their title, only for the conference room to fill with smoke. The game was still demoed after, to show where the developers stand at the moment and why they have to delay the game further. </p>



<p>The report reveals that only in the past weeks has the game reached a point where the Shovel Knight developers were able to play all the content from start to end. During this process, they have identified several areas that need improvement. However, they have only identified all the problems and will need some more time to fix them. </p>



<p>Shovel Knight developers can only remain independent if Mina the Hollower is a success. The dev studio has already undergone downsizing and now has only 15 employees left, with finances at a low point as well. The co-founder, Sean Velasco, has stated, “It’s make-or-break for sure,” adding that if the game sells 500,000 copies, they are golden; if it sells 200,000, they are still happy; however, if they sell only 100,000, that could be a problem. </p>

<p>Discord is rolling out a new commerce experience for users and has partnered with Marvel Rivals as the first title with integrated shopping and gifting.</p>



<p>Launching just in time for the Marvel Rivals anniversary celebrations and the holiday season, players in the Marvel Rivals Discord will be able to browse and purchase digital goods within the Marvel Rivals Discord.</p>











<figure><figcaption>New feature. Image via Discord</figcaption></figure>



<p>Players in the Marvel Rivals Discord can now create a wishlist of the items they want to add to their collection and gift in-game items to their friends, with purchased and gifted items instantly accessible within Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p><a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-introduces-a-new-commerce-experience-for-gaming-communities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord says</a> the integration is a huge boost for players and developers alike, as gifting isn’t limited to players of the game, so items can be gifted to friends to encourage them to jump into the game, extending in-game currency, and building upon the existing gifting behavior on Discord.</p>



<p>It’s added that 20% of all Shop purchases on Discord are gifts, a number that increases to almost 30% during the holiday season, so the integration is described as “a natural evolution of how people use Discord to connect and celebrate together.”</p>



<p>Initially, the integration will support purchases in USD only on the Discord desktop client, though players from the US, Canada, Ireland, and Oceania will be able to use it. Additional regions and platform support will be explored in the future, Discord says.</p>



<p>Additional game support is expected to be added in the future as part of the feature’s evolution.</p>
