<p>Nintendo always keeps a careful eye on its branding and the face of its company, Mario. Even when collaborating with a partner like Sega.</p>



<p>Of course, the relationship between Sega and Nintendo is much different today than it was 30 years ago at the height of the console wars. As many know, Sonic, Sega’s mascot, was designed specifically to make Mario seem slow and outdated, so more players would gravitate toward the Sega Genesis home console. However, Sega left the console war in 2001 and, in later years, appeared alongside Mario in Super Smash Bros. games and in their own game, where Mario, Sonic, and many of their side characters from their respective franchises participated in Olympic sports.</p>







<h2 id="h-mario-can-t-appear-to-be-a-step-behind">Mario Can’t Appear to Be a Step Behind</h2>



<p>Ryoichi Hasegawa, a former Sega producer, worked on the Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games franchise. Now, he’s sharing a fun story that offers insight into how protective Nintendo is of its mascot.</p>



<p>He was recently interviewed by Adrian of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r6XcQF_pBI&amp;pp=0gcJCU8KAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arcade Attack Retro Gaming Network,</a> and during the interview, explained that Nintendo once was upset that Sonic’s foot was ahead of Mario’s in the key art for the Mario and Sonic at the Beijing Olympics video game</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“But there was one funny story. There was, of course, artwork of Mario, Sonic, and other characters standing on the field. Those artworks were used for the package, the instruction manual cover, and the cartridge label, and things like that. There was one small error. Sonic’s foot was in front of Mario’s foot. Nintendo demanded us to change the priority. I still remember that. We were like, ‘Oh my God! We have to change it, or there’ll be no deal.'”</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>That’s right, blast processing be damned! Mario will always be one step ahead. There were six games featuring the Mario and Sonic characters at the Olympics. However, the series has remained dormant since the 2019 release of Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.</p>

<p>Two minutes of in-engine footage of ZeniMax Online Studio’s cancelled Project Blackbird has leaked online.</p>







<p>The footage, which Insider Gaming can verify is legitimate, was used internally at ZeniMax to showcase the game’s lighting in Unreal Engine 4. You can see the two minutes of footage below:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="es" dir="ltr"><p>👀🔥 LEAK ⚡️</p><p>Nuevo metraje de "Project Blackbird", el MMO de Zenimax Online cancelado hace meses por Xbox.</p><p>Qué ganas le tenía 🥺. <a href="https://t.co/4Nz1G22l2F">pic.twitter.com/4Nz1G22l2F</a></p></div>— eXtas1s 🎮 Noticias &amp; Rumores (@eXtas1stv) <a href="https://twitter.com/eXtas1stv/status/2012971422679765352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Project Blackbird was cancelled by Microsoft in July 2025 as a part of Microsoft’s mass layoffs, which also saw other projects at the publisher cancelled.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources on Blackbird, the game was targeting a 2028 release date and had amazed Microsoft Gaming executives just months earlier during a presentation. As of the time of writing, Microsoft Gaming still haven’t given a reason as to why Blackbird was cancelled.</p>



<p>The game’s cancellation led to the layoff of some 300 developers and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/matt-firor-quit-zenimax-project-blackbird-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure of studio president Matt Firor</a>. </p>

<p>The live-action Legend of Zelda movie will stream exclusively on Netflix after its theatrical and home entertainment releases.</p>



<p>Very little is known about the Legend of Zelda movie, aside from the fact that it is slated to release in May 2027. However, as part of Sony Pictures’ Pay-1 licensing deal with Netflix, the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie will join Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse and the forthcoming quartet of Beatles movies, directed by Sam Mendes, in streaming exclusively on Netflix.</p>



<p><a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-and-sony-pictures-entertainment-enter-new-global-pay-1-deal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a press release, </a>Paul Littmann, EVP of Global Distribution at Sony Pictures Television, praised the partnership with Netflix and cited the new deal as the next step in that relationship.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our partnership with Netflix has always been incredibly valuable. This new Pay-1 deal takes that partnership to the next level and reinforces the enduring appeal of our theatrical releases to Netflix’s global audience. It also further underscores the strength of our independence and unique ability to create meaningful opportunities that benefit our creative stakeholders, consumers, and world-class partners.”</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">What We Know So Far About the Legend of Zelda Movie</h2>



<p>In November 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-images-reveal-link-and-zelda-in-costume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official images</a> of Zelda and Link in the film were revealed. Bo Bragason will play Princess Zelda, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth will play Hyrule’s protector, Link. Filming began in 2025, but there’s still over a year until the actual release, and much remains to be learned about the casting, plot, and more. Recently, it was suggested that a star of the popular Apple TV series, Severance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zelda-movie-leak-impa-severance-actor-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">could be joining the cast.</a></p>







<p>2026 is also the 40th anniversary of the The Legend of Zelda franchise as a whole. In celebration, a new LEGO set is on the way.
