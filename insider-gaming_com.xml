<p>The mystery surrounding Highguard stayed with the game until its inevitable launch. The FPS revealed next to nothing in the build-up to its launch, but Wildgate Entertainment was happy to address one major detail about Highguard: Its price and free-to-play status.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> aptly kept up a high guard following its shocking The Game Awards 2025 reveal, even as the days and weeks ticked by to its release date. This added only to Highguard’s aura, and while we all tried to work out what the game was and what it was about, the dev left no doubt about Highguard’s price tag.</p>

<p><strong>Highguard doesn’t cost anything, and it doesn’t have a price, because Highguard is a free-to-play shooter.</strong></p>



<p>That’s the first big stumbling block out of the way. Games like Concord have shown that charging a fee for this type of game can warrant a backlash, or worse (in the case of Concord), nothing at all from anyone.</p>



<p>The gaming world was left with its mouth ajar, watching Highguard be the final reveal of TGA 2025. By not showing anything since, this ironically increased the game’s appeal and hype. On the plus side, no matter how Highguard turns out, whether you love it or hate it, it won’t cost you a penny.</p>



<p>In fact, the game’s only real marketing at all, a few days from launch, was its initial reveal trailer. The impressive footage ended with a definitive message: “Play Free.”</p>

<h2 id="h-will-highguard-have-microtransactions-amp-battle-pass">Will Highguard Have Microtransactions &amp; Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Many will. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Steam claims that Highguard will have ‘In-App Purchases,’ but this is the full extent known about Highguard’s extra paid purchases and potential live-service elements.</strong></p>



<p>All that is known about Highguard—other than the Steam notice about the purchases—is a brief description of the shooter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From the creators of&nbsp;Apex Legends&nbsp;and&nbsp;Titanfall, comes&nbsp;Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to battle for control of a mythical continent. There they’ll clash against rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>You’ll find out, like everyone else, what Highguard has in store (potentially literally) when it launches as a F2P game on January 26.</p>



<p>If Highguard wasn’t free-to-play, would it have put you off? Will you still be skipping Highyuard anyway?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has announced the next Life Is Strange game, “Life is Strange: Reunion,” which will conclude the story of fan favorites Max and Chloe. Due out on March 26, the game is coming to current-generation consoles, and <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a> appears to have shared the news ahead of a dedicated stream officially announcing the next game in the series.</p>



<p>The title of the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unannounced-life-is-strange-reunion-rated-by-pegi-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed through a PEGI rating </a>early in January 2026, and now players know there’s just a little more than 2 months until they can begin the journey to end the story of Max and Chloe.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-fate-of-max-and-chloe-is-in-your-hands-in-life-is-strange-reunion">The Fate of Max and Chloe Is in Your Hands in Life Is Strange: Reunion</h2>



<p>Andrew James, the Senior Brand Manager of Life Is Strange, wrote the blog on Xbox Wire announcing the next game. In the piece, he spoke about his own emotional connection to the story and promised fans the opportunity to decide how to bring Max and Chloe’s story to a definitive conclusion.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Max and Chloe’s relationship is at the core of the story, a relationship that YOU will choose how to develop over the course of the game. Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the past you’ll confirm as you play, but to the future you’ll fight for the chance to build.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>During the official live stream on January 20, Hannah Telle, the actor behind Max Caulfield, and Rhianna DeVries, who portrays Chloe Price, explained how the story would come together based on the decisions players made in prior games. In this new title, Max will learn that she changed more than just the events in Life Is Strange: Double Exposure when she converged timelines.</p>



<h2 id="h-through-the-fire-and-the-flames-we-carry-on">Through the Fire and the Flames We Carry On</h2>



<p>The crux of the story in Reunion will be a fire that breaks out at Caledon University, and Max will use her returning rewind abilities to try to save her friends and students. Max will also be able to stay in the past and begin again after leaping into Polaroid photos to try to escape the fire. Meanwhile, players will also be able to control Chloe, who can use her Backtalk ability to gain answers and advance the story.</p>



<p>Additionally, there’s campus drama, secret societies, and many questions surrounding Max’s role in the fire that players will need to discover as they work toward their perfect finale for these beloved characters.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade has been out for a few years, but you poor Xbox and Nintendo Switch players have had to wait your turn. Square Enix has heard the cries of the planet, and yours, and the FF7 Remake Intergrade release date beckons for the forgotten consoles.</p>



<p>It feels like a lifetime ago that the FF7 Remake debuted on the PS4! It arrived during a weird time for the real world, mirroring the thematic struggles of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remakes-buster-sword-almost-had-a-more-realistic-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>‘s planet. A lot of time has passed since then, so let’s check out the difference in platforms and new release dates.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Cloud nine. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A January 22 release date is currently locked in for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch 2 owners.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation has gotten to enjoy Intergrade for years, and even a PC port has been commissioned in between. The final bridge that needed to be crossed was the one connecting to Xbox and Nintendo. There were doubts if it was ever going to happen.</p>



<p>The timeline on this has been fun, though: Firstly, we heard in June 2025 that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-releasing-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake was finally releasing on Xbox</a>. After a few months, FF fans learned that the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-officially-confirmed-for-xbox-and-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy was confirmed for Xbox and Switch 2</a>!</p>



<p>The experience should be amazing, but if you’re on Nintendo Switch 2, be warned that it will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-be-close-to-100gb-on-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">close to 100GB on Switch 2</a>!</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-on-ps5">Can You Buy Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade On PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, a PS5 version of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is real, and has been available since June 10, 2021.</strong></p>



<p>The PS4 was first associated with FF7 Remake and the Intergrade upgrade. However, it seemed sensible to clear up all platforms and reveal if Intergrade has made its Chocobo-w on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Come January 22, FF7 Remake Intergrade will be available on most main formats.</p>



<p>Let IG know if you’re planning on picking up the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on either Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch 2. The place to do this is simple: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s time to look ahead to FF7’s future. Read about the report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3’s game experience is ‘More or Less Complete’</a>.</p>
