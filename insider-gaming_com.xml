<p>The Last of Us actor recently shared his thoughts on AI, stating that we shouldn’t “demonize” it and that it could help people seek more authentic experiences. </p>



<p>As technology continues to evolve rapidly, the presence of AI is becoming more prominent than ever. It’s impossible to ignore the growing impact of AI across all areas of tech, and we recently saw Sony file a patent for an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-patents-ai-technology-that-can-play-the-game-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI “ghost player”</a> that can basically play a section of the game for you. Now, one of the gaming industry’s prominent members has shared his thoughts on this tech. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-actor-feels-ai-will-make-people-seek-authentic-experiences">The Last of Us Actor Feels AI Will Make People Seek Authentic Experiences </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-troy-baker-could-we" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Business</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/troy-baker-ai-shouldnt-be-demonized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer</a>), The Last of Us actor Troy Baker spoke about AI and its impact on the industry as a whole. Baker first spoke about ” a fundamental premise to making art that people are not remembering right now, and it’s that it requires artists.” People usually look at AI and are amazed by what it can do, but that shouldn’t matter. </p>



<p>Baker adds that people don’t need “don’t need to diminish it, we don’t need to denigrate it, we don’t need to demonize it.” All they need to do is accept its existence while also knowing that their choice as a performer and producer still exists. The Last of Us actor added that AI “there is no doubt that AI can make content way better than humans,” however, the tech “can create content, but it cannot create art” as it “invariably requires the human experience.” </p>



<p>Troy Baker also stated that the growth of AI will drive people to seek more authentic experiences, such as “‘I want to go and watch this person sing this song live.’ ‘I want to see theater’. ‘I want to read books.’ ‘I want to have this first-hand experience as opposed to the gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror”, which is a good thing, “a revolution”. </p>

<p>ARC Raiders CEO reveals that games like Helldivers 2 inspired them to move away from free-to-play to a more traditional model. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ new extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, has cemented itself as one of the top dogs in the multiplayer shooter genre, doing so without pursuing a free-to-play model. The title’s success is apparent, with the game recently hitting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 million sales</a> within 2 months of release. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-wanted-to-make-the-game-feel-like-it-s-totally-worth-40-bucks">ARC Raiders Devs Wanted to Make the Game “Feel Like It’s Totally Worth 40 Bucks”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBeat’s Dean Takahashi</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/embark-boss-says-arc-raiders-usd40-price-was-inspired-by-the-likes-of-helldivers-2-wed-rather-make-people-feel-like-its-totally-worth-40-bucks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Patrick Söderlund, Embark Studios CEO, revealed why they ditched the free-to-play model for ARC Raiders. Söderlund stated that they “looked at games like Helldivers” and realised that’s the same space they want to be in, rather than releasing a free-to-play game. Söderlund adds that he is unsure whether this was the right or wrong decision, but is happy about the fact that the game is “relatively affordable”. </p>



<p>Söderlund then spoke about how they arrived at $40 as the game’s price point. The dev team knew that the game didn’t have a campaign, so they didn’t want the price to be a “offender for someone”. Therefore, they decided to “rather make people feel like it’s totally worth 40 bucks.” The hope is that players feel that they got value for their money, “given how much time they seem to spend in the game.”</p>







<p>In other news, the CEO of Embark Studios has stated they don’t want to promote PvP because “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceo-the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game isn’t about shooting other players</a>”. Additionally, ARC Raiders&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-tv-show-and-movie-ideas-being-pitched-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV show and movie ideas</a>&nbsp;are being pitched to the developers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The CEO of Embark Studios has revealed that they don’t wish to promote PvP systems, as they don’t want to foster that type of gameplay. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders is undoubtedly one of the standout titles of 2025, and it shows no signs of slowing anytime soon, having recently hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new milestone of 12 million units sold</a>. At the same time, it seems the developers aren’t looking to go all-in on PvP to keep the fire burning, since the game wasn’t designed with that as a focus.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-don-t-want-to-foster-pvp-type-gameplay">ARC Raiders Devs Don’t Want to Foster PvP-Type Gameplay</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameBeat’s</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dean Takahashi</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/arc-raiders/250358/news/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund revealed why they aren’t looking to promote PvP systems. The CEO first mentioned discussions about adding Nemesis systems; however, they don’t know where the team is at right now and are also happy that the game doesn’t have a leaderboard and “it’s not competitive.”</p>



<p>Söderlund adds that the dev team “doesn’t want to necessarily foster that type of gameplay” as “the game isn’t about shooting other players”. Of course, the game allows you to be aggressive and fight other players, “but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players.” The PvP element was added to craft tension. </p>



<p>The Embark CEO then spoke about the game being designed to be played “without other players for a long time,” and noted that this worked quite well in some instances. However, as soon as other players were added, the dev team had to resort to subtle ways of signalling, rather than telling you how many players are on the server, how many have died, etc. </p>



<p>Hence, ARC Raiders is all about players using audio and visual cues when engaging in PvP situations. Players need to hear other players shooting and see raider flares go up to see where the action is. Not providing all the information at once creates tension, forcing players to decide whether exploring the area where the action is a risk worth taking. </p>



<p>However, the CEO also said that private servers in ARC Raiders are “absolutely something we could consider,” and that could be an excellent addition for players looking for more PvP action. </p>
