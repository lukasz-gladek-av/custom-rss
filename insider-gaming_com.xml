<p>A new report has revealed that Michael Sarnoski, the director behind <em>A Quiet Place: Day</em> One will be directing the new Death Stranding movie.</p>



<p>The new report comes from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/death-stranding-movie-michael-sarnoski-a24-1236360094/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, who say that Michael Sarnoski will be the director and writing of the live-action adaptation of Hideo Kojima’s video game&nbsp;Death Stranding. Sarnoski ‘broke out’ with his movie ‘Pig’ that starred Nicolas Cage. Shortly after, Sarnoski went on to direct ‘<em>A Quiet Place: Day</em> One’, grossing more then $250 million worldwide.</p>



<p>The Death Stranding movie was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced in 2022</a> and will be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-partners-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnership project between Hideo Kojima and film studio A24</a>. Details on the movie are still unclear, but Kojima has said&nbsp;he’s “aiming for a more arthouse approach” with the movie.</p>



<p>Those comments might make a bit more sense if you’re familiar with A24’s past movies, including the likes of ‘The Witch’ and ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’.</p>



<p>Death Stranding the movie hasn’t currently had any announcements as to who the film will star, but for those hoping that Normal Reedus will reprise his role, it’s likely not to happen. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous information</a> reported by Deadline, the movie will focus on a story set apart from the content found within the games, introducing all-new ‘elements and characters’ within the existing universe of Death Stranding.</p>



<p>The original game see’s the player control Sam Porter Bridges (portrayed by Normal Reedus) as he’s tasked with supplier isolated outposts and colonies with a wireless communications network so they can be reconnected. It’s set in the United States, where an unknown event has caused the planet to be a shell of its former self, where creatures of the unknown roam. </p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong developers have confirmed that the game will also be released on the original Nintendo Switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matthew Griffin, who handles Marketing and Publishing for Hollow Knight: Silksong, recently took to <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1909395467945099502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to clear up the confusion. After the game appeared during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, many players were worried that it would be only available on the upcoming console. However, Griffin’s latest tweet confirms, “Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming to both Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>



<p>With the confirmation of Switch 1, Hollow Knight: Silksong is now confirmed on all the leading platforms, including PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox and Nintendo Switch. Moreover, when it releases, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available as a <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/1907487462840029397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Day One</a> title on Xbox Game Pass. However, the developers have yet to provide a release date for the game; we only know that it is slated to be released in 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-season-2-is-only-the-%E2%80%98first-half%E2%80%99-of-the-game.1157979/</guid>

<p>The reviews for the second season of The Last of Us are rolling out right now, and they’re mostly positive, bar a few outliers. This batch of all-new episodes has been a long time coming, given that it has been more than two years since the first season dropped and turned heads worldwide.</p>



<p>The award-winning show returns to the pleasure of fans everywhere, and if there’s one thing the reviews are confirming, it’s how much meat is on the bones of the second season. The earlier reports are being confirmed – The Last of Us season two only represents the first half of the 2020 release of The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-makes-sense">Makes Sense</h2>



<p>We always knew The Last of Us Part II would be a beast to adapt for a live-action series. It’s an expansive title that spans years and several settings – plus there are two playable characters who each have their perspective on the game’s intense and cinematic story.</p>



<p>It was suggested a while ago by showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann that it would take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-tv-show-around-forever/">‘two or three seasons’</a> to cover everything in The Last of Us Part II, and that’s not including original content that’s created specifically for the show.</p>



<p>The reviews that are emerging now have confirmed that around <strong>one-half </strong>of The Last of Us Part II is covered by the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-and-episode-count-revealed/">batch of seven episodes</a>. Some have complained that it feels ‘spread thin’ when compared to the first season, which saw the entirety of the game covered by a single sprint.</p>



<p>This likely means that setting up the climax for a painful transition into the third season, which will likely take another two or three years, will be front and centre as the episodes unravel.</p>



<p>The Last of Us season two is set to release with a schedule of one episode a week starting this Sunday, April 13.</p>

<p>In July 2023, Disney Illusion Island was released exclusively on Nintendo Switch. It wasn’t a groundbreaking title, but it boasted a charming enough 2D side-scrolling operating model that allowed players to control some of Disney’s most beloved characters.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed by dataminers that after almost two years on the market, Disney Illusion Island is leaving the Nintendo Switch and heading to PlayStation 5. It hasn’t been confirmed if it’ll be launching on Xbox and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-disney">More Disney </h2>



<p>In a listing posted on <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2956512/disney-illusion-island-starring-mickey-and-friends" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSDeals.net</a>, it was revealed that ‘Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey and Friends’ is headed to PlayStation 5 (digitally) on May 30. This information was first uncovered by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lmbnmasc7k2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> on social media.</p>



<p>In Illusion Island, players can pick from Mickey, Minnie, Donald Duck, or Goofy, taking those characters and navigating through perilous levels and avoiding enemy attacks to resolve quests. As the game unravels, players unlock more abilities and broader areas of the map.</p>



<p>From the game’s description from the PS Store scraping:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Join Mickey &amp; Friends on a quest to explore the mysterious island of Monoth and recover three mystical books to save the world from disaster!</p>



<p>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends includes the base game plus the Keeper Up, Mystery in Monoth, and brand new C.A.S.H. update featuring Scrooge McDuck.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a game with local co-op mechanics, so it’s perfect for families. It hasn’t been suggested how much it’ll cost, but it’s $39.99 in the Nintendo Store, so use that as a guide.</p>



<p>The game was developed by Dlala Studios, and it was noted that the title took inspiration from Rayman Legends when it was being created. On launch, the game garnered mixed reviews, going on to land a Metacritic score of 73 but securing some high praise from Nintendo-centric outlets.</p>



<p>For instance, while IGN gave Illusion Island a score of 7/10, Nintendo Life reached for a score of 9/10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-explain-why-solid-snake-silent-tough-guy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima created and released Metal Gear in 1987, introducing Solid Snake to the world. He would go on to become one of the most widely recognised characters in gaming, but his first outing rendered him a silent, stalwart figure incapable of uttering a single word.</p>



<p>Kojima has gone on record explaining why Solid Snake was silent, breaking down his earliest experiences with voice actors and reflecting on past technologies.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-games-still-couldn-t-speak">‘Games Still Couldn’t Speak’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/49804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">An An</a> (thanks to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-snakes-silent-tough-guy-personality-was-influenced-by-technical-limitations-of-the-first-game-kojima-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Hideo Kojima explained at length why Solid Snake was a silent protagonist in the first Metal Gear game that debuted in the late eighties:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In 1986, when I entered the game industry, <strong>games still couldn’t speak</strong>. The characters didn’t have voices. There wasn’t even a kanji font, and the characters were just displayed one by one. Solid Snake, the protagonist of my debut game, Metal Gear (1987), was born as <strong>a silent tough guy</strong> because of this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It didn’t take long for things to change, though. The legendary developer revealed that just one year after Metal Gear was released, a technological leap forward occurred when NEC released the CD-ROM2, a console with a disc drive. This was an evolution that accommodated Kojima’s desires:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Because the media was CD, it was possible to use voice dialogue, which had not been possible until then. I was one of the first to step forward and remake it.</p>



<p>It was my first time doing voice recordings. I did the casting myself, but since I was a complete outsider, I left the management to an agency. I took the first bullet train from Kobe and arrived at the studio in Tokyo. The gorgeous voice actors were already standing by in front of the microphone. </p>



<p>There was no time to greet or even have a meeting. It was an outrageous schedule, with everything recorded in almost half a day. There was no way I could build relationships. The regret and regret of this first experience would greatly change my subsequent voice recordings.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Text translated from Japanese by AI)</em></p>



<p>From there, history started being made, and Kojima went on to explain how his various teams tried to innovate in the voice recording department whenever possible. Today, Kojima’s games feature Hollywood celebrities and deeply cinematic scripts and performances, so it’s fair to say he was successful in that mission.</p>
