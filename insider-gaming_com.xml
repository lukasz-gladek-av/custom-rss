<p>Ubisoft has spent a long time working on XDefiant, and now it’s reportedly shutting down—according to reports. The 2024 shooter is seen as a big rival to Call of Duty, so let’s find out everything we know about XDefiant’s future, and if you need to play for big changes.</p>



<p>The online first-person shooter landscape is primarily dominated by the same faces. When you narrow it down to military shooters though, the pool shortens more so. Battlefield 2042 notoriously launched to negative reception, and many contemporaries are either hero shooters or third-person titles. XDefiant was supposed to be just that, a defiant stance catering to shooter fans tired of the annual Call of Duty release.</p>



<p>XDefiant’s beta performed well, Ubisoft responded to player feedback as they said they would, and the worldwide launch was hotter than a dinner part with The Cleaners faction. Let’s see if things have gone south since, and what it could mean.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-xdefiant-shutting-down">Is XDefiant Shutting Down?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Now I have to turn my back on you. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>XDefiant is officially shutting down in June 2025, and the shooter is set to receive hugely reduced content updates moving forward.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming first broke the news on Dec. 3, that XDefiant is shutting down for good. The major details revealed, that “a skeleton crew [is] maintaining the title until June 2025,” and that once Season 3 launches, this signals the end of XDefiant’s regular content schedule, instead, the occasional update is expected to follow based on already-made assets and parts. This is in stark contrast to recent reports that XDefiant wouldn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-executive-producer-denies-claim-the-game-will-shut-down-after-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down after Season 4</a>.</p>



<p>Worse still, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot issued a company-wide memo</a> to “pay tribute to the tremendous work done by the XDefiant’s teams,” but discussed downsizing by way of “<strong>The closure of the San Francisco and Osaka studios</strong>, and the <strong>ramp down of the Sydney production site</strong>.”</p>



<p>It’s understood Ubisoft is refunding players for any cosmetic purchases and Founder’s Packs. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-xdefiant-shutting-down">Why is XDefiant Shutting Down?</h2>



<p>According to sources close to the situation, “<strong>Poor player numbers and a lack of player spending</strong>” are the reasons for XDefiant shutting down in 2025.</p>



<p>XDefiant is a free-to-play, live-service title, and as such, it means the shooter’s revenue comes from the voluntary purchases of players. Battle Passes, Skins, and specialist currency are all part of the XDefiant e-commerce system. It appears XDefiant players were not spending enough money on optional cosmetics, leading the shooter to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-fallen-behind-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fall behind expectations.</a>“</p>



<p>It seems bizarre in hindsight, as XDefiant’s debut registered a whopping <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million unique players in under three hours</a>. The numbers skyrocketed to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-8-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight million unique players by the end of its first full week</a>. It wasn’t to be though, as player numbers began to tail off, and XDefiant’s downfall slowly unfolded during the next few months.</p>

<p>Are you sad to see XDefiant hang up its holsters already? Could Ubisoft have done anything differently with the FPS title? Let us know down below. Be sure to look at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-not-dying-ubisoft-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant roadmap</a> detailing the final planned content.</p>

<p>As 2024 winds down, another game studio has closed its doors for good. Deceive Inc. developer Sweet Bandits Studios has announced that it is shutting down, effectively immediately.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/a-message-from-sweet-bandits.2340721/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">forum post</a> on Tuesday, the Canadian studio announced that it is “no more” after reaching “the breaking point for the studio”.</p>



<p>“After a long and difficult road of trying to get Deceive inc. in a state where it could thrive, we have reached the breaking point for the studio, unable to continue this adventure with you,” the studio said.</p>



<p>“While this is a moment of great sadness for us, we are happy to have been given the chance to create this universe and share it with you all. We were amazed by the passion of this community and this has been a driving force for us all along, pushing us to try and make this project reach the potential it has. We’ve put our heart and soul into this game and nothing makes us happier than seeing it resonate with other people across the world.”</p>



<p>Sweet Bandits launched Deceive Inc. in 2023 to a “very positive” response from players on Steam. According to the studio, they are working with publisher Tripwire Interactive in order to maintain the game and keep it online.</p>



<p>“We will share news with everyone once we have more details,” they said. “In the meantime, servers and game access will continue as they have been.”</p>



<p>While the company didn’t confirm how many people have lost their jobs, the <a href="https://www.sweetbanditsstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s website</a> says that it had 18 employees. It’s unclear, however, if that number was still accurate.</p>

<p>Torn Banner Studios, the developers behind No More Room in Hell 2 and Chivalry 2, have announced layoffs amid a “restructure” at the company. </p>



<p>The news was announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/torn-banner-studios_a-message-from-steve-piggott-torn-banner-activity-7269735996861091841-xf_y/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> by CEO Steve Piggott.</p>



<p>“Today I want to share some unfortunate news for Torn Banner Studios,” Piggott said. We have made the very difficult decision to undergo a restructure and reduce some of our talented workforce.</p>



<p>“As a fully independent, self-funded developer, we’re up against many challenges. Our team is navigating this process with a tremendous amount of care and appreciation for those that are impacted. Torn Banner Studios would not be the place it is today without the dedication, passion, and accomplishments of these great people.”</p>







<p>Piggott continued to say that No More Room in Hell 2’s development will continue on, and that the studio is “fully committed as we move forward with a full 1.0 release in 2025”. The game, he says, is “central to our goals as a studio”.</p>



<p>“We are still actively working on everything we’ve spoken about in our roadmap, and more,” he said. “Torn Banner will continue to work hard to develop the game alongside our community.”</p>



<p>The studio’s other game, Chivalry 2, will have servers remain active after the game received its final update earlier this year.</p>



<p>Those being let go at the company will receive severance packages and are able to keep their work computers.</p>



<p>“We’ll also be working hard to help people find positions at other studios where we can,” Piggott added.</p>



<p>At this time, it’s unclear exactly how many people are being let go from Torn Banner Studios in this round of layoffs. Insider Gaming has reached out for clarification, and will update this article should a response be received.</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a> lost across 170+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000.</p>
