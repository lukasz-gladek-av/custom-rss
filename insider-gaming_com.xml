<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has reignited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-zombies-split-screen-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> as the mode returned back to its round-based roots. The undead mode has been all about giving the community what they want, a classic Zombies experience, with all the Perks and features fans know and love.</p>



<p>Speaking of Perks, you’ll find a familiar bunch in both Terminus and Liberty Falls, from Juggernog, Speedcola and Quick Revive to Deadshot Daiquiri, Stamina-Up and PHD Flopper.  With the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts map</a>, the devs have decided to reintroduce a Perk from Black Ops 2 called Vulture Aid.</p>



<p>For those who aren’t familiar with the Perk, here’s what Vulturue Aid is in Black Ops 6 Zombies and how it works.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-is-vulture-aid-in-bo6-zombies">What is Vulture Aid in BO6 Zombies?</h2>



<p>Vulture Aid is a <strong>Zombies Perk that players can purchase in the Black Ops 6 Citadelle des Morts map</strong>, which arrives December 5, 2024, as part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1-reloaded-release-date-new-guns-codmas-event-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 Reloaded update</a>. </p>



<p>The Vulture Aid Perk was first introduced in Black Ops 2’s Buried map and hasn’t been seen since. It returns in Black Ops 6, and it will likely feature the same coffin-style red and white Perk machine design.</p>

<h2 id="h-vulture-aid-perk-effects">Vulture Aid Perk effects</h2>



<ul>
<li>See Perks, wall weapons, the Pack-a-Punch machine, and the Mystery Box through walls when close-by (they will also have a brighter glow for better visability).</li>



<li>Zombies also occasionally drop ammo or points on death</li>



<li>Some Zombies will release a green cloud upon death that players can walk into to mask themselves from Zombies and be ignored.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are the effects of Vulture Aid in Black Ops 2. There’s no telling whether the Perk will have the same effects in Black Ops 6 until mwe get hands on, but it will likely be very similar.</p>

<p>Venture Aid is on the Citadelle des Morts map in Black Ops 6 Zombies. We don’t yet know exactly where the Perk Machine will be, but it has been confirmed for the new map.</p>

<p>PlayStation is in the midst of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the brand. From bold sales to nostalgia-fuelled montages celebrating the label’s expansive history, players have been wrapped up in the last three decades of PlayStation-based gaming for several days.</p>



<p>Later this month, several esports tournaments will surface on PS5, utilising the onboard PlayStation Tournament platform that was added to the system towards the end of 2022.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-games-are-in-the-playstation-tournaments">What Games Are In The PlayStation Tournaments?</h2>



<p>It was revealed that a string of PlayStation Tournaments will unravel between December 6 – 8, allowing users to win exclusive celebratory prizes. These prizes will include in-game items and avatars created in celebration of PlayStation’s milestone.</p>



<p>Here are the games confirmed to be contributing to this special event:</p>



<ul>
<li>College Football 25</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 25</li>



<li>Guilty Gear Strive</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 1</li>



<li>Madden NFL 25</li>



<li>MLB The Show 24</li>



<li>NBA 2K25</li>



<li>Tekken 8</li>



<li>UFC 5</li>
</ul>



<p>For some, the list is a little lacking – there are no FPS or racing options, which might seem a little short-sighted given the state of the esports industry and its preference for such games, but that’s a conversation for another day.</p>



<p>If you consider yourself a talented player in one of these games, you can sign up through the PlayStation Tournament function on your PS5, competing across one – or several – of these games in an attempt to win some exclusive prizes.</p>



<p><a href="https://compete.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation’s ‘Competition Center’</a> is the place to go to find out everything you need to know about this promotional event.</p>



<p>Will you be taking part in December’s PlayStation Tournaments? Let us know what game you’ll play on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gray Zone Warfare Rip-off Appears On PlayStation Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-copy-playstation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-rip-off-appears-on-playstation-store.1050399/</guid>

<p>It was recently noticed that a knock-off copy of Gray Zone Warfare, ‘Gray Zone Attack’, has appeared on the PlayStation store, set to be released in 2025. It’s from a developer named ‘Esail’, and at first blush, it’s a carbon copy of the popular tactical-slash-extraction shooter that was released in April 2024.</p>



<p>The cover art featured on the PlayStation store was made using AI, and everything from the iconography on down is a thinly-veiled replication of Gray Zone Warfare.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shameless">Shameless</h2>



<p>It’s the nature of the business – when a game becomes successful enough, replications of said game will surface.</p>



<p>Last year, I covered a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-switch-clone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hilarious Last of Us clone</a> on Nintendo Switch called ‘The Last Hope’. It featured characters reminiscent of Joel and Ellie, slaying the undead and looking for a ‘brighter future’. It was pulled from the store not long after appearing, though.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Attack has appeared under similar circumstances. It’s listed on the PlayStation store as a single-player shooter, whereas Gray Zone Warfare is a PvEvP FPS. The game’s blurb and spiel reads could be describing MADFINGER’s GZW, though.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Prepare to enter a hostile and unpredictable world where danger lurks at every turn. In Gray Zone Attack, you’re part of an elite tactical unit sent to uncover the secrets of a devastated quarantine zone. Every decision matters, every bullet counts, and survival is never guaranteed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>“Every decision matters.”</em></p>



<p>MADFINGER’s slogan for Gray Zone Warfare is ‘every move matters’ – the audacity of this replication is mind-blowing.</p>



<p>On social media, MADFINGER’s Rick Lagnese wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While #GrayZoneWarfare brings players tactical depth and strategic thrills, “Gray Zone Attack” might be a little too busy attacking the idea of originality. We prefer crafting something one-of-a-kind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full description of Gray Zone Attack talks of an immersive open world, customisable gear, tactical combat with realistic weapon handling, and a dynamic injury system. These are all features that sit front and centre in Gray Zone Warfare, which has been painstakingly crafted by MADFINGER over many years.</p>



<p>I’d bet hard cash this title will never see the light of day, and if it does, it’ll be some bizarre, stripped-down microtransaction farm.</p>



<p>What’s the most ridiculous copy of a game you’ve seen? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
