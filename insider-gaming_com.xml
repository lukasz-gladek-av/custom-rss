<p>VALORANT Patch 9.11 has just gone live, and the long-awaited nerfs to the game’s most overpowered agent have finally arrived. Neon has been running wild across VALORANT competitive queues, and her over-tuned abilities have even drawn complaints from many pro players.</p>



<p>At long last, the Neon nerfs have arrived, but how impactful are they really going to be?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-slide-cancel">Slide cancel</h2>



<p>The most impactful change made to Neon is the nerfs to her sliding ability. While her High Gear sprinting ability is active, Neon can right-click to slide, temporarily increasing her speed. With the <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-9-11/">release of Patch 9.11</a>, Neon now only have one Slide charge instead of two. Additionally, accuracy while sliding has been reduced from “full” accuracy down to the consistency of crouch-walking accuracy.</p>



<p>These changes walk back the buffs Neon received back in June 2024. In Patch 8.11, Slide was granted two charges and “all weapon movement error” was removed while sliding. This resulted in Neon retaining precise firing accuracy even while sliding around a corner or angle at an alarmingly fast pace. Neon and her Slide became the default agent/ability combo for entry players. In the second half of the 2024 VALORANT Champions Tour season, Neon was a go-to for pro teams on maps like Sunset and Haven.</p>



<p>The Patch 9.11 nerfs to Neon’s Slide accomplish two things. First, they prevent Neon from using two charges to just slide into an area, get a kill, and slide away safely without getting traded. Secondly, the changes to movement accuracy will deter Neon players from winning long range duels while sliding against stationary opponents. The Slide is still deadly at close range, but it’s no longer a broken ability that lets Neon get free kills at long range.</p>



<p>In addition to the Slide nerfs, Patch 9.11 will nerf Neon’s ultimate ability, Overdrive. The deadly lightning beam now lasts only 10 seconds instead of a full 20, and players need to earn an additional eighth ultimate point in order to activate it. Patch 9.11 also gives some minor buffs to the newest agent Vyse, and changes the in-game pinging system. Pings are now blocked by smokes, and pings made using the map will stay on the map and not appear in the world.</p>



<p>Still planning to use Neon despite her nerfs? Tell us why in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/people-can-fly-announces-layoffs-impacted-120-employees/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>People Can Fly has announced that it is the next studio to hold layoffs as 2024 winds down. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1866531267464007759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski said that the company is making changes throughout the studio that will impact over 120 employees.</p>



<p>“Today, we made a very difficult decision to reduce our self-publishing strategy by suspending Project Victoria, scaling down our team on Project Bifrost, and restructuring some of our supporting teams at People Can Fly,”  Wojciechowski said.</p>



<p>He said that the moves come due to “external market pressures” that were beyond what they had expected. Moving forward, they are focusing on the development of a single game as opposed to multiple projects, and are “redoubling our efforts with new work-for-hire engagements”.</p>



<p>The layoffs at People Can Fly puts the games industry at nearly <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">15,000 known jobs lost</a> in 2024. When taking into account unconfirmed  numbers, the real total is over 16,000 jobs. </p>



<p>“We recognize this is a profoundly challenging time for our team members, as we say goodbye to valued colleagues who have contributed so much,” Wojciechowski said.</p>



<p>“Our priority is to approach this moment with compassion and to ensure our team feels supported as we work together to build a stronger future.”</p>



<p>You can read Wojciechowski’s full statement below. Let us know what you think of the state of the games industry and the latest layoffs down below or in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1313/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>



<hr>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are deeply saddened by the fact that this situation means suspending or parting ways with more than 120 talented Aviators, colleagues who we enjoyed having as part of our team.</p>



<p>This action became necessary as external market pressures persisted beyond our forecasts. The video game market is still evolving, and we have to adjust with where things are today. We are redoubling our efforts with new work-for-hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game.</p>



<p>We believe in our teams, games, and their potential, and we remain extremely committed to continuing that journey, but we need to tailor our plans to our financial capacity.</p>



<p>We are deeply grateful for the contributions of every team member impacted by this turn of events; their talent and dedication have helped shape our company and our games. These changes are deeply felt by all of us.</p>



<p>We recognize this is a profoundly challenging time for our team members, as we say goodbye to valued colleagues who have contributed so much. We are focused on supporting those impacted during this transition, providing them with resources and assistance to navigate this change, and are equally committed to caring for those staying, who are managing the challenges of losing coworkers and friends.</p>



<p>Our priority is to approach this moment with compassion and to ensure our team feels supported as we work together to build a stronger future.</p>



<p>In this hard moment, our dedication to excellence and creativity remains as strong as ever. For everyone who loves what we create — we will not give up on our dreams.”</p>

<p>The 2024 PlayStation retrospective is now available, allowing PS4 and PS5 owners to check their stats throughout the year.</p>



<p>Since the feature was introduced, it has been widely anticipated by fans because of its social contagion. In this day and age, who doesn’t like to brag on social media, right?</p>



<p>The initiative allows players to see the hours played, the number of trophies obtained, the most played games of each month and other details. To celebrate the occasion, PlayStation is also releasing an avatar code that appears on the screen at the end of your retrospective.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://wrapup.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2024 PlayStation Wrap-Up</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>An interesting feature is that the retrospective also serves to determine the player’s preferred style. If you’ve played a lot of RPGs or JRPGs, you’ll be categorized as a Role Player, for example.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the site is overloaded. The situation should normalize over the course of the day when the number of simultaneous accesses begins to drop.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of the use of the algorithm, the Wrap-Up also indicates a selection of PS Plus games that are ideal for the player based on the titles they have tried throughout the year.</p>



<p>How was your 2024 PlayStation Wrap-Up? Let us know in the comments and join in the discussion on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mongolian-cs2-team-makes-history-at-shanghai-major/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>At the Perfect World Shanghai Major, a Mongolian Counter-Strike 2 team is doing the unthinkable. The MongolZ have accomplished a feat that no other team from the Asia region has ever done before, in a manner that no team in the world has done in more than half a decade.</p>



<p>Just a few weeks prior, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mongolz-wins-thunderpick-world-championship/">The MongolZ claimed their largest prize pool winnings ever</a> at the Thunderpick World Championship. But something even more unimaginable is still possible for them.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-job-s-not-done">Job’s Not Done</h2>



<p>By qualifying for the playoffs of the Perfect World Shanghai Major, The MongolZ became the first Asian Counter-Strike team to do so in Major history. Dating back to 2013, the playoff field has always been dominated by European teams, with one or two North and South American teams sneaking in regularly. Asian teams typically compete alongside Oceanic teams in Major qualifiers, but in the rare occasions were an Asia-Pacific team reaches playoffs, it’s always been an Australian roster until now.</p>



<p>The fashion in which The MongolZ reached the playoffs is also a historical feat. The Major utilizes two 16-team Swiss stages to determine who goes to playoffs. The MongolZ went 3-0 in both the Opening Stage and the Elimination Stage, beating the likes of Heroic, GamerLegion, MOUZ, and G2 Esports. The last time a team went 3-0 in two Swiss Stages at the same Major was at the FACEIT London Major in 2018, when Team Liquid accomplished that feat. G2 did it as well at the ELEAGUE Boston Major prior, which was the first Major to utilize the two Swiss stages.</p>



<p>Fittingly, The MongolZ made playoffs at the first Counter-Strike Major to be held in Asia. The team’s 19-year-old rising star Sodbayar “⁠Techno⁠” Munkhbold <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40498/techno-on-playing-in-front-of-the-asian-crowd-its-a-big-advantage-for-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said the crowd has been “a big advantage”</a> for the team. That advantage should increase as the event transitions over to the larger Shanghai Oriental Sports Center for playoffs.</p>



<p>Do you have The MongolZ going all the way in your pick ‘ems? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-2-focuses-on-customization-and-expressing-yourself/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>CD Projekt Red has announced full details for Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2. Releasing Today (December 10), Update 2.2 is known as the “Express Yourself” patch that adds a number of capabilities for players in areas such as car customization, photo mode, and character creator. </p>



<p>The update is available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Starting with car customization, players will now be able  to update more cars with more colors and designs. There’s also a new “Twintone” feature that allows players to scan any car in the world, and transfer the scheme and color over to their own vehicle. Lastly, in regard to vehicles, Johnny Silverhand can now be a passenger in  your car.</p>



<p>With Photo mode, the developers have added a number of new options for players including a new drone mode that allows for more range and movement when setting up a photo. There are also new lighting updates along with the ability to add up to three NPCs to  your photo. Once you’re happy with your pictures, you can hang them in your apartment or upload them to a gallery for other players to see.</p>



<p>The game’s character creator has been updated to include over 100 new assets as well as a complete character randomizer. There were also updates that the team didn’t want to talk about during the reveal stream. </p>



<p>The full patch notes are available via <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/update-2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While players will no doubt be a bit disappointed to not get any PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements or a New Game+, the additional customization features should breath some extra life into the four-year-old game. </p>



<p>With Update 2.2, CD Projekt Red didn’t confirm that this will be the final update for Cyberpunk 2077. They did say that that “maybe” there would be another surprise or two in the future. However, as the team puts the focus on the game’s sequel Project Orion, it could be assumed that time working on the first game is winding down. </p>



<p>Speaking of the game’s sequel, the game likely won’t arrive until after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-production-cd-projekt-red-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next installment of The Witcher</a>, currently known as Project Polaris.</p>
