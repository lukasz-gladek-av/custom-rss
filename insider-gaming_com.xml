            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) and Battlefield Studios have pushed out an update that nerfs XP bot farming in Battlefield 6 portal lobbies.</p>



<p>While portal lobbies will give players a 150% match completion bonus, <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1980703722800886102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they no longer</a> offer Mastery XP or challenge completions. This nerf only impacts those lobbies that have bots enabled.</p>



<p>When Battlefield 6 launched, many players used bot-filled lobbies within the portal to quickly rank up their weapons and complete challenges. That resulted in debate among players on social media about whether it was something that should be allowed. Then, a week after the game‚Äôs release, EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put out a statement</a> saying that a review of data found that <strong>‚Äúa large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>While they ‚Äúcompletely understand‚Äù why these lobbies were made, EA said that it made it ‚Äúnoticeably harder‚Äù for players to play in lobbies that offered a genuine Battlefield 6 experience. This led the company to announce plans to make adjustments to the portal that would limit the number of XP farms that used available server space.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWhether that‚Äôs Hardcore Conquest, All-Out Warfare, longer matches, or your favorite community-created experience, we want you to be able to find and enjoy it easily with your friends as you play your way together,‚Äù EA said at the time.</p>







<p>As expected with a major change like this, the reactions have been a bit mixed. While the overall feedback on social has been generally positive, with players calling the update ‚Äúexcellent news‚Äù and ‚Äúas it should be‚Äù, there are those who aren‚Äôt happy about it.</p>



<p>The chief complaint among those upset involves the <a href="https://x.com/Jaidenatoor11/status/1980709454145536371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty and length of time</a> it takes to complete various weapon challenges and unlock attachments. EA has said, however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-progression-issues-and-xp-leveling-will-be-addressed-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that updates to progression</a> are coming as early as this week. </p>

<p>Despite rumours, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will release on its previously revealed release date, November 14, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who don‚Äôt know, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a claim</a> from yesterday stated that there was evidence of a potential release date change for Black Ops 7, with the game arriving a week earlier. However, Treyarch has debunked this claim, revealing that the release date for the upcoming title remains on track. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-to-release-on-november-14-as-planned">Black Ops 7 To Release on November 14 As Planned</h2>



<p>The latest post from Treyarch on <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1980670037985042637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) discusses the release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The developers have stated, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre less than a month away from #BlackOps7‚Äôs launch on November 14,‚Äù which clears up any doubts about a potential announcement of a release date change. The post also talks about their newest dev talk dropping today, October 21, along with more juicy multiplayer updates from the beta. </p>

<p>Talking about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Beta, it was revealed that RICOCHET Anti-Cheat achieved the strongest Beta results in Call of Duty history. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-matches-beta-cheaters-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">99% of the matches were cheater-free</a>, and cheaters were detected within three matches. This is excellent news for fans of the series, as Call of Duty has been one of the franchise‚Äôs biggest victims of in-game cheating. Hopefully, the case remains the same during launch. </p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 developers have announced that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-will-have-non-disbanding-lobbies-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feature</a> non-disbanding multiplayer lobbies at launch. Additionally, the game didn‚Äôt include a Wall Run feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-have-wall-run-due-to-its-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to its timeline</a>.
