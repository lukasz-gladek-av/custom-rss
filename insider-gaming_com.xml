<p>Are you excited about Berlin’s VCT Game Changers Championship? The relatively new tournament series has become increasingly popular among Valorant fans. The co-ed series features both women and male players from various esports organizations. Here is the upcoming VCT Game Changers Championship format being used.</p>



<h2 id="h-berlin-s-vct-game-changers-championship-format">Berlin’s VCT Game Changers Championship Format</h2>



<p>The popular event will feature some of the best Valorant players in the world facing off against each other in Berlin. However, no official prize pool has been announced.</p>



<p>Still, fans are gearing up for a legendary event to see who takes home the 2024 Game Changers Championship title.</p>



<p>So, what about the format? Well, Riot Games just released the tournament format today on Twitter, let’s break it down:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>10 Teams Competing</strong></li>



<li><strong>Double-Elimination</strong></li>



<li><strong>Best-of-3 Brackets</strong></li>



<li><strong>Top Seeds From NA and EMEA Will Get a Buy Into 2nd Round</strong></li>



<li><strong>Final Matches: Best-of-5</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The series will feature competitors from the following regions of the world:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>North America</strong></li>



<li><strong>Latin America</strong></li>



<li><strong>EMEA</strong></li>



<li><strong>China</strong></li>



<li><strong>APAC</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brazil</strong></li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Grand Finals will be streamed live on the <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/status/1850930070640324947">official Valorant Twitch.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-tournament-dates">Tournament Dates</h2>



<p>Here are the official VCT Game Changers Championship dates:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>November 8 – 17, 2024.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The tournament series is meant to give Valorant fans and competitors the gaming action they need during the official VCT off-season. The actual VCT season ended in South Korea back in August of 2024 when EDward Gaming was awarded first place.</p>



<p>Luckily, Valorant understands that waiting until 2025 for more competitive Valorant action will not go over well with fans and players. </p>



<p>But what about the teams competing? Here is a list of every esports team playing in the 2024 VCT Game Changers Championship:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>G2 Gozen</strong></li>



<li><strong>GIANTX GC</strong></li>



<li><strong>Falcons Vega</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shopify Rebellion</strong></li>



<li><strong>FlyQuest RED</strong></li>



<li><strong>MIBR GC</strong></li>



<li><strong>KRU Blaze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Xipto Esports</strong></li>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-lw3a1-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LW3A1 Frostline</a> is the best Sniper for quickscoping in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> due to its fast mobility and handling. It’s a bolt-action Sniper  Rifle, so it requires an accurate shot, which is extremely satisfying when it hits. It will one-shot enemies to the head, upper chest, and upper arms, so you’ll need to retain accuracy while quickscoping in order to drop enemies quickly.</p>



<p>The SVD may have better handling and mobility, however, it’s a semi-auto rifle, which means it lacks one-shot capabilities, making it a worse option.</p>



<h3 id="h-is-the-lw3a1-frostline-better-than-the-lr-7-62">Is the LW3A1 Frostline better than the LR 7.62?</h3>



<p>The LW3A1 is better for quickscoping, but the LR 7.62 is the best Sniper in terms of damage and one-shot kill consistency. </p>



<p>The LR 7.62 will drop an enemy in one bullet so long as you hit the arms, chest, or head. The Frostline is less forgiving, as you need to hit the upper chest and arms to secure a one-shot kill. That said, the LR 7.62 is slower and has worse handling, so as far as quickscoping goes, I prefer the fast and weightless feel of the LW3A1.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Short Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Comb: </strong>Commando Riser</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Laser: </strong>Target Laser</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong> 7.62 Nato FMJ</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Short Barrel </strong>provides a boost to the jumping aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds, which I found incredibly useful with Ominimovement in Black Ops 6, as you’ll often find yourself jumping around to avoid bullets and hit shots.</p>



<p>To increase aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds, the <strong>Commando Riser </strong>Comb is a great choice, while the <strong>Combat Stock</strong> provides some flinch resistance and aim walking movement speed.</p>



<p>Arguably the most important attachment for quickscoping in Black Ops 6 is the <strong>Target Laser</strong>, which drastically reduces aiming idle sway and improves your aim walking steadiness. This means that when you aim in, your aim will be more accurate to where your crosshairs were before aiming down sight, leading to more accurate quickscopes.</p>



<p>Lastly, to add some flair to your shots, the <strong>7.62 Nato FMJ </strong>Fire Mod will allow you to hit wallbangs with an improvement to penetration damage.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-perks-for-quickscoping">Best Perks for quickscoping</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong> Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong> Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Cold Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong> Overkill</li>
</ul>



<p>For the best quickscoping loadout in Black Ops 6, you’ll want <strong>Ghost</strong> to keep you off the enemy radar, <strong>Forward Intel </strong>for more information on the enemy team’s position, and <strong>Cold Blooded</strong> to avoid enemy scorestreaks. These combine to give you the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong> too, which will reveal enemies through walls when you spawn, giving you a good idea of where to set up.</p>



<p>As for the Wildcard, <strong>Overkill</strong> is the best option, as you can then run an SMG like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-c9-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C9</a> or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ksv-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KSV</a> as your Secondary to cover those close-range engagements. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-equipment-to-use-with-sniper">Best Equipment to use with Sniper</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tactical:</strong> Concussion</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong> Combat Axe</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong> Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>The Concussion is perfect for breaching rooms and stopping enemies from pushing you while you have a Sniper out. It also gives you the time you need to quickscope an enemy while they’re hunting you down, stunning them in their tracks. The Combat Axe is a classic and it should be on every Sniper loadout just for style points. It’s not the easiest to hit, but once you master the COmbat Axe, it can be very useful tool for close-range engagements.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Field Upgrade, whenever you’re set up in a nice spot on any of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a>, you’ll want to cover yourself to prevent any flanker from shooting you in the back, so the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> is a great pick.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> brings the iconic FPS franchise back to the forefront, offering players a brand new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-mission-list-every-campaign-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Campaign</a>, Multiplayer, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> mode to enjoy.</p>



<p>Treyarch has focused on bringing Call of Duty back to its roots, which has enticed both veteran and new players. With a traditional <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige system</a>, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/">arsenal of weapons</a> to unlock, and a variety of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps and modes</a> to enjoy, players have been flocking to Multiplayer. Those who love the round-based format of Zombies have been satisfied too, while story enjoyers are getting their fix through the Campaign.</p>



<p>That said, how many are actually paying Black Ops 6 and what does the player count look like? Here’s everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-players-are-in-black-ops-6">How many players are in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there are <strong>no official stats for the Black Ops 6 player count</strong>, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, there are <strong>143,030 current Steam OC players on Call of Duty </strong>as of October 28, 2024. </p>



<p>The 24 hour peak sits at <strong>306,460</strong> players, but keep in mind this is only the player count for Steam on PC, so if you take console into account too, the figure is likely much higher than this. Call of Duty is extremely popular on Xbox and PlayStation, and so those platforms likely make up a large portion of the player count which isn’t available to the public.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to SteamDB.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Call of Duty HQ app also includes players on COD games such as MW3, MW2, and Warzone. It even takes those playing the Campaign and Zombies into account, so it’s not an accurate number for those playing the Multiplayer.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is also the first Call of Duty title to release on the Game Pass for both PC and Xbox consoles. Because of this, there a likely a lot of PC players enjoying BO6 via the Game Pass, and the SteamDB numbers don’t track that platform. Thanks to the Game Pass release, successful beta period, and hype prior to release, we expect Black Ops 6’s number to be very healthy, pointing to a successful launch.</p>



<p>There also haven’t been many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-black-ops-6-servers-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">server issues</a> or major bugs, so players have been able to grind. Once we know official numbers we’l be sure to update this piece with all the information. However, Call of Duty haven’t released official player count stats for some time now, so it’s unclear whether we will get any insight.</p>
