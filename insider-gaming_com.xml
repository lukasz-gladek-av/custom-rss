            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-flea-market-locked-level-40/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-won%E2%80%99t-unlock-the-full-tarkov-flea-market-until-level-40.1354804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update is here, and fans worldwide are enjoying it – or those who can <strong>access the game are</strong>, anyway. It’s the dawn of a new era for the stellar extraction shooter, which has grown over the last decade to become a staple of the industry and a leader of the genre.</p>



<p>The 1.0 update brings stacks of changes, and one that players are struggling to contend with concerns the game’s <strong>Flea Market </strong>mechanic. It has been discovered that ‘categories’ of the Flea Market are locked until you progress to a fairly high level.</p>







<h2 id="h-flea-market-locked-down-again">Flea Market Locked Down Again</h2>



<p>The latest changes to Escape from Tarkov have been a mixed bag. On one hand, the new map, faction, weapons, and 1,000 bug fixes are welcome, but the shattered servers that are having issues hosting the hundreds of thousands of players trying to get into the game, we can do without.</p>



<p>One change that’s proving to be divisive is the alteration made to the game’s Flea Market, the peer-to-peer trading solution that allows users to buy and sell gear they find, craft, or steal.</p>



<p>With 1.0, players are now being forced to hit minimum level requirements to open up sections of the Flea Market, with certain categories remaining under lock for quite some time.&nbsp;The base Flea Market unlocks at Level 15 as always, but there are higher restrictions now in terms of levels.</p>



<p>Here’s what we’ve seen so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bolt-action rifles – Level 20</li>



<li>Assault rifles – Level 25</li>



<li>Marksman rifles – Level 25</li>



<li>Backpacks – Level 25</li>



<li>Foregrips – Level 20</li>



<li>Light and laser devices – Level 25</li>



<li>Muzzle devices – Level 20</li>
</ul>



<p>It gets a bit more extreme in some places:</p>



<ul>
<li>Barter items – Level 30</li>



<li>Gear components – Level 30</li>



<li>Injectors – Level 30</li>



<li>Keycards – Level 30</li>
</ul>



<p>And some high-tier ammo will remain locked for a very long time:</p>



<ul>
<li>PS12B – Level 40</li>



<li>M80 – Level 35</li>



<li>Blackout CJB – Level 40</li>
</ul>

<p>This is believed to be an effort to counter cheaters trying to participate in RMT (real-money trading), but it has rubbed some fans the wrong way.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zelda-movie-leaks-hint-at-first-major-actor-reveal.1354732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-footage-has-reportedly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked set footage</a> of The Legend of Zelda movie may show who is playing an iconic character in the franchise. Furthermore, it’s done by one of TV’s biggest stars from Severance.</p>







<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-movie-record-breaking/">The Super Mario Bros</a>. Movie in 2023 and the upcoming Super Mario Galaxy film, Nintendo is on quite a roll with films. Its blockbuster sales at the Box Office proved that bringing its IPs to theaters can work if done well. The company’s next project is a highly ambitious live-action adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Directed by The Maze Runner’s Wes Ball, the film is set to release on May 7th, 2027. The film has cast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link and Zelda</a>, but the rest of the cast has yet to be revealed. With filming underway, the process has been done and, with a new video leak, we may know who’s playing one of Zelda’s biggest supporters.</p>



<h2 id="h-severance-star-may-be-playing-impa-in-the-legend-of-zelda-leak-hints-nbsp">Severance Star May Be Playing Impa in The Legend of Zelda, Leak Hints&nbsp;</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCALkNk0Nl/?igsh=MW40OGJvOXRqamx0Zw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the leaked video on Instagram</a>, a figure can be seen lecturing Zelda and granting her a sword. As we only know Link and Zelda’s actors, seeing a new person on set does indicate more has been added. With them lecturing Zelda, one could assume the character is Impa, Zelda’s Sheikan guardian. Given that some versions of the character can range in age, it seems the film could be taking notes from the younger version shown in Ocarina of Time and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-release-date-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1oxjpdt/movie_there_is_leaked_footage_of_the_zelda_movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fans on Reddit were quick</a> to point out that the actress in the Legend of Zelda movie video leak looked strikingly familiar to Severance’s Dichen Lachman, who played counselor Ms. Casey in the popular Apple TV+ series. The actress has grown into a household name with Severance, as well as big roles in Neighbors, Jurassic World Dominion, and in the upcoming second season of Netflix’ The Last Airbender.&nbsp;Interestingly enough, the actress did star in Wes Ball’s last film, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.&nbsp;Regardless, no official confirmation has been made on the casting, so take it and the leak with a grain of salt. However, if the fans’ reactions are proof enough, the actress would be perfect as Impa.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/concord-has-effectively-been-shut-down-by-sony-for-a-second-time/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-has-effectively-been-shut-down-by-sony-for-a-second-time.1354705/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Concord has gone down in infamy as an all-time Sony and PlayStation blunder. It’s also understandable that the company wants to sweep the game’s existence under the rug, which is why Sony has presumably and swiftly issued DMCAs notices to gameplay videos of a fan-inspired Concord reboot, causing access to the game to be halted.</p>



<p>We don’t think much needs to be said about Concord at this point. The live-service shooter apparently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-cost-over-400-million-to-develop-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost over $400 million to develop</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team behind it was quickly shut down by Sony</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation took Concord offline within days of launch</a>.</p>



<p>Now, a community effort to resurrect the game has been met with strong action.</p>







<h2 id="h-sony-issues-dmcas-to-concord-pc-revival">Sony Issues DMCAs To Concord PC Revival</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Burn it down. Credit to Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>We reported on November 14 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-pc-fan-made-multiplayer-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord got a playable fan-made revival on PC</a>. Users cleverly managed to get custom Concord servers up and running—requiring special access to let you play.</p>



<p>What seemed like innocent fun has quickly turned into the gaze of Sony being cast upon them.</p>



<p>A dev post in the Concord Delta Discord updated everyone on a serious development:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>It transpires that gameplay videos of the Concord project had made their way to YouTube. DMCA action was immediately imposed by MarkScan—a name that works a lot on Sony’s behalf. If you add the facts up, it’s fairly obvious to see what’s happened.</p>



<p>As a result, the Concord PC project and servers are on hold, and unless something drastic changes, it probably means Sony is once again responsible for the death of Concord.</p>



<p>Is it better that we all move on from Concord at this point? Or is it a shame to see a handful of people who cared about the short-lived shooter have their hard work up in flmaes? The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is the perfect place to share your thoughts.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-season-1%E2%80%94release-period-all-new-maps-zombies-content-more.1354684/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 begins another 12-month content crusade. New maps, guns, game modes, Operators, events, and all the usual hullabaloo that comes with a new CoD season. We have the latest Black Ops 7 Season 1 release information, as well as the known S1 content.</p>



<p>You could argue that this hasn’t been the most hyped CoD in history—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam player numbers</a> would agree. Nevertheless, thousands of players have dived into Black Ops 7, meaning that Season 1 will have its fair share of recruits. If you want to know when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLOPS 7 Season 1</a> starts, read on for the crucial pointers.</p>







<p>Also, if you haven’t picked up the game yet, or you intend to, we have the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">cheapest way to buy Black Ops 7</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-expected-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-release-date">Expected Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Run for it. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We expect Black Ops 7 Season 1 to kick off on December 4, because it coincides with the end of Black Ops 6 Season 6—Signaling the transition from Black Ops 6’s seasonal content ending and Black Ops 7’s beginning.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been in the live-service loop before, you know the drill. Once a previous season ends, the next one begins. BLOPS 7 has a brief period between launch and Season 1 called the ‘preseason’.</p>







<p>We know for sure that the legendary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown map</a> is a big addition in the preseason period. Once we cross this barrier, it’s time to move on to Season 1. Treyarch is likely to confirm the Season 1 start date in the coming days, but don’t be surprised to see December 4 as the official start date!</p>



<h2 id="h-expected-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-start-time">Expected Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 Start Time</h2>



<p><strong>Again, based on existing data, Black Ops 7 Season 1 onlookers can expect the new season to begin around 9 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>This is a simple case of deduction using the end of the Black Ops 6 Season 6 Battle Pass. It’s what happens with all Call of Duty seasons, and we expect Season 1 to be no different.</p>



<p>If this isn’t the case, we’ll update this hub and let you know of any confirmed times, delays, or changes.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-season-1-multiplayer-amp-zombies-content">All Black Ops 7 Season 1 Multiplayer &amp; Zombies Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A lot to take in. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 1 introduces a whopping 7 multiplayer maps, 7 weapons, remastered content, new multiplayer modes, new LTMs, Holiday season content, and 3 new Zombies maps.</strong></p>



<p>Where do we begin? Let’s start with the Zombies content to mix it up.</p>

<p>The Season 1 roadmap has confirmed that <strong>Astra Malorum</strong> is a new round-based Zombies map—to add to Ashes of the Damned—and there will also be two additional Survival maps.</p>



<p>We’ve covered all of this and more in our complete <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Zombies hub</a>.</p>



<p>Zombies fans will be satiated with flesh and fun for the foreseeable future, at least. Knowing Treyarch, there is probably the odd surprise here and there you’ll need to uncover!</p>



<h3 id="h-new-black-ops-7-season-1-multiplayer-content">New Black Ops 7 Season 1 Multiplayer Content</h3>



<p>The main course for most is the multiplayer content. A lot of maps are currently locked in for Season 1, adding to the 18 multiplayer maps that launched with the base game.</p>



<p>Here’s every confirmed map for Season 1 already:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fate</li>



<li>Meltdown</li>



<li>Nuketown (Technically a preseason map)</li>



<li>Odysseus</li>



<li>Standoff (Remaster)</li>



<li>Utopia</li>



<li>Yakei</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, 7 “new &amp; fan-favorite weapons” are coming—including the <strong>Maddox</strong> from Black Ops 4—and we don’t quite know what the new game modes and extras entail.</p>



<p>Treyarch will reveal all when the time is right. Stay tuned for more updates on Season 1.</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that Treyarch is starting strong with Season 1. It’s being touted as the biggest season ever, and you can see why.

<p>Where Winds Meet has finally launched worldwide after a long period of only being available in China, and if you’re keen to restart your journey at any point, we’ve got the details on whether you can delete your character.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet launched globally on November 14, 2025, after months of being exclusively available within China, and there’s a staggering amount of content to dig through in the Wuxia open-world adventure.</p>



<p>Regular RPG players will be well accustomed to starting over with a new character, which often requires choosing to delete your progress, and there are some limitations in Where Winds Meet, as we’ve explained here.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-delete-your-character-in-where-winds-meet">Can You Delete Your Character in Where Winds Meet?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Limited options. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no option to delete your character in Where Winds Meet, unfortunately, so the process to start again is more lengthy.</strong></p>



<p>While you can customize your character freely at any time from the pause menu, though some customizations, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-change-hair-color/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changing hair color</a>, require specific items, you can’t choose to wipe clean and start again with a click of the button.</p>



<p>Instead, the only way to start over is to create a new account in the game, and the only way to delete a character, as a result, is by deleting your account.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-delete-your-account-in-where-winds-meet">How to Delete Your Account in Where Winds Meet</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to delete your account, and therefore your character, in Where Winds Meet, the process is fairly straightforward.</strong></p>



<p>However, it does require creating a new account in the game if you want to start your journey again, and you will lose everything you have earned. </p>







<p>Due to this, some in-game rewards may not be able to be claimed again, if they have already been revealed on your account. While you may be able to redeem them again with a new account, you may be stuck if the redemption is tied to your email address—unless you use an alternative.</p>



<p>Here’s the step-by-step process of how to delete your account in where Winds Meet.</p>



<ol>
<li>Open the game through the launcher.</li>



<li>In the log-in screen, select the profile icon on the left-hand side to open log-in credentials.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Account Deletion’ option.</li>



<li>On the webpage that pops up, click the checkbox to agree to the conditions stated, and click ‘Next.’</li>



<li>Click ‘Confirm’ on the pop-up that appears.</li>



<li>Fill in the steps to verify account ownership, and add your contact email.</li>



<li>Click ‘Yes’ on the next pop-up.</li>



<li>On the final page, check the box for the agreement, and hit ‘Submit’ to delete your account.</li>
</ol>
