<p><strong>“This actually made me Pre-Order [sic] Battlefield 6.” </strong>That sentiment is seemingly felt among a number of players as the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 gameplay reveal trailer is being hammered by the community, with many claiming they’re moving to EA’s Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two days after its reveal</a>, the Black Ops 7 trailer sits at just 42,000 likes despite having over 28 million views. That puts it at one of the lowest-liked reveal trailers in the franchise’s history. Moving to the dislikes shows even more bad news, at least on the surface. </p>



<p>Thanks to a browser extension, it shows that the Black Ops 7 gameplay trailer has 235,000 downvotes as of publishing. And it only seems to be growing in number.  For comparison purposes, the Black Ops 6 reveal trailer has just 5,452 dislikes after more than a year while the gameplay reveal is no longer available on the official Call of Duty YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Moving to the comments shows a drastically different story. Many of the top comments mention Battlefield 6, and how players are more excited or moving over to the game.</p>



<p>The previously mentioned comment about pre-ordering Battlefield 6 sits at 108,000 likes. Another comment  that says <strong>“From a COD player- thank you for making it easy to choose Bf6”</strong> has 41,000 likes.</p>

<p>After years and years of waiting, the release of Hollow Knight: Silksong is rapidly approaching, and it’s not too much longer until you can finally get your hands on the title. We’ve got all the details on the release date.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong thoroughly impressed us in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, and the positive reception immediately led to a desire from players for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-download-the-hollow-knight-silksong-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong demo</a> to be downloadable.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to add the Hollow Knight: Silksong release date to your calendar and potentially prepare to call in sick from work or school, we’ve got the precise details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-hollow-knight-silksong-coming-out">When is Hollow Knight: Silksong Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get ready. Image via Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>After years of waiting, Hollow Knight: Silksong finally has an official release date and will be available worldwide on September 4.</strong></p>



<p>First announced in February 2019, and even having a playable demo at E3 that year, it’s been a long six-year wait for fans waiting for the title. At times, you’d be forgiven for wondering if you’d be stuck waiting for the release until the end of time.</p>



<p>Team Cherry has delivered, though, with a release date much sooner than many may have expected, so it won’t be too much longer until the long wait comes to an end and you’re experiencing a historic moment in gaming history.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-hollow-knight-silksong-s-start-times">Do we Know Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s too early to provide an exact start time for Hollow Knight: Silksong and when exactly it will be playable, but we might be able to hazard a guess.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/hollow-knight-silksong" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is confirmed to be a day-one launch on Xbox Game Pass, which has a fairly set schedule for releases and the majority of titles become playable at 7am PT/9am CT/10am ET/3pm BST/12am AEST.</p>



<p>That’s only an estimate, however, but bookmark this page as we’ll update the article as soon as we have an accurate start time. For now, the release date is the most important piece of information, and after years of waiting for that to be revealed, I’m sure you can cope a little while longer for start times.</p>

<p>The long-awaited release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong has finally been announced as part of Gamescom 2025.</p>

<p>The end date for that wait has finally been revealed, however, with a short special announcement trailer from Team Cherry.</p>
