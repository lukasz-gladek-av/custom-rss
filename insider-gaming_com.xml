<p>A new leak has revealed that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach will have a collectors edition costing $229.99.</p>



<p>That’s according to reliable dataminer <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, who reports that the game is gearing up for an announcement later today.</p>



<p>It’s theorised that the announcement could come during Kojima’s appearance at SXSW 2025, where Kojima Productions is set to host a panel. </p>



<p>If the pre-orders are not announced during the panel, then it’s almost certain that an announcement will be made later this month, as billbil-kun obtains his datamined information from the backend of websites and stores, meaning that the information has recently been uploaded to the backend and thus, ready for an announcement.</p>



<p>According to the leak, the game will have two different physical editions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Edition : 79.99 euros / 69.99 US dollars / 69.99 pounds sterling</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Collector’s&nbsp;Edition : $229.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>As pointed out in the leak, the contents of the editions are currently unclear, but at a hefty $229.99 price tag for the collectors edition, it’s likely to contain some kind of statue. The original Death Stranding collectors edition featured a Baby BB Pod Replica.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2 was officially revealed at the Game Awards in 2022 and is set to launch on the PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

<p>In Fallout 76, one of the peskiest things you’ll need to do is complete daily and weekly challenges. They might be to kill three Snallygasters or drink five Nuka Cola Cranberry beverages. It might be as trivial as picking up a handful of scrap items or something as challenging as laying waste to a horde of Deathclaws.</p>



<p>In this ultimate guide to Fallout 76 challenge locations, I’ll help you find everything you need to complete these challenges. As the challenges expand over time, so too will this guide, so be sure to bookmark it to keep coming back for more.</p>



<p>In no particular order, let’s start cracking through where to find these deliverables for Fallout 76 daily challenges.</p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-find-snallygasters-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Snallygasters in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>If you’re tasked with killing Snallygasters in Fallout 76 for a daily challenge, you’ll want to head to the nastier areas of the map, typically where you’ll find swamps, toxic pools, and other environmental hazards.</p>



<p>The best place to find a Snallygaster in Fallout 76 (or three) is the Flooded Trainyard.</p>



<p>If you head to the Flooded Trainyard in Fallout 76, you’ll be greeted by as many as half a dozen Snallygasters, ripe for the taking.</p>



<p>But where is the Flooded Trainyard?</p>



<p>Well, you’ll need to head out to the Cranberry Bog to find it:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The next best Snallygaster location in Fallout 76 is near Hemlock Holes in the Toxic Valley at the top of the map.  If you head south from Hemlock Holes, you’ll find Snallygasters and even a Grafton Monster.</p>



<p>Hemlock Holes can be found here:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-gulpers-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Gulpers in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It can be quite tough to track down a decent Gulper location in Fallout 76, but it’s not impossible. If you want to find Gulpers for a Fallout 76 daily challenge, you’ll need to head into The Mire and track through the dark and dingy forest.</p>



<p>The best place to find Gulpers in Fallout 76 is at the Gulper Lagoon – the clue is in the name, you see.</p>



<p>Here’s the top spot for Gulpers for daily challenges:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Alternatively, you could wait around for Moonshine Jamboree to pop. That event is positively bursting with Gulpers, so you’ll complete this daily challenge to kill Gulpers in no time at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-teapots-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Teapots in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It might seem bizarre, but Fallout 76’s daily challenge structure can include a request to find teapots for no reason whatsoever. It’s one of the trickier daily challenges as it requires you to find something small in a <strong>very </strong>large map, and ground loot can often seem randomised.</p>



<p>Fear not – it’s not all that difficult to find a teapot in Fallout 76, and if you need multiple, you can try server hopping to see if more teapots pop up.</p>



<p>To secure the best teapot locations in Fallout 76, you’ll want to check out the Palace of the Winding Path. At this location, you’ll find more than a dozen teapots scattered around.</p>



<p>This is where you’ll find teapots in Fallout 76 with ease:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find teapots at the Palace of the Winding Path, you can try elsewhere. The next best location for teapots in Fallout 76 is Helvetia, the small town near Vault 76. Here, you’ll find half a dozen (or more) teapots lurking around:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-mirelurk-eggs-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Mirelurk Eggs in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Forget the Mirelurks themselves, some Fallout 76 daily challenges want you to find <strong>Mirelurk Eggs</strong>. As you can imagine, you’ll almost always find the two together, so it could be a case of killing two birds with one stone.</p>



<p>It’s easy to find the best Fallout 76 Mirelurk Egg locations, though.</p>



<p>If you head to Quarry X3 in the Cranberry Bog, you’ll find dozens of Mirelurk Eggs. Be warned, though – you’ll have to tussle with Mirelurks and even a Mirelurk Queen if you’re unlucky:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The next best location for Mirelurk Eggs in Fallout 76 is around the Ohio River Adventures site. If you explore the riverbanks around this location, you’ll find Mirelurk Eggs everywhere:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-rabbits-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Rabbits in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It’s tough to find Rabbits in Fallout 76 because they’re so small and they blend in well with the environment, but with a keen eye (and perhaps VATS), you’ll be able to find a few for your daily challenges.</p>



<p>The best location for Rabbits in Fallout 76 is near the Whitespring Bunker. Here, you’ll need to explore the area, but you should manage to find Rabbits easily and tick off some Fallout 76 daily challenges:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find any Rabbits near the Whitespring Bunker, you can try checking the Twin Lakes location in the Savage Divide. This is the next best location for Rabbits in Fallout 76:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-a-bobblehead-in-fallout-76">Where to Find a Bobblehead in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Every Fallout fan knows about the Vault-Tec Bobbleheads. They’re everywhere throughout the series, and they come with some seriously helpful character upgrades.</p>



<p>In Fallout 76, Bobbleheads tend to spawn in static locations, which means they’ll always be there whenever you jump onto a new server – unless someone has grabbed one first.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best Bobblehead locations in Fallout 76:</p>



<p><strong>On top of the mansion at Clancy Manor:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>In Camden Park, near the Minor Miner Zone Sign or on top of the Widowmaker rollercoaster</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>In Morgantown Airport, sitting in a quarantine tent and in the laboratory hanger near the airstrip</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>There are hundreds of Bobblehead locations in Fallout 76, but these are some of the most reliable. Let me know in the comments where you go to find Bobbleheads in Fallout 76.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-magazines-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Magazines in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Like Bobbleheads, Magazine locations in Fallout 76 are static, and you’ll find consistent spawns everywhere. Unfortunately, Fallout 76 Magazines are also in high demand all the time, so you’ll need to have luck on your side <strong>or </strong>have access to a private server to find one.</p>



<p>There are some top Magazine locations in Fallout 76 that you can try checking before you’ve even walked too far from Vault 76, which is nice.</p>



<p><strong>Check the south cabin and the treehouse in the Alpine River Cabins:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Check the main reception counter, the kitchens, and the bunk beds in Bolton Greens:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Check the airplane seats, the kitchen platform, and the cockpit of the plane at Horizon’s Rest:</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>All of these locations yield multiple Magazines in Fallout 76, so you should be able to find at least one or two to resolve these daily challenges.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-wood-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Wood in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>It’s a relatively mundane thing to track down, but many daily challenges in Fallout 76 revolve around finding building materials. In this challenge, you’ll be tasked with finding Wood locations in Fallout 76. It might seem easy, but it’s not – you can’t just go cutting down trees, after all.</p>



<p>The best location to find Wood in Fallout 76 is at the Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp. This location can be found in the Savage Divide close to the Sons of Dane Compound, and it’s bursting with Wood for daily challenges in Fallout 76:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-soap-in-fallout-76">Where to Find Soap in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Finding Soap in Fallout 76 is important, as keeping clean in the harsh, post-apocalyptic wasteland is something all explorers should be doing. Perhaps not, but that doesn’t stop the Fallout 76 daily challenges circuit from tasking you with finding stacks of Soap in the game.</p>



<p>It’s a little tougher to find Soap as it’s not guaranteed to spawn in many places. However, I’ve tracked down the best locations for Soap in Fallout 76, so you don’t have to.</p>



<p>The easiest location for Soap in Fallout 76 is at the Whitespring Resort. Here, you can access the Whitespring Mall, and from there, you’ll track down the Whitespring Spa. In the Spa, you’ll find up to <strong>seven </strong>Soap at one time:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you can’t find any at the Whitespring Resort, you can find Soap in Fallout 76 by heading to Darling Sister’s Lab – just don’t ask me what they were doing with this much soap:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here, you’ll find <strong>seven </strong>Soap just sitting in a wheelbarrow.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-montage-lets-slip-that-two-fan-favourite-rifles-could-be-coming-back.1129299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-return-amax-kilo-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, Activision took to social media to promote International Women’s Day with a Call of Duty trailer focused on female characters. The punchy montage showcased some of the most popular female streamers and in-game operators, but it also let slip a few key details about the future of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>In a couple of sequences in the montage, we see current operators running around with AMAX and Kilo assault rifles. These instantly recognisable weapons were firm favourites when Verdansk was rolling around in Warzone between 2020 and 2021, and it looks like they’re coming back.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-hit-the-nostalgia">Hit the Nostalgia</h2>



<p>It was mentioned recently that if Verdansk’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-warzone-3-if-verdansk-does-not-retain-players/">return to Warzone is a flop</a>, Warzone itself could be on the rocks and scheduled for closure. At the very least, Activision will scale back resources and prepare to keep Warzone afloat with a skeleton crew, as the downfall of the battle royale has been unravelling over the last couple of years.</p>



<p>When season three arrives in Call of Duty next month, following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/">a sizeable delay</a>, it should bring with it the original Verdansk map from 2020. That’s not all, though – according to the recent Call of Duty montage released by Activision, we’re also set to get some OG weapons back, too.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>BREAKING: The Kilo 141 and AMAX are officially returning to Warzone with Season 03! </p><p>Confirmed by todays IWD trailer posted by Call of Duty! <a href="https://t.co/RWxBbxw8zv">pic.twitter.com/RWxBbxw8zv</a></p></div>— Task Force News (@TaskForceNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaskForceNews/status/1898397599930986953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>I’m holding out hope that the Grau makes a return, but I’ll settle for the AMAX and Kilo. There are so many ‘meta’ weapons that Activision’s teams could bring back to Warzone, but I <strong>really hope </strong>the DMR and Mac-10 combination is kept well away from this iteration of the battle royale game.</p>



<p>It’s not confirmed, but featuring the weapons front and center in a trailer this close to the launch of season three is pretty telling. If the original timeline were being adhered to, we’d be just ten days away from the launch of the game’s third season. Instead, we’ll need to wait until April 3rd.</p>



<p>What weapons do you want to see returning to Warzone this year? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-too-easy-making-tougher/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-is-%E2%80%98too-easy%E2%80%99-and-blizzard-is-preparing-to-make-it-tougher.1129290/</guid>

<p>During a recent campfire stream, Blizzard’s developers working on Diablo 4 reflected on the most recent season, suggesting that things didn’t pan out as expected. They confirmed that the game has become far too easy and revealed that players are levelling up in ‘half the time’ compared to previous seasons, even on harder difficulty levels.</p>



<p>As someone new to Diablo, I can attest to that. I’m usually awful at challenging games, but even after cranking it up a few levels, I’m having no issues whatsoever with Diablo 4.</p>



<p>That’s set to change, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-hell">Prepare for Hell</h2>



<p>When the next season rolls around in Diablo 4, players will find themselves levelling up slower and facing a tougher grind compared to the current season, which is focused on the Vessel of Hatred expansion.</p>



<p>In the recent campfire stream, Blizzard’s Colin Finer revealed that players are ‘chewing through some of the content’ much too quickly, hitting level 60 and securing their Paragon classification far too rapidly and with too few struggles.</p>



<p>In season 8, players will find that they’re levelling slower through the first 25 levels of a new character and that rarer loot – such as Legendary items – will be much harder to find.</p>



<p>Here’s the full campfire chat with Blizzard:</p>

<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/536470/diablo-4-blizzard-too-easy-season-8-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The team revealed that ‘too many’ players have found their way into the highest difficulty level of the game in record time, which represents a kind of imbalance in the player base.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just from a philosophy standpoint, we really want whatever the hardest Torment tier is — in this case Torment 4 — to be aspirational, and to us that means around 10% (of players).</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Presently, around 50% of the players in the Vessel of Hatred season have made it to the highest difficulty level. To battle back against that issue, Blizzard will be adding new, more challenging boss characters in the new season, and existing bosses will have their abilities cranked to the max.</p>



<p>It’ll be a while before all that arrives, though. The next season of Diablo 4 isn’t expected to drop until April 29.</p>

<p>In the latest trailer for the second season of The Last of Us, we’re given a brief glimpse at the expansion of the story established in the 2020 game. It has been known for a while that the sheer amount of meat on the bones has given way to the second game having a two-series split in terms of the live-action adaptation, but that hasn’t stopped the showrunners from creating fresh storylines.</p>



<p>In particular, we’re given an extended look at the attack on Jackson—Ellie and Joel’s home haven in the game—by vast swathes of infected. This sequence isn’t replicated in the game, but some of the perspectives are reminiscent of No Return, the additional mode added with the release of The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-content-galore">Content Galore</h2>



<p>The Last of Us Part II has plenty of inspiration to draw from when it comes to creating extra content for the live-action adaptation. In 2023, with the launch of the first season, viewers were treated to an entire episode that explored the backstory of Bill and Frank – and that sequence alone won the show an Emmy Award.</p>



<p>In the latest trailer, we get the idea that Craig Mazin, Neil Druckmann, and everyone else involved is following a similar pattern in the second (and assumedly the third) season of the HBO show.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Last of Us Season 2 | Official Trailer | Max" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Once again, the cinematics smack of the most faithful recreation possible, and we can now see that a fair amount of flashback content will be included in season two. For instance, we’ll be heading back to the prequel scenes that see Ellie and Joel explore a museum on Ellie’s birthday, ultimately discovering a building packed with dinosaurs, spacecraft, and <strong>danger</strong>.</p>



<p>We also get an extended look at the Seraphites, but it doesn’t look like Lev and Yara are being revealed just yet. We do see some other sequences that suggest the Seraphites and their background will be explored further in the show, which would help to set up a little more lore for those uninitiated in the story thus far.</p>



<p>The WLF is front and centre, too – as is Abby’s band of antiheroes heading to Jackson for no particular reason whatsoever.</p>



<p>The Last of Us season two drops on April 13 in full – are you going to binge watch this one? Let me know in the comments or over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
