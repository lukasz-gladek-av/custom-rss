<p>Starting today, Xbox Insiders who have enrolled in the PC Gaming Preview will find Gaming Copilot (beta) in the Game Bar for Windows PCs. </p>



<p>Gaming Copilot is a feature that helps players reach gameplay faster, sharpens their skills, and guides them through obstacles. The early beta version was previously available through the Xbox Mobile app, enabling players to access Copilot on a second screen. Now, select players have received an even more integrated experience. </p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The Gaming Copilot beta will track the player’s Xbox activity “to provide an experience centred around you”. Players can ask for help with the game they are playing, or with games they are interested in or want to discover. Additionally, you can also ask questions about your account, play history and achievements. </p>



<p>The Gaming Copilot widgets can be pinned to the screen and used through Voice mode. This mode allows players to use the feature while actively playing the game. Players can ask for tips or any other help without stopping the gameplay. All they need to do is select the ‘Microphone’ option in the Gaming Copilot widget, and the conversation can be continued seamlessly whenever the player is stuck. </p>



<p>Moreover, when the Xbox Insider asks Gaming Copilot for help during voice mode, it will take screenshots of the player’s gameplay to provide more helpful responses. This allows players to refer to events in the game as they occur, without needing a detailed description. </p>



<p>The Gaming Copilot (beta) is also available on Windows Handhelds for Xbox Insiders, albeit with limited functionality. The early preview is currently available only to Insiders in select regions. You can check out the complete list <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/06/gaming-copilot-beta-begins-rolling-out-to-xbox-insiders-on-game-bar-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>

<p>Bethesda is reportedly working on bringing Creations to Fallout 4 to introduce paid mods for the game. </p>



<p>Fallout 4 is yet to receive a proper update since the next-gen upgrade for the title. The developers have released a bug-fixing patch since then, but no major updates have been revealed. As Fallout 5 doesn’t seem to be releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-bethesda-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anytime soon</a>, players are expecting more content out of Fallout 4, especially after the Amazon Prime series. It seems developers might be fulfilling this wish with a paid mod system that exists for several other Bethesda games. </p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-4-paid-mods-could-arrive-before-season-2">Fallout 4 Paid Mods Could Arrive Before Season 2</h2>



<p>The claim about Fallout 4 paid mods comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-AwL2IrXLw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JuiceHead</a> on YouTube, who has confirmed these details from multiple sources. JuiceHead has also accurately claimed in the past that Skyrim would receive a new paid mods system, and Creations was released soon after. Moreover, the recent changelog updates on SteamDB suggest that Bethesda is working on something for Fallout 4. The YouTuber also shared that Fallout 4’s press build has undergone some changes as well. </p>



<p>The fact that Fallout 4’s press build is receiving changes hints that Bethesda is testing out new features by giving select users access through the Steam beta. The core aspect of the upcoming update is bringing Creations to Fallout 4, the same system available in Skyrim and Starfield for paid mods. It is speculated that this new system will enable players to view both paid and free mods, and also allow authors to create new paid content for the game. </p>



<p>The Fallout Amazon Prime series has been influential in bringing audiences back to the Fallout games, with Fallout 4 experiencing the most significant growth. As Bethesda has now observed that their games could benefit from other media, they might plan to release the Creations update after or alongside Season 2 of the series, which is scheduled to arrive in December 2025. However, as all of this information doesn’t come from an official source, players should take it with a grain of salt. </p>
