<p>After years and years of waiting, the release of Hollow Knight: Silksong is rapidly approaching, and it’s not too much longer until you can finally get your hands on the title. We’ve got all the details on the release date.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong thoroughly impressed us in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, and the positive reception immediately led to a desire from players for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-download-the-hollow-knight-silksong-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong demo</a> to be downloadable.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to add the Hollow Knight: Silksong release date to your calendar and potentially prepare to call in sick from work or school, we’ve got the precise details you need.</p>

<p><strong>After years of waiting, Hollow Knight: Silksong finally has an official release date and will be available worldwide on September 4.</strong></p>



<p>First announced in February 2019, and even having a playable demo at E3 that year, it’s been a long six-year wait for fans waiting for the title. At times, you’d be forgiven for wondering if you’d be stuck waiting for the release until the end of time.</p>



<p>Team Cherry has delivered, though, with a release date much sooner than many may have expected, so it won’t be too much longer until the long wait comes to an end and you’re experiencing a historic moment in gaming history.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-hollow-knight-silksong-s-start-times">Do we Know Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s too early to provide an exact start time for Hollow Knight: Silksong and when exactly it will be playable, but we might be able to hazard a guess.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/hollow-knight-silksong" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is confirmed to be a day-one launch on Xbox Game Pass, which has a fairly set schedule for releases and the majority of titles become playable at 7am PT/9am CT/10am ET/3pm BST/12am AEST.</p>



<p>That’s only an estimate, however, but bookmark this page as we’ll update the article as soon as we have an accurate start time. For now, the release date is the most important piece of information, and after years of waiting for that to be revealed, I’m sure you can cope a little while longer for start times.</p>

<p>Elden Ring is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, and it reportedly struggles to run on the latest Nintendo console?</p>



<p>According to Nintendo Life’s Felix Sanchez, who spent time with the game while in Cologne for Gamescom the game has serious performance issues on the Switch 2 when playing in handheld mode.</p>



<p><strong>“Performance wise, here at that big first fight, as soon as you step outside, the framerate drops quite substantially,”</strong> Sanchez said while mentioning that it’s always locked at 30 frames per second</p>



<p>He then continued: <strong>“You get to the outside world, and the framerate just tanks. It’s really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this.</strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-gamescom-future-games-show-at-gamescom-2025-everything-announced">More Gamescom: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-games-show-gamescom-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Future Games Show at Gamescom 2025: Everything Announced</a></h6>



<p><strong>“It is terrible. Of course, you’re never going to see the light of this because—well, maybe it’ll release in that state, but I can’t imagine it will.”</strong></p>



<p>Sanchez said it felt like 20 frames per second and, sometimes, as low as 15. It would happen, he said, doing the “most simple stuff”.</p>



<p>As far as the positives, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sanchez did say that</a> while it doesn’t look as good as PC or PlayStation—as should be expected—it did look “really good”. He also said the tutorial area of the game performed properly.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition is scheduled to release on Nintendo Switch 2 later this year. A firm release date, however, has yet to be announced. </p>
