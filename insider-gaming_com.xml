<p>Use these Roblox Build To Climb monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Stumps, Pets and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Planting the tallest Stumps to reach the top and potentially to the next map is the primary goal of Build to Climb. Purchasing different Stumps will deplete your treasury and will take some time to earn all the money back. Plus, you will need the help of Pets to boost your Cash income. This is when you should use the active Build to Climb codes. Claim free Stumps and Pets using these codes. You’ll easily reach 9.6km and progress further within a few hours after redeeming the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-sorcerer-battlegrounds-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game codes.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-active-build-to-climb-codes-nbsp">Active Build To Climb Codes&nbsp;</h2>

<p>There are no expired codes in Build to Climb. If any active code goes inactive, it’ll be added here. Redeem all the active codes in a single sitting as they risk going inactive at any moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stumps are very important and contribute heavily to the Build to Climb gameplay. Players can easily increase the overall height of their giant stalks by using the free Stumps obtained from codes. The core principle of Build to Climb is that the more distance you cover, the more Cash you earn. You can easily earn thousands of Cash and invest it into new Stumps, however, note that certain Stumps must be unlocked by reaching specific height milestones.</p>



<ul>
<li>Blue Stump – 1km – 10,000$</li>



<li>Chocolate Stump – 2.8km – 40,000$</li>



<li>Purple Stump – 3.9km – 130,000$</li>



<li>Lemon Stump – 6.8km – 800,000$</li>
</ul>



<p>With that sorted, try purchasing Eggs to obtain Pets that provide Cash multipliers. The Cat, which is redeemed from an active code, is part of Egg 1. Below are all the Eggs, their Pets, and their hatch chances:</p>

<p>Hyung-tae Kim, the CEO of Shift Up and the director behind Stellar Blade, has received a Presidential Commendation in South Korea. This prestigious awardwas presented by the South Korean President himself, and it was given for Kim’s services to the domestic game industry. </p>



<p>While Stellar Blade was mentioned, the award was also given amidst recognition of Shift Up’s other games, like Goddess of Victory: NIKKE.</p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-was-a-game-changing-title">Stellar Blade Was a Game-Changing Title</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade first dropped in April 2024, before being released on PC a little more than a year later. The game would go on to sell millions of copies, with players being pulled in by the visuals and staying for the combat and intriguing story.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that much of the attraction in Stellar Blade rests with the game’s protagonist, Eve. Her character model was built around a scanned representation of a South Korean glamour model, which gives you an idea of why the character was such a hit with gamers.</p>



<p>As revealed by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-hyung-tae-kim-receives-award-from-president-of-south-korea-for-contributions-to-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, Hyung-tae Kim, the visionary director behind Shift Up’s Stellar Blade, recently received an award from the South Korean President, Lee Jae Myung. This commendation was bestowed upon Kim because of his contributions to the industry and ‘achievements in overseas expansion’.</p>



<p>In the report, it was stressed that Kim ‘humbly thanked his development teams and Shift Up’ for their pivotal work on bringing Stellar Blade to life.</p>



<p>In September, it was confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/">a Stellar Blade sequel</a> was in development and moving along quite nicely. In November, reports were circulated suggesting that Shift Up was targeting more platforms for further Steller Blade expansion, eyeing up the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/">Xbox and Nintendo</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Red Bull has created the world’s largest game of Tetris powered by 2000 drones as a part of the Red Bull Tetris World final.</p>



<p>The special event saw Red Bull use the iconic 150-metre high Dubai Frame, which opened in 2018, as the border for the Tetris game, which Red Bull says made the game the “world’s first open-air, live playable Tetris game”.</p>







<p>A grand total of 2800 drones were used for the game, with each player needing 1400 drones per game due to the drones’ battery life.</p>



<p>Fehmi Atalar of Türkiye went home as the champion of the game, achieving a score of 168,566 during the five-minute game. Leo Solórzano of Peru managed a score of 57,164.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/red-bull-tetris-world-final-recap-and-winner-fehmi-atalar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Red Bull</a> described the event as “phone to drone, with Qualifiers featuring participants in 60 countries playing directly on their mobile devices. </p>



<p>“This event was one of a kind. It’s not a thing you can describe in words,” said Red Bull Tetris World final winner Fehmi Atalar.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“Over [my] five years of Tetris experience, this was the best moment, and this event was one of a kind. It’s not a thing you can describe in words,” Atalar concluded. “I managed to play like a machine, and although I could have done things a bit cleaner, I achieved a flawless run and did not miss a single point in any of my matches, so I am very happy.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-isnt-a-ps5-exclusive-forever-could-come-to-xbox/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>S-GAME is looking to deliver its A-game with Phantom Blade Zero. The hack ‘n’ slasher looks slick and quick, and will be the action game to watch out for in 2026. PS5 gamers are eyeing it up, but it might not stay this way forever.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-release-date-trailer-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Blade Zero release date</a> was finally revealed at The Game Awards 2025. It’s going to add to an incredibly stacked year of gaming, and the pre-release hype is already big. Early marketing has made it clear it will launch on PS5—and PC—and not Xbox. Yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-phantom-blade-zero-could-release-on-xbox">Phantom Blade Zero Could Release On Xbox</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’s always an asterisk. Credit to S-GAME</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s amazing how often little details are picked up on by players days after a new trailer or announcement. The Game Awards 2025 is well behind us, but only now is it apparent that Phantom Blade Zero’s Release Date trailer had new information in plain sight.</p>







<p>At the very end of the four-minute trailer, a big blue screen pops up with an interesting message: “PlayStation 5 Console Exclusive.”</p>



<p>This was already known. However, as you should with all contracts, if you read the fine print, there’s more than meets the eye:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Also available on PC. Not available on other consoles until at least 12 months after the release date.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Simply, this means Phantom Blade Zero is a timed exclusive. Like Silent Hill 2 or Square Enix’s Final Fantasy Remake games, it will launch on PS5 first (on consoles), and then we could easily see an Xbox port later down the line.</p>



<p>More than likely, this is what will happen. The console wars are over, and it seems to be about maximizing profits for Sony and Microsoft. It will get to the point where pretty much every game is on every other console—apart from Nintendo, don’t expect Mario on PS5 anytime soon!</p>



<p>Here’s the full Phantom Blade Zero trailer from TGA 2025.</p>

<p>Will Phantom Blade Zero be a day-one buy on PS5 or PC? Or does this revelation give you enough hope to hang on for a possible Xbox port later down the road?

<p>Winter Wildcards has been expected to make its return to EA FC 26 for weeks, but new leaks now suggest the festive promo is officially next in line. Set to begin on Friday, December 19 at the usual 6 PM UK time, this year’s edition is shaping up to be the biggest Winter Wildcards event the series has ever seen.</p>



<p>And for once, it’s not just the player list doing the rounds. The leaks for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 26</a> have been unusually broad, hinting at everything from significant new card upgrades to multiple versions of the same players with differing positions and stat tweaks. With so much information surfacing early, anticipation for this year’s Winter Wildcards is building fast—if the leaks hold true, you’re in for a truly wild festive promo.</p>

<p>According to reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/FutSheriff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FUT Sheriff on X</a>, a flood of new details has emerged about the upcoming Winter Wildcards promo in EA FC 26—and there’s plenty to get excited about. The standout reveal is the suggestion that three full promo teams are on the way. With EA recently sticking to rapid-fire, one-week promos, a longer, more substantial festive event would be a welcome change and give players something meatier to dig into over the holiday period.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨WINTER WILDCARDS INFORMATION 🎄🎅🥶</p><p>• ✅ 3x Promo Teams<br>• 👶 Baby &amp; Prime Icons<br>• ⚡️ ONLY 1 PS+ <br>• 🔥 DAILY PLAYER SBC’S 💣 <br>• 👀 Some normal players also have 2x versions <br>• 👑 Best Of in packs<br>• ➕ More 👀💣🔜</p><p>Thoughts on Power Curve?

<p>But that’s far from the only headline. Another major leak claims that a select group of Winter Wildcards cards will become the first items in EA FC 26 to receive <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/winter-wildcards-breaks-ea-fc-26-trend-with-game-changing-playstyle-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two PlayStyles+</a>, marking a significant shift in the game’s power structure. It appears EA is experimenting with gradually introducing higher-tier cards without abruptly breaking their slower power-curve philosophy—and double PlayStyles+ could be their first step in that direction.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for player names, the leaks are coming thick and fast. Icons like Zidane, Ibrahimović, and Ronaldinho have already been mentioned, and more are expected as we get closer to launch.
