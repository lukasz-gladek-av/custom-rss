<p>The memory shortage is hitting the GPU market. A new report suggest Nvidia is preparing to cut down on production of its GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>According to Chinese outlet <a href="http://www.boardchannels.com.cn/thread-130069-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BoBantang</a> via <a href="https://benchlife.info/nvidia-will-adjust-geforce-rtx-50-suppy-due-gddr7-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Benchlife</a>, Nvidia is looking to reduce supply of the latest series of cards by as much as 30-40% compared to the first half of 2025. The report adds that this is being done due to the memory shortage for GDDR6 and GDDR7 RAM. Across the industry, this shortage has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumer prices skyrocket</a> as AI companies buy up all of the available supply.</p>







<p>In addition to the original report, Benchlife adds that various AIC partners and suppliers have told the outlet that the first cards to likely be cut back are the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5060Ti 16GB.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Nvidia hasn’t confirmed or denied the report. Insider Gaming has made attempts to contact Nvidia for an official statement on the matter, but, so far, all requests have gone unanswered. Should one come, it will be added to this story. </p>
