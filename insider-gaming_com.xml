<p>The sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix is going to get messier before it gets settled. On Monday, it was announced that Paramount had submitted what is being classified as a “hostile” proposal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. </p>



<p>Their offer would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be for $30 per share</a>, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 per share for just the Warner Bros. side of the company.</p>







<p><strong>“WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,”</strong> Paramount CEO David Ellison said.<strong> “Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion.”</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Confirms-Receipt-of-Paramount-Skydance-Unsolicited-Tender-Offer/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message to investors</a> on Monday afternoon, Warner Bros. Discovery confirmed that it had received the public proposal from Paramount. The company called the offer <strong>“unsolicited”</strong>, but will <strong>“carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix”</strong>.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery made it clear, however, that the Board of Directors will not be “modifying its recommendation” of the Netflix acquisition with respect to the prior agreement. The company plans to inform stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount’s offer with 10 business days. </p>



<p>If counting today, that would mean an update should come by no later than Friday, December 19. With offers being considered and a fight underway, the future of Warner Bros. Games—both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its studios and projects</a>—continues to hang in the balance.</p>



<p>What do you think ultimately happens with the Warner Bros. sale, and will it go to Netflix or Paramount?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The future of the Tomb Raider series is being unveiled at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Game Awards</a>. While no specifics were given, it seems fans will finally know what’s next for Lara Croft during the event.</p>



<p>Released in 1996, the Tomb Raider series has become an icon in the gaming world. The intuitive gameplay, sweeping stories, and, of course, the protagonist Lara Croft, have entertained fans for almost 30 years. The last main entry in the series, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, released in 2018, with re-releases following suit. Developer Crystal Dynamics and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-publishing-next-tomb-raider-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new partner Amazon</a> have been working on a new entry for some time. Now, December 11th is the date players will finally know where Lara Croft is off to next.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-future-of-tomb-raider-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2025">The ‘Future of Tomb Raider’ to be Shown at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, it was announced that Tomb Raider would make an appearance at the show. Specifically, the ‘future of gaming’s most iconic franchises’ will be shown on December 11th <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the show</a>. Apparently, the news was teased in Fortnite, where fans can vote for their favorite nominees for the show.</p>



<p>It has been quite some time since fans reunited with Lara Croft, as 2018 marked the last new entry. However, teasers of Lara’s new look came out in celebration a few years back, though it’s unknown if it’s changed since. It’s also unclear whether it’s a continuation of the new reboot trilogy or of the originals. Given Lara’s look in the silouette, it does look reminiscent of her days in the original titles, though likely with a modern twist. Either way, a new Tomb Raider is finally on its way, and fans won’t have to wait long to find out how.</p>







<p>What do you think the future of Tomb Raider will look like? Excited to see it at The Game Awards? Do you think it’ll be like the reboots? Originals?
