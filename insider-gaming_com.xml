<p>Path of Exile 2 developers, Grinding Gear Games, have revealed that their early access launch has been delayed for three weeks, with the new date set as December 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Path of Exile 2’s Game Director, Jonathan Rogers, revealed through a statement on <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1851096646140166559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that the game’s early access will have to be delayed. Rogers explained that they are not behind on “the game itself” but on “some service-side infrastructure work” that is taking much longer than intended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogers elaborated that keeping up with one of Path of Exile 2’s key promises is one of the major reasons for the delay. The team promised that all microtransactions would work across both titles, Path of Exile 1 and 2. However, to accomplish this feat, the developers have had to integrate the account systems for both games and console ports; they have changed the backend code and are conducting a bunch of load testing, which is time-consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roger believes the game will still be complete by the launch date, but not without mistakes, and the developers don’t want these errors to happen. Hence, Path of Exile 2’s early access has been delayed by three weeks. Moreover, details about all the content players can expect during POE 2’s early access will be revealed through a live stream “in about four weeks.” This will be the biggest announcement Grinding Gears Games have ever made.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sony is shutting down Firewalk Studios. The news was first broken by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, and Insider Gaming was quickly able to corroborate with sources. </p>



<p>Sony made the announcement public shortly after the news broke in a message on its <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>.</p>



<p>“We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities,” PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst said. “As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE’s Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studios – Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hulst says that over the last few months the team at PlayStation explored “all [their] options” regarding the game. Despite those efforts, however, the decision was made to close the studio and sunset the game for good.</p>



<p>“After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio,” he said.  ” I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued: “I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE.&nbsp; Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization.”</p>



<p>Concord launched in late August to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concords-launch-is-worse-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than 1,000 players</a> on Steam and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly 25,000 copies sold</a>. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/">game was shut down</a> two weeks later with talk of a potential return as a possible free-to-play shooter.</p>



<p>Ultimately, that didn’t happen and Sony has moved on. There was no mention by Sony if all employees will be let go or move to other areas within the company.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for clarification on employment status for those at Firewalk Studios and Neon Koi.&nbsp;There have been nearly 14,000 known jobs lost to layoffs in 2024 within the games industry across nearly 160 companies.</p>



<p>You can read Hulst’s full memo to staff below.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>Dear Team,&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Today, I want to share some important updates from Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Studio Business Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities. As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE’s Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studios – Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Expanding beyond PlayStation devices and crafting engaging online experiences alongside our single-player games are key focal areas for us as we evolve our revenue streams.&nbsp; We need to be strategic, though, in bringing our games to new platforms and recognize when our games fall short of meeting player expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>While mobile remains a priority growth area for the Studio Business, we are in the very early stage of our mobile efforts.&nbsp; To achieve success in this area we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios’ pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>With this re-focused approach, Neon Koi will close, and its mobile action game will not be moving forward. I want to express my gratitude to everyone at Neon Koi for their hard work and endless passion to innovate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Regarding Firewalk, as announced in early September, certain aspects of Concord were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline.&nbsp; We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio.   I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE.&nbsp; Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization.&nbsp; Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>I am a big believer in the benefits of embracing creative experimentation and developing new IP. However, growing through sustainable financials, especially in a challenged economic environment is critical.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>While today is a difficult day, there is much to look forward to in the months ahead from the Studio Business Group and our teams.&nbsp; I remain confident that we are building a resilient and capable organization driven by creating unforgettable entertainment experiences for our players.  &nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you for your continued support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plethora of weapons</a> to enjoy, but one of the most efficient guns in the game is the AEK-973, a three-round burst DMR that hits hard and can drop enemies in seconds.</p>



<p>To make the most of the Marksman Rifle, here’s the best Black Ops 6 AEK-973 loadout to use, including the attachments, Perks, Equipment, and more.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-aek-973-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-aek-973">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>

<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AEK-973 in Black Ops 6</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-aek-973-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AEK-973 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-aek-973-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best AEK-973 attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>Volzhskiy Reflex </li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>For the best AEK-973 loadout in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a>, you’ll want a clean Optic like the <strong>Volzhskiy Reflex</strong> and the <strong>Suppressor </strong>Muzzle to keep you off the enemy radar when firing the gun.</p>



<p>Next, the <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> provides a boost to bullet velocity and damage range, allowing you to secure kills at long distances. The <strong>Commando Grip</strong> improves the AEK’s handling stats so that you can ADS and fire faster after sprinting. Lastly, but certainly not least, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> mod gives the Marksman Rifle a major increase to its fire rate, meaning the 3-round bursts come out faster, allowing you to get a faster TTK.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-aek-973">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for AEK-973</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Ninja</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Vigilance</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Flak Jacket</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Impact Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>When it comes to Perks, we’ve gone with <strong>Ninja </strong>for quite movement, <strong>Forward Intel</strong> for extra minimap information, and <strong>Vigilance</strong> to keep you aware of your position being exposed. These combine to give you the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong>, which is very useful for seeing the enemy team’s position on the map.</p>



<p>We’ve then selected <strong>Perk Greed </strong>as the Wildcard, which means you can pick a fourth Perk, for which we went with <strong>Flak Jacket</strong>, as Lethal Equipment can be deadly without it.</p>



<p>Speaking of Lethals, the <strong>Impact Grenade</strong> is great for flushing enemies out of tight spaces, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> regenerates your health to get you back in the fight and survive longer.</p>



<p>The <strong>Trophy System</strong> is one of the best Field Upgrades in the game as it protects the team when capturing an objective, hence why we’ve picked it in our best AEK-973 loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-aek-973">Best Secondary for AEK-973</h2>



<p>The <strong>Grekhova </strong>is the best Secondary weapon for the AEK-973, as its a full-auto pistol that performs extremely well at close range. This covers you in close-quarters combat, which is not where the AEK-973 excels.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AEK-973 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the AEK-973 by reaching <strong>Level 34</strong> in Black Ops 6. You can do this in Multiplayer or Zombies, as progression is shared across these modes. Once Warzone is integrated, you’ll also be able to level up in the Battle Royale too.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to unlock the gun, check out our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/">top tips on ranking up quickly in BO6</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-aek-973-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AEK-973 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The AEK-973 is one of the best Marksman Rifles in Black Ops 6. It may not be the top of the meta, as those spots are occupied by the strong SMGs and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-assault-rifles-in-black-ops-6-ranked-best-ar-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assault Rifles</a>, but the three-round burst DMR can outperform any weapon when it’s used to its strengths.</p>



<p>Hold long lines of sight and try not to run and gun too much, this weapon excels when used in positions of power such as high ground and head glitches.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to AEK-973 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <strong>Swat 5.56</strong> is the obvious alternative to the AEK-973, as it’s also a 3-round burst DMR. It performs similarly to the AEK, but has better accuracy and slightly worse mobility stats. If you want something even more deadly that requires pinpoint accuracy, give our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best quickscoping LW3A1 Frostline loadout</a> a go.</p>
