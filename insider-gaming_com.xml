<p>Players have reported that Battlefield 6 physical copies include the entire game and do not require any additional downloads to play. </p>



<p>It’s less than 3 days until the highly anticipated Battlefield 6 releases on October 10, 2025. Interestingly, some players who had pre-ordered the physical copy of BF6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-physical-copies-reportedly-received-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received the game early</a> and have started providing reports on what is available on the disc, and it seems you can have the whole experience right off the bat. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-servers-seem-like-they-are-already-online">Battlefield 6 Servers Seem Like They Are Already Online</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-physical-copies-are-content-complete-and-require-no-initial-install-according-to-early-copy-holders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the original poster, who had received Battlefield 6’s physical copy early, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2p42z/?share_id=gftOQn-SiPIYz2EDMKSD6&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> some other details as well. A player asked the OP whether the game was playable without an internet connection and required no additional downloads, and the answer was “yes”. The OP also confirmed other points, such as being able to play the campaign through the Battlefield 6 disc, and the multiplayer servers seem to be online as well. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 developers have also contributed to the hype ahead of the game’s release recently. During a recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-teases-naval-warfare-is-coming-to-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a>, the developers stated that “requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favorite little helicopter, platoons, and more.” These points are likely to make fans happy, as even more exciting content appears to be on the way. </p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s associate creative director has explained why the timeline doesn’t allow for Wall Runs.</p>



<p>Activision’s latest Call of Duty installment, Black Ops 7, is all set to arrive on November 14, 2025, with the developers conducting open beta testing until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-beta-has-been-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 9</a>. Ahead of the game’s release, the devs have provided players with an insight into BO7’s movement features, explaining why Wall Jumps can transition into Wall Runs. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-doesn-t-have-wall-runs-as-the-timeline-doesn-t-allow-it">Black Ops 7 Doesn’t Have Wall Runs As the Timeline Doesn’t Allow It</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-say-that-you-can-blame-the-black-ops-timeline-for-the-wall-jump-not-being-a-wall-run-black-ops-2-really-gave-us-a-foundation-for-the-technology-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie revealed why Wall Runs weren’t included in the game. Leslie first explains that when they began developing BO7, they “wanted to pick up threads from Black Ops 2.” Which is why all the technology available in the game is from that era. Leslie explained that the team is very precious to their canon and they have to respect that. </p>



<p>Leslie added that they couldn’t have Thrust Jump as the tech didn’t exist until 2035. Similar to that, Wall Run would have made sense if the game were set more in the future; however, as the tech did not exist in the Black Ops 2 era, “so it made sense not to do it.” </p>



<p>Black Ops 7 does have Wall Jumps, which allow players to gain some height by chaining three jumps. Leslie also spoke about how players can get much higher with the new feature, and they “took a lot of learnings from everything we did on Black Ops 3 – it was really important that we kept the combat in-frame.” </p>
