<p><strong>LATEST UPDATE 4:25pm EST:</strong> Path of Exile 2 still isn’t available for players hoping to enjoy the start of early access  as more issues have come up for the developers.  The game’s official social media account posted, “We’ve run into the same symptom again with a different problem. We are working on fixing it again but regrettably every time this happens we have to restart and wipe the databases to prevent them getting into bad or corrupted states. We’ll have a fix out as soon as we can!”</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: The early access launch of Path of Exile 2 has been delayed due to database</p>



<p>The game was originally scheduled to launch at 2pm EST. Just before that time, and with a larger than expected number of players eager to jump into the game, developer Grinding Gear Games decided to do “last minute database upgrades” in order to allow the game’s servers to handle the influx of players. </p>



<p>The delay comes hours after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-ii-queue-warning-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers warned of long queue times</a> for players on launch day.</p>



<p>After the database configuration was deployed, the <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865098006934229066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">team said</a> that it would only take a “half hour” to get access restored to the game. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case after another issue was found within the game.</p>



<p>First, there was a crash that “would have affected a majority of users” that was fixed and being deployed before final checks. Following stating that the release was “relatively imminent”, yet another problem arose for the game.</p>



<p>“We’ve run into a configuration problem and need to restart the realm,” they said. “The problem we ran into was due to adding more database shards in the last minute to try to support the massive player numbers. Unfortunately there was an issue which caused multiple characters to have the same character id.”</p>



<p>As of publishing, not only is the early access launch delayed but the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3594080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a> has been going offline due to players looking for updates.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide an update when Path of Exile 2 is functioning and available.</p>
