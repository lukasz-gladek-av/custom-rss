<p>Embark Studios has uncovered what’s coming next with Shrouded Sky, the update hitting ARC Raiders next week. Alongside a teaser trailer that revealed the new map condition as ‘Hurricane’, we received a graphic that contained a <strong>stark revelation</strong> that has fans excited.</p>



<p>After months of asking for them, it looks like Embark Studios is finally adding beards to the customization menu in ARC Raiders. The post-apocalyptic Speranza residents who have all gone rather baby-faced up until now might finally be able to wear a little face fur after Shrouded Sky drops.</p>







<h2 id="h-beards-are-coming-to-arc-raiders">Beards Are Coming to ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you’ve been holding out hope that Embark Studios would add beards to ARC Raiders, it looks like you’re finally in luck. In the new teaser trailer for Shrouded Sky, we’re treated to a graphic that shows a raider very clearly sporting a relatively large beard.</p>



<p>That’s important for one major reason, and it’s that up until now, every shot of in-game characters has had them wearing clothing sets that can be equipped <strong>in-game</strong>. It also has them exclusively showing off hairstyles, tattoos, and face decorations that you can buy or unlock in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>This is the first time we’ve seen a raider with a full beard.</p>



<p>Therefore, we’re led to believe, very patently, that beards are coming to ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>It could be in anticipation of the new Shrouded Sky update, which drops on February 24th. It brings <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-hurricane-new-map-condition/">the ‘Hurricane’ map condition</a>, which will batter players with vicious winds, flying debris, and harsh rain. Perhaps wearing a beard is some extra layer of protection against the detritus flying around, slamming you in the face.</p>



<p>That’s probably not the reason.</p>



<p>Beards were always on the cards, in reality. This is a slow-feed, live-service title with plenty of meat, and Embark Studios plans to support it for years to come. We were always going to get beards; it’s just a matter of when.</p>



<p>Now, all that matters is for us to find out how deep the facial hair runs. Will we get moustaches and goatees, too? It’s anyone’s guess.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embar</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">k Studios</a> has confirmed what’s making ‘Shrouded Sky’ so <strong>shrouded </strong>when the next major ARC Raiders update comes around in just a few days. The next update hits <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> on February 24th, introducing a new small-scale ARC enemy, a map overhaul, some new quests, an Expedition Project, and a <strong>new map condition</strong>.</p>



<p>Fans have been racking their brains trying to think of what the new map condition could be, but Embark Studios has finally confirmed it. The world outside Speranza is about to be rocked by a hurricane.</p>







<h2 id="h-hurricanes-are-coming-to-arc-raiders">Hurricanes Are Coming to ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>, Embark Studios has confirmed what’s coming on February 24th with Shrouded Sky, focusing on the new map condition. Based on the data available, we always thought it would be a ‘Toxic Swamp’ map condition, but that might be lined up for a later update.</p>



<p>For now, we’re getting <strong>Hurricane</strong>.</p>



<p>This will change the game’s weather and physics, introducing powerful winds that heavily impact players as they explore the maps:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The wind will change how you navigate topside. When you have a tailwind, you’ll feel fast and nimble, but fighting against the gales will inhibit your speed and quickly drain your stamina. Throwables will also behave differently in these conditions, and it may take a while to master the trajectory of thrown items like grenades. Other aspects of gameplay like smoke, gas, and even jumping will be affected by the power of the Hurricane.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Debris will fly around at breakneck speed, striking the player and causing their shields to glitch. Embark has advised that you might prefer to remove your shield entirely, as the bits and pieces flying around will make your shield degrade and spark, making you <strong>very </strong>visible.</p>



<p>Further, visibility will take a huge hit in Shrouded Sky under the Hurricane map condition. Players will find themselves enveloped by thick mists that make spotting ARC and other Raiders almost impossible. That, combined with the ‘howling winds’, means that navigating the maps will be much tougher than usual.</p>



<p>The gem of the Hurricane map condition is a new stack of First Waves Caches, buried boxes containing rare relics that have been unearthed by the violent winds and harrowing rain.</p>

<p>A new report reveals that PlayStation has decided to shut down Bluepoint Games. </p>



<p>Bluepoint Games has been instrumental in enhancing past titles for the current-gen consoles, including Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection and Shadow of the Colossus. The team was also responsible for bringing us the PlayStation 5 remake of Demon’s Souls. Now, the studio has been closed down. </p>







<h2 id="h-bluepoint-games-will-shut-down-next-month">Bluepoint Games Will Shut Down Next Month</h2>



<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTUyNzAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMTMxODI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQVBZWlBLR0lGUFkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.utABYnI4m_K6kqNqybZarBQ9T5WW_aWCH6NI3kt8Q64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>&nbsp;report, PlayStation has decided to close Bluepoint Games, leading to the dismissal of approximately 70 employees from a total of 80. A spokesperson for PlayStation stated that this decision was made “following a business review.” The shutdown of Bluepoint Games is scheduled for next month.
