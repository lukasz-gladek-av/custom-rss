<p>The sale of EA to the Saudi Arabian-owned Public Investment Fund has been approved by shareholders. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the purchase</a> still needs government approval before it can go through.</p>



<p>Earlier in the year, EA announced that PIF would be purchasing a majority stake in the gaming company. The deal, set for $55 billion, would lead to PIF acquiring 93.4% of EA. While the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-it-will-keep-creative-control-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would still run things</a> as it would in the United States, it would be mainly owned by Saudi Arabia. Pushback from fans and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-sale-facing-resistance-us-politicians/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even US government officials</a> have arose since the announcement, but nothing has been amended. Now, the company’s shareholders have moved forward with the deal, further solidifying it.</p>











<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As of 2:03pm PT, EA's shareholders have officially approved EA's $55 billion sale to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. </p><p>The deal will next need to receive approval from government regulators</p></div>— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/2003225658982576557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/2003225658982576557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet from journalist Stephen Totilo</a>, EA shareholders have approved the deal of the company being sold to Saudi Arabia’s PIF. The only thing truly left is for government regulators to approve the deal. No word as to when that deal will come in has been said as of yet. </p>



<p>Despite the buyout, EA will maintain creative control of the company. It’s not fully known what PIF will play within the company. EA did extremely well in 2025, with Battlefield 6 topping the charts in sales and it’s sports titles doing great, as well. Still, given the many warnings from government and fans, as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-bioware-employees-worried-about-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studios at EA like Bioware</a>, the direction the company can go is up in the air.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto: Tokyo ‘Almost Happened,’ Says Former Rockstar Dev]]></title>

<p>The Grand Theft Auto franchise was very close to branching out with a game set in the Japanese capital of Tokyo, a former Rockstar dev confirmed, before eventually being scrapped.</p>



<p>GTA has become synonymous with the USA over the years, with Rockstar creating the likes of Liberty City, San Andreas, and Vice City as counterparts to New York, California, and Florida, and it’s been over 25 years since GTA briefly visited the streets of London, and an exit from North America now seems extremely unlikely.</p>



<p>However, a game based in Tokyo was on the agenda in the past and “almost happened,” though the idea was later scrapped.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesHub</a>, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij, who worked on the likes of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas, confirmed that discussions did take place for a Tokyo-based version of the game to release.</p>



<p>“We had ideas about GTA games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul. Tokyo almost actually happened. Another studio in Japan was going to do it, take our code and do GTA: Tokyo. But then that didn’t happen in the end,” he said.</p>



<p>With the GTA franchise ballooning further since the release of GTA V, and the huge anticipation for GTA 6, Vermeij believes the time has passed for a move to another continent to take place, and believes it wouldn’t work.</p>



<p>“People love having these wild ideas, but then when you’ve got billions of dollars riding on it, it’s too easy to go let’s do what we know again, and also America is basically the epicentre of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven’t been there. They have a mental image of the cities.</p>



<p>“I think it’s unlikely it’s going to be in Bogota next time, especially since there’s just more and more money involved as the project gets bigger. It doesn’t make sense to set it in some left-field location for novelty. GTA: Toronto? It just wouldn’t work.”</p>



<p>Additionally, while fans have been holding out hope for the bottom of the GTA 6 map to be expanded to include some of the Caribbean, or even Colombia, Vermeij believes it’s still unlikely to happen, even though he admits it’s something he would enjoy.</p>



<p>“I would love that. I think drug running is a good match. I was actually constantly trying to push to get that into the earlier games but it never happened. But is that what Rockstar are doing? I don’t think so. It doesn’t really make sense. It’s a lot of extra work for what it would be.”</p>
