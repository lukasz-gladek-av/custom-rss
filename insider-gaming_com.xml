<p>OpTic Texas has found itself in a sticky spot since 2025 kicked off. The team’s last win in a qualifying stage was at the end of January, and at the Major in Madrid, the team crashed out after winning just one series in the lower bracket. The squad is on a historic losing streak, losing 15 maps in sequence and sitting one from the bottom in the CDL stage standings.</p>



<p>The team is drawing a 50-50 win-loss record right now in the overall season standings, but one more loss will push them into negative ground and could move them further down the leaderboard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-texas-in-turmoil">Texas in Turmoil</h2>



<p>The impact of the losing streak has been visible on the faces of the OpTic Texas crew in recent weeks. They’re looking sullen and extinguished on their camera feeds, and the energy that usually drives them is sorely lacking.</p>



<p>Recently, the organisation’s owner, Hector ‘H3CZ’ Rodriguez, made a controversial statement on stream, dubbing the squad the worst OpTic team ever. This losing streak is indeed like nothing we’ve ever seen for the organisation.</p>



<p>This stage alone, OpTic Texas has lost with an 0 – 3 scoreline against:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>
</ul>



<p>The running joke now is that even the Vegas Falcons, a team that has lost two dozen Hardpoint rounds since the season started and sits on a record of 0 – 16 overall has put up a better fight this stage.</p>











<p>OpTic’s most recent loss came at the hands of Toronto Ultra, which laid the utter smackdown against the team from Texas. In this series, JoeDecieves (ULT) set a new KD record at 2.05, helped by going double positive in the opening Hardpoint.</p>



<p>It was a crushing blow for Texas through and through, and the closing round of Control was a 3 – 0 masterclass from Ultra. Ironically, this is OpTic Texas’ Major event. The upcoming LAN tournament will be played at the arena in which they won their CDL Championship last year, and they’re entering the running in the worst position possible.</p>



<p>On social platforms everywhere, fans of the OpTic franchise are writhing and desperately figuring out a plan to right the ship. The consensus is that a major roster change is needed, but nobody seems to know who is at fault. The finger pointing is generally levelled at Kenny, and one of the most common claims is that Huke never should have been pushed back out for the return of Pred.</p>



<p>What do you think needs to be done for OpTic Texas to win a series? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>A new leak has revealed that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach will have a collectors edition costing $229.99.</p>



<p>That’s according to reliable dataminer <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, who reports that the game is gearing up for an announcement later today.</p>



<p>It’s theorised that the announcement could come during Kojima’s appearance at SXSW 2025, where Kojima Productions is set to host a panel. </p>



<p>If the pre-orders are not announced during the panel, then it’s almost certain that an announcement will be made later this month, as billbil-kun obtains his datamined information from the backend of websites and stores, meaning that the information has recently been uploaded to the backend and thus, ready for an announcement.</p>



<p>According to the leak, the game will have two different physical editions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Edition : 79.99 euros / 69.99 US dollars / 69.99 pounds sterling</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Collector’s&nbsp;Edition : $229.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>As pointed out in the leak, the contents of the editions are currently unclear, but at a hefty $229.99 price tag for the collectors edition, it’s likely to contain some kind of statue. The original Death Stranding collectors edition featured a Baby BB Pod Replica.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2 was officially revealed at the Game Awards in 2022 and is set to launch on the PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>
