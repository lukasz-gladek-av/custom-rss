<p>In a recent seminar at GDC, Cameron Williams, formerly of Rockstar Games, offered a walkthrough of the issues plaguing open-world games. Williams has since relocated, taking his talents to Absurd Ventures, the studio founded by Dan Houser, but he has previously worked on Grand Theft Auto 6 and Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>He stressed that large open worlds with too much content are leading to analysis paralysis and preventing players from wanting to actively explore. The worlds we’re experiencing these days are so expansive and the incentives for travelling vast distances and covering all the bases just aren’t enough anymore. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-impossible-task">‘An Impossible Task’</h2>



<p>In a panel discussion covered by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/players-dont-explore-former-grand-theft-auto-6-and-red-dead-online-designer-lays-out-the-perils-of-open-world-fatigue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> at GDC, Absurd Ventures’ Cameron Williams took a deep dive into one of the most talked-about issues with open-world games. In his words, they’re becoming too big and diverse, presenting players with so many options that they simply cannot choose what to do next.</p>



<p>This is something that the team at Absurd Ventures is actively trying to avoid.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players just don’t explore, right?</p>



<p>Whether they just simply aren’t compelled or your game has a huge time investment and it’s hard for players to pick up and put down, which is an increasing challenge, especially with the sort of evolving ecosystem of free-to-play and live service games that are kind of eating everyone’s time and attention.</p>



<p>They’re wondering, ‘Okay, how far away is the next thing? I really gotta run all the way across the map? And what’s my gain?</p>



<p>We want to avoid creating a possibility space so large that <strong>players simply just don’t know what to choose</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s something I covered in my recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">review of Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, which is a great game but suffers from the open-world fatigue that Williams is referring to. The objectives are far too spaced apart and the world is enormous, which makes it a chore to navigate, leaving players to rely on fast-travel mechanics far too often.</p>



<p>These games can be hellish for what Williams dubbed ‘beeliners’ – players who want to go from A to B with as little interference as possible. They’re the gamers who don’t have time to waste on side content and tertiary missions and want to explore a story and hang up their hat.</p>



<p>Do you think open-world games are becoming far too bloated for the average gamer to enjoy? Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

<p>Battlefield leaks are still flowing thick and fast from the latest round of testing sessions, and in the freshest drops, an all-new map has been revealed. It’s called Battery, and per the reports, it’s a dense urban map themed on Gibraltar, which was a location given away in early concept art for the game.</p>



<p>A series of gameplay clips from Battery have leaked on Reddit. They showcase the new map and some Conquest action – check out the links below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-new-norm">The New Norm</h2>



<p>Many have theorised that Electronic Arts <em><span>all</span>ows </em>these leaks to flow from the Battlefield Labs tests, as it’s effectively free publicity. The consensus so far has been that the next Battlefield game looks <strong>good</strong>, even at this alpha stage. It looks like a throwback to the peaks of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4</a>, which is great news for those more veteran of the series.</p>



<p>In the latest Battlefield leaks, we’re given a look at Battery, a packed urban map with tight streets and tall buildings. It’s the kind of map that fosters intense destruction, close-quarters combat, and kill boxes for vehicles, but it looks great at first blush.</p>



<p>The best look at Battery comes courtesy of user TooFlu2, who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jguiic/gameplay_from_the_new_battlefield_labs_map_and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">uploaded a two-minute clip</a> to the Battlefield subreddit.</p>



<p>In another post, user eggdrums115 uploaded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jgofni/first_overview_of_new_map_battery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a picture of Battery’s tac-map</a>, which shows you just how tight-knit the environment will be.</p>



<p>The more talked-about features pop up again in this gameplay snippet, such as players having the ability to pull downed teammates out of the line of fire. It’s also a showcase for the convention military mechanics that are set to feature in the next Battlefield game – gone are the futuristic gadgets, robot dogs, and wingsuits.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the next Battlefield game? Have the leaks filled you with hope that it will finally deliver when it’s ultimately released? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Verdansk returns to Call of Duty Warzone on April 3, more than three years after it disappeared from the iconic battle royale title. It’s penned as being a last-ditch effort for Activision to retain players, and it’s arguably the biggest thing to happen to the game since it was <strong>removed </strong>in December 2021.</p>



<p>Today, the Verdansk Tac Map was revealed on social media, uncovering the full suite of POIs and some tidbits of information about the ‘new old’ map – including <strong>water on land</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-same-but-different">Same But Different</h2>



<p>Verdansk is almost entirely unchanged in the new graphic published <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1903129487123849371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Call of Duty</a> on social media. The POIs are the same as they were five years ago when the game was first released:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dam</li>



<li>Military Base</li>



<li>Quarry</li>



<li>Airport</li>



<li>TV Station</li>



<li>Storage Town</li>



<li>Superstore</li>



<li>Stadium</li>



<li>Lumber</li>



<li>Boneyard</li>



<li>Train Station</li>



<li>Hospital</li>



<li>Downtown</li>



<li>Farmland</li>



<li>Port</li>



<li>Prison</li>



<li>Park</li>



<li>Promenade</li>



<li>Hills</li>
</ul>



<p>Where you land first is entirely up to you, but those hot spots likely haven’t changed over the last half-decade.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted a couple of telling sights on the new Verdansk Tac Map, though. It looks as though we’ll have water extending throughout the map in the form of rivers, which wasn’t a thing when the map was first released in March 2020. It seems like the updated railway line is also present, which means the train could be coming back.</p>



<p>It has also been noted that classic weapons could be making a comeback for the return of Verdansk. As players, we passed through so many metas back then that there’s a wealth of weaponry for Activision’s teams to choose from.</p>



<p>Aside from that, Verdansk looks as good as it ever did. Could this be a Fortnite OG kind of resurgence that brings millions of players back to Warzone overnight? Perhaps. We’ll know for sure on April 3.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/european-commission-targets-exploitive-virtual-in-game-currency-practices/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/european-commission-targets-exploitive-virtual-in-game-currency-practices.1141812/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/european-commission-targets-exploitive-virtual-in-game-currency-practices/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The European Commission and the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network have published a new set of guidelines covering the purchasing of in-game virtual currency today. These new principles were applied after the CPC Network found a game developer to be engaged in a number of practice deemed “harmful to children.”</p>



<h2 id="h-the-european-commission-has-launched-a-probe-into-star-stable-online">The European Commission Has Launched a Probe into Star Stable Online</h2>



<p>On March 20th, The CPC Network <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that that a number of commercial practices from Star Stable Entertainment AB were deemed “particularly harmful to children” in their game, Star Stable Online. These practices allegedly include “direct appeals to children in the advertisements,” the use of pressuring techniques, a lack of clear and transparent information, and failing to ensure that influencers promoting the product were disclosing commercial content.</p>



<p>The developers of the children’s game where you collect, accessorize, and race horses now have a month to address the issues highlighted by the CPC Network. However, these issues have made the CPC Network see “the need for European consumers to be better protected.” Thus, they have <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/8af13e88-6540-436c-b137-9853e7fe866a_en?filename=Key%20principles%20on%20in-game%20virtual%20currencies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> seven “key principles” on in-game virtual currencies:</p>



<ol>
<li>“Price indication must be clear and transparent.” This effectively requires games to list the real-world money equivalent on any in-game virtual currency or in-game digital content.</li>



<li>“Practices obscuring the cost of in-game digital content and services should be avoided.”</li>



<li>“Practices that force consumers to purchase unwanted in-game virtual currency should be avoided.”</li>



<li>“Consumers should be provided with clear and comprehensive pre-contractual information.”</li>



<li>“Consumers’ right of withdrawal should be respected.” </li>



<li>“Contractual terms should be fair and written in plain and clear language.”</li>



<li>“Game design and gameplay should be respectful of different consumer vulnerabilities.”</li>
</ol>



<p>The CPC Network hopes these principles will “will help create a safer, more transparent experience for players,” but will also continue to monitor EU gaming companies and “may take further actions if harmful practices continue.” All the newly established principles are based on pre-existing EU consumer laws.</p>



<p>Are virtual currency practices too exploitive of children? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-arcade-is-reportedly-unprofitable-without-subscription-bundle.1141761/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/apple-arcade-is-reportedly-unprofitable-without-apple-one-bundle/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Apple Arcade, the mobile gaming subscription service, is reportedly one of several Apple services suffering from low usage and profits. It’s been reported in the past that payouts to developers have been declining for years, and if it weren’t included in the Apple One bundle, it would be considered unprofitable.</p>



<h2 id="h-25-of-apple-arcade-users-during-it-first-years-were-on-free-trials">25% of Apple Arcade Users During it First Years Were on Free Trials</h2>



<p>The information comes, ironically, from tech and business news outlet The Information, who <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-streaming-losses-top-1-billion-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Apple is losing over $1 billion a year on its streaming service, Apple TV+. The report also mentions other Apple services that are supposedly not performing well, including Apple Arcade.</p>



<p>“Apple Arcade, for example, had only 2 million users in its first year after it launched in 2019, with roughly 25% of them on free trials, according to one person with direct knowledge of the figures,” reads The Information’s report. “Without Apple One, some services, such as Apple Arcade and Fitness+, likely wouldn’t be profitable.” Apple One is a subscription bundle introduced in 2020 that offers access to Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and iCloud storage, with a Premier plan option that includes Apple News+ and Apple Fitness+ as well.</p>



<p>Apple Arcade was launched only a year prior in 2019, offering direct access to paid games without advertisements or in-app purchases. 71 games were included at launch, and developers like Capcom, Sega, Bandai Namco, and Devolver Digital partnered with Apple to create games for the service. But <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-axed-games-declining-payouts-disillusioned-studios-and-an-uncertain-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> from Neil Long at Mobilegamer.biz from last year claimed that payouts to developers had been declining for year, and that a “shitload” of projects had been canceled. One developer reportedly told Long that the Apple Arcade service had “the smell of death” around it. Still, Apple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-trials-of-mana-and-more-coming-to-apple-arcade-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added 10 new games to the service just this past January</a>.</p>



<p>Are Apple Arcade’s days numbered? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
