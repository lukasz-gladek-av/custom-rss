            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" id="311">Fallout</a> is a bustling realm that’s as much made up of the original projects by the developers as it is fan-made projects pieced together by those enthralled by the post-apocalyptic universe that emerged in the late 1990s. The latest entry into that world, Fallout: The New West, is no different, but it’s one of the more ambitious concepts to surface in recent years.</p>



<p>Fallout: The New West is a fan-made project that aims to remake the cancelled Fallout: Van Buren, which many die-hard fans have always dubbed ‘the original Fallout 3’. It’s what might have been had the original team not hit a patch of financial distress and shifted focus away from the series, ultimately selling the label to Bethesda Game Studios.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-the-new-west-revives-what-might-have-been">Fallout: The New West Revives What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>Van Buren was canned in 2003 after months of development at Black Isle Studios. It would have been the third major release in the series, bearing the name ‘Fallout 3’ and taking players to the American southwest, around Colorado. Coincidentally, that’s where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-fallout-set-colorado-season-two-explained/" id="174234">the next season</a> of the Fallout television show is headed.</p>



<p>It was never to be, and in 2008, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda/" id="419">Bethesda Game Studios</a> released Fallout 3, a monumental overhaul to the series and a real risk-taker of a game, after acquiring the licenses from Interplay and Black Isle.</p>



<p>Now, a group of dedicated modders is bringing Van Buren back to life with Fallout: The New West. It’s a complete conversion mod that promises to transform Fallout: New Vegas, telling the ‘same broad story envisioned by Fallout: Van Buren.’ On the website for Fallout: The New West, the game’s narrative was outlined, and by all accounts, it’s an ambitious stab at a near-forgotten game.</p>



<p>Days ago, The United West Team, the group assembling The New West, posted the first teaser trailer for the mod:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout: The New West Reveal Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KY5X0G_05h0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>At the time of writing, the trailer had garnered more than 100,000 views and hundreds of positive comments. One user wrote, <em>‘For a moment, I thought this was from Bethesda and went, ‘Oh, so they were actually cooking.’ As always, it’s the community that keeps Fallout alive.’</em></p>



<p>Fallout: The New West actually surfaced around five years ago. In May 2021, the team at The United West announced plans to piece the mod together, but back then, it was dubbed Fallout Revelation Blue. Back then, it was noted that Fallout: The New West <strong>would not </strong>treat New Vegas as canonical.</p>



<p>One thing is for sure, and that’s that Bethesda’s Todd Howard probably won’t play this mod either, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-no-interest-fallout-4-mod-london/" id="167864">effectively snubbing Fallout: London</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bloober-team/" id="1451">Bloober Team</a> officially reveals Layers of Fear 3, the next chapter in its psychological horror series.</p>



<p>Bloober Team previously teased a countdown clock that would expire on Valentine’s Day, featuring audio featuring a quote from The Sick Rose and a poem by William Blake.</p>



<p>The countdown clock was tied to the franchise’s 10th anniversary. It led to the reveal of Layers of Fear 3. The game’s tagline uses the same line from that poem heard in the audio, “Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Six Invitational 2026 comes to a head tomorrow in Paris, and it’s all down to just two teams: FaZe Clan and Team Secret. Following an intense tournament, the grand finalists are lined up and raring to go, but only one will walk out of the stadium with $1 million and the coveted Six Invitational trophy.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most valuable grand finals in esports, as even the second-place team takes a $450,000 check home. Let’s jump into everything you need to know about the Six Invitational 2026 grand final.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-2026-predictions-faze-clan-vs-team-secret">Six Invitational 2026 Predictions: FaZe Clan vs. Team Secret</h2>



<p>The Six Invitational is a tough one to call at this point. Even though only <strong>two teams remain</strong>, they’re very evenly matched as we run into the grand final. The group stage yielded similar results for both squads, with Team Secret having the edge, but FaZe Clan shone a little brighter during the playoffs.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that it’s FaZe Clan’s <strong>third </strong>grand final in a row at the Six Invitational, which is impressive by itself. Last year, the organization lifted the trophy in Boston after wiping Team BDS in the grand final, making up for a tough second-place finish on home turf in 2024.</p>



<p>Team Secret bloomed <strong>heavily </strong>last year, securing the win at the Esports World Cup, but FaZe Clan remains the favourite to lift the hammer this year in Paris. The community is behind FaZe Clan, but it’s <strong>close</strong>, and both teams are playing on neutral ground.</p>



<p>If you want to tune in, the grand final of the Six Invitational 2026 will start at 17:00 GMT, and you can expect some huge news from Ubisoft before it lands.</p>







<p>What are you thinking? Will we see an underdog upset from Team Secret, or will FaZe Clan go back-to-back at the Six Invitational? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Takeshi Ichikawa, the producer of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dragon-quest-7-reimagined/" id="3414">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a>, reflects on preserving the spirit of Akira Toriyama’s designs in the remade video game.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest 7 was originally released back in 2000 on the Sony PlayStation. However, over a quarter-century later, the game has been reimagined in a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/square-enix/" id="87637">Square Enix</a> release. Not only have some major gameplay mechanics been overhauled, but the 2D visuals have been overhauled as well.</p>



<p>The original game featured art by the legendary Akira Toriyama, and it was important to the 2026 development team that the spirit of that art style be preserved to remain faithful to the original drawings.</p>







<h2 id="h-preserving-the-spirit-of-toriyama-s-original-work-on-dragon-quest-7-was-essential">Preserving the Spirit of Toriyama’s Original Work on Dragon Quest 7 Was Essential</h2>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-quest/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-producer-says-square-enix-tried-to-convey-the-cuteness-of-legendary-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyamas-original-designs-without-compromising-the-jrpgs-unique-atmosphere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Takeshi Ichikawa discussed the importance of preserving the cuteness of Toriyama’s designs while still capturing the game’s atmosphere for a modern audience. As for the direction of modern art, Ichikawa noted that current movies and games featuring doll designs had been well received, so they chose to combine that with Toriyama’s original designs.</p>



<p>“We felt this approach would create a visually appealing style, leading to our decision to move forward with the hand-crafted aesthetic,” he said.</p>







<p>The remake has been well-received. It currently has an 83 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic </a>score and a 7.6 user score on the platform.</p>



<p>Akira Toriyama also worked on an upcoming Dragon Ball video game project before his passing. Learn more about that upcoming game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/" id="171842">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dead-by-daylight/" id="741">Dead by Daylight</a>, the popular co-op survival horror game from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/behaviour-interactive/" id="1742">Behaviour Interactive</a>, is being adapted into a film. The <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dead-by-daylight-movie-adaptation-writers-1236505104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollywood Reporter</a> has confirmed that Blumhouse-Atomic Monster has selected David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, known for his work on The Conjuring series, and Alexandre Aja as writers for the upcoming adaptation.</p>



<p>Alexandre Aja has writing credits, including 2006’s “The Hills Have Eyes,” but he’s also known for his directorial work. According to the report, he’s not directing this film because he’s slated to direct Under Paris 2 at Netflix. Therefore, Dead by Daylight is still looking for a director.</p>







<h2 id="h-blumhouse-founder-is-confident-in-choice-for-dead-by-daylight-writers">Blumhouse Founder Is Confident in Choice For Dead by Daylight Writers</h2>



<p>Jason Blum, the founder and CEO of Blumhouse, praised Aja and McGoldrick in a statement. He said the pair offers a rare balance of character-focused storytelling and genre intensity. He also dubbed the pairing an excellent blueprint for attracting prospective directors.</p>



<p>“Drawing from survival horror and psychological terror, their work establishes a world where fear is not just experienced, but earned. It is a cinematic blueprint designed to attract a director who can elevate that vision through performance and scale,” said Blum.</p>







<h2 id="h-video-game-adaptations-are-all-the-rage">Video Game Adaptations Are All the Rage</h2>



<p>Dead by Daylight is just one of many video games currently being adapted for film and TV. Sega’s House of the Dead franchise is slated for a new movie release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/house-of-the-dead-movie-casts-isabela-merced-in-lead-role/" id="174954">starring Isabela Merced</a>. Additionally, the God of War franchise is being adapted into a TV show on Prime Video. That series has already been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" id="161464">greenlit for a second season.</a></p>



<p>Also, Sega has announced that many of its classic franchises, including Streets of Rage and Shinobi, will receive animated adaptations. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/streets-of-rage-shinobi-outrun-getting-animated-adaptations/" id="176639">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In Rainbow Six esports fashion, Ubisoft has used the biggest stage in the space, at the Six Invitational, to announce the setting for <strong>the next Six Invitational</strong>. As the action unfolds in Paris, France, the team took it upon themselves to declare <strong>Brazil</strong> the spot for next year’s Six Invitational, one of the most valuable esports tournaments in the business.</p>



<p>This will be the <strong>second </strong>Six Invitational to hit Brazil in three years, with the 2024 event taking place in Sao Paolo and setting a record as one of the most-viewed events in the game’s history.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-goes-back-to-brazil">Six Invitational Goes Back to Brazil</h2>



<p>The Six Invitational is wrapping up in Paris, France, tomorrow, and it has been one hell of a tournament thus far. It’s the first Six Invitational to land in Paris since 2021, and the European fans have been <strong>very </strong>receptive to the power of the event.</p>



<p>In a new press release, Ubisoft and BLAST unveiled a reinvigorated, three-year partnership, pushing further into an alignment that has proved fruitful over the last few years. BLAST will host the next Rainbow Six Major events, which were <strong>also </strong>revealed today:</p>



<ul>
<li>Salt Lake City R6 Major: May 8 – 17, 2026</li>



<li>Japan R6 Major: November 2026</li>
</ul>



<p>Speaking on the announcement, the CEO of BLAST, Robbie Douek, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Over the past three years, BLAST and Ubisoft have worked side-by-side to elevate Rainbow Six esports on a global scale, from unforgettable live events to a more competitive and connected ecosystem. Renewing this partnership was a natural next step and sends a strong positive message to fans of BLAST Rainbow 6, and the competitive entertainment industry. </p>



<p>With incredible destinations confirmed for the 2026/27 season and exciting plans ahead for the ecosystem, we’re excited to continue in our mission to elevate and improve BLAST Rainbow Six Esports for fans, players, teams and brands.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the statement, Francois-Xavier Deniele, the VP of Marketing &amp; Esports (Rainbow Six) at Ubisoft, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Renewing our partnership with BLAST is a strong vote of confidence in what we’ve built together over the past three years, and in where we want to take Rainbow Six esports next. With a unified global structure for 2026, new event destinations across the US, Japan, and Brazil, and the CNL joining as a fully integrated region, we’re creating a clearer competitive journey for teams and a stronger, more consistent experience for fans. </p>



<p>We’re excited to keep innovating, investing in the live product, and growing the ecosystem sustainably for the long term.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last year, Deniele went on record talking about the immense success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege/" id="1507">Rainbow Six Siege</a> as an esports game. He was part of the crew suggesting there’s a <strong>very long </strong>and lucrative road ahead for the game, which Ubisoft wants to become an ‘annual billionaire’ franchise.</p>

<p>Another week draws to a close, but how was it for you? Did you enjoy Valentine’s Day? Or did you miss a day of the NYT Connections puzzle and now your streak is lost, and you’re inconsolable? Whatever happened, I’m back again with another round of NYT Connections hints to help you wrap things up quickly.</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections answers and tips.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>
