<p>It has been a few days since Rockstar Games released GTA 5 Enhanced on PC, bringing a slew of changes and upgrades to the title and allowing players to migrate from the ‘standard’ version of Grand Theft Auto 5. However, things haven’t gone swimmingly, with the game’s overall review score on Steam bombing to an all-time low.</p>



<p>It’s now the worst-rated GTA title on the platform, with almost 10,000 reviews bearing a negative sentiment. It has garnered mixed feedback that’s <strong>mostly </strong>positive, but only just, with 53% of reviews saying something good about the release.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-what-we-wanted">Not What We Wanted</h2>



<p>The biggest gripe players have with GTA 5 Enhanced on Steam is that the account migration feature is hit and miss. Many have reported in their reviews that they’ve been unsuccessful in migrating their accounts, which some have poured thousands of hours (and dollars) into over the years.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240220/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Enhanced/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">One review in particular</a> shines at echoing this sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The GTA Online profile associated with this Rockstar Games account is not eligible for migration at this time.” If you think i’m throwing away nearly 700 hours of gameplay on one character so that you can make a few more bucks off me, then you can lick my anal orifice clean. – MrMorganfarts</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eloquently put.</p>



<p>Another user explained that Rockstar has removed online chat, which has made lobbies and missions feel <strong>dead</strong>, while many more have said that GTA 5 Enhanced should have been an update applied to the base game and not an entirely new version.</p>



<p>The positive reviews, which were still in the close majority at the time of writing, say nice things about the upgraded visuals, the quality-of-life improvements, and the reduction in stuttering and frame rate issues.</p>



<p>That hasn’t stopped GTA 5 from being the worst-rated Grand Theft Auto title on Steam, though. It’s not close, either – it’s leading in that position by a good 10%. </p>



<p>Have you ‘upgraded’ to GTA 5 Enhanced and experienced issues? Let me know what you’re struggling with in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A Popular Fortnite leaker has stated that the game could receive a new emote inspired by Kendrick Lamar’s song.</p>



<p>Fortnite leaker HYPEX’s new post on <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1899497216546410966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> talks about the upcoming Fortnite x Kendrick Lamar collaboration. The partnership will seemingly introduce a “Sit Down, Be Humble” bundle with an emote and song. The song will most likely be “Humble,” the Grammy-winning song by the American Rapper, which was released in 2017. The tweet also states that the “Emote might be from the girl in “Not Like Us. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players will be excited to see Kendrick Lamar-inspired emotes arriving in the game. Some have also started speculating that the hip-hop artist could be a part of the next Fortnite Festival season. Others also wonder why Fortnite is going with a 2017 song when Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Not Like Us’ blew out of the stratosphere after his Super Bowl performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, previous leaks have already provided an idea about who Fortnite Festival’s next headliner will be, and it doesn’t seem like it is Kendrick Lamar. According to the leaks that arrived in January this year, the next artist could be none other than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-sabrina-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a>. The ‘Espresso’ singer is speculated to be the next Fortnite Festival Icon, which will bring new cosmetics and jam tracks inspired by the American artist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is expected to introduce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-a-new-lara-croft-skin-this-update-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Lara Croft skin</a> in this update. Also, cheaters with lifetime bans will receive a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cheaters-with-lifetime-bans-will-receive-a-second-chance-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second chance</a>’ soon. What are your thoughts on Fortnite getting a Kendrick Lamar emote?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Take-Two, the parent company behind Rockstar Games, has sued PlayerAuctions, a side that allegedly facilitates the sale of hacked and boosted GTA Online accounts and illegitimate in-game currency. The recent lawsuit was filed in California, with Take-Two claiming that the Chinese-owned PlayerAuctions platform was ‘reaping millions in revenue’ based on these sales.</p>



<p>The filing from the U.S. Central District Court of California insists that PlayerAuctions is being run with the ‘full knowledge that its sellers are engaged in rampant infringement and other unauthorised conduct.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-first">Not The First</h2>



<p>It was revealed in February 2025 that the Roblox Corporation was also suing PlayerAuctions for a similar streak of allegations. As these cases ramp up, more developers and publishers may enter the fight, as PlayerAuctions supports the sale of digital goods and services from a staggering assortment of titles.</p>



<p>Everything from RuneScape and Fortnite to World of Warcraft and Call of Duty is featured on PlayerAuctions.</p>



<p>The Take-Two case, which was originally spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/536315/take-two-gta-5-online-black-market-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, offers an in-depth perspective on how PlayerAuctions operates and how it’s walking a fine legal line when it comes to digital goods in GTA Online.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836607989/Take-Two-PlayerAuctions-lawsuit-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">California court filing</a> reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>PlayerAuctions goes to great lengths to lull its users into buying illegitimate GTA V content from its sellers, including by offering ‘after-sale protection’ – i.e. refunds – if the hacked accounts they purchase are detected and banned by Take-Two’s anti-cheat systems.</p>



<p>PlayerAuctions offers this ‘protection’ because it knows the hacked player account listings on its marketplace are infringing and unauthorised under Take-Two’s terms of service.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed in the filing that Take-Two has sent several notices to PlayerAuctions along with evidence of these claims, but the platform’s operators have refused to relent. Per the statutory claims of the case, Take-Two would be entitled to $150,000 for each copyright infringed, but PlayerAuctions’ sales figures haven’t yet been made public.</p>



<p>It could be a monster case in terms of damages if Take-Two is successful.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GDC Remove ‘Iron Man’ Reference From Electronic Arts Schedule Page]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/iron-man-motive-reference-gdc-removed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gdc-remove-%E2%80%98iron-man%E2%80%99-reference-from-electronic-arts-schedule-page.1131984/</guid>

<p>Just a couple of days ago, I reported on a mention of Motive’s Iron Man being shown during a summit at GDC next week. Eagle-eyed gamers spotted this, and it set up assumptions that the game would be demo-ready for GDC, one of the biggest conferences in the gaming world.</p>



<p>Now, it has been noticed that the GDC admin team has removed the reference to Iron Man from the same schedule page, suggesting that the game either will no longer be shown <strong>or </strong>the team is attempting to ‘keep it a surprise.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-iron-man-no-more">Iron Man No More</h2>



<p>The schedule page promoting the Advanced Graphics Summit at GDC on March 17 originally spoke of a presentation concerning the development of texture sets for <strong>both </strong>Dead Space and Iron Man at EA’s Motive studio. This was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motive-iron-man-game-demo-ready-gdc/">covered in an article I published</a> recently, but upon refreshing the page, it’s clear that the Iron Man reference has been removed.</p>



<p>Whether this was an editing mistake or something that shouldn’t have been revealed yet remains to be seen. In just a few days, GDC will kick off in San Francisco, and journalists will attend the summit to determine the truth of it.</p>



<p>Motive has been working on an Iron Man game since at least 2022, when we revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motives-iron-man-game-already-starts-playtesting/">playtests for the title</a> had already started. It has been relatively silent in terms of production updates since it was revealed, and even base imagery of the game hasn’t been revealed.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been a great time for superhero games of late, what with the collapse of Wonder Woman and the commercial failure of Suicide Squad, but that’s a problem for WB Games.</p>



<p>All we know so far is that Motive’s Iron Man will be a third-person, single-player title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/iron-man-unreal-engine-5/">built in Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>Are you interested in picking up Iron Man when it eventually materialises? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>EA has officially added microtransactions to Skate’s latest alpha. In an update message sent out to players, EA teased an “epic gameplay update” along with other “exciting” updates to the game. </p>



<p>One of those updates from developer Full Circle is the addition of microtransactions to the current Closed Alpha playtest. This, according to a message sent to players that has been provided to Insider Gaming. </p>



<p>Known as San Van Bucks, this in-game currency allows players to buy various cosmetic items. According to Full Circle, this is being added to make sure players have a “positive experience when purchasing items from the skate store.”</p>



<p>“To ensure we achieve these goals at Early Access we have enabled the option to purchase and use virtual currency (San Van Bucks) in our ongoing Closed Alpha playtest,” the message to players reads. “Your feedback will be greatly appreciated in providing a great experience at Early Access launch.”</p>



<p>Because the game is still in a playtesting state, it’s mentioned that account progress might be reset at times and will be fully reset before the launch into Early Access. Should you spend any money on San Van Bucks—and, in turn, on items—any purchases you make will be converted back to San Van Bucks and be made available again at the start of Early Access.</p>



<p>To make sure you get them, though, you have to use the same EA account for both playtesting and Early Access.</p>



<p>EA Skate is scheduled to release sometime in 2025. When it does, the game will be free-to-play on PC and console. The game is also expected to come to mobile.</p>
