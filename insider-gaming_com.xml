    <div>
        
<p>This Wednesday morning started with a nice surprise for PlayStation fans. Well, at least for some of them.</p>



<p>As highlighted by the X profile <strong><a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN">Genki_JPN</a></strong> (via <a href="https://x.com/chi_m02/status/1909784608733884842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chi_m02</a>), the company has initiated the distribution of animated backgrounds to a select group of users. These backgrounds are associated with various intellectual properties fans cherish, including Demon’s Souls, Days Gone, Ghost of Yotei, Astro Bot, and others.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that these backgrounds are related to the Welcome Page of the dashboard. They do not appear to be full themes like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-classic-themes-are-leaving-but-they-might-return-soon/">classic ones</a> released to celebrate the company’s 25th anniversary.</p>



<p>This feature has been a highly requested addition by PlayStation 5 owners, and indications suggest that PlayStation has finally heeded the desires of its fanbase by enabling the customization, despite some limitations, of the console’s background display.</p>



<p>The situation is a bit weird due to the lack of any official announcement from Sony at the company’s social profiles. Because of this, it remains unconfirmed whether this functionality is currently in a testing phase or if it is a feature that will be made available to all users throughout the course of this week.</p>



<p>What do you think about Sony releasing Animated PlayStation 5 Backgrounds for the welcome page? Tell us in the comments and join the discussion on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">forum</a>!</p>

<p>A new report about the Nintendo Switch 2 reveals how it compares to the other consoles in terms of third-party games, and the upcoming console seems comparable to the PS4.</p>



<h2 id="h-ps4-is-a-very-natural-point-of-comparison-for-the-switch-2">PS4 is a ‘Very Natural Point of Comparison for the Switch 2’</h2>



<p>During the latest Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DF Direct Weekly</a> episode, the hosts took a deep dive into the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct Stream. One segment of this episode focused on comparing cross-console games for the Nintendo Switch 2, including Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Hogwarts Legacy, and Elden Ring. After going through Final Fantasy 7 Remake, it was stated that the game on the Switch 2 looks “quite comparable to the PS4, if not a bit of a favourable experience relative to the PS4.”</p>



<p>After going through Hogwarts Legacy, it was stated that the upcoming Nintendo console provided much better image quality than the PS4. For Elden Ring, it was hard to compare as they didn’t receive any press assets, and the quality would drop down in a YouTube upload. However, they said the resolution is comparable to the PS4, and other settings look similar “if not better” than the PS4.</p>



<p>Overall, the “Switch 2 is doing a pretty great job of turning in PS4-level visuals,” possibly with other upgrades such as better loading times and advanced rendering technologies that modern titles have. They add, “It’s a pretty good showing for the Switch 2 so far,” and for these “PS4 class titles,” players can probably expect a “PS4 level” of experience.</p>

<p>We’re set for our first meaty look at The Outer Worlds 2 on June 8—courtesy of a Direct Showcase. We don’t know how long it will last, but it’s confirmed that the presentation will lift the lid on much of Obsidian’s sci-fi sequel.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/outer-worlds-spacers-choice-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds</a> was one of my favorite games of 2019. It included a lot of what I love about Fallout, but added its own shine and humor in a refreshing way! The Outer Worlds 2 being announced at The Game Awards 2024 was a pleasant surprise, and it had to come with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funny trailer</a> reminding us all what it’s about.</p>



<p>Obsidian has been quiet about The Outer Worlds 2 ever since. Its development, release, and support of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> likely had a lot to do with this. The Outer Worlds 2 Direct signals full-steam ahead for the successor.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase 2025</a> takes place on June 8. Soon after it finishes, we jump straight into The Outer Worlds 2 Direct.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-2025-outer-worlds-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a> newsletter said this on April 9: “Immediately following [Xbox Games] Showcase,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;Direct will bring you inside the walls of Obsidian Entertainment, revealing new gameplay, details, and developer insights, straight from the people making the sequel to the award-winning, first-person sci-fi RPG.</p>



<p>You can catch all the action through Xbox’s many channels, including YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and much more.</p>

<p>If something’s too good to be true, it usually is. The new Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera is the clear choice on paper. Having the prickly piranha next to your TV and Switch 2 is a dream, but its low-resolution image might taint the purchase.</p>



<p>Engagement with friends and family and social interconnectivity is huge in the Switch 2’s marketing. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> opened with a glorious package for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, and segued nicely into Switch 2 features such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-is-for-gamechat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C-Button</a> and using cameras to broadcast you in real-time to playing partners.</p>



<p>A line of official cameras can send an image of you to anyone you’re playing Switch 2 games with. The official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera looks professional, but the Piranha Plant Camera looks fun. However, there’s a drastic reduction in the latter’s camera resolution and quality.</p>

<p>The official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera outputs a solid <strong>1080p</strong>; on the other hand, the Piranha Plant Camera barely pushes out <strong>640×480</strong>.</p>



<p>It certainly explains the price difference between <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo</a>‘s two devices. You’re looking at <strong>$49.99/£49.99</strong> for the official camera and <strong>$43.99/£33.99</strong> for the Piranha Plant. Given that almost anything licensed costs more, there had to be a catch somewhere, making the Piranha Plant cheaper.</p>



<p>Now you have the answer. If you were planning on picking up a Switch 2 camera, think carefully about whether you choose quality or an unquestionably amazing design for a camera.</p>
