<p>The Haunted Masquerade in Overwatch 2 is the game’s latest Halloween event, bringing with it a new game mode, skins, and more content in a new season update.</p>



<p>While Overwatch was dealing with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/almost-half-of-players-who-quit-overwatch-jumped-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loss of players due to Marvel Rivals</a> about a year ago, the game has been making a resurgence with some great content updates, and this looks to be the latest.</p>



<p>Here is when the Haunted Masquerade starts in Overwatch 2 and all the content you can expect in it.</p>

<p><strong>The Haunted Masquerade Halloween event in Overwatch 2 begins on Tuesday, October 14, alongside the update to Season 19.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24232473/beware-a-haunted-masquerade-begins-in-season-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Season 19 in Overwatch 2</a> brings a bunch of Halloween content, like the Haunted Masquerade and the return of Junkenstein’s Revenge, as well as a mythic hero skin for Lifeweaver and a mythic weapon skin for Kiriko. For the first time, Junkrat will also receive a mythic hero skin when the midseason update happens in November.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-stadium-a-round-based-competitive-mode-that-borrows-from-deadlock-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Stadium mode</a> is getting three more heroes added to the mix in Hazard, Torbjorn, and Sojourn. Stadium is also getting a new shop item called gadgets that will help to turn the tide in your favor for battle.</p>



<p>Outside of that, you can expect the usual rotation of new skins and bundles in the shop themed around archangels and spirits.</p>

<p><strong>The Haunted Masquerade in Overwatch 2 is a limited-time mode that allows players to first select the hero they want to play and then choose a mask of a different hero in the spawn room to gain a special ability for that match.</strong></p>



<p>After you select your mask, your hero will instantly get a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-adds-ability-altering-perks-brings-back-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small perk power-up</a>. For example, putting on a Genji mask will give whatever hero you are playing a double jump, or Reaper’s mask will heal you slightly as you deal damage to enemies.</p>



<p>That’s not all, though, as masks have a little extra surprise if you and a team member select lore-appropriate heroes. For example, if your team has Mei and Juno and they have each other’s masks, their ultimates will combine, bringing in an Orbital Ray boost to your teammates, while also having Blizzard freeze enemies in range.</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-crossover-release-date-all-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch 2</a> Halloween event looks to be a chaotic arcade mode that you and your friends can play throughout October. Be sure to experiment with the masks that work best for your chosen heroes and have fun out there.</p>

<p>MachineGames posted a new 15th anniversary picture and, in it, showcases a new yet-to-be-announced game.</p>



<p>For 15 years, MachineGames has been crafting some of the best action FPS on the market. From the Nazi-killing bloodbath of Wolfenstein to the historic adventures of Indiana Jones, the team are masters of the craft. With last year’s release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-hands-on-previews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, fans have been waiting to see what’s next from the studio. Fortunately, we now know it is working on something new, thanks to a new celebratory post.</p>



<h2 id="h-machinegames-15th-anniversary-poster-shows-mysterious-next-game">MachineGames’ 15th Anniversary Poster Shows Mysterious Next Game</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/machinegames/status/1976685867235164308?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Twitter/X post</a>, MachineGames revealed a poster celebrating the studio’s 15th anniversary. All of the newest titles, like Wolfenstein: The New Order and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, are there. However, next to Indy is a blocked off box with a question mark. Seeing as Great Circle was the most recent, it seems MachinesGames is hinting it’s currently working on the studio’s next new title. Furthermore, as it’s on the 15th anniversary poster, we could find out what it is before the end of the year.</p>



<p>As for what the next game could be, it’s likely it’ll be either a new Wolfenstein or Indiana Jones. For Wolfenstein, the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/machinegames-new-wolfenstein-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed interest</a> in returning to the series in a recent documentary. With Indiana Jones, the massive success and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-indiana-jones-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push from Disney</a> may have the team invigorated to pick up his whip sooner than later. Still, it could be an entirely new project or IP, seeing as MachineGames has been doing franchise titles for a bit. Either way, it’s clear the studio is almost ready to share it’s next title and, if it’s anything like the others, it’s one to watch out for.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see what MachineGames’ new title is? What do you hope the new game will be? Wolfenstein? Indiana Jones? Something new for its anniversary? Let us know in the comments, forums, and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/5f4cvU6G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>
