<p>Bloober Team’s epic Silent Hill 2 remake smashed it out of the park on PS5 and PC. The title was a console exclusive for the PS5, but a new ESRB rating has revealed that the Silent Hill 2 remake is coming to Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p>



<p>It seems the Silent Hill 2 remake was potentially on a timed exclusivity agreement. This is the feeling as the horror remake has been rated by the ESRB for the “Xbox Series.” There’s still no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-switch-2-xbox-rumor-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch port</a> in the open, but the game’s console presence is about to become wider and more terrifying.</p>

<p>Poor James Sunderland, he has to relive his own personal trauma all over again on Xbox. On the plus side, it’s a nice Halloween treat for Xbox players who’ve upgraded to modern-gen hardware.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ESRB</a> website was updated on October 31 (of all dates) to show Silent Hill 2 being certified. The key difference this time is that it’s for “Xbox Series” platforms, and the news comes nearly a year after the PS5 and PC launches.</p>



<p>From what we can tell, nothing’s changed on the rating summary front. It’s still the same Mature 17+ rating, and features the same depraved content, the same gruesome and gory gameplay, and the same “Enemies with body parts sewn together.”</p>



<p>It doesn’t clarify when Silent Hill 2’s remake is coming to Xbox. We’ll have to wait for an official announcement in the future—maybe closer to The Game Awards?</p>



<p>For now, if you’re on Xbox and you haven’t played the second game’s exquisite remake, we advise you to get the sick bags on standby and have a nice supply of light bulbs at the ready, as playing this in the dark will mentally put you in Silent Hill while you’re trying to sleep!</p>



<p>Have you played the Silent Hill 2 remake? What do Xbox players have to look forward to?

<p>After achieving huge success in China, Sword of Justice is gearing up for a major global release, and we’ve got all the details on the title’s free-to-play status.</p>



<p>Sword of Justice is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sword-of-justice-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing on November 7</a> and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sword-of-justice-platforms-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively available on PC and mobile devices</a>, with no launch on console platforms like PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, but there is a huge platform to build upon after achieving over four million players in the first month of release in China.</p>



<p>If you’re considering Sword of Justice but want to know whether you have to splash out on the title, or if it’s available for free, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Completely free. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>

<p>The free-to-play business model has proven to be a big success if managed correctly, and Sword of Justice looks to have set itself perfectly after achieving vast success in its initial release in China—attracting over four million players in the first month of operating.</p>



<p>Similar success is expected across the rest of the world with the global launch on November 7, putting players in the forefront of a new adventure that offers over 100 hours of single-player content and optional PvP environments.</p>

<p>Sword of Justice is an MMORPG, with constant internet connection required and a dedicated account with the game in order to play, meaning you can’t just download the game and dive in without registering.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sword-of-justice-platforms-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-sword-of-justice-on-playstation-5-or-xbox-series-x-s-all-sword-of-justice-platforms-explained.1340131/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sword of Justice is gearing up for a big global launch after achieving huge success in China, and we’ve got all the platform details for the game ahead of release.</p>



<p>The MMORPG offers an in-depth story to enjoy, alongside PvP access and in-depth NPCs powered by AI, and is looking to build on its success in China, where it achieved over four million players in its first month.</p>



<p>If you want to know what platforms you can play Sword of Justice on, we’ve got all the important details.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-sword-of-justice-on-playstation-5">Is Sword of Justice on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No console yet. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Sword of Justice is not available on PlayStation 5 and is exclusive to PC and mobile devices.</strong></p>



<p>Sword of Justice was initially released in China on PC and mobile devices, and the doors are now opening to the rest of the world. However, console players will not be able to jump into the adventure as there is no upcoming PlayStation 5 release or any news about a port.</p>



<p>Given MMO games are much more popular on PC than they are on console, this shouldn’t be too surprising.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-sword-of-justice-on-xbox-series-x-s">Is Sword of Justice on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Sword of Justice is not available on Xbox Series X|S as it is a title exclusive to PC and mobile devices.</strong></p>



<p>Initially released in China on those platforms, Sword of Justice is now launching for the rest of the world, but the door remains shut for those on console, including Xbox Series X|S, as there is no details on any release on the platform.</p>



<p>While that could change in future, it’s unlikely to be on the immediate agenda.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-sword-of-justice-come-to-ps5-or-xbox-series-x-s">Will Sword of Justice Come to PS5 or Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Sword of Justice could release on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S in the future, but this is not guaranteed, and any release will likely be a long way off.</strong></p>



<p>Opening the doors to the rest of the world in Sword of Justice is a big step and will require ongoing support to sustain the player base and ensure there are no major server issues. Perfecting the experience will be top of the agenda.</p>



<p>Whether the door opens to a console release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later down the line remains to be seen but, in truth, there isn’t too much of a need for the title to make the move, as it should achieve huge success on its current platform.</p>



<p>Games like Wuthering Waves have shown you don’t need to release on console, with PC and mobile both offering more than enough access to players.</p>

<p>We may be into the final few months of 2025 already, but there is still a host of big releases coming up, including the global launch of the Chinese hit Sword of Justice—and we have all the release date details you need.</p>



<p>After achieving staggering success in China, where it became one of the highest-selling games, Sword of Justice is bringing the adventure to the rest of the world with a global launch across PC and mobile.</p>



<p>If you’ve got your eyes on Sword of Justice and want to know exactly when you can start playing, this guide has all the release date details.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-sword-of-justice-coming-out">When is Sword of Justice Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A new world awaits. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Sword of Justice is coming to PC and mobile devices on Friday, November 7, and is available for free, with monetization coming from optional cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>The game has already been a huge success in China, surpassing over 40 million players in the first month and more than 1.1 million pre-registrations on it’s first day, and anticipation for the global release is similarly high, with pre-registrations for the global launch being vast.</p>



<p>Offering over 100 hours of single-player story-driven content, with the outcome changing with your playstyle, a big lure of the game is AI-driven NPCs, expanding the dialogue options you will receive.</p>



<p>As ever, though, the exact time you can jump in depends on your location in the world, but we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-sword-of-justice-start-time">Do We Know The Sword of Justice Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Sword of Justice has a staggered release globally, releasing in the United States from 7:30 AM PT, and later in the morning elsewhere in the world.</strong></p>



<p>Theoretically, at least, this means that players in some locations, like Japan and Australia, will be able to jump into the game before others, but the game will launch for everyone in the morning of November 7 local time.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-sidekick-leak-shows-prices-will-be-the-same-as-collab-skins/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite announced that Sidekicks are coming next season, with the first drop in the upcoming Battle Pass followed by new additions to the Item Shop, but it appears they will have a heavy price.</p>



<p>Peels the banana dog will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured in The Simpsons-themed Battle Pass</a> from November 1, with subsequent releases including Lil’ Raptor, Spike, Flopsticks, Cuddle Team Jr, and Bonesy in the Item Shop from November 7.</p>



<p>Ahead of that launch, leakers have uncovered the prices for those in the Item Shop, and the hefty price point is causing a stir in the community.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-sidekicks-have-similar-prices-to-collab-skins">Fortnite Sidekicks Have Similar Prices to Collab Skins</h2>



<figure><figcaption>High price. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1984097137723109799/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked by ShiinaBR</a>, the prices for Sidekick in the Item Shop will range from 1,200 V-Bucks to 1,500 V-Bucks, the same price range that collab skins have in the shop.</p>



<p>Flopsticks, for example, is priced at 1,500 V-Bucks, a higher price than the 1,200 V-Bucks it costs for the original outfit, and the same price as the new Alien Xenomorph skin that released today.</p>



<p>The prices for the Sidekicks have attracted more controversy amid customization rules, which make some choices, like the color of a dog, permanent, and the same Sidekick will need to be purchased again to choose a different appearance. Styles, meanwhile, include clothing and similar items, which can be adjusted.</p>



<p>While Sidekicks could be included in the Battle Pass regularly moving forward, there is no guarantee this will happen, as the release of Kicks last year has been oriented around them being purchasable in the Item Shop and not as an earnable reward.</p>



<p>Prices could still be adjusted before release too, though usually leaks of this nature are accurate when it comes to upcoming releases.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is the Latest Game to Turn Its Back on ‘Call of Duty Skins’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-call-of-duty-skins/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-is-the-latest-game-to-turn-its-back-on-%E2%80%98call-of-duty-skins%E2%80%99.1340092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has been released and is being enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of gamers worldwide. It’s a gritty, post-apocalyptic extraction shooter with a beautiful aesthetic, rooted in retro-futurism and boasting sumptuous, semi-open-world environments. It also has extensive customization options, including skin bundles and outfits.</p>



<p>That opens the door to potentially introducing some bizarre costumes, but Embark Studios has firmly shut down that suggestion. Following the reluctance of EA DICE to add kooky skins to Battlefield 6, Embark has stressed that ‘Call of Duty’ style skins won’t find their way into ARC Raiders.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-ridiculous-skin-packs-for-arc-raiders">No Ridiculous Skin Packs for ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>Call of Duty faces regular ridicule for the skins and outfit bundles it offers players everywhere. From Nicki Minaj to a literal pigeon, and from Beavis and Butthead to Wubz, Call of Duty has featured some borderline bizarre skins over the years.</p>



<p>One of the leading concerns from fans of Battlefield 6 was that EA DICE (and associated studios) would follow a similar monetization path in the newly released first-person shooter. For now, the team is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-skins-are-being-adjusted-after-community-backlash/">keeping the creativity confined</a> to mostly realistic outfits, but fans are skeptical whether it’ll stay that way forever.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/skins-cosmetics-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a>, Embark Studios confirmed that ARC Raiders will follow a similar operating model, with the team avoiding the addition of inane skins that don’t match the game’s vibe.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have. It will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction.</p>



<p>I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting that we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit, but we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes a Santa Claus. That’s not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that’s kind of the line you can draw.</p>



<p>I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don’t know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly – <strong>I don’t think the novelty is worth the trade</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Black Ops 7 will be released in just two weeks, and the stranger skins have already started stacking up for the game. It’s part and parcel of the Call of Duty ecosystem these days, but that doesn’t mean fans aren’t actively complaining about all the silly skins being added to the games.</p>



<p>Hopefully, games like Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders will steer clear of irrelevant crossovers and celebrity skins.</p>



<p>Do you want ARC Raiders to have any insane skin collaborations? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>It has been claimed by a Halo leaker that both Halo 2 and Halo 3 are getting the remake treatment after Halo: Campaign Evolved drops. In a post on social media, ‘leaks_infinite’ claimed that a source informed them that both games are being remade and that they ‘will have sprint’.</p>



<p>It was also noted that the next Halo game to feature multiplayer will be Halo 7, but nothing more was shared on that front, aside from a note that the campaign and multiplayer will launch separately, as they did in Halo Infinite.</p>

<p>It was recently revealed by Halo Studios that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> is on the way. The news dropped as the Halo Championship Series came to a close for 2025, marking the end of Halo Infinite’s competitive lifecycle.</p>



<p>The team also revealed that, for the first time, Halo will come to PlayStation, with Campaign Evolved being released on PS5.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, a Halo leaker has made a fresh claim that both Halo 2 and Halo 3 are being remade, but neither will have multiplayer. It’s a claim that has been met with disappointment by some, as Halo 3’s multiplayer is where many gamers were introduced to the series, being as it was one of the most popular games on Xbox 360.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Halo 2 &amp; Halo 3 are being remade, yes they will have sprint. No multiplayer, only campaign. Full remakes.<br>Multiplayer is going to be Halo 7. <a href="https://t.co/gD8DNKLT3V">pic.twitter.com/gD8DNKLT3V</a></p>— Halo Leaks (@leaks_infinite) <a href="https://twitter.com/leaks_infinite/status/1983941972311339311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The leaker then threw in a little conjecture, suggesting that Halo Studios will use the performance of Halo: Campaign Evolved to ‘judge whether a Halo 2 and 3 remake would be viable’, which is a fair comment.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that all planned remakes will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>



<p>Do you think Halo 2 and Halo 3 should be remade <strong>with </strong>multiplayer? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
