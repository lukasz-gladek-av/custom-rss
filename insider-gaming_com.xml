<p>Insider Gaming has learned that a new game based on the Alien franchise is back in development.</p>



<p>According to sources, this new Alien title is a single-player arcade survival horror game that sees players trying to survive being aboard a decaying space station. They’ll have to evade a mix of xenomorphs and spec ops units in what was described to Insider Gaming as being “Shadow of Tomb Raider with xenomorphs” at its current stage.</p>







<p>The game, which has been in the works since at least 2020 under a variety of names and was even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first reported on</a> by Insider Gaming in November 2022. What was once codenamed “Marathon” and others that Insider Gaming promised not to share to protect sources, was believed to be dead for a few years. It had switched developers multiple times, but recent documents dated from earlier this year show that the current studio working on Alien is Eidos Montreal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to gameplay, its planned to have a mix of combat, platforming, and puzzles. Players will need to rely on stealth, resource management, and problem-solving, with puzzles ranging from repairing machinery to cracking codes. And during combat, enemies won’t just rush blindly. The AI is designed to adapt and react to whatever tactics you use.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Documents also show at least three characters in the game. The main character Aubrey is an engineer who has the ability to use items like grappling hooks and magnetic boots, among others. Another new character is Ryuzo who uses the space station as his fortress and is likely an antagonist of some sort. Finally, there’s Ripley 8. In the movies, she was famously played by Sigourney Weaver and there’s an internal hope that she could reprise her role for the game. That said, only a first approach has been made as of now with nothing set in stone.</p>







<p>The early budget for the game is less than $75 million, but it’s higher than the earlier budget of $30 million from a few years ago. It’s also slated for release in 2028 for all major platforms. However, it was emphasized that the game is still in “early development”, and that the date, along with other game details, could very well be changed. Sources say, though, that the state of the game is in a good place at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Eidos Montreal nor Embracer responded to multiple requests for comment on this story.</p>

<p>The best way to spread Holiday cheer is by playing Fortnite Winterfest 2025 loud for all to hear. If you’re staying up past your bedtime, eating milk and cookies to keep a lookout for Winterfest 2025 details, this guide can help.</p>



<p>Unless Epic Games decides everyone needs coal in their stockings this year, expect <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-suggest-overwatch-crossover-could-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> Winterfest 2025 to drop and get the community into the festive spirit. Like Santa, it comes once a year and delivers a bunch of fun gifts to enrich the Fortnite festive spirit!</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has gathered up the latest leaks and tidbits about Fortnite Winterfest 2025.</p>

<p><strong>It’s looking likely that Fortnite Winterfest 2025 will start the week of December 15, potentially launching as late as Friday, December 19.</strong></p>







<p>This is not a guarantee, and it’s simply using leaks and logic from previous Winterfest events. Firstly, HYPEX declared on December 10 that: “FORTNITE WINTERFEST 2025 STARTS NEXT WEEK.”</p>



<p>As of writing, today is Friday, and it’s looking unlikely that Winterfest 205 is dropping sadly. However, this would be in keeping with previous years, as Winterfest has never dropped before December 13—as it did in 2022.</p>



<p>Winterfest 2024 was the most recent incarnation, and it went live on December 20, 2024, which was the third Friday of the month. December 19 would be the third Friday of the month this year. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Winterfest does have a history of launching on different days throughout the week, though, so don’t rule it out starting a bit earlier.</p>

<p><strong>A Harry Potter collaboration is expected to be the main attraction for Fortnite’s Winterfest 2025 event and theme; the Cabin is expected to return, and there will be other Xmas-themed activities and a boss.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a lot to wrap and unpack this Christmas! Let’s start with Fortnite Winterfest 2025’s Harry Potter collaboration. Insider Gaming reported a while ago that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite and Harry Potter collab was coming soon</a>.</p>



<p>The official Fortnite account has posted about the expected collab: “Unlock the Chocolate Frog Back Bling before it hops away AND get ready for customizable Hogwarts house-themed Outfits in the Shop later this month!</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Something magical is brewing…</p><p>Unlock the Chocolate Frog Back Bling before it hops away AND get ready for customizable Hogwarts house-themed Outfits in the Shop later this month! <a href="https://t.co/dxU8F0don5">pic.twitter.com/dxU8F0don5</a></p></div>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1999359954533462056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In addition to this, Shiina (through <a href="https://x.com/itsmeleaky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@itsmeleaky</a> &amp; <a href="https://x.com/blortzen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@blortzen</a>) has revealed a leaked Winter Hatsune Miku skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Along with a Harry Potter skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you thought this was all, well, be prepared to have your Muggle mind blown with the reveal of more skins and a broom!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, another leak from <a href="https://x.com/FinnLeakss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Finn | Fortnite Leaks &amp; News</a> suggests a ‘Yule Trooper Boss’ is coming to cause trouble.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>NEW WINTERFEST 2025 DETAILS 🔥 </p><p>– Cabin Files Have Been Re-added, Expect Cabin To Return<br>– Christmas Tree &amp; Snowman Storm Shaped Activated (Non Competitive Modes)<br>– Yule Trooper Boss With Play As Boss Feature Enabled<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fortnite</a> <a href="https://t.co/VrgVcjTkIU">pic.twitter.com/VrgVcjTkIU</a></p></div>— Finn | Fortnite Leaks &amp; News (@FinnLeakss) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinnLeakss/status/1999062756834898307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>
