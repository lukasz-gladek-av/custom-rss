<p>Having the best meta guns will give you a huge advantage in Battlefield 6. At the very least, you’ll be able to compete with everyone else who is also using the best guns. We’ve got top weapons you should be using in Battlefield 6, along with the ideal loadouts to go with them.</p>



<p>If you’re not keeping on top of the ‘meta,’ you’re going to fall behind. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> features a vast array of guns, but selecting the right one for each class is crucial. You might love the AK4D, for example, but it’s not as good as the most elite assault rifle in BF 6.</p>



<p>We’ve put together the best meta guns and loadouts for the top weapon in each Battlefield 6 class.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Starting off strong. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The assault rifle category isn’t as strong as other classes in Battlefield 6. However, it looks like the <strong>M433 </strong>is the standard in the AR category and the bar that other assault rifles need to live up to.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Baker 3.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Double-Port Brake</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>M4A1 </strong>is currently the best Carbine—and potentially best weapon overall—in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>. An assault rifle usually ends up being the most dominant gun in FPS games. For us, there’s no question it’s the M4A1 Carbine that takes the crown instead. It fires well, hits hard, and this best loadout brings out its true potential.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Baker 3.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Standard Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 14.5″ Carbine</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>It’s the MP5, always will be. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>PW5A3</strong>—AKA the MP5, let’s face it—rules the roost where SMGs are concerned. It’s consistently appeared throughout the course of FPS gaming history, and it’s here in Battlefield 6. It outclasses every other SMG up close, and it’s also quite handy at mid-range as well. If you need a gun that rapidly chews through bullets and tears through opponents in smaller maps, look no further than the PW5A3.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Iron Sights</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Compensated Brake</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 245MM Custom</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 40RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Don’t sleep on this. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best <strong>DRS-IAR</strong> loadout is a strange one, as it doesn’t even feel like an LMG in some ways. Our Magazine attachment gives it fewer bullets than our PW5A3 class, for example. But it’s still a powerful gun that can be just as powerful as an AR, and then some. If you’re looking for a different type of weapon, you should consider the DRS-IAR.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> CCO 2.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Double-Port Brake</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 20″ SDM-R</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Alloy Vertical</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> Magwell Flare</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Boom. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you played the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, chances are you were blown away by it, by blown away, I mean blasted in the face repeatedly by the <strong>M87A1</strong> Shotgun. Its dominance and superiority have carried over into the full game, and there’s no question that the M87A1 is the Shotgun to use. It’s a one-shot weapon of mass destruction.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Iron Sights</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 20″ Factory</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Adjustable Angled</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 7 Shell Tube</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Flechette</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>King of Sniper Rifles. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 has a decent amount of medium-to-long-range maps. This allows Sniper Rifles to flourish, and if you fancy your chances as a precision marksman, you need the <strong>M2010 ESR</strong>. It’s flexible as both a quick-firing quickscope rifle, or can dominate at a distance. Our M2010 ESR loadout is the one we feel gets the most out of the weapon, but don’t be afraid to tinker with the slots here. You may want a suppressor, but we do not.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> SSDS 6.00X</li>



<li><strong>Optic Accessory:</strong> Anti-Glare Coating</li>



<li><strong>Left Accessory:</strong> Range Finder</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 26″ Carbon</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 8RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> DLC Bolt</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Match Grade</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a fan of both horror movies as well as old-school cartoon shows, then these Dandy’s World codes may well be worth your time.</p>



<p>Think of a Roblox game where you start in a building known as the Gardenview Center as a cartoon character, with the objective being to survive, while also collecting money to unlock new characters and solving puzzles to fix the broken elevator. Playable in a group of up to 8 players, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-prospecting-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Dandy’s World can be a rather scary experience, with scary monsters known as ‘Twisteds’ hunting the players down in every nook and cranny of the building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dandy’s World is a game where strategy and teamwork are of utmost importance, as various shocking and dark plot twists can happen with each playthrough. Dandy’s World players must also be on the lookout for Tickets and Trinkets, while Ichor is the main in-game currency, used to upgrade characters and their abilities. Although simply playing the game will grant players plenty of Ichor, using codes in Dandy’s World is a good way to boost the amount of currency you can get.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Redeeming these free rewards in Dandy’s World is a simple process that doesn’t require too much effort at all. For players who may be new to the Roblox environment, though, here’s a step-by-step guide that should make redeeming the Dandy’s World codes a cakewalk:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Dandy’s World.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Use Code’ option.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on ‘Use’ to instantly receive your rewards.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-dandy-s-world-codes">Where To Get More Dandy’s World Codes</h2>



<p>Although there is only one active code in the game right now, Dandy’s World is a game that’s known to release new codes whenever it achieves a major milestone or launches an update for the title. With this in mind, it’s safe to assume that more are on the horizon, and players simply have to wait patiently to get their hands on more free Dandy’s World rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best way to stay up to date with all the latest codes would be to simply bookmark this page and check back every now and then. We update this article as soon as new codes are dropped by the developers. This can save players from the hassle of having to manually go into the game’s socials and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/blushcrunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> each time to check if new codes have been released.&nbsp;</p>
