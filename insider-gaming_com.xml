<p>PlayStation have announced that Killzone content is returning to Helldivers 2, and this time, it’s here to stay. </p>



<p>Back in December 2024, Killzone made its first appearance in Helldivers 2 with two waves of crossover items that included weapons, armor sets, and cosmetics. The developers at Arrowhead have made it clear that they’ve heard the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-killzone-cosmetics-price-backlash-response-from-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan feedback regarding the pricing</a> and that the content will instead be re-released as a Premium Warbond. </p>

<p>Announced via the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">Pla</a><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ySta</a><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">tion Blog</a>, Arrowhead have confirmed that a fresh batch of Killzone-themed gear is on the way to Helldivers 2. For 1500 Super Credits, players will be able to unlock a Premium Warbond packed with iconic Killzone weapons, armor, and cosmetics—plus a collection of brand-new items that weren’t part of last year’s limited release.</p>



<p>Better still, Arrowhead are rewarding returning players. Anyone who <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-cosmetics-are-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously purchased any Killzone item</a>—even a single piece—will receive the full Killzone Legendary Warbond at no extra cost. All previously owned or gifted items will also be medal-unlocked, meaning players won’t need to spend medals to reclaim them and can instead focus on the new additions.</p>







<p>Here’s how eligibility works, as confirmed by PlayStation.</p>



<ul>
<li>Players who have previously purchased any (even one) of the Killzone items, will have the whole Helldivers 2 x Killzone Legendary Warbond unlocked at no extra cost! Additionally, there is no medal vacuum here! The items previously purchased (and those which were gifted last December) will be medal unlocked. So no need to spend medals on the items you already own!</li>



<li>Players who received the gifted items in December 2024 but didn’t pay for any single item, will have to pay the 1500 Super Credits to unlock the full Legendary Warbond.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Not to worry, if you do pay for the Warbond; the gifted items will also be medal unlocked.</li>



<li>Players joining after the Helldivers 2 x Killzone items left the store in December 2024 can access the Warbond by unlocking it for 1500 SC, and then enjoy redeeming medals on their favorite items just as usual.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Premium Warbond includes every item from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/second-wave-helldivers-2-killzone-2-crossover-content-will-be-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two waves of Killzone X Helldivers 2 content</a>, as well as a list of new items, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>StA-52 Assault Rifle</li>



<li>StA-11 SMG</li>



<li>PLAS-39 Accelerator rifle</li>



<li>AC-1 Dutiful/The Strength In Our Arms cape</li>



<li>AC-2 Obedient/Defender of Our Dream cape</li>



<li>Acclimated Passive</li>



<li>Extrasolar Ash patterns</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re a fan of either franchise, then now’s a great time to hop back into Helldivers 2. Will you be checking out the new Premium Warbond? Share your thoughts in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>. </p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077’s lead writer has stated that the team understood during the game’s pre-production that Night City would be the main antagonist, confirming the age-old fan theory.</p>



<p>The main attraction of Cyberpunk 2077 has always been Night City, which is not only a dense open-world that will keep you engaged the entire journey, but also an all-knowing and all-seeing entity that sells people big dreams, but they always come with massive repercussions. Now, a lead writer has confirmed that Night City is indeed the true villain of Cyberpunk 2077. </p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-always-night-city-versus-everyone-else-in-cyberpunk-2077">It’s Always ‘Night City Versus Everyone Else’ in Cyberpunk 2077</h2>



<p>For some time, players have theorised that Night City is the main character and antagonist in Cyberpunk 2077, and this post on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1aeuz79/v_is_not_the_main_character_my_simple_theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cyberpunkgame</a> explains it quite well. During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/5-years-on-from-cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-reveals-why-making-night-city-the-main-antagonist-created-an-irresistible-rpg-exploring-the-darker-side-of-human-nature-is-exciting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Cyberpunk 2077’s lead writer, Tomasz Marchewka, confirmed, “Quite quickly, during pre-production of Cyberpunk 2077, we realized that Night City is going to be our main antagonist.”</p>



<p>Marchewka acknowledged that some players had caught on quite quickly and asked about it. The game also features other antagonists, such as Arasaka, Adam Smasher, and others. However, it has always been “Night City versus everyone else, even the big guys. So yeah, that’s a cool concept to make the city the main antagonist,” explained the lead writer.</p>



<p>Igor Sarzynski, the cinematic director, also explained why players might find this world so compelling, stating that for him it was always finding the balance between “subtle, personal, human, and emotional elements – things that are fragile and touching and invite compassion – versus what you mention: the danger, the violence.” </p>



<p>“Everything that forces you to put on armor, literal or emotional, and protect yourself, fight for survival. Night City exists right on the edge of those realms, between beauty and bloodshed, and so you’re never bored; you always think that&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;the next dream will come true,” Sarzynski added. </p>







<p>In other news, the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will feature a city that feels like ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-city-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Gone Wrong</a>‘. Additionally, CD Projekt Red and WierdCo have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-tcg-announced-by-cdpr-and-wierdco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> Cyberpunk TCG.

<p>Arrowhead’s CCO has stated that they have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode for Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 has been receiving a whole lot of updates recently, focusing on performance and optimisation. Most recently, the developers made significant progress in reducing the PC file size, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-pc-file-size-reduced-by-85-slim-version-now-available-in-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing it down by 85%</a>.

No other details about this game mode were revealed. </p>



<p>Pilestedt has been providing a lot of Helldivers 2 details on X recently.

Any hot takes? When asked where it will take 3 years to deliver these arcs, Pilestedt responded, stating they will “deliver a bit more often than that” moreso now as they are “in a better technical space”. </p>

<p>A new 007 First Light leak has revealed that Grammy-winning musician Lenny Kravitz will be playing a villain called Bawma in the upcoming game. </p>



<p>007 First Light developers recently showcased new gameplay to the players with insights from the gameplay director and the senior level designer.
