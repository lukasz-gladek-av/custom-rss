<p>Splitgate 2, which was recently rebranded as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, has been having a fairly tough time of late. The game was relaunched after being pulled back to beta following a hampered and relatively disastrous summer release, but the second wind has failed to generate much traction.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Splitgate developers at 1047 Games addressed the ongoing discourse around the game’s lack of success, which typically relies on Steam player numbers to frame a picture of the game’s struggles.</p>



<p>The developers are saying, as many have before, that Steam’s player numbers aren’t indicative of the bigger picture.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-rely-on-steam-to-get-your-consensus">Don’t Rely on Steam to Get Your Consensus</h2>



<p>In a recent post on social media damning the discourse around Splitgate: Arena Reloaded’s inability to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-failed-secure-traction-fumbled-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generate any hype</a> the second time around, <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the team said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Steam Charts don’t measure fun.</p>



<p>They show one number, one one platform, at one given moment. They don’t show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don’t capture the community that’s actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).</p>



<p>Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible.</p>



<p>To our amazing community: thank you. Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day.</p>



<p>And to everyone who hasn’t played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For reference, here’s what the Steam Charts look like for Splitgate: Arena Reloaded at the time of writing:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This statement comes months after Splitgate 2’s sentiments plummeted around a miserable launch and a marketing campaign that fell flat in a pretty spectacular way. There were concerns about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-drops-fans-concerned-microtransactions/">microtransactions</a> and bold statements made by the 1047 leadership team, and on two occasions, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developer-holds-another-round-of-layoffs/">layoffs were made</a> that further damaged the company’s PR image.</p>



<p>Even the game’s paid influencer campaign came under fire, with one analyst labelling the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-analysis-condemns-tone-deaf-influencer-campaign/">effort ‘tone deaf’</a> and stressing that it ‘alienated its core audience in pursuit of mainstream appeal.’</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a potential hit, zombie indie game, then you might want to start preparing yourself for the Quarantine Zone: The Last Check release date. By preparing yourself, this means ensuring you’re free of zombie bites.</p>



<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check infuses the infectious (no pun intended) eye for detail of Papers, Please, and the typical survivalist qualities of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-indie-games-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indie</a> survival horror rolled into one. One second, you’re scanning survivors for the slightest sign of a bite, the next, you’re desperately defending yourself from a horde of undead.</p>



<p>If you’re currently free of quarantine right now (even if you’re not, no one will tell), check out the game’s launch day.</p>

<p><strong>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check has an official January 12 release date exclusively on PC systems.</strong></p>



<p>Closed playtests have come and gone, which means it’s time for the full launch. Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is one of the most-hyped Steam games in January, and with the month not bubbling in terms of AAA releases, it could be time for an indie game to get the huge boost it deserves.</p>



<p>Its game mechanics and fundamentals seem safe and secure, so unless there are any late breaches, you can look forward to a post-Christmas plague party to pile hours into.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-have-a-demo">Does Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Have A Demo?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A caged animal. Credit to Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is a free-to-play Quarantine Zone: The Last Check demo that you can download and play right now on Steam.</strong></p>



<p>It’s always safer to try before you buy. Thankfully, Brigada Games and Devolver Digital are more than happy to oblige, courtesy of The Last Check’s free Steam demo.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick explainer on how to acquire it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Steam</a> page.</li>



<li>Scroll down until you see a big, green box saying <strong>Download Quarantine Zone: The Last Check Demo</strong>.</li>



<li>Click <strong>Download</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose <strong>Install</strong>.</li>



<li>As long as you have the 21 GB required, it should download and install itself on the system.</li>



<li>Once ready, you can try out the free Download Quarantine Zone: The Last Check demo!</li>
</ol>



<p>Again, there’s a lot of interest in The Last Check, but it doesn’t hurt to have one ‘last check’ to see if it’s for you or not.</p>
