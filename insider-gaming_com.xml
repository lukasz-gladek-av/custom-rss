<p>Raven Software revealed a plan to prevent players from ruining the experience for others in Warzone Casual. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-black-ops-6-april-11-update-patch-notes-dragon-breath-shotguns-removed-shattered-veil-boss-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> Season 3 marks the long-awaited return of the battle royale’s original map, Verdansk. So, For many who have flocked back, this is the first time they have played the battle royale in months, if not years. To help ease players back in, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-out-of-warzone-bootcamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Bootcamp</a> is a refresher and shows you the ropes. </p>



<p>Once players are ready for real action but aren’t quite prepared for a standard battle royale match, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Casual</a> is a new game mode with <strong>28 real players</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>120 bots</strong>. As the name suggests, the game mode caters to casual players, and Raven Software wants to keep it that way. </p>

<p><strong>In an interview with&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>IGN</strong></a><strong>, Raven Software’s Warzone game director, Pete Actipis,</strong> <strong>assured players that the devs will take action if Warzone Casual no longer lives up to the name. </strong></p>



<p>“The whole spirit of the Casual mode was to give people that were scared about getting into a time commitment or a game commitment or a skill commitment with Warzone, but do it on their terms,” Actipis said. “So if we see sweats come in there wrecking the whole server, then we will have to come up with plans against that.” </p>



<p>Actipis did not reveal how the team plans to prevent it from becoming an issue, but Casual mode fans can rest easy knowing that Raven Software is aware of it. </p>

<p>Sanfall Interactive’s debut project,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>, is set in a universe centered around a paintress. Every year, she paints a descending number on a monolith, and people of that age turn to smoke and fade away. </p>



<p>Other expedition groups have tried and failed in the past to stop the paintress. Yet, before she can paint 33, another team sets out to finally end her reign of terror and save the rest of humanity. Without further ado, let’s look at who voices each expedition member. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-voice-actors-in-clair-obscur-expedition-33">All Voice Actors in Clair Obscur Expedition 33</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Renoir is one of the leading figures in Expedition 33. Image via Sandfall Interactive </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Clair Obscur Expedition 33</strong> <strong>has 10 voice actors for the English cast.  </strong></p>



<p>The Expedition 33 team features five primary characters, each with a role. Gustave is the group’s lead engineer, and Lune is the expedition’s chief researcher. In addition, <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/meet-our-english-voice-cast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sandfall Interactive</a> revealed five supporting characters with a mix of friends and foes added to the mix. </p>



<p>You can check out every actor and who they play in Clair Obscur Expedition 33 below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Split Fiction Voice Actor</th><th>Character Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Charlie Cox&nbsp;</td><td>Gustave</td></tr><tr><td>Andy Serkis </td><td>Renoir </td></tr><tr><td>Jennifer English </td><td>Maelle </td></tr><tr><td>Kirsty Rider </td><td>Lune </td></tr><tr><td>Shala Nyx </td><td>Sciel </td></tr><tr><td>Ben Starr </td><td>Verso </td></tr><tr><td>Rich Keeble </td><td>N/A </td></tr><tr><td>Maxence Cazorla </td><td>N/A </td></tr><tr><td>Devora Wilde </td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Tracy Wiles </td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Marvel fans will be familiar with Charlie Cox and Andy Serkis. Cox famously portrayed Matt Murdock in Daredevil and recently reprised the lead role in Daredevil: Born Again. Meanwhile, Serkis was Ulysses Klaue in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and appeared in Avengers: Age of Ultron and Black Panther. </p>



<p>Serkis is known for his iconic voice work as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Caesar in the Planet of the Apes series. He also portrayed Alfred Pennyworth in The Batman. In addition, Serkis portrayed Kino Loy in Andor and Snoke in the Star Wars sequel trilogy themes. </p>



<p>Sandfall Interactive also recruited several veterans from the video game industry. Ben Starr is known for his role as Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy XVI, and Jennifer English was in Baldurs Gate 3 and Elden Ring. </p>



<p>When asked about the role in an interview with <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/meet-our-english-voice-cast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sandfall Interactive</a>, Starr said, “It was so appealing to be able to explore his subtle yet simmering dramatic inner life with the amount of freedom that the Sandfall team gave me.”</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;time-to-kill&nbsp;in&nbsp;Call of Duty&nbsp;refers to the time it takes for a weapon to kill an opponent. Some fans have argued that TTK speeds are too fast on Verdansk, and Raven Software addressed those concerns. </p>



<p>To give you a good idea of how fast TTK speeds are in Warzone Season 3, The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cr-56-amax-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CR-56 AMAX</a> is arguably the best long-range meta weapon and has a 570-millisecond TTK, meaning you can consistently take down enemies in three to four shots up to around 25 meters. </p>



<p>For close-range engagements, players discovered that the 12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath Ammunition broke the MX Guardian and gave it a 280 ms TTK up to 10 meters, which is significantly faster than ever other weapon. The devs took notice and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-black-ops-6-april-11-update-patch-notes-dragon-breath-shotguns-removed-shattered-veil-boss-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the attachment</a>, but there are still concerns about weapons eliminating enemies too fast. Raven Software cleared the air on that subject. </p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-devs-explain-why-the-ttk-is-fast-on-verdansk">Warzone Devs Explain Why The TTK is Fast on Verdansk</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Weapons aren’t the only danger in Verdansk in Warzone. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><span><strong>In an interview with&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>IGN</strong></a><strong>, Raven Software’s Warzone game director, Pete Actipis,</strong>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>admitted that TTK speeds are faster on Urzikstan and that the design choice was intentional</span>.</strong> </p>



<p>“Comparatively to last year, the Urzikstan year, it is a faster TTK,” <span>Actipis</span> said. It’s pretty equivalent – I don’t know the exact numbers offhand – but the original experience and what we wanted to go back for now was make it more of a casual, friendly kind of, ‘if I’m not good at hitting straight shots, I have an opportunity, I’m not going to get destroyed every gun battle.’ There’s also a lot more excitement, like, ‘Oh, I have an opportunity to get a kill.”</p>



<p>Making the Warzone TTK speed fast comes at the expense of higher-skilled players because even if the enemy misses shots or isn’t as accurate as them, needing fewer shots to kill covers up that inaccuracy. So, in many cases, winning and losing a gunfight comes down to being in a better position and seeing the enemy first rather than pure gun skill. </p>



<p>And Raven Software currently doesn’t have any plans to change that formula. </p>



<p>“We like right now where the TTK sits,” <span>Actipis</span> argued. “We will evaluate as the game progresses and see what our fans think.” “But right now, it seems like people are enjoying it.” </p>

<p>In the interview with IGN, Raven Software also provided an update on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-devs-provide-update-on-how-long-verdansk-will-stay-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future of Verdansk</a> and said that this map is the ‘starting point’ for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-devs-warzone-starting-point-verdansk-revival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone revival</a>. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/has-bungie-already-done-everything-wrong-with-marathon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/has-bungie-already-done-everything-wrong-with-marathon.1164135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/has-bungie-already-done-everything-wrong-with-marathon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie has officially revealed Marathon, uncovering the core gameplay loop, operating model, and narrative concept. It’s a somewhat traditional extraction shooter that’s going to try to disrupt the genre by introducing unique social mechanics and an original art style that has started turning heads in the gaming space.</p>



<p>However, many have already written off Marathon, pointing out glaring flaws in the game’s reveal and the news and rumours that followed. It’s bold enough to try breaking into the extraction genre, but to do it with so many risky choices sitting front-and-centre is downright ballsy – or foolish.</p>



<p>Has Bungie already done everything wrong with Marathon?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-marathon">What’s Wrong with Marathon?</h2>



<p>As a <strong>game</strong>, Marathon looks just fine. The combat mechanics look entertaining, the impressions built off preview sessions are strong, and it’s backed by Bungie, a big-name, big-budget studio. But that’s the tip of the iceberg, and when you start digging deeper, the flaws surface quite rapidly.</p>



<p>Firstly, extraction shooters <strong>rarely survive</strong> in the open market. Escape from Tarkov is the only extraction game to have remained consistent over the years, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-will-compete-with-other-extraction-shooters-by-not-competing-interview/">Russian shooter’s market cap</a> is nothing short of overwhelming for newcomers.</p>



<p>It can also be argued that Bungie is late to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-explains-why-marathon-is-an-extraction-shooter/">the extraction shooter boom</a> with Marathon, but other developers are still <strong>trying </strong>to crack that nut. It’s battle royale games all over again, but more of <strong>those </strong>have survived their uptick than the smattering of extraction shooters that appeared in recent years.</p>



<p>It was revealed that Marathon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-marathon-be-free-to-play-pricing-explained/">will be a premium title</a> with a moderate price tag, which many have suggested is the wrong foot forward for Bungie. It has been said that ‘a game like this’ should be free-to-play with microtransaction support, and I’m inclined to agree. It’s hard to land sales for a game like this, given that it’s a niche genre and a never-before-seen IP (if we ignore the original game that debuted in 1994).</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvJIQoWIQP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>On the subject of release, Marathon is contending with another big-budget first-person shooter, releasing on <strong>the same day as Borderlands 4</strong>. That game already has millions of fans around the world, and Borderlands is nothing if not loaded with quirks and a similarly unique art style, which could mean it’ll already outpace Marathon with ease.</p>



<p>The cacophony of mechanics and features wrapped up in Marathon are great, but it’s an overly complex way to present the extraction shooter genre, which at heart, is quite simple. You load up, you run a map, and you leave again – that’s it. Despite claiming to be super accessible, Marathon might be doing the opposite by putting up a convoluted learning curve.</p>



<p>With <strong>that </strong>being said, it’s too much of an arcade game for the hardcore extraction fans, and it’s likely too challenging for arcade shooter fans, so what exactly is Marathon’s target market? </p>



<p>I’m all game to give it a try, and I’ll go in with an open mind, but I’m worried about Marathon. It has been years in development at Bungie, and I just don’t want the team to fall flat with the project when it hits the market.</p>



<p>We’ll know more soon – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-access-marathon-alpha-closed-guide/">the closed alpha is on the way</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cod-devs-warzone-starting-point-verdansk-revival/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Verdansk has been turning heads since it returned to Call of Duty: Warzone almost two weeks ago. It saw player counts and viewership figures skyrocket to highs that hadn’t been seen for years, and it became the talk of the town far and wide. It was playing heavily into the nostalgia stakes, but that’s just what Warzone needed.</p>



<p>In a follow-up interview after the release of Verdansk (which hasn’t been seen since 2021), Activision’s developers spoke about the future of the battle royale platform. They’re insistent that Verdansk’s immediate success is ‘the starting point’ for a revival (or evolution) of Warzone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-inevitable-evolution">Inevitable Evolution</h2>



<p>Warzone was in a sticky spot before Verdansk came along. The game was tired, plagued by cheaters, and relatively unstable, but the sheer nostalgia value alone of Verdansk was enough to bring millions of players back. Activision went <strong>hard </strong>on the marketing campaign to make sure everyone knew the iconic map was coming back, and it has been a smash hit return thus far.</p>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, Pete Actipis, Raven Software’s game director working on Warzone, explained how this is the kick-off point for a grand evolution:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It has been pretty successful, and I think you can tell in the experience, right?</p>



<p>Like Etienne (Pouliot) said, we recreated Verdansk to be the best experience possible. But then we didn’t stop there.</p>



<p><strong>This is the starting point</strong>. It is not an anomaly for where Warzone is going.</p>



<p>We were very careful with crafting this experience this season, and the data is showing us that <strong>it’s been really successful and we just hope to keep that momentum going </strong>into the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also spoke about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battle-royale-multiplayer-casual-mode-where/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale Casual</a>, a new mode added alongside Verdansk that gives players a much lighter experience in Warzone. It’s not just here to stay but to <strong>grow </strong>as a mode:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The nice thing about this is, this is the first (revision) of it. It just went live and we’re going to look at the data, we’re going to evolve it over time to make sure it retains the design principles and spirit that we wanted it to have.</p>



<p>It’s still pretty new right now. I think it’s still giving players what they need in it right now, and we’ll just keep monitoring and evolving it. It’s a fun mode.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There was talk in the interview about the future of Verdansk’s narratives, which some eagle-eyed players have started picking up clues about in recent days. There is plenty of lore surrounding Verdansk, which unravelled across a couple of iterations a few years ago.</p>

<p>Verdansk returning to Warzone is a massive success story, but there is always the fear that the map will be removed or replaced in the rotation. Raven Software alleviated those concerns. </p>



<p>Caldera replaced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-prison-safe-locations-in-warzone-verdansk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> as the primary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/corsair-warzone-range-single-keycap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> map in December 2021 after a remarkable run that almost lasted two years. Since then, battle royale maps have typically been replaced after two years. For example, Caldera and Urzikstan survived two years before being shut down. </p>



<p>Al Mazrah was a rare exception and only made it one year. Verdansk is an interesting case, as the map launched in April, which is deep into the Black Ops 6 life cycle.<span> So, since&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-black-ops-7-details-have-been-leaked-by-a-playtester/" target="_blank">Black Ops 7</a>&nbsp;is coming soon, fans don’t know what that me</span>ans for Verdansk’s future. </p>

So for the time being, Verdansk is sticking around, and this is just the beginning of the Verdansk 2025 journey, and then we’ll see how things go from there.”</p>



<p>This will be reassuring news to fans who have enjoyed Verdansk so far, and the success is undeniable.
