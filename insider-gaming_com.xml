<p>Wonder Weapons are bonafide difference makers in Black Ops 6 Zombies—and most installments of game mode. Some classic Wonder Weapons return, but there is also some fresh blood added to the mix, making for both a familiar and refreshing Zombies experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a fun and fresh Campaign, another exhilarating multiplayer marathon to embark on, and the return of Zombies. It’s proper Zombies though: Round-based, Easter Eggs, different maps, and Wonder Weapons.</p>



<p>As usual, Wonder Weapons are quite hard to get in Black Ops 6. But when you get one, the feeling is unmatched, and they’re well worth trying to track down.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-wonder-weapons-are-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How many Wonder Weapons are in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Zombies currently has <strong>four Wonder Weapons</strong>: The Ray Gun, Beamsmasher, Thrustodyne Model 23 AKA Jet Gun, and the Wunderwaffe DG-2.</p>



<p>You might recognize the Ray Gun, Thrustodyne Model 23, and Wunderwaffe, but give a warm, undead welcome to the <strong>Beamsmasher</strong>—a new, mega-powerful weapon of mass destruction.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-wonder-weapon-in-black-ops-6">Every Wonder Weapon in Black Ops 6</h2>



<h3 id="h-ray-gun">Ray Gun</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hello, old friend. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Ray Gun is surely bound for the gaming Hall of Fame as it’s one of the best weapons in history. Its design is iconic, and the engineering is likely complex, but the end result is a satisfying, striking, nuclear bolt of deadly energy. It’s akin to classic alien death rays from B-movies of a bygone era, but it still works in 2024—trying to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-ray-gun-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get a Ray Gun in Black Ops 6 Zombies</a> is as tough as ever though.</p>



<h3 id="h-beamsmasher">Beamsmasher</h3>



<figure><figcaption>No-nonsense death beam. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As far as I’m aware, the Beamsmasher can only be obtained on the Terminus Zombies map—so bear this in mind when you’re trying to obtain one. Other than this, there’s not much else to say about the Beamsmasher that the above screenshot doesn’t already tell you about the new toy. It fires a single, devastating, zombie-eviscerating beam and is great for concentrating on bringing down Elite Zombies.</p>



<h3 id="h-thrustodyne-model-23-jet-gun">Thrustodyne Model 23 / Jet Gun</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s obnoxiously big, and I love it. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I would say “Thrustodyne Model 23” doesn’t quite roll off the tongue like “Jet Gun” does—so I’m going to refer to it as the latter. The Jet Gun gives off an evil cartoon vibe (you can’t tell me those dials aren’t deliberately evil-looking eyes) and it’s making its first appearance since its debut in Black Ops 2. It sucks up Zombies and recycles them into a fine paste—and I feel it delights in doing so. </p>



<h3 id="h-wunderwaffe-dg-2">Wunderwaffe DG-2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A classic returns. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, another legendary Wonder Weapon comes back with a vengeance, and it’s none other than the Wunderwaffe DG-2. Apart from the Ray Gun, the Wunderwaffe DG-2 has featured about as much as any Wonder Weapon down the years, and Black Ops 6 is very accommodating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-wonder-weapon-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Wonder Weapon in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>There are various ways to get Wonder Weapons in Black Ops 6 Zombies: Get lucky with the <strong>Mystery Box</strong>, get them as loot from <strong>Armory Lockers or Safety Deposit Boxes</strong>, use <strong>Legendary Gobblegums</strong> for lucrative rolls, and you can also <strong>craft the Beamsmasher</strong>.</p>



<p>Using 950 Points on the Mystery Box is the easiest way to get a Wonder Weapon—and the odds increase the higher the round count you reach—in Black Ops 6 Zombies. You can also secure Loot Keys from Elite Enemies and open Lockers and Safety Deposit Boxes to see if they contain a Wonder Weapon.</p>



<p>Furthermore, certain Gobblegums can reroll Mystery Box drops—the Wonderbar! Gobblegum guarantees a Wonder Weapon—and the Beamsmasher can be crafted.</p>

<p>Obbe Vermeij, former Rockstar developer and sharer of secrets, has revealed an intriguing tidbit about Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the game’s 20th anniversary. The developer – who still works in the industry today – is known far and wide across social media for his insights and behind-the-scenes glimpses at the development of many Grand Theft Auto games.</p>



<p>His latest factoid about San Andreas is pretty interesting, and it comes as the game celebrates a major milestone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-20-years-as-the-goat">20 Years as the GOAT</h2>



<p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is considered one of the best games of all time. It’s a memorable, expansive adventure that took players across a series of cities that made up ‘San Andreas’. It was one of the games that defined a generation, and for Rockstar, it was a dizzying success that served as a benchmark for things to come.</p>



<p>Recently, Obbe Vermeij, who worked on GTA 3, GTA Vice City, San Andreas, and GTA IV, took to social media to reflect on twenty years of San Andreas history.</p>



<p>He wrote that the original plan was to have the game map split up into three separate portions, only reachable by inter-city travel made up of trains and planes. This would enable the team to circumvent ‘tight’ memory restrictions, and it would be easier to differentiate between separate assets needed to make each city feel unique.</p>



<p>In the end, an executive meeting at Rockstar North changed the path of history and settled on one huge map that was tougher to develop but much more impressive overall.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>20 years ago we released Grand Theft Auto – San Andreas.</p><p>The original plan was for the 3 cities to be on separate maps. The player would travel between the cities using trains and planes.<br>(Gta 1 and 2 also had three cities on separate maps)</p><p>Memory was very tight on the ps2 and… <a href="https://t.co/kUMxR9Kt96">pic.twitter.com/kUMxR9Kt96</a></p></div>— Obbe Vermeij (@ObbeVermeij) <a href="https://twitter.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1849940437596787037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Vermeij then went on to reminisce about midnight launches and how impressive it was that San Andreas pulled in such massive crowds before the internet and social media allowed developers and publishers to generate much of a buzz.</p>



<p>Back then, it would have been a couple of TV spots, a trailer or two, and perhaps an article here and there in a magazine or one of the few websites around at the time:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The internet was crap and apart from a couple of trailers, gamers didn’t know too much about the game. </p>



<p>I went to the biggest store near the R*North offices, which was HMV on Princess Street, Edinburgh. Even though it was a drizzly night, the line meandered all through the store and spilled out onto the street.</p>



<p>It was mind-blowing to see all those people so excited, going home to play the game all through the night.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA: San Andreas was my first ‘launch day game’ back in 2004, and I poured thousands of hours into it over the years that followed. It’s a masterpiece, and it’ll always have a place in my heart.</p>

<p>The US Copyright Office has determined that it <strong>will not </strong>alter existing DMCA rules to allow for the preservation of video games in repositories and archives across the country. This news comes following a three-year battle by the Video Game History Foundation to desperately find a path to preservation for games that are in danger of being lost forever.</p>



<p>Previously, the organisation revealed that around 87% of all games released before 2010 are ‘virtually inaccessible’ owing to changes in technology, consumer habits, retail operating models, and the simple passing of time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-remember-them">Remember Them</h2>



<p>Many gamers appreciate a blast from the past – it’s why some games do so well when they are remade, or when modern variants introduce elements from past releases.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG, I’m looking at you.</p>



<p>If we go beyond that and look at <strong>true </strong>nostalgia – retro gaming – we enter a vast world filled with consoles, games, and peripherals from yesteryear, all of which are steadily falling into an abyss due to a lack of <strong>official preservation practices</strong>. While books, movies, music, and the like are all preserved under DMCA law, video games have never fallen into a legitimate category.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-24563.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the retort</a> published by the US Copyright Office, which leant on comments made by the Entertainment Software Association, it was said that the petition from the VGHF was kicked because they:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>… did not propose a clear requirement to know who the users are or why they want to access a game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier, the ESA said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Enabling widespread remote access to preserved games with minimal supervision would present a serious risk to an important market.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Video Game History Foundation insists it’s not finished with its crusade, but the rules are relatively black and white right now. In an ideal world, a digital repository of archived games would exist for users to check them out and access their contents through emulation platforms, but it admittedly becomes quite hard to police who is accessing them, and when, and <strong>where</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you think video games need to be preserved in this way, or should the retro collector market be enough to suffice? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
