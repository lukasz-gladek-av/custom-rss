<p>It seems Ubisoft could be gearing up for an announcement of The Division: Definitive Edition, as a banner has surfaced in Japan. </p>



<p>The Division franchise seems to be progressing well, with Ubisoft’s Julian Gerighty stating that The Division 3 is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shaping up to be a monster</a>” and thinks it could have as significant an impact as the first game in the series. Talking about the first game, it seems there still might be something in store for us for Division 1 in 2026. </p>











<p><span>Spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/domen0204" target="_blank">domen0204</a>&nbsp;on X (formerly Twitter), a banner for The Division: Definitive Edition was spotted at the FPS Day X event in Japan recently, with many hoping that the developers will finally provide an official announcement during its 10th Anniversary celebrations.</span> Additionally, we received some new announcements for The Division 2, with the developers confirming a ‘Realism mode’ coming in March 2026. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-division-2-s-realism-mode">The Division 2’s Realism Mode</h2>



<p>The Division 2’s ‘Realism mode’ will feature action-focused gameplay, reduced time-to-kill, and realistic weapon damage based on bullet caliber, allowing players to immerse themselves in the game in a brand-new way. Additionally, the mode will also introduce reduced UI, limited HUD, no health regeneration, reduced cool-down, and more. The devs also confirmed this is only the “first glimpses of the celebrations ahead,” with “more surprises” to come. </p>

<p>Stellar Blade developers seem to be living the life we all want, as they have been given over $3,000 in cash and Apple products as a New Year’s Bonus. </p>



<p>Shift Up knows how to treat its employees and keep them motivated through frequent bonuses awarded on major milestones and other occasions. For last year’s New Year’s Eve, the developers were given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-employees-receive-ps5-pros-and-a-cash-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5 Pros</a> and a cash bonus. This time, Shift Up has returned with another set of goodies for the employees. </p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-devs-were-gifted-cash-and-apple-products-for-new-year-s">Stellar Blade Devs Were Gifted Cash and Apple Products for New Year’s </h2>



<p>According to a report by South Korean outlet <a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/2K773GI6BZ">Seoul Economic Daily</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-up-has-gifted-all-its-staff-3500-airpods-max-and-an-apple-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Shift Up has gifted 300 employees a 5 million won cash bonus ($3400 USD), Apple AirPods Max, and Apple Watches for this New Year’s. As mentioned above, Shift Up is known to shower their employees with gifts; they have previously received items such as iPhone 14s, credit cards loaded with 10 million won ($6,800 USD), PlayStation 5 Pros, and Switch 2s. Don’t you wish you were working at Shift Up as well? </p>



<p>Currently, the dev team is working on the Stellar Blade sequel and other projects, and this could be the best way to motivate them and keep their interests aligned. The dev team is also working on a cross-platform title called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-upcoming-title-will-be-published-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Spirits</a>, which will be created through “a strategic partnership to include both publishing and joint development,” with Tencent’s Level Infinite. </p>







<p>In other news, Stellar Blade devs are considering additional platform expansions, which could mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-could-come-to-xbox-and-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 and Xbox ports</a> are on the way. Additionally, Shift Up is planning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multi-platform release</a> for the sequel.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-release-time/</link>
            <guid>1403209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The countdown until the release of Hytale is rapidly approaching the end, and as players across the world gear up for the release of the title, questions have naturally emerged about the Hytale release time.</p>



<p>Hytale releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 13</a> as a PC exclusive, though it is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-steam-how-to-buy-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">not available on Steam</a> at launch, after a rollercoaster ride through development that saw the title cancelled by Riot Games last year, before then being re-acquired by the original creators.</p>



<p>There’s still a long development journey ahead until a full 1.0 release, but players will finally be able to sink their teeth into Hytale imminently, and Insider Gaming has the release time details.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-time-does-hytale-release">What Time Does Hytale Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Go time. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale has a confirmed release time of 10 AM ET/3 PM GMT on PC, as revealed by a countdown timer on the official Hytale website.</strong></p>



<p>The official countdown on the <a href="https://hytale.com/countdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale website</a> has been running for a while, counting down exactly how many days, hours, minutes, and seconds are left before players can dive into the game.</p>



<p>Hytale devs are expecting around one million players on launch day, so there could be some server issues to iron out early on, but the hope is that when the doors open, players will be able to flock in.</p>



<p>If you are having issues launching the game when the release time has passed, you may have to wait and try again, and make sure to keep an eye on the official Hytale social media accounts for any news and updates on ongoing problems.</p>



<p>The table below shows the exact release time for Hytale in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Hytale Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Jan. 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Jan. 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is in full swing, and there’s plenty to look forward to in gaming this year. However, with so much on the calendar, it’s easy to lose track of what’s dropping and when.</p>



<p>From major drops to indie games worth your attention, Insider Gaming has selected several games worth checking out releasing in the week of January 12.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-games-releasing-january-12-18-2026">Biggest Games Releasing January 12-18, 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-hytale">Hytale</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Finally. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Launching into early access on January 13 after years of waiting, exclusively on PC, gamers have been warned that the title is very much a work in progress, but that’s unlikely to stop hordes of players from immediately diving into the Minecraft-inspired world at the first opportunity.</p>



<p>The open-world sandbox has stunning visuals, with teaser images and clips showing everything from barren deserts to bountiful forests, alongside a variety of creatures and monsters. While it’s unclear how much of that will be available immediately, the depth that Hytale offers long-term will be difficult to match.</p>



<h3 id="h-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Admittedly not a new release, with the game turning six this year, the Nintendo Switch 2 edition comes along the mammoth 3.0 update, offering a hefty chunk of DLC-sized content for all players and doesn’t require any extra purchases.</p>



<p>The 3.0 update includes the addition of a new hotel, with customizable rooms to fit a desired theme, new collab items to unlock, and new villagers, so there’s plenty to offer for both new and returning players.</p>



<h3 id="h-quarantine-zone">Quarantine Zone</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Checkmate. Credit to Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Launching January 12 on PC, Quarantine Zone puts players in control of managing a checkpoint in a collapsing city during a zombie outbreak. Players utilise advanced screening tools and their own intuition to decide whether a survivor is free to pass through, or if the doors are slammed in their face.</p>



<p>One wrong move can quickly lead to your downfall, and players also need to manage resources, reinforce defences, and keep your camp alive in this chaos-filled strategy simulator.</p>



<h3 id="h-cassette-boy">Cassette Boy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Puzzling. Image via Wonderland Kazakiri Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Anyone seeking a new puzzle adventure to sink time into should take a look at Casette Boy, which launches on January 15 across PlayStation 5, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Players must rotate a 2D pixel-styled 3D world to uncover the mystery of the vanished moon, utilizing new weapons and equipment to improve their survival chances in exploration and combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-brokenlore-unfollow">BrokenLore: UNFOLLOW</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Haunting. Image via Serafini Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re up for a haunt, BrokenLore: UNFOLLOW is definitely a title to check out, with the first-person psychological horror exploring the impact of social media on mental health. The concept certainly grabs attention, and the sinister creatures you will encounter are truly terrifying.</p>



<p>BrokenLore: UNFOLLOW launches January 16 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</p>



<h3 id="h-craftlings">Craftlings</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Choices. Image via Ariano Games GmbH</figcaption></figure>



<p>Launching January 15 exclusively on PC, Crafdtlings is “inspired by legendary classics from the ’90s”, pulling players along in a journey full of strategic decisions, testing players to optimize automated production chains.</p>



<p>The Craftlings themselves are tiny humanoids you put to work to shape the world around you, improving your settlement with various building types, including farms and barracks. It’s not all smooth sailing, though, as there’s always the risk of encountering danger as you progress through different biomes and environments.</p>
