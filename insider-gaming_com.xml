<p>Remedy has been distracted by other games in recent years. But Control 2 is one of the company’s biggest upcoming projects, and not only have we learned new details about the game’s progress, but the company has announced a huge milestone for the franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-ultimate-editions-new-update-introduces-hideo-kojima-mission-for-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control</a> felt interesting until the game’s final moments: The puzzles, the paranormal activity in the environment, and your powers. It felt like something was <em>always </em>happening. It could see-saw from horror to hot action in a heartbeat. The demand for a second game has been strong for a while, and it appears the sequel is getting closer.</p>

<p>The 2025 Remedy Half-year financial report told us several things: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar and Remedy are working together on the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake</a>, the Control franchise has surpassed 5 million lifetime copies sold and counting, and Control 2 is coming along nicely.</p>



<p>Here’s the official <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">word</a> on Control 2’s development: “Control 2&nbsp;development is on track towards meeting its next milestones. The focus is now on the gameplay, environments, and missions. Work continues on developing the game into a strong commercial offering.”</p>



<p>The next milestones could be an official reveal trailer or even a gameplay reveal right out of the gate. I think it’s safe to assume from this that we’re still quite some way off from Control 2 hitting shelves and digital storefronts, though.</p>



<p>One thing’s for sure: Remedy has a lot on its plate with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreaks-new-patch-introduces-faster-progression-and-economy-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, the Max Payne Remake, and Control 2.</p>



<p>What did you love most about the first Control? For me, it was all of it, to be honest. I want to hear what you think, and you can get a conversation underway courtesy of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake.1267815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake is still moving along nicely, according to Remedy in its 2025 half-year financial report. It’s also been revealed that Rockstar Games and Remedy Entertainment are teaming up for the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake.</p>



<p>Remedy’s work on the original Max Payne games was exceptional. Both games sold well and became iconic for their revolutionary bullet-time feature (popularized by The Matrix) and their unique presentation and style. Remedy handed over the franchise to Take-Two, leading to Rockstar Games handling Max Payne 3—another success.</p>



<p>We learned early details about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-gives-update-on-control-2-and-max-payne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake in 2023</a>, and the game went into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-2-is-now-playable-as-max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full production in 2024</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-max-payne-1-amp-2-remake-remains-in-full-production">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake “Remains in Full Production”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could it lead to a Max Payne 4? Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remedy’s “Half year financial report January–June 2025” covered many aspects of Remedy, including upcoming projects. There was a new update on the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake, revealing a cool detail.</p>



<p>“The&nbsp;Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake&nbsp;project continues its progress and remains in full production. In the second quarter, the team built on steady momentum from earlier in the year. Collaboration with Rockstar Games remains close and productive, ensuring alignment as the project advances toward its next major phase,” the statement <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>



<p>This means both of Max Payne’s key developers are working together on the project. It’s unclear if this is a 50/50 split of the workload or how much input either team is contributing.</p>



<p>Regardless, long-term Max Payne fans should rest easy knowing Remedy and Rockstar Games are on the case. Can the two companies synergize perfectly to recapture the Max Payne magic? Or do you think there could be some crossed wires? Share your thoughts through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Doesn’t Use Controversial EOMM System, Says NetEase Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-doesn%E2%80%99t-use-controversial-eomm-system-says-netease-games.1267788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Marvel Rivals player base has dwindled in recent times, and many in the community believe EOMM is a big reason. NetEase has publicly acknowledged the belief and says it’s not the case. The developer is preparing a video set to break down how the game’s matchmaking works.</p>



<p>When you think of matchmaking in major FPS games, you probably default to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a>. This is known as Skill-Based Matchmaking, and is a contentious (and constant) frustration across multiplayer games. It favors an algorithm that keeps players in matches with similarly skilled players. EOMM doesn’t get the headlines SBMM does, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-marvel-rivals-planning-collaborations-with-other-marvel-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has been linked with the controversial system for a while.</p>



<h2 id="h-netease-working-on-video-to-explain-marvel-rivals-matchmaking">NetEase Working on Video to Explain Marvel Rivals Matchmaking</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Swiping away the accusations. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>Presumably tired of the speculation, the Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account posted an update on August 12.</p>



<p>“Hi Rivals! As our game continues to thrive, we want to reiterate that Marvel Rivals does not use EOMM. We are currently working on a video to demonstrate our developer insights on the matchmaking and ranking system, which is expected to be released next week,” it said.”</p>



<p>EOMM stands for ‘Engagement Optimized Matchmaking.’ Whereas SBMM targets competitive matches and lobbies, EOMM focuses on player retention and engagement. The long-standing belief is that EOMM is designed to give you regular doses of the highs and lows of online gaming.</p>



<p>One second you’re wrecking lobbies multiple games running—racking up a nasty K/D and W/L ratio—the next, you’re on an unexplainable losing streak. The idea is that the wins keep you playing because you feel powerful, and the losses encourage you to keep playing to secure the next win.</p>



<p>It sounds similar to SBMM. However, the underlying motive is to keep you playing and coming back for more, increasing the likelihood of you spending money on microtransactions.</p>

<p>The video should be a fascinating peek behind the curtain. Will NetEase be completely transparent, or do you think the developer will retain some of the finer details?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-rileycs-cheating-allegations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/viral-vtuber-%E2%80%98rileycs%E2%80%99-has-been-banned-on-twitch-following-battlefield-6-cheating-allegations.1267785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A VTuber has been banned on Twitch after her Battlefield 6 gameplay clip amassed tens of millions of views.</p>



<p>The Vtuber, named RileyCS posted her Battlefield 6 clips on X on August 8, which prompted many users to accuse her of cheating. The discourse around the clip has resulted in the video accumulating 47.8 million views at the time of writing. </p>



<p>Presumably, the viral tweet has resulted in her being reported to Twitch by those who think she’s been cheating, which has resulted in her ban.</p>



<p>You can watch the clip below to decide for yourself if you think she’s cheating:</p>

<h2 id="h-the-battlefield-6-cheating-allegations">The Battlefield 6 Cheating Allegations</h2>



<p>At first glance, it isn’t difficult to jump to the conclusion that Riley is indeed cheating after watching the footage. Her unique playstyle, which requires her to ‘flick’ onto enemies to get gameplay clips for content, does have all the traits of cheating. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/"><strong>RELATED – When Does The Battlefield 6 Beta End? Open Beta End Times Explained</strong></a></p>



<p>However, some have argued in favour of Riley, stating that she’s known within the community for this type of content. Battlefield YouTuber Enders has also analysed the clips, which makes for an interesting watch if you have the time. But then again, the counterargument is that you can turn aimbot on and off very easily (with a foot pedal for instance). </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whether Riely is cheating or not is something that will probably be hotly debated for the foreseeable future until either EA comes out to debunk the claims, or Riely plays at some kind of LAN event.</p>



<p>Regardless, the viral clip has prompted dozens more players to capture similar clips and post them to X. So, the cheating accusations within the community against players, regardless if they are legit or not, will likely continue. </p>



<p><strong>UPDATE – Rileycs has now been unbanned from Twitch.</strong></p>



<p>What do you think of Riley’s clips? Do you think she was cheating in Battlefield 6? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>
