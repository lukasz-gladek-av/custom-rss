<p>Every new update on Stellar Blade seems to suggest that the game has defied all expectations. Now, it’s understood that Stellar Blade has beaten out Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, Marvel’s Spider-Man, and others to be the best-selling PlayStation exclusive on PC.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade news has been coming thick and fast recently. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/">Stellar Blade sequel is confirmed to be in development</a>, and the bombshell was dropped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade is going multiplatform</a>. The original game was a success on launch and continues to escalate in terms of popularity and sales.</p>



<p>Shift Up has revealed a new graphic showing this to be the case.</p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-destroys-other-playstation-exclusives-on-pc">Stellar Blade Destroys Other PlayStation Exclusives On PC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Eve is the Queen. Credit to Stellar Blade</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stellar Blade developer Shift Up showed off an impressive chart showing the biggest PlayStation-exclusive games that have received a PC port.</p>



<p>The graphic (shown by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki</a>) shows the top six games for sales on PC. The data shows Stellar Blade hit a peak of 192,000 concurrent players on Steam at launch, with the next best being 77,000 players for Ghost of Tsushima.</p>







<p>The headline sentence also says: “Best-selling PlayStation-exclusive launch IP in history.”</p>



<p>Based on the numbers, this isn’t just the case; it’s conclusive. We reported a couple of weeks ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuhei-yoshida-absolutely-wanted-stellar-blade-on-playstation-after-playing-it/">Shuhei Yoshida ‘Absolutely Wanted’ Stellar Blade on PlayStation after playing it</a>. PC players eventually got a chance to experience it—which was clearly snapped up!</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Shift Up released a chart showing that Stellar Blade is the best selling PlayStation exclusive single-player PC launch in history!</p><p>– Reached 192k peak concurrent players on Steam at launch<br>– Over 2.5x more than the previous record <a href="https://t.co/BEuNUm9QhB">pic.twitter.com/BEuNUm9QhB</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1992891077335154995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The game’s appeal continues to grow as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-silent-hill-f-crossover-teased-in-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade x Silent Hill f crossover was teased</a>, and owners have new content to play, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-receives-3-new-epilogues-with-the-latest-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 new epilogues</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GFA Games has announced that PIONER, an ambitious post-apocalyptic MMO, will launch in early access on December 16, 2025. This date comes mere weeks after a successful beta test, which saw the game skyrocket to over 500,000 wishlists on Steam. The PC-exclusive MMO has been described as a perfect balance between the likes of Fallout, STALKER, and Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>PIONER features a massive open-world environment, stacks of customization options, and an immersive atmosphere that encourages players to prioritize exploration and development over anything else.</p>



<h2 id="h-pioner-hits-early-access-soon">PIONER Hits Early Access Soon</h2>



<p>PIONER, which has been compiled by GFA Games, a studio headquartered in Serbia, is set to be released <strong>in early access </strong>on December 16. This news dropped today, along with a new trailer, which you can see below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PIONER - Together" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZDY7I4VS70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The team at GFA Games also revealed the Deluxe Edition of PIONER, which comes with stacks of digital content:</p>



<ul>
<li>Unique Skin: “Renegade” – a unique, exclusive armor and gear design</li>



<li>Weapon Skin with VFX – a unique weapon skin for the entire AR platform, including AR-12,<br>AR-16, and AR-16 Ifrit</li>



<li>Exclusive Founder Title – a status symbol for social interaction</li>



<li>Premium Currency – 500 Efritanium Crystals</li>



<li>Weapon Accessory: “Creepy Charm” – cosmetic trinket for a weapon</li>



<li>Gadget: “Katana” Watch – inspired by the iconic 80s Japanese watch design; a retro-futuristic style that fits the world of PIONER</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s blurb reveals how much potential this game has:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>PIONER takes players to a vast, atmospheric post-apocalyptic island, where remnants of the Soviet era create an incredible alternate reality. The game emphasizes realism over traditional mechanics, offering an open world of over 50 km2 filled with hidden dungeons, story quests, and faction missions that influence alliances and rewards. As a social-focused MMO, PIONER combines story-driven exploration with intense PvE and PvP gameplay. Players shape the world through their actions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PIONER has an expansive campaign that eases players in with a great tutorial section, and it has grown over several years of development to become something that could stun in early access.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-receives-blessing-to-include-technoblade-tribute/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hytale-%E2%80%98receives-blessing%E2%80%99-to-include-technoblade-tribute.1362625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale will feature a tribute to Technoblade in future after permission was granted by the content creator’s father, with fans urged to submit their ideas for the tribute.</p>



<p>Youtuber Technoblade, who passed in June 2022 after a battle with cancer, was a prominent Minecraft YouTuber, often using the Hypixel server that eventually spawned into Hytale, and he is set to be commemorated in the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-technoblade-tribute-coming-to-hytale">Technoblade Tribute Coming to Hytale</h2>



<figure><figcaption>In memorium. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1992443358602572006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme shared that the team had received the blessing of Technoblade’s father to “add something in Hytale that represents Technoblade’s memory.”</p>



<p>He added that Technoblade was “a big part of our journey with Hypixel,” and he wishes for “him to be a part of this one as well,” and the doors are now open to suggestions.</p>



<p>Players have been urged to submit their ideas for a “meaningful tribute” for Technoblade, who, it was revealed, applied to work for Hypixel Studios’ marketing team a decade ago but was too young at the time.</p>



<p>Suggestions shared on social media so far include rare odds for a pig to spawn as Techoblade, a special weapon, or a boss fight.</p>



<p>Technoblade already received a tribute in Minecraft after his passing, with the splash image for the title showcasing a pig wearing a golden crown—a callout to the iconic skin he used in his videos.</p>



<p>After revealing his diagnosis with cancer in August 2021, Technoblade raised over $300,000 dollars for the Sarcoma Foundation of America, smashing the quarter of a million goal within two hours, and his YouTube channel posthumously reached 20 million subscribers in May 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-reveals-plans-for-proximity-chat-multiplayer-portals/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hytale-reveals-plans-for-proximity-chat-multiplayer-%E2%80%98portals%E2%80%99.1362577/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale devs are working on two significant social features to add to the game, with proximity chat and the potential of ‘portals’ in single-player that allow friends to join your game without having to tweak settings.</p>



<p>News on Hytale continues to come thick and fast following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founders reacquiring the title from Riot Games</a>, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-price-revealed-ahead-of-early-access-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing revealed last week</a> and details on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access release date</a> arriving in the coming days.</p>



<p>The early access launch will be a major step for the future of Hytale, but there is still a lot to come, and two major features have been revealed.</p>







<h2 id="h-proximity-chat-amp-multiplayer-support-in-single-player-coming-to-hytale">Proximity Chat &amp; Multiplayer Support in Single-Player Coming to Hytale</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More to come. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an in-depth interview with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcmNb40D6Vg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ElRichMC</a>, Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme answered a range of questions about the development of Hytale and plans for the future, alongside taking the opportunity to reveal two components that are in the works.</p>



<p>One of those is support for multiplayer in single-player worlds, allowing players to have drop-in, drop-out gameplay with friends, but, in a bid to make it more immersive, the current plan is for an item that needs to be built to access the feature.</p>



<p>“I want the game to be more social, so I was thinking, what if, to invite your friends, you have to make a portal? And when you leave the game, they go out from that portal, to make it more immersive,” Collins-Laflamme said.</p>



<p>While this may seem like a simple feature, it’s added that “some other popular games don’t have it,” and the crucial aspect is the ability to “invite your friend with no need to change your firewall settings.”</p>



<p>Another feature that goes hand-in-hand with the planned multiplayer functionality is proximity chat, which is confirmed to be in the works, but Collins-Laflamme admitted he’s “not sure” whether the feature will be available at the early access launch.</p>



<p>Voice chat is “very important” for Hytale, opening the doors for plenty of other experiences to be built, particularly given the expansive modding support the game will have.</p>

<p>Fortnite’s Sidekicks feature looks set to receive a huge flock of collabs, according to leakers, as a major agreement with Paramount is said to have been reached.</p>



<p>The Sidekicks feature was added earlier this month, featuring customizable pets, visible only to you and players in your party, in specific modes, and additional Sidekicks are expected to be added regularly.</p>



<p>A first collab Sidekick has been added in The Simpsons season, with Scratchy coming in the Itchy &amp; Scratchy bundle, and other animated stars are on the horizon.</p>







<h2 id="h-paramount-ips-coming-to-fortnite-as-sidekicks">Paramount IPs Coming to Fortnite as Sidekicks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Paramount</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable Fortnite leakers, <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1992656693499756589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">including SamLeakss</a>, Paramount IPs are coming to Fortnite as Sidekicks, which aligns with previous leaks indicating collabs with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob Squarepants</a>.</p>



<p>No specifics have been shared on what collabs to expect, but there is a lengthy list of potentials, with Paramount’s expansive list of IPs including the likes of SpongeBob, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers, and more.</p>



<p>Some of those franchises, including TMNT and Transformers, have already featured as collabs in the past, including with skins, but the new Sidekick feature opens the door for other characters, smaller in size, to feature.</p>



<p>One of the biggest franchises under the Paramount umbrella that would certainly fit the Sidekicks theme is Paw Patrol, though the show is geared to a younger audience and may therefore not be suited to featuring in Fortnite.</p>



<p>An agreement with Paramount opens the door for plenty of options, and time will tell exactly what will be added to the game, but it’s clear Epic Games has big fans to utilize Sidekicks in more collabs.</p>

<p>In a fresh report from NewZoo, it has been confirmed that ARC Raiders skyrocketed within just two days on the market, beating many of the world’s most capable and impactful games in October’s revenue charts. The data revealed that ARC Raiders secured the seventh spot in the charts in October, despite being released on October 30.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has proven to be one of the most transformative games ever released, taking over the extraction shooter genre and retaining an enormous player base almost a month after release.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-on-top-almost">ARC Raiders On Top (Almost)</h2>



<p>In an all-new October revenue report from NewZoo, it was documented that ARC Raiders hit the seventh spot in the charts despite being on the shelves for just two days in October.</p>



<p>It effortlessly walked over some of the biggest games in the business:</p>



<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>VALORANT</li>



<li>ROBLOX</li>



<li>World of Warcraft</li>



<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
</ul>



<p>The stunning achievement sat ARC Raiders behind the likes of NBA 2K26, Fortnite, Ghost of Yotei, and Battlefield 6, all of which is/were to be expected.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders continues to stun gamers worldwide, and everyone from diehard extraction shooter fans to those totally new to the concept is getting on board. Recently, a streamer-backed initiative saw some of the biggest creators in the space take part in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/">unofficial ‘war’</a> that pulled unprecedented audiences into some streamers’ chats.</p>



<p>There’s a hefty roadmap in store for ARC Raiders, and Embark Studios, the game’s stellar creator, has vowed to support the title for years to come. The next major update will be <strong>Cold Snap</strong>, coming in December 2025.</p>
