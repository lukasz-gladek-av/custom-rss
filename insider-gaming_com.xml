<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade’s storage requirements have been changed for the Nintendo Switch 2, now coming in close to 100GB. </p>



<p>We have been hearing a lot about Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 recently, with devs stating they are considering a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-devs-are-considering-a-full-title-after-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole new game</a> after the release of the final part. However, in the meantime, development on FF7 Remake Intergrade continues for Switch 2, and it seems the game will take up almost half of Switch 2’s base storage space. </p>

<p>Tarsier Studios announced their upcoming title, Reanimal, at Gamescom Opening Night <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarsier-studios-new-game-reanimal-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this year</a>, with a trailer that got many players excited. The developers are also experienced in this space, bringing players the first two Little Nightmare games and LittleBigPlanet 3. </p>







<h2 id="h-reanimal-release-date-set-for-february-13-2026-pre-orders-are-live">Reanimal Release Date Set for February 13, 2026; Pre-Orders Are Live</h2>



<p>The release date for Reanimal was spotted by Shinobi602 on <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1991512993218326945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter).

<p>Reanimal is a co-op horror-adventure where players experience the story of a brother and sister who set foot in hell to save their friends. The region the players explore is filled with tension and a thick atmosphere as they traverse by boat and on land. Exploration is key, as the main path is only one part of the story, with many mysterious locations and their own stories to tell. The title is fully playable in single player and local &amp; online co-op, it also has “a shared, directed camera, designed to maximise claustrophobia and tension.”</p>
