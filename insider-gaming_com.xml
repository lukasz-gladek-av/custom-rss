<p>ASUS has announced its new lineup of gaming monitors, with one being one of the more interesting monitors to come in some time. The ASUS ROG Strix XG32UCG is a 32-inch monitor with an IPS display that offers either 4K at 160Hz or 1080p at 360Hz, depending on what you’d need.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 has not been spared from the discourse about “dying” that surrounds multiplayer and live service games in recent years. Counter-Strike as a series has been around for decades, and the state of the game has been a constant discussion point since.</p>



<p>But is there any truth to the arguments that CS2 is dying?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-are-players-saying-that-cs2-is-dying">Why are players saying that CS2 is dying?</h2>



<p>There are a number of issues that the wider Counter-Strikes 2 player base has with the state of the game.</p>



<p>One of these issues has been Valve Anti-Cheat, the anti-cheat program that’s supposed to keep cheaters and hackers at bay. Many players claim that VAC hardly keeps cheaters out, and that they are constantly running into cheaters on a frequent basis.</p>



<p>Other issues plaguing the game include client performance, a lack of new content (seasonal operations), more frequent crashes, subtick issues, and various bugs.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-2-dying">Is Counter-Strike 2 dying?</h2>



<p>Despite the issues facing Counter-Strike 2 currently, the game is not dying. While the player numbers for CS2 have always fluctuated, there’s been no consistent dropoff. The <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peak player and average player numbers</a> as of December 2024 are lower now than they were in April or May, but higher than they were in January or February.</p>



<figure><figcaption>CS2 player peaks and averages, per SteamDB.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These numbers will typically spike after a large update, whether that be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a change to the map pool</a> or a return of the Major pass. While these larger updates feel more sparse when compared to other popular multiplayer titles, players are still logging back in to play. Valve is also still (slowly) releasing updates regarding some of the major issues.</p>



<p>CS2 is still the most played game on Steam at any given time, and likely will remain that way for a long time.</p>



<p>Thoughts on CS2 as whole? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> is arguably the most legendary franchise in gaming, proving time and again why it’s so overwhelmingly popular. It has produced some of the most instantly recognisable protagonists in the business – and even the franchise’s side characters are just as memorable. With Grand Theft Auto 6 on the horizon, we thought it’d be appropriate to rank the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto/">Grand Theft Auto</a> protagonists, figuring out once and for all which main character in the GTA series is the best.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-grand-theft-auto-protagonists-ranked">Grand Theft Auto Protagonists Ranked</h2>



<p><em>It’s driven mostly by opinion – if you have your own ranking for the Grand Theft Auto characters, feel free to drop a comment saying who you’d put where in this list!</em></p>



<h4 id="h-10-victor-vance-vice-city-stories">10. Victor Vance (Vice City Stories)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vic Vance first appeared as a minor character in Vice City and had his own journey documented later on in Vice City Stories, which was a prequel of sorts. He becomes embroiled in the seedy, criminal underbelly of Vice City to support his family, and while his game boasted a good story, it wasn’t overwhelmingly impactful – hence the rating.</p>



<h4 id="h-9-johnny-klebitz-the-lost-and-damned">9. Johnny Klebitz (The Lost and Damned)</h4>



<p>Back when Grand Theft Auto actually had story-based expansions, players were introduced to Johnny Klebitz. As a part of the Grand Theft Auto IV saga, Johnny took centre stage in The Lost and Damned, a gritty expansion based around an outlaw motorcycle club that was strewn with themes of brotherhood, loyalty, and the constant threat of brutal death. </p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-grand-theft-auto-cross-platform/">Is Grand Theft Auto Cross-Platform?</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-8-tommy-vercetti-vice-city">8. Tommy Vercetti (Vice City)</h4>



<p>Tommy Vercetti is an iconic PlayStation 2-era character, emerging from the very heart of Vice City as one the most ruthless and headstrong characters in the GTA series. As a former hitman for the Mafia, Vercetti has the tools needed to survive in the trade, and there are hopes he’ll resurface in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<h4 id="h-7-claude-gta-iii">7. Claude (GTA III)</h4>



<figure><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gta-5/"></a></figure>







<p>Claude was a silent protagonist who ushered in a new generation of gaming with the introduction of Grand Theft Auto III, the first 3D game in the series. It changed the paradigm for open-world adventures, and despite Claude never uttering a word, he’d become known as one of the most impactful Grand Theft Auto protagonists ever.</p>



<h4 id="h-6-franklin-clinton-gta-v">6. Franklin Clinton (GTA V)</h4>



<p>Franklin Clinton was always more of a follower than a leader – first with Lemar Davis and then with Michael De Santa – but he had remarkable talents that made him shine in Grand Theft Auto V. His struggles ultimately turned themselves around, and in a relatively short period of time, Franklin Clinton became a legend of the streets, making millions, living in Vinewood Hills, and pulling off immense heists.</p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-gta-5-still-so-popular/">Why Is GTA 5 Still So Popular?</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-5-trevor-philips-gta-v">5. Trevor Philips (GTA V)</h4>



<p>Trevor Philips was as unhinged as they came, but he was one of the most entertaining Grand Theft Auto protagonists to ever grace our screens. His anger management issues made for some hilarious situations, and despite his insanely hot head, he was an overwhelmingly talented marksman with a cold and calculating mind for business, and that’s what made him such a strong GTA protagonist.</p>



<h4 id="h-4-tony-cipriani-liberty-city-stories">4. Tony Cipriani (Liberty City Stories)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tony Cipriani is one of the few GTA characters to bridge that gap between more than one game, appearing in both Grand Theft Auto III as a main character and in Liberty City Stories as the protagonist. He was a driving force in the Leone Crime Family that was based in Liberty City, and as both a fiercely loyal individual and a talented combatant, he made his mark on the franchise and proved that someone can perfect the balance between being a <strong>family man </strong>and a <strong>made man</strong>.</p>



<h4 id="h-3-michael-de-santa-gta-v">3. Michael De Santa (GTA V)</h4>



<p>In many ways, Michael De Santa was the driving force behind the Grand Theft Auto V story – he was the catalyst and the spark that triggered events and snowballed them into the grand adventure that hundreds of millions of players have enjoyed. He’s a skilled criminal, even in his later years, and he’s unbelievably talented with any form of weaponry. He’s also a master thief, a charismatic individual, and what’s more, he recognises the need to help youngsters develop themselves into something greater than what they are. </p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-source-code-partially-leaks/">Learn About The GTA 5 Source Code Leaks</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-2-carl-cj-johnson-san-andreas">2. Carl ‘CJ’ Johnson (San Andreas)</h4>



<p>Carl Johnson was introduced to the world in 2004’s GTA San Andreas, and he would ultimately go on to become one of the most iconic Grand Theft Auto protagonists of all time. He’s a die-hard family man and a ruthless fighter with a heart of gold, and he wants what’s best for those closest to him. He’s multi-talented, oozes charisma, and his journey across San Andreas turns him from a back-street gangbanger to a legendary icon of the series.</p>



<h4 id="h-1-niko-bellic-gta-iv">1. Niko Bellic (GTA IV)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) players were introduced to a darker, more serious tone – and it was a total break away from what we’d come to know and love from the series thus far. However, it was a smash hit, and it put Niko Bellic on the GTA map. </p>



<p>As the man who sits atop the list of the best Grand Theft Auto protagonists, Niko has earned his spot for many reasons. Firstly, he’s a stalwart protector of his family and friends, which makes him honourable. He does what he does with the best of intentions in mind, and somehow, he manages to be likeable even when he’s going on a rampage to protect those he loves.</p>



<p>He’s a mysterious, storied character with a background that players simply desire to learn more about, and his journey through Liberty City is monumental. He goes from being an immigrant fresh off the deck of a cargo boat to being a respected, revered criminal presence in the city. </p>



<p>That’s why he’s the best Grand Theft Auto protagonist in the series.</p>

<p>From the pulse-pounding gorefests to the psychological horrors, there are so many horror games for you to sink your teeth into, but which ones are worth your time – and your sanity? </p>



<p>In this list, we’re breaking down the 10 best horror games ever from days gone by. They’re some of the top horror games ever, and they’re guaranteed to have you reaching for the pause button and switching on the lights. </p>



<p>It’s okay, just pretend you’re not scared – it usually works.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-horror-games-ever">Best Horror Games Ever</h2>



<p>Here’s our list of the best horror games you’ll ever play – enjoy! <em>*Insert evil laugh here*</em></p>



<h3 id="h-1-resident-evil">1. Resident Evil</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is where it all began for so many of us. In 1996, Capcom developed and released Resident Evil, a culture-shifting, paradigm-altering game that left many of us old-timers clutching our chests with fear. As we navigated the terrifying Spencer Mansion (and beyond), we found ourselves coming face-to-face with an all-new and terrifying threat: the undead.</p>



<p>Resident Evil set a bar that horror games would try to reach in the many years that followed. It was the baseline for the horror genre, and it went on to spawn a successful movie franchise, countless follow-on titles, and a living, breathing, and thriving universe.</p>



<p>Is there anything more suited to the top spot on this list than the original Resident Evil? It’s the best horror game ever.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-silent-hill-2">2. Silent Hill 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Silent Hill 2 (2001) is an absolute classic – a true horror game that fans of the genre simply must play.  It’s arguably the defining game of the series that has gone on to spawn many more titles, and it’s equal parts physically threatening and psychologically taxing. It’s a solid title to play if you’re hunting for one of the best horror games ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-outlast">3. Outlast</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Outlast – and the follow-up titles – is a terrifying experience that’ll have you pausing to catch your breath following one of the game’s many jumpscares. It’s one of those games that leaves you incapable of fighting against what’s hunting you, and all you can do instead is run and hide, which often results in you sitting on the edge of your seat with your heart pounding in your chest.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-resident-evil-biohazard">4. Resident Evil: Biohazard</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Biohazard might not have felt like a typical Resident Evil game, but thanks to the title’s lore, it was steeped in history and embedded in the overall RE timeline. In Biohazard, players must contend with some of the most chilling enemies in RE history, fighting through a story that’s equal parts graphically violent and psychologically thrilling. It’s a top-tier RE game and one of the best horror games ever concocted. </p>







<h3 id="h-5-maid-of-sker">5. Maid of Sker</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Maid of Sker was released in 2020 and quickly became known as being one of the scariest games ever made. It features gorgeous visuals and a beautiful soundtrack but it’s easily one of the most intense games you’ll ever play. In Maid of Sker, even <strong>breathing </strong>can put you in the sights of bloodthirsty creatures roaming the stunning environment of an abandoned Welsh hotel.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-the-last-of-us">6. The Last of Us</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you don’t think The Last of Us is a horror game, then you haven’t played it. It is riddled with jumpscares, terrifying enemies, and heart-pounding sequences made more terrifying by the constant, looming threat of the post-apocalyptic setting. If you’ve never come face-to-face with a Clicker, you obviously haven’t played one of the best horror games ever made.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-half-life-alyx">7. Half-Life: Alyx</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This VR game might not seem like a horror at first blush, but I was jump-scared more playing this than any other game <strong>in history</strong>. From the perspective of a VR headset, everything is incredibly detailed and in-your-face, and nothing will make you leap out of your skin more than a headcrab jumping at your face out of the darkness.</p>



<p>Special mention to Jeff, one of the most terrifying creatures I’ve ever faced in one of the scariest segments of a game I’ve ever seen.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-amnesia-the-dark-descent">8. Amnesia: The Dark Descent</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Amnesia has had a few titles spawn in the series but none have been quite as scary as the first title, which was released way back in 2010. In The Dark Descent, players must contend with some of the most unexpected, effective jumpscares ever featured in a game, and they can quite literally occur around any corner.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-the-mortuary-assistant">9. The Mortuary Assistant</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Mortuary Assistant was popularised by streamers who wanted to be scared out of their mind during a broadcast, and it did that job quite well. In this particular horror game, players are charged with working in a mortuary (obviously) and preparing bodies for what comes next, but with some of the most mind-bending jumpscares popping up in the most unexpected places, it’s a non-stop thrill ride of intensity.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-p-t">10. P.T.</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>P.T. was a demo that was supposed to advertise Hideo Kojima’s ‘Silent Hills’ game, but it was never meant to be. While the full game was never released, players spent hours poring over P.T. – ‘Playable Teaser’ – which was released with no instructions, no guide, and no direction.
