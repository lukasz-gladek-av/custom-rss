<p>The next Pokemon Presents date has seemingly been leaked, and it comes from an unexpected source. </p>



<p>A keen-eyed <a href="https://x.com/mattyoukhana_/status/1876988464878567879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">user on Twitter</a> spotted metadata from Niantic that hints at the next Pokemon Presents taking place on February 27, 2025. In the data it shows a title of “Pokemon Presents 2025 x GO Tour: Unova Timed Research”. </p>



<p>The leaked date shouldn’t come as a surprise. Since 2021, there has been a Pokemon Presents on February 27 every year to coincide with Pokemon Day. If we are looking at when each of the last four events were announced, they usually didn’t come until just days prior. That means fans shouldn’t expect an official announcement on the next Pokemon Presents until around February 20 or so. </p>







<p>As far as what to expect during the showcase, it’s clear based on the title that a new timed research event for Pokemon Go will be shown. Also, with Pokemon Legends Z-A scheduled to launch this year, it could be assumed that the game will be shown in some way.  Elsewhere, Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket is likely to see a solid presence after it’s successful launch late last year. There’s also a good chance The Pokemon Company has a surprise or two up its sleeve in honor of the 29th Anniversary of Pokemon’s 1996 launch.</p>



<p>Whatever The Pokemon Company has in store for fans, Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the broadcast.</p>



<p>What do you think we see during the Pokemon Presents on Pokemon Day 2025? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>Ubisoft has just released a new blog post detailing the parkour systems for Assassin’s Creed Shadows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parkour has always been an integral system for every Assassin’s Creed title, and it seems to be a handy tool in Shadows. Parkour will be an excellent feature for exploration and a key tool for stealth and combat. Naoe is the parkour master, and she can quickly scale castles, leap across rooftops and surf the crowds in the streets of Kyoto thanks to her speed and agility. Check out how parkour works in Assassin’s Creed Shadows below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-parkour-inputs-for-assassin-s-creed-shadows-nbsp">New Parkour Inputs for Assassin’s Creed Shadows&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The upcoming game has changed specific inputs to add more mechanics. The crouch and dodge buttons have switched places to add the ability to go prone and let dodge mechanics lead directly to parkour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players will see that dodge and parkour down mechanics have merged thanks to the new input mapping. The new mapping will also disable the stance switch so that you can use any stance when going down from a rooftop. Players will also see new moves with the dodge button, such as acrobatic dodges over railings, jumping out of windows, or new silent drop-downs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-parkour-moves-nbsp">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Parkour Moves&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-parkour-up">Parkour Up</h3>



<p>Players who have played previous Assassin’s Creed games will know that this mechanic lets players hold a button to scale any building or structure they want, and the same parkour system will make its way to Shadows, too. The mechanic works while running up walls, jumping across gaps and leaping into the void. Naoe is better at jumping further and reaching higher than Yasuke.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-recovery-roll-nbsp">Recovery Roll&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When jumping from a distance, players can use the Igan Recovery Roll by pressing the dodge/parkour down button, considerably softening the blow and reducing the noise.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down">Parkour Down</h3>



<p>Here’s where the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows parkour system comes into play. As dodge and parkour mechanics have blended, players can press dodge near a ledge to transition into a parkour down traversal. Naoe will have acrobatic descents, while Yasuke will have heavy drops. Parkour down will let you access the safest lowest point below your character and avoid the player needlessly jumping into the void.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-sprint-mechanics-nbsp">Sprint Mechanics&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A new system unique to Naoe, the fastest assassin in the franchise, has been introduced. This mechanic allows players to trigger an extended dive roll over smaller objects such as fences, crates, rails, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows also includes two more systems: automated passovers and shoulder tackles. Automated Passovers allow the characters to jump over smaller objects acrobatically. On the other hand, automated shoulder tackle is exclusive to Yasuke, allowing him to bash through enemies or destructive objects while sprinting. If there are non-destructible objects, Yasuke will use automated passover, but it won’t be as clean as Naoe.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-grappling-mechanics">Grappling Mechanics</h2>



<p>Apart from sprinting and parkour, Assassin’s Creed Shadows players can also access a grappling hook. With this tool, players can perform vertical ascents and hook swings. Naoe can also scale unclimbable walls by wall running and using the grappling hook on a ledge.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-advanced-parkour-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Advanced Parkour in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<h3 id="h-stance-dodges">Stance dodges</h3>



<p>There are three types of stances: standing, crouching, and prone, and each stance has its own way of dodging for Naoe. Yasuke can dodge directionally while standing and crouching; however, only Naoe can dodge directionally while prone. This prone dodge will allow her to move side-to-side, roll forward, or slide backwards.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Prone Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-wall-run-eject">Wall Run Eject</h3>



<p>Thanks to her acrobatic skills, Naoe can run up any wall. The Wall Eject tool allows her to perform an incredible jump off the wall by pressing the parkour button at the top of the run. If her hands and feet are connected to a surface, Naoe can also use this move while climbing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-parkour-down-backward-dodge-and-high-structure-safety-nbsp">Parkour Down Backward Dodge and High Structure Safety&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Parkour Down Backward Dodge is a new move that allows the character to move while their back is facing the edge. In this position, the player can tap the parkour down button without directional input to cause their character to perform a backward dodge, rolling over the edge and down on the ground with a “muffled landing.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Parkour Deep Dive: Backward Drop Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXehGq8UkuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Parkour Down High Structure Safety is a new system that provides safety for the character at heights where fall damage could occur. In this situation, using parkour-down transitions would cause the character to hold on to the edge and hang there. You must press an additional button to make the character drop-down or climb up.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-unclimbable-surfaces">Unclimbable Surfaces</h2>



<p>Lastly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have surfaces that Yasuke and Naoe <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd/assassins-creed-shadows-parkour-system-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cannot climb</a> with the help of parkour, as they do not have any physical handholds to grab on. The associate game director, Simon, shared that this move is a big deal for them as they must be “more thoughtful about creating interesting parkour highways.” Additionally, this allows them to have “more control about where Naoe can go and where Yasuke can’t,” adding more contrast to the play style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the developers have assured that most Assassin’s Creed Shadows areas are “very much climbable,” and even more so with the grappling hook. Players must look for “valid entry points from time to time.”&nbsp;</p>
