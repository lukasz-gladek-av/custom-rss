<p>PlayStation is entering the gaming monitor market with its very own PC monitor.</p>



<p>Announced at the end of Tuesday’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-november-2025-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play Japan showcase</a>, the PlayStation Gaming Monitor is the first of its kind under the PlayStation brand. It’s also designed for use with both the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and PC.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-gaming-monitor-s-features">What Are The Gaming Monitor’s Features?</h2>



<p>The PlayStation gaming monitor—not to be confused with Sony’s INZONE brand—comes in at 27″ with a Quad High Definition (QHD) IPS display at a max 2K (2560 x 1440p) resolution. It also includes High Dynamic Range (HDR) support with Auto HDR Tone Mapping. For refresh rates, the monitor supports up to 240 Hz on PC and 120 Hz on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles as well as Variable Refresh Rates (VRR). </p>



<p>One of the more unique features is the built-in charging hook for DualSense and DualSense Edge controllers.</p>







<p>Input wise, it has two HDMI 2.1 inputs and one DisplayPort 1.4 input. There are also two USB-A ports and one USB-C port. Lastly, the monitor has a built-in speaker and 3.5mm audio output while also being VESA compatible for mounting. </p>



<p>The PlayStation gaming monitor will launch sometime in 2026 though no sepecific date or price was confirmed. What was announced, however, was that it will only be available in the United States and Japan.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up the PlayStation gaming monitor whenever it releases? </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-12-885/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-885-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-wednesday-november-12.1350634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re at the midway point of the week and raring to go with another NYT Connections puzzle. Below, I’ve provided the top NYT Connections hints and solutions you’ll need to smash today’s challenge. How’s your week going? Let me know in the comments if you’ve been playing any other puzzling games and what you might like to see more hints for!</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections answers you’re looking for. Today’s puzzle is a little bizarre as it features <strong>exclusively </strong>four-letter words. You’ll see what I mean below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-12">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 12)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #885:</p>



<ul>
<li>YOLO</li>



<li>POLO</li>



<li>LOCO</li>



<li>DODO</li>



<li>COMO</li>



<li>FOMO</li>



<li>JUDO</li>



<li>BOGO</li>



<li>BOZO</li>



<li>ROJO</li>



<li>YO-YO</li>



<li>SUMO</li>



<li>POCO</li>



<li>DOPE</li>



<li>GOLF</li>



<li>GOAT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>These all involve physical competition, but not your everyday gym workout.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Terms for someone who’s not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>Internet-born abbreviations that pack a punch.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>You might hear these in Madrid or Mexico City.</em></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 12.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-12-885">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 12 (#885)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– GOLF, JUDO, POLO, SUMO</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BOZO, DODO, DOPE, YO-YO</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOGO, FOMO, GOAT, YOLO</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COMO, LOCO, POCO, ROJO</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
