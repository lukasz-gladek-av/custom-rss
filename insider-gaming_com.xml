            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dan Houser has been on a media cycle to promote his new book. Obviously, gaming questions and quandaries are being thrown his way, and the Rockstar Games co-founder has opened up on AI usage in gaming, how he’s using it for his new game, and how it’s not all that.</p>



<p>AI is everywhere. You can’t get away from it. We’ve gone from harmless ChatGPT prompts to full-blown AI use across all media. AI’s use in gaming is causing a constant stir, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dan-houser-left-rockstar-games-due-to-disagreement-with-brother-over-companys-direction-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Houser</a> has discussed how his new game with Absurd Ventures is using it, and why it’s not as useful as it seems.</p>

<p>In an interview on the Sunday Brunch talk show, Houser was asked about his new book, called ‘A Better Paradise,’ aptly all about AI and an aspiring developer creating the perfect computer game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are making a game, set in the same world, but not exactly the same story. We’ve begun work on that about 18 months ago, and that’ll be another few years in development.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Rockstar co-founder was asked about the use of AI in his upcoming game. He’s very candid about using it, but offers some pushback on the technology:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are dabbling in using AI, but the truth is it’s not as useful as some of the companies would have you believe yet. It’s not going to solve all of the problems.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>The progression of AI and whether he thinks it’s moving faster than it ever has before also came up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In specific areas, yes, and in other areas when we have a whole field of areas we need technology for, and AI is great at some of the tasks and can’t do the other tasks yet. So people will claim that is [AI] can solve every problem, but it really can’t yet. As far as I understand it, it’s a hold all term for future computing, and it’s not really doing a lot of the stuff yet. But if we all give it all of our money, it might do it in the future.”</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-to-officially-relaunch-in-2025-after-beta-ends/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-to-officially-relaunch-in-2025-after-beta-ends.1364125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers of Splitgate 2 have announced that the beta season will end on December 4, 2025, and the game will relaunch later that month. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the developers of Splitgate 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a> that they will be “going back to beta” to rebuild significant parts of the game. It seems the developers have now spent enough time retesting the title and are confident enough to bring it back to the market. </p>



<h2 id="h-splitgate-2-beta-ends-on-december-4">Splitgate 2 Beta Ends on December 4</h2>



<p>The beta end date for Splitgate 2 was revealed through a new update on their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>. The announcement shows that the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside seasonal “rank” progress on December 4. Moreover, the beta servers will be taken down on the same day to prepare for the relaunch later that month. Details for Splitgate 2’s final beta playlist are live, and it kicked off on November 22. </p>



<p>The final Beta playtest for Splitgate 2 features Karman Station, a new power weapon, and some party modes. Karman Station was the first map ever made at 1047 games and features thoughtful adjustments to fit the modern sandbox. The final beta will also bring back the Rail Gun and will focus on a Party Mix playlist featuring updated versions of Team SWAT, Team Fiesta &amp; Shotty Snipers with more to come.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-has-going-back-to-beta-changed-splitgate-2">How Has Going Back to Beta Changed Splitgate 2?</h2>



<p>The developers also spoke about how the beta has helped the title, revealing that they have “rebuilt the entire foundation around what makes Splitgate special: portals, movement, and pure gunplay.” Factions have been removed entirely, and abilities have been reimagined as power-ups. Classic roundless modes like King of the Hill, Domination, and Team Deathmatch are back and added Classic Arena. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have introduced new maps, new weapons, reworked the menus, and refined systems based on Player feedback. They have also added portal overloading and EMPs, which change how map control works. Equipment has been streamlined for combat clarity, controller feel has been tuned, critical bugs have been fixed, and countless optimizations have been made. </p>



<p>In other news, the Splitgate 2 devs have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-devs-beg-fans-give-us-one-more-chance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begged fans for one more chance</a> at their relaunch. Additionally, 1047 Games held <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developer-holds-another-round-of-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another round of layoffs</a> to go back to beta.

<p>A new leak for Sonic Racing CrossWorlds reveals that the Pac-Man DLC is expected to arrive in January 2026. </p>



<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds has been out for some time now, bringing good competition to the kart racing space. Recently, we also learned that the game will be facing Mario Kart World next month, with the title receiving a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-releases-for-switch-2-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 release date</a>. Now, the next DLC’s release window for the title has been leaked. </p>

<p>The release window for Sonic Racing CrossWorlds’ Pac-Man DLC was revealed by a user on <a href="https://x.com/8T8999/status/1992775917945700779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Their recent post includes an in-game screenshot with “Crossover Course, Release expected in January” written on it. The course is locked and Pac-Man-themed, with Pac-Man himself driving a kart alongside Sonic. When asked how they came across this find, the user revealed that they updated the game before the Pac-Man festival, and the devs let them in “an hour early”. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is really living up to its name, crossing over with as many franchises as possible. The game has already collaborated with the likes of Persona, Like a Dragon, Minecraft, and more. The latest collaboration is with SpongeBob SquarePants, which, along with new racers, machines, courses, and more, also brought the SpongeBob SquarePants festival, which introduced additional rewards players can acquire.  </p>

<p>A 10-minute video of a Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake gameplay presentation leak has appeared online. It shows live motion capture scenes being played out, discusses the story, and important changes for Farah.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming recently provided a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake release update</a>. The game is still happening, it’s still in development, and we shouldn’t have to wait too much longer.</p>



<p>In the meantime, a huge leak has emerged—which Ubisoft initially had removed for copyright—showing what appears to be a focus group presentation, and it’s now viewable online.</p>

<p>The video was first reported on the Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p65pyn/leaked_pitch_deck_for_prince_of_persia_sands_of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumors</a> page by siliconwolf13. It claimed to be a “Leaked pitch deck for Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake from Q1 2024.”</p>



<p>Meaning, the presentation is nearly two years old at this point.</p>







<p>The thread was updated to say that the original video was pulled from YouTube, and the reasoning is clear-cut: “This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Ubisoft.”</p>



<p>This video is very real, and Ubisoft did not want anyone to see this. The good news is that the video has been reuploaded and mirrored to avoid further copyright claims.</p>



<p>It starts with a brief explanation of the Princess Farah character, running through her profile. It then guides us through the Sands of Time Remake story, before showing off live-action motion capture. The video quality isn’t the best, and the gameplay looks like it’s very much in the alpha stages. But it’s fascinating to see where the game started.</p>



<p>We also learn about how Farah has grown in the remake. She’s no longer an innocent support character, and <strong>Farah comes equipped with a bow to protect herself</strong>. The presentation also mentions players can “Parkour a world rebuilt from the ground up, <strong>expanded with 2 new locations.</strong>“</p>
