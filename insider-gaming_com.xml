            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft’s On-Hold Financial Report Will Be Published Before Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-on-hold-financial-report-published/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft%E2%80%99s-on-hold-financial-report-will-be-published-before-friday.1358284/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed that the H1 FY 2025-26 report that was recently put on hold will be published ‘before the opening of trading on Friday 21st November 2025’. This news comes mere days after Ubisoft delayed the release of the report and put a hold on trading, fuelling widespread speculation.</p>



<p>The leading belief was that Ubisoft was going to uncover something huge, such as an imminent buyout. That has not proven to be the case thus far, but at the very least, we’ll have fresh numbers to examine before Friday.</p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-to-reveal-performance">Ubisoft to Reveal Performance</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cfo-internal-memo/">a report</a> circulated by Insider Gaming last week, Ubisoft’s Chief Financial Officer explained why a hold had been put on trading:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to let you know that we are taking extra time to finalize the closing of the semester, and as a result we will publish our first-half earnings results in the coming days instead of tonight.</p>



<p>Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time. To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. </p>



<p>I encourage you all to listen to the conference call – which will be available via the Investor section of our site — just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has now been confirmed that the financial release will drop before trading opens on Friday, which means it’ll probably be published <strong>tomorrow</strong>. Despite trying to remain cool and prevent ‘unnecessary speculation’, Ubisoft sparked just that by this action, which has mostly gone unanswered.</p>







<p>In a recent filing, Ubisoft’s United Kingdom arm stressed that the face of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-people-playing-fewer-games-struggling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games industry is changing</a> as people ‘play fewer games for longer’, which is causing standalone, single releases to ‘struggle to stand out’.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-2018-has-allegedly-been-copied-by-a-2024-indian-animated-movie/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/god-of-war-2018-has-allegedly-been-copied-by-a-2024-indian-animated-movie.1358281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought a 7-year-old game couldn’t have one of its most iconic action scenes imitated by an animated Indian film, then think again. Accusations have suddenly come to light that Mahavatar Narashimha blatantly copies some of God of War 2018’s most iconic fight scenes.</p>



<p>Santa Monica’s 2018 reboot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-developers-new-ip-was-cancelled-after-investing-25-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> is a masterpiece. The combat is classic Kratos chaos, and its boss fights and action sequences go up a notch. Who can forget the opening sequence between Kratos and Baldur? Not Mahavatar Narashimha, apparently.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-and-mahavatar-narashimha-have-something-in-common">God of War And Mahavatar Narashimha Have Something In Common?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sometimes, art imitates art. Credit to Santa Monica</figcaption></figure>



<p>It wouldn’t be a shock if you’ve never heard of Mahavatar Narashimha. The Indian animated movie isn’t well-known outside the country of its origin. Even though it was first debuted at the International Film Festival of India in 2024, it only got a proper theatrical release this year.</p>



<p>It’s been a few months since its July 2025 debut on the silver screen. However, one narrative has suddenly come to the fore: One of Mahavatar Narashimha’s sequences looks like a direct copy of Kratos and Baldur’s first encounter.</p>



<p>X account <a href="https://x.com/BT_BlackThunder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Thunder</a> has done a side-by-side video, showing the God of War sequence, and the alleged Mahavatar Narashimha imitation. The 19-second clip features Mahavatar Narashimha’s character being sent flying through the air—like Kratos—before crashing and lying face-first on the floor—like Kratos.</p>



<p>The next few seconds are unnervingly identical as each antagonist flies toward the character, misses, and stands up menacingly. Both heroes then rip a tree out of the ground, before being tackled and attacked in (again) frame-by-frame copies of one another.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You can be the judge on this one. It’s not like this would be the first time something has ever copied something else; it’s just odd. Do you think this is nothing more than a happy coincidence? Or is Mahavatar Narashimha blatantly honoring Santa Monica’s game?
