<p>Massive Entertainment has shared a message on social media confirming that Julian Gerighty, executive producer on The Division franchise, is stepping down and transitioning to a new role at Battlefield Studios. This takes Gerighty from Ubisoft to Electronic Arts, moving from one shooter series to another.</p>



<p>Gerighty has been at Ubisoft for more than fifteen years and recently appeared in interviews talking about the future of The Division, making bold promises about The Division 3.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-division-s-executive-producer-is-moving-on">The Division’s Executive Producer is Moving On</h2>



<p>In a recent post on social media, Massive Entertainment shared the message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today, we want to share that Julian Gerighty, Executive Producer on the Tom Clancy’s The Division franchise is heading off to a new adventure at Battlefield Studios. While we’ll miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we’ll continue to bring hte world he’s been part of creating to our players for years to come.</p>



<p>Julian, your legacy is part of this studio and remember: once an Agent, always an Agent.</p>



<p>For our players, don’t worry. Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with an ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence, and The Division 3</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Days ago, Gerighty spoke on The Division 3, stressing it’s shaping up to be ‘a monster’ and suggesting it will have the same impact on the industry as the first Division game, released back in 2016.</p>

            <guid>1408165</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on social media, Battlestate Games has asked for <strong>your help </strong>picking upcoming collaborations and crossovers with other projects. This isn’t a request that’s exclusive to <strong>games</strong>, as the team asked for opinions on ‘games <strong>or</strong> projects’ that could be a ‘great fit’ for Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>It was recently suggested that an Escape from Duckov collaboration might be incoming, which honestly writes itself. But there’s a whole world of brands out there that would make perfect sense for an Escape from Tarkov collaboration.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-brands-do-you-want-in-escape-from-tarkov">What Brands Do You Want in Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p>Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, posted a message <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/2012116918694752296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> asking fans for help:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>recently the team and I have been discussing potential collaborations with other projects, and I’d love to hear your thoughts. What game or project do you think would be a great fit for EFT for a collab with?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Escape from Tarkov, the pioneering extraction shooter that has been evolving for a decade, has typically steered clear of the typical collaboration topics that live-service games so regularly explore. It’s not a game known for skin packs, crossover bundles, or LTMs, which is something fans have been appreciative of over the years.</p>



<p>However, that looks set to change now that Escape from Tarkov is a ‘1.0’ title and is exploring more ways to monetize and expand.</p>



<p>Days ago, it was suggested by Team Soda and Bilibili that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-tarkov-collaboration-coming/">Escape from Duckov x Escape from Tarkov crossover</a> is on the horizon. This would make brilliant sense, as both games are extraction shooters that mirror each other closely, but what other brands could surface or enter the space?</p>



<p>Fans were quick to make suggestions on social media under Buyanov’s post.</p>



<p>One suggested more alignment with similar games, like ARC Raiders and Gray Zone Warfare. Another suggested STALKER makes sense, but there might be something political preventing Russian and Ukrainian developers from joining forces.</p>



<p>In one comment, a user poked fun at Escape from Tarkov’s more prolific problems, writing: ‘Collab with Riot Games and add Vanguard anti-cheat.’</p>



<p>It’s unlikely we’ll see Escape from Tarkov become the next Fortnite when it comes to collaborations, but it’s cool to imagine the potential.</p>

<p>Resident Evil 5’s voice actor is teasing a new announcement coming this March, during the franchise’s 30th Anniversary. </p>



<p>Capcom’s next big title, Resident Evil Requiem, arrives next month on February 27, 2026. The developers just provided us with another trailer, showcasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-showcase-reveals-new-leon-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon Kennedy’s gameplay</a> in the process. However, after this title, what’s next for the franchise might be revealed during the 30th Anniversary event in March. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-5-s-sheva-alomar-teasing-something-for-march-2026">Resident Evil 5’s Sheva Alomar Teasing Something for March 2026</h2>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qdt1yu/eva_la_dare_va_from_sheva_alomar_re5_is_teasing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, the voice actor for Karen Dyer from Resident Evil 5, Sheva Alomar, has posted a cryptic video on their official <a href="https://x.com/KarenShevaEva/status/2011868483194392926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The video’s caption states that “got a few fun things lined up for March. Stay Tuned!. Additionally, the video itself has another caption that reads “When you know something, but can’t share it with the world…yet.” </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fans from the community have already started making all kinds of speculation from this post, with many hoping that this could be a tease for a possible Resident Evil 5 Remake. At the same time, there are also speculations that Alomar will star in another Resident Evil movie, with Resident Evil: Death Island’s writer, Makoto Fukami, mentioning in a 2023 <a href="https://www.fangoria.com/resident-evil-death-island-writer-would-love-to-take-the-carnage-to-antarctica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fangoria</a> interview that he would “love to bring back characters like Barry Burton or Sheva Alomar.” </p>



<p>Additionally, there was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-5-remake-not-in-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a claim</a> from last year that stated Resident Evil 5 Remake was not in development. Whatever this announcement is, players will have to wait until Resident Evil’s 30th Anniversary to know for sure, and all players are hoping that more games are announced this year. </p>







<p>In other news, PlayStation was recently seen promoting a strange Resident Evil rip-off, ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-promote-resident-evil-rip-off-ebola-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ebola Village</a>‘. Additionally, Requiem’s director has stated that the upcoming title is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-almost-like-having-two-games-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost like having two games</a>“.

<p>A new season has arrived in Marvel Rivals, headlined by the addition of Deadpool, and there’s a new Battle Pass to consider purchasing in Season 6.</p>



<p>Battle Passes in Marvel Rivals include a wide array of cosmetic rewards, and Insider Gaming has the breakdown of everything included in the Season 6 pass, alongside the price and a verdict of whether it’s worth buying.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-marvel-rivals-season-6-battle-pass">How Much is the Marvel Rivals Season 6 Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to unlock. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals Season 6 Battle Pass is priced at 990 Lattice, which equates to around $9.99, but there are other options available.</strong></p>



<p>For 2100 Lattice, you receive an immediate 2800 Chrono Tokens to unlock rewards and receive an additional 20% Chrono Tokens Acquisition bonus for the duration of the season to increase the amount you earn for each quest completed.</p>



<p>You can purchase the Battle Pass through currency earned in-game, and, once unlocked, it’s permanently available, so you can work through it at your own pace.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-marvel-rivals-season-6-battle-pass">All Rewards in Marvel Rivals Season 6 Battle Pass</h2>



<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals Season 6 Battle Pass has 12 pages stacked with rewards, including costumes that can’t be obtained anywhere else, two of which are included in the free pass.</strong></p>



<p>Without splashing out on the pass, a free costume is available for Storm and Blade, while purchasing the pass unlocks rewards for the likes of Venom, Winter Soldier, Invisible Woman, and Mantis.</p>



<p>For a full breakdown of all the rewards in the Season 6 Battle Pass, take a look at the table below.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-marvel-rivals-season-6-battle-pass-worth-it">Is the Marvel Rivals Season 6 Battle Pass Worth it?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, the Season 6 Battle Pass in Marvel Rivals is arguably the weakest to be introduced since launch, and, unless you’re in love with one of the premium skins, it’s an easy one to skip.</strong></p>



<p>The characters featured, including Venom, Wolverine, Winter Soldier, and Invisible Woman, all have better costumes already available in the game, so it’s hard to justify splashing out on the pass.</p>



<p>Not having a Deadpool skin included is a major disappointment, considering how high the excitement levels have been for his addition, and you’d be better off saving your Lattice for a different purchase.</p>
