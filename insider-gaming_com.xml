<p>Activision has announced that all players of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone will receive 20 Battle Pass Tier skips. The move comes as a thank you to players as updates for the game wind down ahead of the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>In order to get your free Battle Pass Tier skips, players simply have to login to either Black Ops 6 or Warzone between now and September 16. Once you do, they will automatically be added to your account.</p>



<p>Activision says that the Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded update will <strong>“be larger on some platforms”</strong> due to <strong>“reorganizing&nbsp;Call of Duty&nbsp;content to prepare for the&nbsp;Black Ops 7&nbsp;Beta on October 2.”</strong> Because of the size of the update, Activision will be giving players a number of double XP tokens on all platforms.</p>



<p>Those who download the update and login to the game between September 4 and October 1 will get <strong>five 1-hour double player XP tokens</strong>, <strong>five 1-hour double weapon XP tokens</strong>, and <strong>five 1-hour double Battle Pass XP tokens</strong>. That equates to 15 hours of double XP in order to unlock and level up what you’re still grinding for. </p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded launches on September 5. The update includes a new multiplayer map, more Zombies content, new and returning modes, and more. Full details for the update can be found on the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-season-05-reloaded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty website</a>.</p>
