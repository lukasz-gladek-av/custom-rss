<p>Electronic Arts (EA) has removed a “controversial” Battlefield 6 skin from both the base Battlefield 6 multiplayer and REDSEC in response to backlash online: “Wicked Grin”</p>



<p>The Wicked Grin is black and blue skin with a sharp-toothed design on the mask.  It was announced as a new skin for players to unlock as part of Battlefield 6 Season 1, but immediately, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wicked-grin-skin-argument/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players took to platforms</a> like Reddit to voice their frustrations.</p>



<p>There were even players vowing not to revive anyone who was using the skin in-game. </p>



<p>Season 1 began on October 1, and within days, the skin was quietly removed as players continued to comment on the skin. There’s been absolutely no communication from EA on the decision.</p>



<p>In its place is a new “Standard Issue” military skin that you can see below, along with the Wicked Grin Skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA for comment on why the Wicked Grin skin was removed. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

<p>The viral horror sensation Poppy Playtime is back with Chapter 5 and, in honor of Halloween, a new teaser is out. Furthermore, we now know some more on what to expect from the next chapter in the series.</p>



<p>Mascot Horror has been at the forefront of the indie scene for quite some time. Starting with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-megan-fox-matpat-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Five Nights at Freddy’s</a>, the genre has developed into an almost foolproof shot to success. Games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-shown-at-summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Choo-Choo Charlie</a>, Indigo Park, and Garten of BanBan have rose in popularity from following FNAF’s footsteps. One such series, Mob Entertainment’s Poppy Playtime, has been one of the bigger successes. With recognizable characters like Huggy Wuggy, Doey, and CatNap, fans worldwide have been anticipating the next chapter of the franchise. Fortunately, just in time for Halloween, we got a new teaser and some plot to go with it.</p>

<p>Mob Entertainment has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released a new trailer</a> for <strong>Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5</strong>. While the video isn’t long, lasting less than a minute, it’s certain to make fans go nuts with theories and the like. There’s a lot to go off of, too, as specific locations like a science lab are shown along with mysterious goop and a burning Poppy billboard. Unfortunately, <strong>no pricing or release date was announced</strong>, though the game is <strong>now available for wishlisting</strong> on <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWlYYXJZYlJyb0NpWEF3X1dGUG5IeHRKckJqZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsTDBLdTh3TVpvdEJ3X20xRE1QWGdiVU9sR2hlQW5jS2dic29pNTNXdDhLNmtIaFRzSHVvMGMxSFRweFNDOU5NNF9Nd1hDYlhocjlVT3RMTTJzeDBXN3FPckRYcTEyeEZ3QnpMa2dlUGZFRWJ4YWdwcw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggywug.co%2F4oK8fPx&amp;v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> </strong>and the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbUQ4eWZjbUNuWFVjbUxDY1o0b0pCeENRU3BuQXxBQ3Jtc0tsNkxVNzdqa1pFbllxV3ByR1hKZmFvVVdKSWFkSjl5RXF1NjUzd1JFZGtnLWhMMUV4UlhCaEZ4QjJIZ3YwaUtUenR4bFhiOGlhcWNQX2pxQXRkMEdBdGFDWXdyNGd5ZEN4Y3JjTEgwWGNrWl9WMHhVMA&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggywug.co%2F4qswKSW&amp;v=NGSn5cY0o3k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a></strong>.</p>



<p>However, we do know some information regarding the game’s plot. The game takes place after the events of Chapter 4. Mob Entertainment states on the official Steam page,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5, players must prepare to face off against the deadly puppetmaster behind the horrifying events of Playtime Co. Solve devious puzzles and overcome dangerous obstacles as the true rotten heart at the center of Playtime Co. draws nearer. Traverse this new realm of shadows in a fight for survival (and the truth) with Playtime’s security system Huggy Wuggy in hot pursuit and separated from your only allies. Will you finally end this nightmare, or fall victim to the puppet master’s twisted madness?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If Chapter 5 is as big as previous entries, we may see Poppy Playtime get back into the spotlight once again. Even if you haven’t played any games in the series, it’s sure to deliver some scares galore. Given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-features-largest-ever-collabs-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite added Poppy Playtime</a> to its Fortnitemares this year, it’s a pretty good time to get into the series and an even better time to be a fan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/advantage-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/advantage-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-review%E2%80%94pro-perfection-without-paying-full-price.1340587/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On paper, the&nbsp;PowerA Advantage Wireless Controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 seem like a more affordable way to enjoy the premium nuances of an official Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. PowerA has always excelled at delivering classy imitators, all while adding its own signature flair through creative designs and licensed crossovers.</p>



<p>When I was asked to check out PowerA’s Advantage Wireless Controller lineup of Switch 2 Pro controllers, it was a no-brainer. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-production-pipeline-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a>‘s official accessories have always been notoriously expensive—it costs <strong>$89.99 for another set of Joy-Con 2 controllers</strong>, for example! If you’re worried about investing a lot of money into a third-party accessory or peripheral device, I’m here to tell you that your doubts are in vain. Read on for my full Advantage Wireless Controller Switch 2 Controller review.</p>



<h2 id="h-pro-kemon-gotta-catch-em-all">Pro-kemon, Gotta Catch ‘Em All!</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It looks utterly gorgeous. Credit to PowerA</figcaption></figure>



<p>From the box to the packaging to the controller itself, this feels like a premium product. The <a href="https://www.powera.com.au/collections/all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerA</a> Advantage Wireless Controller is ‘Pro’ in every sense of the word. I reviewed the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions edition, but the range also features a more classic-looking ‘<strong>Black</strong>‘ design, in line with the actual Switch 2 Pro controller, and the more vibrant ‘<strong>Mario &amp; Friends</strong>‘ is a must-have for Mario fans. </p>



<p>As a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-year-revenue-estimates-hit-1-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> connoisseur myself, I had to have Mega Evolutions. It’s simply incredible to look at. The front-facing design is compartmentalized into Lucario, Pikachu, and Mewtwo segments. They team up and intertwine to create a canvas of cohesive colors, and they’re presented on, in essence, a smooth-shaven controller surface—<strong>It’s the ASMR equivalent of sleek architecture</strong>. </p>



<p>The main Y, X, A, and B buttons have a nice purple finish to align with Mewtwo’s colors, and the top of the device—where a centrally-placed USB-C slot awaits—has a lovely yellow finish wrapped around the curved edges. The analog sticks are where your thumbs will be the majority of the time. A stark opposite to the Pro controller is having grippy barbs around each rubber stick. They add an extra layer of grip, and give you a feel of control that its more expensive contemporary could learn a thing or two from.</p>



<p>Lightweight is the best way to describe the controller, and it sits beautifully in my hands. The buttons are clicky and responsive, and my only real reservation about the design is that the <strong>controller’s main functionality buttons are all in a line along the bottom of the controller</strong>. I don’t think PowerA has done this with previous Switch controller designs. Throughout my playtime with the device, I often found myself trying to press the ‘+’ button, thinking it was in the middle of the controller, only to be met with empty space. Again, it’s the <em>only </em>minor inconvenience I’ve encountered with the design and presentation, and you get used to it after a while.</p>



<h2 id="h-pro-performance-across-the-board">Pro Performance Across The Board</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Spoilt for choice? Credit to PowerA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The PowerA Advantage Wireless Switch 2 Controller will cost you <strong>$69.99</strong>, compared to the more eye-watering <strong>$84.99</strong> of the official Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. After countless hours with the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions controller, I don’t see any reason to pay the extra $15. Plus, you don’t get the novelty and variety of these bespoke designs.</p>



<p>In fact, the only major performance discrepancy of note is the <strong>battery life</strong>: You get roughly 40 hours for the official controller versus 30 hours with the PowerA model. It’s up to you if you think the extra money is worth a few more hours, but I charge my controller regularly, and I have immediate access to a USB-C cable next to the couch as a contingency for worst-case scenarios. </p>



<p><strong>PowerA has also thrown in a 10ft / 3m USB-C charging cable as a bonus.</strong></p>



<p>I tested the controller across a collection of my Switch games: Mario Kart World, Pokémon Scarlet, and Super Mario Party Jamboree. <strong>I experienced zero issues</strong>; the controller connected to my Switch 2 very quickly, and it behaves just like a Pro controller should. It also doesn’t skimp on the additional buttons, enabling you to reconfigure the controls. If you feel the X button is too far away for the game you’re playing and it’s compromising your playstyle, simply remap it to either of the GR/GL buttons.</p>



<p>The GR and GL buttons are present on the controller’s rear area of the handles, tucked inside. They sync up with your middle fingers and give you the liberty to tweak your setup. It also has real-time sensors and motion controls as standard—along with a C Button for Switch 2 GameChat.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict">Verdict</h2>



<p>Unless another pro controller comes along that narrowly edges out the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions design, this is easily my new, full-time Nintendo Switch 2 controller moving forward. The analog sticks are unbelievably satisfying to use and tailor-made to cushion your thumbs. The overall design is smooth, simple, light, and feels satisfying to use. The controller’s performance is absolutely what it needs to be, and unless you want to pay a few more dollars for additional battery life, you can’t go wrong with any of the PowerA Advantage Wireless Controllers For Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>I hope you enjoyed my Advantage Wireless Controller For Nintendo Switch 2 review. Let me know if you end up buying one of the controllers.
