<p>Pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem are set to go live on October 29, along with a special series-themed video.</p>



<p>The Resident Evil franchise has been delivering the scares since 1996. With the 30th anniversary coming next year, a new entry, Resident Evil Requiem, is releasing on February 27th, 2026. From what we’ve seen (and played), it looks to capitalize on what makes the series iconic: terrifying creatures and survival skills. If you cannot wait to return to Raccoon City, like I am, we know know when pre-orders will start. Plus, we’ll get an extra special video to go along with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-special-video-requiem-pre-orders-to-release-on-october-29th">Resident Evil Special Video, Requiem Pre-Orders To Release On October 29th</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The nightmare begins soon. <br>Resident Evil Requiem pre-orders will start on October 29th, US time. Plus, we'll be releasing a video celebrating the Resident Evil franchise at the same time (note: no new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay will be shown). Keep an eye out.… <a href="https://t.co/M8ssS8PJsS">pic.twitter.com/M8ssS8PJsS</a></p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1976773536883609715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1976773536883609715?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a>, Capcom has announced that pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem will go live on October 29th, 2025. No specifics were given as for what time that will be other than “US time”. In addition, a special video celebrating the Resident Evil series will premiere on October 29th as well. Unfortunately for fans hoping to see more Requiem gameplay, Capcom confirmed that no new footage will be shown.</p>



<p>However, for the optimists in the room, it doesn’t confirm that nothing new from the series will be shown. Rumors of a remake of Resident Evil 0, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-resident-evil-5-getting-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5</a>, and Code Veronica have made the rounds for a while. Perhaps we could see a reveal for one of those titles during the video? Furthermore, the film adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-2026-resident-evil-movie-will-be-in-spirit-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-2026-resident-evil-movie-will-be-in-spirit-of-games/"> Evil</a>, directed by Weapon’s Zach Cregger is currently in production. Maybe we’ll see some footage or principal photography? We’ll just have to wait and see on October 29th.</p>

<p>Are you looking to play PowerWash Simulator 2 in early access? Are you hoping for any chance to jump in as soon as possible?</p>



<p>With the first game being a surprise hit, PowerWash Simulator 2 is looking to be another rewarding experience, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-powerwash-simulator-2-splitscreen-local-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this time with more friends</a>.</p>



<p>Here is everything you need to know about any potential PowerWash Simulator 2 early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-early-access">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You have to wait just like everyone else to clean this. Image via FuturLab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access period in PowerWash Simulator 2. The game’s full release is set for October 23, which is when everyone will be able to access the game.</strong></p>



<p>The original <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator</a> was released into early access, in the way that it did not have its 1.0 release until much later, but that is not the case with the sequel. All content in PowerWash Simulator 2 can be considered the game’s full launch, with any future maps likely coming via DLC packs, like the first game saw.</p>



<p>It is not necessarily surprising that there is no early access for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>. Typically, only very large games offer that kind of benefit for buying a deluxe edition or something like that. With a smaller, but still anticipated, game like this, that doesn’t happen much.</p>



<p>With that said, it is nice to see the game have a full 1.0 release so soon after the release date announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-a-demo">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have a Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, there is a demo available for download for PowerWash Simulator 2, but it is only available on Steam. There is no demo for the game on Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S, at least as of this writing.</strong></p>



<p>In the demo, you get a look at the early portion of the game, with two jobs available: Removal Van and Public Facility. You can also walk around your home base and see how this new area will be in the full game.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, with the demo only available on Steam, console players are left out of the early fun. There is always a chance that these storefronts will get access to the demo before the game releases, but as of now, there is no indication that it is happening.</p>

<p>The Haunted Masquerade in Overwatch 2 is the game’s latest Halloween event, bringing with it a new game mode, skins, and more content in a new season update.</p>



<p>While Overwatch was dealing with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/almost-half-of-players-who-quit-overwatch-jumped-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loss of players due to Marvel Rivals</a> about a year ago, the game has been making a resurgence with some great content updates, and this looks to be the latest.</p>



<p>Here is when the Haunted Masquerade starts in Overwatch 2 and all the content you can expect in it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-overwatch-2-haunted-masquerade">When is the Overwatch 2 Haunted Masquerade?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The new Stadium additions. Image by Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Haunted Masquerade Halloween event in Overwatch 2 begins on Tuesday, October 14, alongside the update to Season 19.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24232473/beware-a-haunted-masquerade-begins-in-season-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Season 19 in Overwatch 2</a> brings a bunch of Halloween content, like the Haunted Masquerade and the return of Junkenstein’s Revenge, as well as a mythic hero skin for Lifeweaver and a mythic weapon skin for Kiriko. For the first time, Junkrat will also receive a mythic hero skin when the midseason update happens in November.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-stadium-a-round-based-competitive-mode-that-borrows-from-deadlock-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Stadium mode</a> is getting three more heroes added to the mix in Hazard, Torbjorn, and Sojourn. Stadium is also getting a new shop item called gadgets that will help to turn the tide in your favor for battle.</p>



<p>Outside of that, you can expect the usual rotation of new skins and bundles in the shop themed around archangels and spirits.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-overwatch-2-haunted-masquerade-mode">What is the Overwatch 2 Haunted Masquerade Mode?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Be sure to have friends wear each other’s masks for a boost! Image by Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Haunted Masquerade in Overwatch 2 is a limited-time mode that allows players to first select the hero they want to play and then choose a mask of a different hero in the spawn room to gain a special ability for that match.</strong></p>



<p>After you select your mask, your hero will instantly get a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-adds-ability-altering-perks-brings-back-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small perk power-up</a>. For example, putting on a Genji mask will give whatever hero you are playing a double jump, or Reaper’s mask will heal you slightly as you deal damage to enemies.</p>



<p>That’s not all, though, as masks have a little extra surprise if you and a team member select lore-appropriate heroes. For example, if your team has Mei and Juno and they have each other’s masks, their ultimates will combine, bringing in an Orbital Ray boost to your teammates, while also having Blizzard freeze enemies in range.</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-crossover-release-date-all-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch 2</a> Halloween event looks to be a chaotic arcade mode that you and your friends can play throughout October. Be sure to experiment with the masks that work best for your chosen heroes and have fun out there.</p>
