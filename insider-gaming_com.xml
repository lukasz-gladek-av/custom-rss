<p>The Call of Duty League’s Major I tournament is unravelling in Madrid as we speak. It’s the first major CDL event in Europe in several years, and the fans are <strong>electric</strong>. One player who wants to see more events in Europe is OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy, who I caught up with after OpTic’s close win over LA Guerrillas M8.</p>



<p>It has been <strong>many years </strong>since Call of Duty esports (outside of Warzone) landed in London, but that’s a fan – and a player – favourite for a future event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-love-the-eu-crowd">‘I Love The EU Crowd’</h2>



<p>Speaking after a 3 – 2 win over LAG that was closer than many people expected, Shotzzy revealed his love for the EU crowd:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I love the EU crowd, they’re insane. I love y’all.</p>



<p>I will say you guys are definitely the better crowd than NA, but obviously we love NA, so.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When I probed and asked if Shotzzy wanted to go anywhere else in Europe, he revealed: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d say London. I had a really bad interview back then, in London, so I’ve got to get my get back.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic’s Huke, who started with the team following Pred’s sudden departure last year, mirrored Shotzzy’s sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think the EU crowd is crazy, I’m not going to lie – in a good way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic Texas came into Major I as the first seed, but a 2 – 3 loss handed down by the Miami Heretics (damn that curse) sent the team into the elimination bracket. Following a win over LAG M8, OpTic now moves forward to face the Carolina Royal Ravens.</p>



<p>At the first CDL Minor tournament, the Royal Ravens forcefully ejected OpTic Texas from the running, before being promptly eliminated by FaZe. Could this be an opportunity for OpTic Texas to, as Shotzzy puts it, ‘get their get back’?</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more of the latest news from the CDL Major I tournament in Madrid.</p>

<p>Welcome everyone to Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast for January 31, 2025. In this week’s episode: Xbox is doubling down on multiplatform releases, Battlefield doesn’t want to screw up again, and the layoffs continue across the games industry.</p>



<p>Mike, Grant, and Albert also play quick gaming trivia that Grant may or may not have been prepared for. Oh, and Tom Henderson joins to talk about the latest gaming rumors and speculation regarding Ubisoft (again), the next God of War game being set in Egypt, and even Marvel Rivals’ developers hiding fake characters in the game in order to catch leakers.</p>
