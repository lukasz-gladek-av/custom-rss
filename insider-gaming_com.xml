<p>The 2026 Street Fighter 6 movie is shaping up nicely. Cody Rhodes has been touted as one of the big-name stars set to light up the Street Fighter stage, and while it‚Äôs not official, we think we‚Äôve gotten an idea of how Guile could look, presumably, with Cody playing (and looking) the part.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs not uncommon for WWE superstars to transition from the hallowed grounds of the squared circle to the silver screen. The likes of Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, and Rowdy Roddy Piper famously paved the way. Dwayne ‚ÄòThe Rock‚Äô Johnson was the one to make the complete leap from professional wrestler to actor.</p>



<p>Others have followed suit‚Äîsuch as John Cena‚Äîand the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-has-reportedly-lined-up-chun-li-balrog-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Street Fighter</a> movie could catapult Cody Rhodes into greater superstardom.</p>

<p>Actor and comedian <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andrewschulz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Andrew Schulz</a> is playing Dan in the Street Fighter movie. They recently took to their personal Instagram page to share a story showing the shadow of someone sporting an iconic hairstyle‚ÄîGuile from Street Fighter.</p>



<p>Guile‚Äôs inverted shaven style is equal parts bizarre and legendary. I‚Äôve never tried to replicate it, and it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm going to try‚Äîalthough it‚Äôs nothing a few cans of hairspray couldn‚Äôt sort.</p>



<p>Again, we‚Äôve not had official confirmation that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-casts-m-bison-and-eyes-wwes-cody-rhodes-for-guile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cody Rhodes is playing Guile</a>. Eagle-eyed fans can infer this to be the case if they look at the song mentioned in the IG story. If you didn‚Äôt know, Kingdom by Downstait is Rhodes‚Äô famous theme song he‚Äôs used for years. Put 2 and 2 together, and I think we get the picture.</p>

<p>The Street Fighter Movie cast also features more rumors and confirmed names, including Jason Momoa, 50 Cent, and fellow WWE star Roman Reigns.</p>



<p>Will the Street Fighter movie be a knockout? Or will it be a swing and a miss? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders is taking center stage at the latest Nintendo Direct showcase, announced for tomorrow.</p>



<p>Due for release on Nintendo Switch 2 later this year, Kirby Air Riders is the first new game in the franchise since 2022‚Äôs Kirby and the Forgotten Land and is one of the big remaining Switch 2 launches this year.</p>



<p>The latest Nintendo Direct continues the approach of focusing on a single game rather than several titles, an approach already seen this year with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-revealed-during-mario-kart-world-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-announced-by-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and plenty of details are set to be revealed.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-direct-announced-for-august-19">Nintendo Direct Announced For August 19</h2>

<p>In a social media <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1957427985625088145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Nintendo announced the Kirby Air Raiders Direct would take place on August 19 at 6am PT/8am CT/9am ET/2pm BST/11pm AEST.</p>



<p>The announcement stated the livestream presentation will ‚Äúlast 45 minutes‚Äù and provides an ‚Äúin-depth look‚Äù at the title, releasing exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>A social media <a href="https://x.com/KirbyAirRiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a> for Kirby Air Riders then went live, which will share the ‚Äúlatest announcements and updates‚Äù for the title, which will likely be extremely active following the Nintendo Direct showcase.</p>



<p>Details on exactly what will be shown are unknown, though it‚Äôs highly likely that a release date will be provided given we‚Äôre approaching the latter end of 2025 and details so far have not been shared.</p>



<p>Further reveals from Nintendo for Switch 2 could be on the cards this week at Gamescom, where the company‚Äôs attendance is confirmed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Open Beta Poll Reveals Community‚Äôs Favorite Map]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-poll-reveals-communitys-favorite-map/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-open-beta-poll-reveals-community%E2%80%99s-favorite-map.1272600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta has ended. For two weekends, hundreds of thousands of players went to war with each other. Now that the dust and rubble have settled, it‚Äôs time to see what the community has judged to be the best Battlefield 6 map‚Äîand worst.</p>



<p>Battlefield has had its fair share of classic maps over the years. Everyone always wants to see a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-battlefield-games-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ranking of the best Battlefield games</a>, but we recently went one better. We broke down our favorite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/9-best-battlefield-maps-of-all-time-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield maps</a>, giving high praise to Wake Island and Caspian Border. It‚Äôs time to see which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> maps stood out.</p>



<h2 id="h-siege-of-cairo-leads-the-way-in-battlefield-6">Siege of Cairo Leads The Way in Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A clear winner. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, I‚Äôll cut straight to the chase, Siege of Cairo has comfortably been voted as the favorite Battlefield 6 map.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>, a poll was launched to find out the answer. It states that only roughly 10,000 votes were cast. Given that the Open Beta recorded well over 500,000 players, we get it‚Äôs a tiny percentage of the crowd. Still, it‚Äôs fun to analyze this portion of the data.</p>



<p>Out of Siege of Cairo, Liberation Peak, Empire State, and Iberian Offensive, Siege of Cairo came out on top with 47% of the vote. Liberation Peak was a distant second with 27%, Empire State recorded 16%, and Iberian Offensive only managed 11%.</p>



<p>These polls are always subjective, though. Personally, I loved Iberian Offensive. I wouldn‚Äôt have had it last (maybe Liberation Peak). </p>



<div><article><p><span>According to a community‚Äôs poll with over 10,000 votes via </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Battlefield</a><span>, Siege of Cairo is the most favourite map from </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a><span>‚Äòs Open Beta whereas Iberian Offensive is the less, favourite map.</span></p></article></div>



<p>But this is the time to tell us what you think. Do you agree with Siege of Cairo being number one? Or is it ranked too highly? Head to the comments to let us know. Plus, go to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to talk all things Battlefield 6.</p>
