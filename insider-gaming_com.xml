            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-new-pre-wipe-event-cultists/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-pre-wipe-event-gives-cultists-marked-keys-and-100-spawn-rates.1064256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-new-pre-wipe-event-cultists/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has rolled out another pre-wipe event for Escape from Tarkov, introducing a 100% spawn rate (at night) for Cultists across their main maps: Shoreline, Customs, and Woods. The latest update has equipped many of these Cultists with Marked Keys, which as you might know, open doors to some of the most high-value locations in the game.</p>



<p>Most recently, players were tackling a pre-wipe event in Escape from Tarkov that required them to kill 30 enemies on the Factory map to unlock Kappa, one of the most sought-after items in the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kill-cultists-make-gains">Kill Cultists, Make Gains</h2>



<p>This latest pre-wipe event for Tarkov comes with the following description on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The losses of both PMC factions during night-time operations have increased. The old-timers believe that this is due to the pilgrimage of the so-called “witnesses” to their marked circles. </p>



<p>There are reports of many of those hooded people carrying marked keys. Despite the increased danger, PMCs are now preparing for night raids and taking advantage of the fact that Mechanic started selling NVGs at a great discount.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, the large maps that accommodate Cultists (so, not Ground Zero or Factory) will have a 100% spawn rate for the faction <strong>at night only</strong>. Also, Mechanic has massively discounted NVGs like the GPNVG-18, which is selling for just 43,000 roubles at the moment.</p>



<p>When you kill Cultists, you’ll have a solid chance of picking up a range of Marked Keys from their bodies, which you can then turn into some great loot. Bear in mind that you’ll be competing with thousands of other players to access these locations, though.</p>



<p>As expected, this pre-wipe event is only available for PvP players, because the game’s PvE mode doesn’t accommodate forced wipes, so a <strong>pre-wipe event </strong>doesn’t make much sense.</p>



<p>As a bonus, you can secure Cultist Knives and trade them with Mechanic for coloured keycards.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the next Escape from Tarkov wipe will arrive around Christmas. Are you ready? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 has just released their first official crossover with none other than Killzone 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 collaboration is <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1869324489391268335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now live</a>, bringing some uniquely-themed cosmetics to the Superstore for players to grab. Apart from the new cosmetics, players also have the chance to receive an additional Killzone 2 reward, depending on their success with the ongoing Galatic War. Check out all the new Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>AC-1 Dutiful (Armor Set)</li>



<li>StA-52 Assault Rifle (Primary Weapon)</li>



<li>Strength In Our Arms (Player Banner)</li>



<li>Strength In Our Arms (Cape)&nbsp;</li>



<li>Assault Infantry (Player Title)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Apart from the Helldivers 2 x Killzone collaboration, Arrowhead has provided some new details about the Superstore. Player feedback has made them realise that “items are in rotation for too short a time”. Hence, the developers will temporarily test longer rotations, with Killzone cosmetics sticking around for 5 days per page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The collaboration with Killzone 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killzone-helldivers-warbond-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked a few days ago</a>; however, at the time, it was believed that two Armour Sets would make their way to the Superstore.

<p>It has been announced by the Esports World Cup Foundation that at next year’s monumental event in Riyadh, <strong>Chess </strong>will make an appearance. In recent years, Chess has been on the up and up in terms of digital gaming and streaming, and the centuries-old board game has earned a place alongside some of the world’s best competitive titles.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at the EWCF announced: ‘The ultimate game of strategy and intellect joins the lineup!’</p>

<h2 id="h-ancient-growth">Ancient Growth</h2>



<p>Chess.com, the number one digital site that services users of the game online, hit 150 million members just over a year ago as a craze swept the world. More players than ever before were finding their way into the ecosystem, and on streaming platforms like Twitch, the game saw a huge boom in viewership figures.</p>



<p>It all started at the beginning of 2021, with a spike taking place following a series of high-stakes tournaments. Before long, the grandmasters of Chess were appearing on these platforms, their profiles being boosted in many ways, such as through the popularisation of The Queen’s Gambit on Netflix.</p>



<p>In a milestone step, TSM signed Nikaru Nakamura as a creator and competitive Chess player. Soon after, Envy picked up the Botez sisters, a Canadian duo focused on streaming Chess and IRL content. </p>



<p>To celebrate the Esports World Cup announcement, Magnus Carlsen, a grandmaster of the game and one of the ambassadors surfacing for the EWC 2025, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m thrilled to see Chess join some of the biggest games in the world at the Esports World Cup</em>. </p>



<p>T<em>his partnership is an incredible opportunity to grow the game, by introducing Chess to new audiences and inspiring the next generation of players. Being part of the esports family is an amazing opportunity for Chess to broaden its reach to a massive group of esports fans.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>There will be a $1.5 million prize pool up for grabs – one of the largest in the history of Chess. It’ll be integrated as part of the Champions Chess Tour, and a new format will be introduced to allow for quicker matches that keep the excitement high while retaining the notions of strategy and tactics.</p>
