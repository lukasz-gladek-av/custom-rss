<p>More often than not, the management and simulation genre proves massive and complex. On PC, there are countless hotkeys to consider, and to the everyday player, it can feel overwhelming to remember every key combination necessary to quick-build or remove pathing sections. Hopefully, we can help. Here are a few of the most important hotkeys in Planet Coaster 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-important-planet-coaster-2-hotkeys-to-remember">Important Planet Coaster 2 Hotkeys To Remember</h2>



<p>I spent too long ignoring hotkeys and shortcuts in games in favor of simply clicking, and the day I started using hotkeys, I never returned. They make life easier. You can access nearly any menu or mechanic in the game without moving your hand from the keyboard. Of course, remembering every hotkey and shortcut command is initially challenging, but there’s no shame in keeping a guide like this one up on your phone or a second screen. </p>



<p>Here are a few Planet Coaster 2 hotkeys worth remembering:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>CTRL + Z</strong> — Undo</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + Y</strong> — Redo</li>



<li><strong>L</strong> — Light</li>



<li><strong>ALT</strong> — Radial Menu</li>



<li><strong>Right CTRL + Right SHIFT + G</strong> — Hide UI</li>



<li><strong>Z</strong> — Rotate 90 Degrees</li>



<li><strong>Hold Z</strong> — Rotate</li>



<li><strong>X</strong> — Advanced Move</li>



<li><strong>M</strong> — Move</li>



<li><strong>F</strong> — Snap Object to Wall Center</li>



<li><strong>P</strong> — Toggle Angle Snap</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + D</strong> — Duplicate Object</li>



<li><strong>R</strong> — Edit Building</li>



<li><strong>I</strong> — Multi Select</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are many more hotkeys and shortcuts in Planet Coaster 2, and you can find all of them within the settings menu, but I find you’ll use these more frequently than any other. It’s worth keeping this guide open for quick reference.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-playstation-and-steam-sales-%E2%80%9860-higher%E2%80%99-than-modern-warfare-3.1031604/</guid>

<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Treyarch’s Miles Leslie took a deep dive into the success of Black Ops 6. He was talking about the power of Game Pass and how it has allowed many ‘on-the-fence’ players to find their way into Call of Duty but mentioned that the difficulty will now rest in <strong>keeping those players </strong>on board.</p>



<p>He also mentioned that on PlayStation and Steam, sales of this year’s Call of Duty title beat last year’s by at least 60%.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 is a phenomenal success – Activision confirmed it was the biggest release in Call of Duty history just days after the game hit the market. It’s proving to be holding firm as time goes on, too – the energy in anticipation of the game’s first season is electric and palpable, and this year, the roadmap has some real potential.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of Black Ops 6</a>, I said it was the best we’ve had in years.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with the BBC</a>, Miles Leslie, a sixteen-year veteran of Treyarch, mentioned that Steam and PlayStation-based sales of Black Ops 6 have beaten those for Modern Warfare 3 by 60%. We already knew it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-biggest-launch-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a roaring success on Game Pass</a>, as it caused the most new subscriber adds ever for a new game, but it’s encouraging to see it won big figures across the board.</p>



<p>In the run-up to Black Ops 6 being released, Activision’s teams pushed out a marketing campaign like no other, which some believed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rivalled that of a major blockbuster</a>. It seemed that no matter where you turned, the Black Ops 6 branding was visible. </p>



<p>Leslie also said about the title launching on Game Pass:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we’ve seen is it’s allowed people that might have been on the fence, might have had some of that friction, might have been like, ‘I haven’t played in a while’ to actually come back and try the game. </p>



<p>Obviously there’s things that we can improve and we’ve got our finger on the pulse of the community so that we can hear those things and analyse them and really attack and fix them in the right ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GSC Game World has announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has finally gone gold after many years of development. The open-world survival shooter, which is one of this year’s most highly anticipated games, has been in development on and off for more than a decade, but on November 20, it’ll finally be released to the world.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>I played Stalker 2 at Gamescom and can attest to how incredible of an experience GSC has compiled for long-awaiting fans. It was an entirely different world when the last major Stalker game was released, and what we’ll be getting our hands on when November 20 comes around is leagues beyond what already exists in the series.</p>



<p>From sumptuous visuals to a remarkable combat engine, and intense survival mechanics to an open world bursting with side activities, Stalker 2 has stacks of meat on the post-apocalyptic bones.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will drop on the Game Pass subscription service the day it launches, which is a huge win for gamers everywhere. If you’d rather go above and beyond, the game has a <strong>ridiculous </strong>collector’s edition that’s probably one of the most expansive versions of a game I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p>Recently, the team also revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s PC requirements</a>, unveiling a specification that’s not all that demanding, considering it’s a top-shelf open-world game being released in late 2024.</p>



<p>Are you going to be playing Stalker 2? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re most looking forward to about the game.</p>

<p>Tony Todd, the voice of Venom in Spider-Man 2, has sadly passed away at the age of 69. The late actor’s representatives first revealed the news to Deadline, stating that he died of natural causes. It was confirmed that he passed away in his home in Los Angeles on November 6, one month before his 70th birthday.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-legendary-presence">Legendary Presence</h2>



<p>Tony Todd enjoyed a lengthy, star-studded career that included 40 years of television, film, and video games. Best known for his role in the Candyman movies, this enigmatic and versatile performer contributed to hundreds of productions over the years.</p>



<p>His spree through video games started in 1998 with a Star Trek title, and a few years later, he was voicing aliens in Half-Life 2. He’d come to play characters in Call of Duty: Black Ops II, Dota 2, and Back 4 Blood, but his most recent and impactful role was as Venom in Spider-Man 2.</p>



<p>While playing Venom, Todd revealed that he spent more time in the voiceover booth than in any previous role in his entire career. He also played fast and loose with some of the game’s juicier tidbits before launch, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-september-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teasing the release date</a> and content drops on social media, much to the amusement of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Tony Todd was a talented and spirited individual known by many as a gentle giant, and he’ll be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with those who survive him.</p>
