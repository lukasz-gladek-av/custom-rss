<p>A new character for Marvel Rivals has leaked before the game’s official release on December 6. According to a known Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1864338925164093603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaker on Twitter</a>, Ultron will be added to the game in the future.</p>



<p>According to the leak, Ultron will be a support character with six abilities. Those abilities are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Encephalo-Ray</strong> (Primary) –  Unleash a burning energy beam.</li>



<li><strong>Dynamic Flight</strong>&nbsp;(Secondary) – Fly quickly in the direction of movement and then enter a free-flight mode.</li>



<li><strong>Algorithm Correction</strong> (Passive)&nbsp;– Hold Jump to fall slowly.</li>



<li><strong>Imperative: Firewall</strong>&nbsp;(E) – Summon drones to grant Bonus Health to allies within range, centered on himself and the ally marked by Imperative: Patch. </li>



<li><strong>Imperative: Patch&nbsp;</strong>(Left Shift) – Command a giant drone to follow an ally, constantly healing allies in its radius, with more healing for the designated ally. </li>



<li><strong>Rage of Ultron&nbsp;</strong>(Ultimate) – Summon Ultron Drones to fire Encephalo-Rays, damaging enemies or healing allies.</li>
</ul>



<p>NetEase has yet to confirm Ultron as a character. However, with all of this information out in the public from a data mine, it should be only a matter of time before he is officially announced.</p>

<p>Warhorse Studios has just announced that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will be released one week earlier than planned. It’ll now be launching worldwide on February 4, 2025. This news follows a delay that pushed the game back into 2025.</p>



<p>On social media, the news was announced by the team in conjunction with a promise that ‘more exciting news’ is coming in the following days. This all kicks off with a new story trailer that’s being released tomorrow.</p>

<h2 id="h-audentes-fortuna-iuvat">Audentes Fortuna Iuvat</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be one hell of an RPG. It’s riddled with historical accuracy and it’s one of the most faithful representations of the setting I’ve ever seen. I got hands-on with the game during Gamescom and loved every second I played.</p>



<p>It helps that I’m a massive fan of the first game, which recently hit a new milestone after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/">selling eight million copies</a> since launching in 2018.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, I was fortunate enough to catch up with Tom McKay, who plays the series’ protagonist, Henry of Skalitz:</p>

<p>Here’s the full post from Warhorse Studios on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Big news: Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will arrive at your homes on FEBRUARY 4TH 2025!</p>



<p>With the release date pushing one week forward, we have a bunch of more exciting news coming in the following days. </p>

<p>BioWare has announced that the Character Creator for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is getting a standalone release. The announcement was <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/da-day-2024?utm_campaign=datv_pub_ww_ic_soco_ltre_character-creator-blog&amp;utm_source=linktree&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=82705&amp;ts=1733330768641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">part of the company’s</a> Dragon Age Day 2024 message to players.</p>



<p>Coming to all platforms, the Character Creator will be completely free, and allow players to build characters before ever buying or loading the game up for the first time. The app allows players to create and then transfer their character over to the game as long as it’s on the same platform. That means you can’t create a character on PC and expect to bring them over to PS5 or Xbox Series.</p>



<p>“There’s no time limit on the Character Creator; we know crafting the perfect protagonist can take hours,” BioWare said.</p>



<p>In addition to the Character Creator, BioWare announced that players can get the get the armor, body paint, and nose blood smear of Hawke, the protagonist of Dragon Age II.</p>



<p>“These cosmetics will be permanently available and can be found in the Lighthouse after downloading Patch 4 and completing the mission ‘The Singing Blade’,” the studio said.</p>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is currently available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. The Character Creator is available now, as well. </p>
