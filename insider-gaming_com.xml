<p>Following reports that Sony was in talks to acquire FromSoftware’s parent company Kadokawa, Kadokawa has confirmed that Sony has expressed interest in acquiring the company.</p>



<p>The update comes following mass media reports, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-buy-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originated from Reuters</a>, that talks between the companies were ongoing. </p>



<p>The full statement reads, “There are some articles on the acquisition of KADOKAWA Corporation (hereinafter “the Company”) by Sony Group Inc. However, this information is not announced by the Company. The Company has received an initial letter of intent to acquire the Company’s shares, but no decision has been made at this time. If there are any facts that should be announced in the future, we will make an announcement in a timely and appropriate manner.”</p>



<p>Presently, Kadokawa owns a 70% stake in FromSoftware, and Sony has around a 14% share. Rolling it up, Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa Corporation, but other gaming titans, like Tencent, also own a piece of the company.</p>



<p>It’s unclear at what stage the talks are currently at, so if the desire for the acquisition is successful, it could be a while before any announcement is made.</p>



<p>What do you think of Sony trying to acquire Kadokawa? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
