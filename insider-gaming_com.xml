<p>It’s nearly time to preload Monster Hunter Wilds, and we need to show you its file size across console and PC so you can install it safely on your chosen platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is aptly going to be a wild ride. The already creatures look bigger and badder than ever before, for one thing. This is only the beginning as Capcom has already surprised players by revealing some of Wilds’ forthcoming content via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-roadmap-mizutsune-dlc-update-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap and DLC plans</a>.</p>



<p>Before we get close to this point, we need Monster Hunter Wilds preloaded. Let’s check its file size on different platforms and assist you with this—you’re on your own with monsters though!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-monster-hunter-wilds">How to Preload Monster Hunter Wilds</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Scary. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to pre-purchase any edition of Monster Hunter Wilds, wait until two days before launch, click to download Monster Hunter Wilds, and it should be ready for release.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> preload process is straightforward enough. But if you’ve never done this before or need a little reminder, we’ve got you covered:</p>



<ol>
<li>Choose which platform you want to play Monster Hunter Wilds on.</li>



<li>Go to the storefront and search for <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong>.</li>



<li>Select one of its several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-editions-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editions</a>.</li>



<li>Complete your purchase to secure exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-monster-hunter-wilds-pre-order-bonuses-how-to-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order bonuses</a>.</li>



<li>Wait for the preload option to go live on <strong>February 26</strong>.</li>



<li>Once it does, click the download option.</li>



<li>When it’s complete, Monster Hunter Wilds is now ready to play the second it goes live!</li>
</ol>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1886931557304144111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds X page</a> has said accurate start times are coming. At the very least, you know you have up to 48 hours before launch to prepare and preload Monster Hunter Wilds to get it installed.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-file-size-explained">Monster Hunter Wilds File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds is 52.826 GB on PS5, requires at least 75 GB on PC, and Microsoft still hasn’t made it clear how much memory is required on Xbox.</strong></p>



<p>You can read more about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-file-size-how-many-gb-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wilds’ file sizes with our handy guide</a>, but this should give you a good idea of what’s required. </p>



<p>The Xbox page has been devoid of accurate memory information for a while now. I can’t imagine it being more than 75 GB, so expect it to be somewhere between the PS5 and PC file size.</p>



<hr>



<p>Will you be jumping on the Monster Hunter Wilds train early? Are the file size requirements quite general compared to many other modern-day sizes?</p>



<p>Even though we don’t have the Xbox file size, we have the latest on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-monster-hunter-wilds-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds appearing on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

<p>According to a new job listing, Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel will feature “the most realistic and reactive crowd system in any game to date.”</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-most-realistic-and-reactive-crowd-system-job" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, the new information was revealed through Pawel Sasko’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1892298966961725540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, which talks about seven job openings for the “next Cyberpunk.” If you dig a little deeper into the daily responsibilities of Lead Encounter Designer, the listing implies that CD Project Red is working on creating the most advanced crowd system to date for the next Cyberpunk, with a focus on the realism and reactiveness of the NPCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The community has started sharing their views on this upcoming crowd system for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1itiifo/cyberpunk_sequel_has_new_opening_for_lead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cyberpunkgame</a> subreddit. The players are discussing whether the developers should work on an entirely new city or improve and evolve the existing Night City to flesh it out even more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many have compared the crowd system for games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V with the original Cyberpunk 2077. Some also wonder whether the next Cyberpunk’s crowd system will be able to beat what Rockstar cooks up with GTA 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the details about the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel are currently unknown. All we know is that it is internally referred to as Project Orion. The developers have also stated that Cyberpunk’s plot is a “uniquely American story” with “punk energy”, and thanks to the Boston studio, the sequel <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-sequel-more-american/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feel&nbsp;more American</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Cyberpunk 2077 was th<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-becomes-first-game-to-support-dlss-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e first game to support DLSS 4</a>.
