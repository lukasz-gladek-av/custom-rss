<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Treyarch’s Miles Leslie took a deep dive into the success of Black Ops 6. He was talking about the power of Game Pass and how it has allowed many ‘on-the-fence’ players to find their way into Call of Duty but mentioned that the difficulty will now rest in <strong>keeping those players </strong>on board.</p>



<p>He also mentioned that on PlayStation and Steam, sales of this year’s Call of Duty title beat last year’s by at least 60%.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 is a phenomenal success – Activision confirmed it was the biggest release in Call of Duty history just days after the game hit the market. It’s proving to be holding firm as time goes on, too – the energy in anticipation of the game’s first season is electric and palpable, and this year, the roadmap has some real potential.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of Black Ops 6</a>, I said it was the best we’ve had in years.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with the BBC</a>, Miles Leslie, a sixteen-year veteran of Treyarch, mentioned that Steam and PlayStation-based sales of Black Ops 6 have beaten those for Modern Warfare 3 by 60%. We already knew it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-biggest-launch-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a roaring success on Game Pass</a>, as it caused the most new subscriber adds ever for a new game, but it’s encouraging to see it won big figures across the board.</p>



<p>In the run-up to Black Ops 6 being released, Activision’s teams pushed out a marketing campaign like no other, which some believed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-marketing-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rivalled that of a major blockbuster</a>. It seemed that no matter where you turned, the Black Ops 6 branding was visible. </p>



<p>Leslie also said about the title launching on Game Pass:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we’ve seen is it’s allowed people that might have been on the fence, might have had some of that friction, might have been like, ‘I haven’t played in a while’ to actually come back and try the game. </p>



<p>Obviously there’s things that we can improve and we’ve got our finger on the pulse of the community so that we can hear those things and analyse them and really attack and fix them in the right ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GSC Game World has announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has finally gone gold after many years of development. The open-world survival shooter, which is one of this year’s most highly anticipated games, has been in development on and off for more than a decade, but on November 20, it’ll finally be released to the world.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>I played Stalker 2 at Gamescom and can attest to how incredible of an experience GSC has compiled for long-awaiting fans. It was an entirely different world when the last major Stalker game was released, and what we’ll be getting our hands on when November 20 comes around is leagues beyond what already exists in the series.</p>



<p>From sumptuous visuals to a remarkable combat engine, and intense survival mechanics to an open world bursting with side activities, Stalker 2 has stacks of meat on the post-apocalyptic bones.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will drop on the Game Pass subscription service the day it launches, which is a huge win for gamers everywhere. If you’d rather go above and beyond, the game has a <strong>ridiculous </strong>collector’s edition that’s probably one of the most expansive versions of a game I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p>Recently, the team also revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s PC requirements</a>, unveiling a specification that’s not all that demanding, considering it’s a top-shelf open-world game being released in late 2024.</p>



<p>Are you going to be playing Stalker 2? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re most looking forward to about the game.</p>

<p>Tony Todd, the voice of Venom in Spider-Man 2, has sadly passed away at the age of 69. The late actor’s representatives first revealed the news to Deadline, stating that he died of natural causes. It was confirmed that he passed away in his home in Los Angeles on November 6, one month before his 70th birthday.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-legendary-presence">Legendary Presence</h2>



<p>Tony Todd enjoyed a lengthy, star-studded career that included 40 years of television, film, and video games. Best known for his role in the Candyman movies, this enigmatic and versatile performer contributed to hundreds of productions over the years.</p>



<p>His spree through video games started in 1998 with a Star Trek title, and a few years later, he was voicing aliens in Half-Life 2. He’d come to play characters in Call of Duty: Black Ops II, Dota 2, and Back 4 Blood, but his most recent and impactful role was as Venom in Spider-Man 2.</p>



<p>While playing Venom, Todd revealed that he spent more time in the voiceover booth than in any previous role in his entire career. He also played fast and loose with some of the game’s juicier tidbits before launch, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-september-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teasing the release date</a> and content drops on social media, much to the amusement of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Tony Todd was a talented and spirited individual known by many as a gentle giant, and he’ll be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with those who survive him.</p>

<p>You need money. We all need money, but we’ll have to settle for virtual cash in a game like Planet Coaster 2. At least in that world, you have total control and can plop down an entire roller coaster in your backyard. I tried that once, and the city sent a zoning expert to shut everything down. Anyway, you can earn more money in Planet Coaster 2, and I’d like to help your amusement park flourish with a few tips!</p>



<h2 id="h-best-ways-to-make-more-money-in-planet-coaster-2">Best Ways to Make More Money in Planet Coaster 2</h2>



<p>Without a constant and ever-growing source of income, you can’t reinvest in your park to open additional rides, like rollercoasters and carousels, or expand your offerings to the new waterpark mechanics. But earning more money in Planet Coaster 2 is easier said than done, right? Nope, here are a few tips:</p>



<h3 id="h-lower-the-entry-fee-to-free">Lower the Entry Fee to Free</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>First and foremost, open up your Park Management screen. It’s the top-most icon on the top left-hand side of the screen. Here, you can alter your Park Options, including the price of admission for the various ticket and pass types in the game.</p>



<p>Here, I recommend lowering your entry tickets to $0.00. That’s right; allow everyone free entry to your for-profit amusement park. Doing so will entice more visitors to check out your park, where you stand to make money. With the ticket prices free, people can spend more on drinks, food, merchandise, and the rides themselves. Jack up those prices, baby!</p>



<h3 id="h-add-scenery-to-rides">Add Scenery to Rides</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Don’t forget about the scenery as you expand your park, plopping down a new ride or two along your most recent expansion. It’s easy to ignore scenery, as everything little bit costs money. It’ll feel as if you’re hemorrhaging money initially. But trust me when I tell you it’s an investment with long-term gains.</p>



<p>The scenery in Planet Coaster 2 directly increases ride and park appeal, which increases the Prestige of your attractions. As appeal and Prestige increase, so does guest happiness. They’ll spend more time at your park, riding the rides and buying merchandise, making you money.</p>



<h3 id="h-relax">Relax!</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>I like to watch whatever show I’m binging while playing a game like Planet Coaster 2. Inevitably, you still encounter slow periods of gameplay where it’s often best to sit back and relax. For instance, once you’re profitable, with a handful of rides and attractions bringing in customers, speed up the game and chill.</p>



<p>Now’s a good time to catch up on Reddit, read a chapter in your book, or catch a few moments of your favorite show while your park works in the background, constantly ticking up those dollar signs with every passing second.</p>
