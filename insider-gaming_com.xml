<p>Currently trying to use the SVD in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, but not sure what loadout to use? While it is true that the gun is among the weaker snipers in the game, it still can be quite useful with the right loadout.</p>



<p>Here is our take on the best SVD loadout in Black Ops 6.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-best-svd-loadout-in-black-ops-6">The Best SVD Loadout in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Sniping in Call of Duty has always been incredibly popular. However, sniping without modifying a weapon is a fool’s game. The SVD can easily become one of the better snipers with the proper loadout.</p>



<h4 id="h-best-svd-loadout">Best SVD Loadout:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Quickdraw Riser</strong> (Comb)</li>



<li><strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> (Barrel)</li>



<li><strong>Heavy Stock</strong> (Stock)</li>



<li><strong>7.62x54mmR FMJ</strong> (Fire Mods)</li>



<li><strong>Ported Compensator</strong> (Muzzle)</li>
</ul>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-quickdraw-riser">Quickdraw Riser</h3>



<p>Quickdraw Risers are essential for pretty much all snipers. This attachment allows players to ADS faster than normal, allowing for players to quick-scope and more. Make sure to equip one to your SVD.</p>



<h3 id="h-reinforced-barrel">Reinforced Barrel</h3>



<p>The Reinforced Barrel helps with damage range for the SVP while also increasing the bullet velocity. It is a great attachment for long-range weapons. However, it does decrease movement speed while aiming, but having the Quickdraw Riser also equipped should help with that issue.</p>



<h3 id="h-heavy-stock">Heavy Stock</h3>



<p>Especially for snipers, the Heavy Stock is essential. This attachment helps improve aim, making the weapon more stable and accurate. Be sure to equip one to your SVP in Black Ops 6.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-62x54mmr-fmj">7.62x54mmR FMJ</h3>



<p>The 7.62x54mmR FMJ is easily the best fire mod for the SVP, as it helps make the weapons shot much more powerful. </p>



<h3 id="h-ported-compensator">Ported Compensator</h3>



<p>The Ported Compensator improves the recoil of the SVP. This helps immensely with the weapon’s accuracy, allowing for first-shot kills to happen much more often when using the SVP in Black Ops 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-rocket-league-ranks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rocket League has become an incredibly popular esport over the years, with the game first releasing back in 2015. Since then, various massive Rocket League tournaments have emerged, including RLCS, Collegiate leagues and more. However, Rocket League also has its own competitive mode. Here are all the Rocket League ranks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rocket-league-ranks">Rocket League Ranks</h2>



<p>Like many other games, Rocket League also has a ranked system that players can play, moving up in levels. Like many other games, Rocket League follows the traditional ranking system, starting with Bronze and moving up the list. </p>



<h4 id="h-all-rocket-league-ranks-in-order-from-worst-to-best">All Rocket League Ranks in Order from Worst to Best:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Unranked</li>



<li>Bronze</li>



<li>Bronze II</li>



<li>Bronze III</li>



<li>Silver</li>



<li>Silver II</li>



<li>Silver III</li>



<li>Gold </li>



<li>Gold II</li>



<li>Gold III</li>



<li>Platinum</li>



<li>Platinum II</li>



<li>Platinum III</li>



<li>Diamond </li>



<li>Diamond II</li>



<li>Diamond III</li>



<li>Champion </li>



<li>Champion II</li>



<li>Champion III</li>



<li>Grand Champion </li>



<li>Grand Champion II</li>



<li>Grand Champion III</li>



<li>Supersonic Legend</li>
</ul>



<p>Moving up in ranks in Rocket League can be quite difficult, and claiming the title of Supersonic Legend is definitely a massive accomplishment. In fact, the game used to end at Grand Champion, but after Epic Games bought the title, Supersonic Legend was added to the ranks.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up">How to Rank Up</h2>



<p>Trying to rank up in the game? Well, luckily, the process is simple: Play ranked matches and win. If you constantly lose when playing ranked matches you will not see yourself move up.</p>



<p>Rocket League’s ranked system also has a decent anti-smurfing system, which works to stop high-ranking players from creating new accounts just to play at lower ranks. </p>



<p>The game also has a new system that evaluates one’s rank early on and moves them up higher in level when officially ranking them. Not everyone will start from Bronze.</p>



<p>What is your rank?</p>

<p>Competitive Call of Duty is being kicked off early in Black Ops 6, but it’s not being backed by Activision.</p>



<p>ZooMaa’s ‘The Flank’ has announced a triple-threat of tournaments that’ll take place between October 29 and November 6, and as a collective, they boast a $100,000 prize pool. It’s a CDL AR &amp; SMG spree that boasts 12 teams made up of four players each, and it comes before the 2025 CDL season has even been formally announced.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-our-own-hands">Into Our Own Hands</h2>



<p>From the moment Black Ops 6 was released, the more competitive players among us were looking for an angle from which they could earn. Wagers sprung up, $8s started running rampant on social media, and amateur kick-off tournaments were set up far and wide.</p>



<p>This is by far the biggest Black Ops 6 tournament to surface, and it comes mere days after the game was released.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Flank has revealed the following schedule:</p>



<ul>
<li>October 29 – $25,000 tournament</li>



<li>November 1 – $25,000 tournament</li>



<li>November 5/6 – $50,000 tournament</li>
</ul>



<p>On tonight’s episode of The Flank, the teams are being picked live, and the expectation is that it’ll be mostly CDL and Challengers players that make the cut, with a few Warzone competitors sprinkled in as cannon fodder.</p>



<p>It’s an exciting time to be a Call of Duty fan – the off-season and pre-season events hosted by brands like OpTic and The Flank are typically more entertaining than the official CDL events. Don’t tell Activision I said that, though.</p>



<p>Will you be checking out the first major Black Ops tournament on October 29? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Popular lifestyle and gaming organization, 100 Thieves, revealed a brand-new Adidas Merch line, which is set to drop this November. The drop, which includes shoes, sweatshirts and more, is another perfect example of how very few gaming organizations are doing it like 100 Thieves.</p>

<p>The new merch by Adidas and 100 Thieves is currently set to release on the following date:</p>

</ul>



<p>Those looking to purchase the drop can do so at the official <a href="https://t.co/lud7N2Kfep">Adidas website</a> and select retailers. However, 100 Thieves fans will be able to get early access to the new merch at <a href="https://100thieves.com/">100 Thieves’s website</a> on November 2, 2024.</p>



<p>100 Thieves has been dedicated to providing gamers with sleek-designed merch for years now in hopes of combining both lifestyle clothing and gaming.</p>

<p>It has become quite common for large brands, such as Adidas, to work with gaming companies and organizations. 100 Thieves, however, continues to put out merch like no other.</p>



<p>Will you be purchasing any of the upcoming 100 Thieves merch? While prices have not been revealed, it will more than likely be a bit more on the expensive end.</p>
