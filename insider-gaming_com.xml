<h2 id="h-the-best-xbox-ally-x-accessories-for-2025">The Best Xbox Ally X Accessories For 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Anti-Glare Screen Protector</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the system costing $600-$1000, the first thing you should do is protect the most important part of the handheld: the screen. Available in a two-pack, these screen protectors retail <strong>for under $15</strong> and are made of tempered glass that cover the whole display.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>NINKI Silicone Skin</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to have some protection around the device without a big hard shell? This case might be just what you’re looking for. It’s form-fitting on the Ally X while offering added grip on the sides and protection around the system. It comes with a kickstand as well, allowing you to set it down nicely wherever you happen to be. You can pick up <strong>the case for $20.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Travel Case&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want a nice carrying case that can not only hold your Xbox Ally X handheld but the charger, stand, and more? This case features a compartment that is designed for carrying everything you need for the system. It’s <strong>less than $30</strong> and feels as durable as something two-to-three times the cost. It was one of the first thing’s purchased when the handheld came in and has gone on every trip since.</p>











<hr>



<p><strong>Docking Station</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This docking station from JSAUX has everything you need to hook up your Xbox Ally or Ally X to a TV or monitor. It features an HDMI 2.1 port for up to 4K at 120Hz as well as two USB-A 3.2 ports, a USB C 3.2 port, a fast-charging USB-C 100W port, and a gigabit ethernet port.

<hr>



<p><strong>Thumb Grips</strong></p>



<figure></figure>

<hr>



<p><strong>Samsung PRO Plus microSD</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You’ve seen this card in a lot of Insider Gaming’s holiday guides this year, and that’s for good measure. The Samsung PRO Plus MicroSD is the best one on the market for the price. This card offers read/write speeds up to around 180 MB/s for reading and 130 MB/s writing. The card starts at <strong>$26.99</strong> for 256GB but is also available in 512 GB for<strong> $49.99</strong> and <strong>$79.99</strong> for 1TB.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Another device you’ve seen countless times on these guides, the Sony INZONE E9 Wired In-Ear headphones are perfect for listening to what you want without interrupting anyone else. They connect via 3.5MM or USB-C port, and don’t have the problems of wearing a bulky headset just for sound. If you want gaming headset-level detail without wearing a bulky headset, these are a fantastic pick. They are on the pricey side <strong>at $149.99</strong>, but they can’t be recommended enough.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty League 2026 Maps and Modes Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-league-cdl-2026-maps-modes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-league-2026-maps-and-modes-revealed.1364659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ahead of the start of the season, Call of Duty League 2026 has revealed the maps and modes that will be present. Furthermore, a new mode will be added, Overload, spicing up the competition further.</p>







<p>With each new entry, the Call of Duty series has been a great multiplayer experience. Despite Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not doing so hot</a>, one can count on Activision and the teams doing well by the mode. Nothing, though, has said it better than in Esports. Last year, Optic Texas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-champs-optic-texas-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took home the championship</a>, with Mercules scoring MVP. With CDL 2026, it’s anyone’s game, especially with the addition of a brand-new mode to competition.</p>



<h2 id="h-cdl-2026-adding-overload-to-game-modes-starting-december-5th-7th">CDL 2026 Adding Overload to Game Modes, Starting December 5th-7th</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from <a href="https://x.com/CODLeague/status/1993347588654018822?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty League</a>, the full lineup of maps and modes for the 2026 season has been unveiled. Additionally, the full competitive rules and settings can be <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/competitive-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found here</a>. The full list of maps and modes can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hardpoint
<ul>
<li>Blackheart</li>



<li>Colossus</li>



<li>Den</li>



<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Scar</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Search &amp; Destroy
<ul>
<li>Colossus</li>



<li>Den</li>



<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Raid</li>



<li>Scar</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Overload (NEW)
<ul>
<li>Den</li>



<li>Exposure</li>



<li>Scar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>As mentioned before, Overload is a brand-new mode added to the Call of Duty League. From Black Ops 7, the 6×6 mode acts like Capture the Flag, as teams will try to get the Overload Device to a designated objective. It’ll be interesting to see how it evolves within the competitive scene. Either way, it’s definitely one to watch on December 5th-7th.</p>







<p>What do you think of CDL’s map and modes lineup? Excited to see Overload added to the modes? Which map do you think will be great for competition?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Ranked Play is at the top of the wishlist for many of you. After all, it’s where the best of the best prove they are above the rest. Black Ops 7 Ranked Mode release details are coming your way.</p>



<p>Ranked is a staple of any recent Call of Duty release. Eventually, traditional lobbies can only offer so much competition, and there needs to be something to grind for—outside of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-multiplayer-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer Camos</a>.</p>



<p>This is where Black Ops 7 and Ranked Mode go hand in hand.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-ranked-mode-coming-to-black-ops-7">When Is Ranked Mode Coming To Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Party like it’s 2025. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s been announced that Black Ops 7 is getting its long-awaited Ranked Mode in Season 2.</strong></p>



<p>This might come as disappointing news for those of you who want Ranked now. There are a few weeks to go until Ranked Play hits BLOPS 7. The devs have previously announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-7-season-2-maps-have-already-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2</a> will see the addition of Ranked Play for both of Activision’s main games: Black Ops 7 and Warzone.</p>



<p>You might be even more aggrieved to know that no one knows when in Season 2 it’s happening. It could be with the season’s launch, it could be midway through, or Treyarch could suddenly announce the day before.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates and announcements on Ranked Play coming to Black Ops 7. If you don’t have it already, you can always use <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">Insider Gaming to buy Black Ops 7 much cheaper</a>.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For those asking, Treyarch has previously confirmed Ranked Play for both Black Ops 7 MP and Warzone will launch with Season 02.</p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1993029985452671461?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-is-black-ops-7-ranked-play">What is Black Ops 7 Ranked Play?</h2>



<p><strong>Ranked Play is a competitive mode where your performances in Call of Duty matches determine your ranking, and good performances and wins are rewarded with skill points and promotions, whereas losing usually can result in demotions to inferior ranks.</strong></p>



<p>For example, in Black Ops 6, you had eight ranks to work your way through: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent, and Top 250. Think of it like a worst-to-best scale. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen if Black Ops 7 adopts the same ranks, names, and divisions, but this is usually how it works. Furthermore, certain maps, weapons, and equipment are restricted in Ranked. Treyarch will inflict limitations on various aspects of Black Ops 7, meaning you need to be adaptable and prove your skill at will.</p>



<p>Reasons for this include meta weapons, to stop everyone from defaulting to them.</p>



<p>Is Ranked something that should launch with CoD on day one? Are you impatient for Ranked Play right now?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-steam-deck-accessories-2025-holiday-guide.1364584/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Since releasing in February 2022, Valve’s Steam Deck has become the most popular gaming handheld on the market. One of the first accessible ways to play your PC games on the go, the Steam Deck is close to being a perfect device for many, but there are some ways it can improve. One way specifically that you can make your Steam Deck experience better is with some accessories and add-ons.</p>



<p>Whether you want to protect it, upgrade the comfort, or just get more out of the device, there are tons of great accessories available. Some are even on the more affordable side, as well. These are the best Steam Deck accessories available for the 2025 holidays.</p>



<p>Below, you’ll find a list of the best options available today, from protective shells and screen protectors to docking stations and thumb grips. Everything here is compatible with both the Steam Deck LCD and OLED models. If you want to get more out of your handheld, these are the accessories worth checking out this year.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-best-steam-deck-accessories-for-2025">The Best Steam Deck Accessories For 2025</h2>



<p><strong>JSAUX PC0104 Shell Case</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first Steam Deck accessory to check out is one that brings durability to the handheld. This shell case from not only protects it when in use, but it comes with a full shell cover for transportation that protects the screen, joysticks and face buttons. There’s even a kickstand for those that want to plug it in simply via the USB-C port and a strap if you want to attach a power bank. It’s <strong>available for $23.99 for the holidays</strong>, and costs $30 throughout the year.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Syntech Soft Case</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>When shopping for a case, sometimes you want something practical. This case will cost you <strong>less than $25</strong>, and goes around the entire Steam Deck without adding too much bulk. It doesn’t interfere with any of the buttons and sits as snug as any chase you’ll find—it’s been used by senior editor Mike Straw for a few months now, actually. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Cooling Fan</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you feel like the Steam Deck runs a little too warm, there are options to keep it on the cooler side. One option comes from JSUAX. This cooling fan snaps right on and helps with overall circulation. It even has a kick stand, allowing you to set it up nicely on your table or desk. If it’s something you’re interested in, you can pick it up <strong>for $30 on sale</strong>, or <strong>$40 at regular price. </strong></p>











<hr>



<p><strong>Back Button Enhancements</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Feel like your fingers slip off the back panel buttons? These rubber grips come in two different sizes to make the buttons feel thicker on the fingers and avoid any possible slip or mis-click. Currently they are <strong>on sale for $12</strong>, but regularly run <strong>about $14.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Thumb Grips</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sometimes the grip on the handheld isn’t what you want it. These Skull &amp; Co thumb grips come with three styles in a pack to help match your preference. They are <strong>available for $10</strong>.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>IVANKY Docking Station</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are a lot of docking stations for the Steam Deck, but this one might be one of the best. It features a USB-c connection that goes to the device while the dock itself has HDMI 2.1 output that supports up to 4K@144Hz, three USB-A 3.0 ports, a 1GB Ethernet port, and a rapid-charging USB-C port to keep your device fully juiced. It’s normally $39.99, but you can<strong> buy it now for $28.</strong></p>











<hr>



<p><strong>PlayVital Rubber Pads</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to add some style to your Steam Deck while improving functionality? These rubber pads come in different varieties and not only look great, but they give you added grip as well. <strong>For less than $15</strong> you can get designs ranging from basic black hexagons to waves and space. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong><strong>Sony INZONE E9 Wired In-Ear Monitor</strong></strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sony built these IEMs specifically for competitive gaming, so they’re all about clean, accurate sound and great positional audio. They’re lightweight, block out noise surprisingly well, and come with a small USB-C DAC that lets you tweak EQ and surround settings through the INZONE software. If you want gaming headset-level detail without wearing a bulky headset, these are a fantastic pick.</p>



<p>One underrated feature of the earbuds is just how good they are at blocking out the outside noise. It’s absolutely perfect when on a long flight that happens to have children on it that are a little bit upset. That alone is worth <strong>the $149.99</strong> price point.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Screen Protecto</strong>r</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With any portable device, the last thing you want to do is damage the screen. These tempered glass screen protectors cover the screen from edge to edge and protect both the LCD and OLED models. The best part is that you can still use the touch screen despite the thickness. Right now, a <strong>two-pack is $10</strong>, but you can often find it for <strong>as low as $8</strong>.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Samsung PRO Plus microSD</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those on the go that need more space in their Steam Deck, the Samsung PRO Plus microSD is one of the best cards on the market without completely breaking the bank. This card offers read/write speeds up to around 180 MB/s for reading and 130 MB/s writing. The card starts at <strong>$26.99</strong> for 256GB but is also available in 512 GB for<strong> $49.99</strong> and <strong>$79.99</strong> for 1TB.</p>
