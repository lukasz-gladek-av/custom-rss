<p>A new claim has said that Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars RTS Game will be revealed between April 18-20.</p>



<p>That’s according to X (Formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1880275605310333092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@bogorad222</a>, who said that the public announcement and trailer would be released during the Star Wars Celebration in Japan, which takes place April 18-20, 2025.</p>



<p>While mainly known for obtaining information via LinkedIn searching, bogorad222 provided Insider Gaming with sufficient evidence that the claims were genuine from one source.</p>



<p>Announced in January 2022, Respawn Entertainment’s Star Wars RTS is being developed alongside Bit Reactor, led by games industry veteran Greg Foerstch. <span>Respawn will produce the new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;strategy game, </span>while Bit Reactor will lead the development of the title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are huge fans of Star Wars here at Respawn and we’re thrilled to work with Lucasfilm Games on new titles that we have wanted to make for years,” said Zampella. “If you want to make great Star Wars games, you should come join us on our journey.” <a></a></p>



<p>At the time of writing, EA has not given any other updates on the project, so at least time-wise, an update or announcement is likely to happen later this year.</p>



<p>In February 2024, EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-respawn-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled Respawn Entertainment’s first-person Mandalorian game</a>, which would see players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take control of a bounty hunter</a> in a linear-level experience. </p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is adding The Thing and the Human Torch to make its almighty roster even more super. It completes the Fantastic Four set and brings some of Marvel’s most famous and feared friends together at last. </p>



<p>It’s rare nowadays to see a service title do little wrong and remain popular. Marvel Rivals is doing this and is flourishing further with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>. The first official season brought many changes, including the addition of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-dropping-a-fantastic-4-trailer-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a> as new heroes.</p>



<p>However, only Mister Fantastic and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-bots-are-being-sniffed-out-by-invisible-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Invisible Woman</a> are available. The Thing and Johnny Storm (Human Torch) are inbound, let’s get an ETA on their debut.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-are-the-thing-amp-human-torch-coming-to-marvel-rivals">When Are The Thing &amp; Human Torch Coming to Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ve done well so far. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NetEase hasn’t given a date for Thing &amp; Human Torch’s arrival, but using logic and game director Guangyun Chen’s own words, we expect the duo to arrive on Friday, February 21.</strong></p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a>, Guangyun Chen confirmed Marvel Rivals is getting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new heroes every three months</a>. Season 1 is a bit different, and he was asked about the regularity of new heroes joining. He says each new season lasts three months (12 weeks), and “for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero” which is roughly six weeks apart.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 launched on January 10. If we fast forward six weeks from this date, it takes us nicely to February 21. There is a chance their arrival might be <strong>one week later though</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the “Marvel Rivals Season 1 Begins Dev Vision Vol. 03” video on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals YouTube channel</a>, Season 1’s two halves are “<strong>lasting six or seven weeks.</strong>“</p>



<p><strong>Timestamp—1:36</strong>.</p>

<p>If it is seven weeks, The Thing and Human Torch arrive on <strong>February 28</strong> instead. We’ll keep checking the Marvel Rivals socials closer to the time to see when NetEase is launching the heroes.</p>
