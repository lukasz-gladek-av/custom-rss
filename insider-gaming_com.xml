<p>The Holiday season is all about giving, and gamers absolutely love gifts themed around their favorite franchises. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> had one of its most successful launches ever with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, as millions have been enjoying the title ever since its launch on October 25.</p>



<p>As with every Christmas, plenty more players will join the pool after being gifted the game, but if they already have it, what sort of presents would a Call of Duty fan love?</p>



<p>Here’s our Holiday Gift Guide for a Call of Duty fan, so you know exactly what to get them.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> $70 / £70</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 full game</a></li>
</ul>



<p>While it may seem obvious, the best gift you can get a Call of Duty fan this Christmas is the new title, Black Ops 6. While most will likely already have the game, this should certainly be the first consideration when gifting a CoD fan. </p>



<p>If you know what platform they play on, great, and if you know whether they’d prefer a digital or physical copy, even better. If they usually get games digitally, and especially if they have a PlayStation Digital Edition or Xbox Series S, you’ll want to gift them with a voucher for the platform so they can purchase it with ease.</p>



<p>It’s also important to note that the price will vary depending on what edition you purchase, as you may find it cheaper at certain outlets. There are always some great deals around Christmas too, so keep an eye on Black Ops 6 as you may be able to get it on sale.</p>

<h2 id="h-cod-points">CoD Points</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>200 CoD Points:</strong>&nbsp;$1.99 / £1.79</li>



<li><strong>500</strong>&nbsp;<strong>CoD Points:</strong>&nbsp;$4.99 / £4.29</li>



<li><strong>1,000 (+100 Bonus) CoD Points:</strong>&nbsp;$9.99 / £8.50</li>



<li><strong>2,000 (+400 Bonus) CoD Points:</strong>&nbsp;$19.99 / £16.79</li>



<li><strong>4,000 (+1,000 Bonus) CoD Points:</strong>&nbsp;$39.99 / £34.99</li>



<li><strong>7,000 (+2,500 Bonus) CoD Points:</strong>&nbsp;$74.99 / £63.99</li>



<li><strong>10,000 (+3,000 Bonus) CoD Points:</strong>&nbsp;$99.99 / £84.99</li>



<li><strong>15,000 (+6,000 Bonus) CoD Points:</strong>&nbsp;$149.99 / £123.99</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/store/cod-points" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Store</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If they already have the latest title, CoD Points are an excellent alternative for CoD fans, as it gives them in-game currency that they can spend on cosmetic items like Operator bundles, Blueprints, and more. What’s great about this too is that the inventory is shared across Black Ops 6 and Warzone, so no matter what game they want to play, they’ll be able to utilize the gifted CoD Points.</p>

<h2 id="h-steelseries-headset">SteelSeries Headset</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>Wide range</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://steelseries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteelSeries website</a></li>
</ul>



<p>An amazing gift for any gamer is a SteelSeries Headset, and that’s even more so for a Call of Duty player since it’s an extremely competitive game. Having top-notch audio is essential for detecting footsteps and other audio cues, and SteelSeries are widely regarded as the best.</p>



<p>As an owner of a SteelSeries Headset myself, I can vouch for the quality. No matter what range you go for you’re guaranteed comfort and high-quality audio, but if you have a bigger budget I’d recommend the Arctis Nova 7 Wireless, which is compatible with all platforms. </p>



<p>You should find some great deals on SteelSeries Headsets around the Holiday period too, so keep an eye out on places like Amazon and the official SteelSeries website.</p>

<h2 id="h-dualsense-edge-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2">DualSense Edge / Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>
<ul>
<li>DualSense Edge – $199.99 / £189.99</li>



<li>Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 – $179.99 / £159.99</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/accessories/dualsense-edge-wireless-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DualSense Edge</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/elite-wireless-controller-series-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>If the person you’re gifting for doesn’t have the premium controller offering for their platform of choice, the DualSense Edge for PlayStation and Elite Wireless Controller for Xbox are both excellent options if you have a high budget. Even if they’re on PC, these controllers can be hooked up to their rig and used, so it’s a great option for all platforms. </p>



<p>Call of Duty is all about having smooth aim and movement, and the controller is the main instrument for that. So, having a premium controller with extra buttons and customization options can increase performance and that’s something a CoD addict will value greatly.</p>

<h2 id="h-kontrolfreeks">KontrolFreeks</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price:</strong> $/£10-20</li>



<li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.kontrolfreek.com/products/call-of-duty-black-ops-6?_pos=1&amp;_sid=3f727ffb0&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">KontrolFreeks</a></li>
</ul>



<p>KontrolFreeks are thumb grips that you attach to your controller’s thumbsticks for better accuracy and control. It provides extra height for the thumbsticks, which makes it easier to make more precise movements by increasing the arc distance. They have been proven to help accuracy and grip, something that’s ever-important in a Call of Duty game.</p>



<p>It’s an excellent accessory for any Call of Duty player, and they’re very popular. You can purchase Call of Duty-themed KontrolFreeks, making it the perfect gift for players grinding Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p>

<h2 id="h-bo6-zombies-poster">BO6 Zombies poster</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Price: </strong>$27 / £22</li>



<li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://eu.shop.callofduty.com/products/codtfa0015-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-key-art-poster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Shop</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If they’re a fan of Call of Duty, they’re most likely a fan of the Zombies mode too. For Black Ops 6, Call of Duty have produced a Zombies key art Poster, featuring the full crew – Weaver, Carver, Auguinaldo, and Grey. </p>



<p>These characters are the latest Zombies crew, and since BO6 has brought back the classic round-based format, they’ll no doubt become iconic. If the first few maps are anything to go by, Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode will be a favorite that Call of Duty fans will look back on, and the poster’s vibrant colors make it the perfect addition to any gaming setup.</p>

</ul>



<p>Holiday season means cold weather for most, and just like everyone else, Call of Duty players have to stay warm! Featuring a woven Black Ops 6 logo and a wolf tag on the cuff, this knitted beanie is an ideal stocking filler for those enjoying the new Call of Duty game.

</ul>



<p>Another great stocking filler for any Call of Duty fan is this Black Ops 6 magnet. Now, you may wonder what a gamer wants with a fridge magnet, but these are great for sticking on PC towers and consoles. They’re also great for other metal accessories you’d find in a gaming setup, such as headphones, monitor arms, and water bottles. </p>



<p>The magnet features the iconic Black Ops sitting bull pose and if you’re wondering about its size and material, it’s an acrylic 3.5 x 5.5 in magnet.</p>

</ul>



<p>Lastly, another small gift perfect for a Call of Duty fan’s stocking is this Metallic Logo Decal. Just like in-game, where players can customize their favorite weapons with colorful decals, this allows fans to customize a belonging of theirs with the iconic Call of Duty logo. </p>

<p>If you’ve been anywhere on the internet in the last few months, the chances are you’ll have seen a guy dressed as Miles Morales pretending to be an NPC on stream. He’s one of the few still holding up the gimmick – or at least he was, until now.</p>



<p>The ‘NPC trend’ went wild on sites like TikTok a while back, and ‘NPC Miles Morales’ was by far the most prolific creator to do it. He’d go on stream for hours on end, performing Miles Morales’s (Spider-Man) voice lines and ‘animations’ in exchange for gifts and donations.</p>



<p>He’s announced that he’s giving it up after all these months and pursuing a traditional streaming career.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-with-great-power">With Great Power…</h2>



<p>NPC Miles Morales – whose real name is Malik Ambersley – has performed his role since midway through 2023, and over time, he has become increasingly popular and controversial. While streaming, he has been robbed, accosted by police, and gotten into fights, all the while performing a character that he rarely breaks from.</p>



<p>The bit has earned him a substantial amount of money, but to be honest, he has put in the work. What he does is physically demanding and requires a great deal of confidence – and his escapades eventually earned him an iconic spot in Kai Cenat’s recent Mafia 2 subathon.</p>



<p>Now that Ambersley has paired up with Cenat, he has become bigger than ever, and in a recent stream, he revealed that he’s hanging up the Miles Morales costume to pursue traditional activities, such as the ‘IRL streams’ that Kai Cenat is famous for.</p>



<p>He said he’d ‘rather be known for being himself’.</p>



<p>Have you ever caught NPC Miles Morales on stream? Let us know what you think about the character on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
