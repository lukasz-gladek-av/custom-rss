<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A continues on the modern trend of Pokémon titles with a huge amount of character customization options, which we’ve explained in full in this guide.</p>



<p>The first big Pokémon launch on Nintendo Switch 2, though it also remains available on the original console, Legends: Z-A follows on from the success of Legends: Arceus and makes a big change to battle mechanics.</p>



<p>There’s also a huge amount of character customization options in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which we’ve broken down in this guide, including covering details on any gender-locked options.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Lots to consider. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</strong> <strong>has a wide array of character customization options, giving you control over your full look and physical features, alongside a host of fashion choices.</strong></p>



<p>Initial character customization in the game covers the general set-up, including choosing a gender, hairstyle, skin tone, eye color, and make-up. Similar to Scarlet and Violet, your physical features are not permanent and can be adjusted in future in any way you choose, aside from skin tone.</p>



<p>In addition to flat hair colors that players have become used to, further customization options include color blocking and balayage. </p>



<p>When exploring Lumiose City, plenty of shops are available to purchase new clothes to shake-up your look, while others are unlocked through story progression and side quests.</p>



<p>We’ve listed all of the available character customization options below, split into physical options and cosmetic options.</p>



<p><strong>Physical Character Customization Options</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Gender</li>



<li>Eye Shape</li>



<li>Eye Color</li>



<li>Eyelash Shape</li>



<li>Eyelash Color</li>



<li>Eyebrow Shape</li>



<li>Eyebrow Color</li>



<li>Beauty Spot</li>



<li>Freckles</li>



<li>Dark Circles</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cosmetic Character Customization Options</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Hairstyle</li>



<li>Hair Color</li>



<li>Tops</li>



<li>Bottoms</li>



<li>Hats</li>



<li>Glasses</li>



<li>Gloves</li>



<li>Socks</li>



<li>Shoes</li>



<li>Jewelry</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>No, there is no customization in Legends: Z-A locked by gender, giving you full freedom in character creation.</strong></p>



<p>Hairstyles are uni-sex, and can be used for either gender, while other customization options like make-up and clothing is also freely available to fit any character. This includes skirts, blouses, and dresses.</p>



<p>This shouldn’t be too surprising, as the change was first made to the franchise with Scarlet and Violet unlocking all clothing and customization options, and should remain the norm for the franchise moving forwards.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review%E2%80%94a-powerhouse-of-portable-gaming.1325215/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is a phenomenal piece of equipment that has a high price tag and a stunning specification, proving once again why ASUS sits at the top of the table in the handheld gaming market. I’ve been trialling a ROG Xbox Ally X for some time, and I’m happy to report that it has ticked all my boxes when it comes to gaming on the go.</p>



<p>Being a veteran of the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X units, I was always going to invest in an Xbox Ally X, but I underestimated how effective the evolution of this device would be. This is a winning handheld that suits me down to the ground, and in this ROG Xbox Ally X review, I’ll help you understand why it’s worth every penny.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-different-from-the-original-rog-ally-x">Is The ROG Xbox Ally X Different from the Original ROG Ally X?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The shell is better, has a custom print, the UI is upgraded, and the buttons have been enhanced.</figcaption></figure>







<p>On paper, it might seem like the core difference is just the name, with the addition of ‘Xbox’ being slipped into the branding. In actuality, things go beyond that, and the ROG Xbox Ally X represents <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rog-xbox-ally-vs-rog-xbox-ally-x-differences-price-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a sizeable overhaul</a> compared to the original Ally X.</p>



<p>The biggest difference is that the ROG Xbox Ally X has an upgraded processor, featuring the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme, compared to the original device’s AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme. This results in more processing power and smoother gameplay, and multitasking.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the memory (24 GB), storage (1 TB), screen (1080p, 120Hz IPS panel), and battery (80Whrs) are all the same.</p>



<p>I’m a <strong>huge </strong>fan of the biggest cosmetic and ergonomic changes to land with the ROG Xbox Ally X. The new device has a shell that might look strange at the beginning, but is actually much more tactile, comfortable, and sensible than the original shell.</p>



<p>It has more of a ‘grip’ built into the shell, and it accommodates larger shoulder and trigger buttons to suit all hand sizes. This grip makes it much more feasible to play games like first-person shooters. For example, I was playing Battlefield 6 on the ROG Xbox Ally X and found that I was almost as capable as I would have been using a traditional controller input.</p>



<p>Other improvements I noticed that aren’t necessarily on paper are the lower operating temperature, even at load, the quieter fans, and what sounds to me like better audio output.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-perform">How Does the ROG Xbox Ally X Perform?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even a brand-new game like Battlefield 6 ran well on the ROG Xbox Ally X</figcaption></figure>







<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X ticked every box for me, as I’ve already said. I ran it through its paces with a series of games, both old and new, and every time, the device left me thoroughly impressed. I played everything from Fallout 4 (2015) to Battlefield 6 (2025). </p>



<p>I spent hours enjoying PowerWash Simulator, and even did what I’d done on the previous ROG Ally X, installing Escape from Tarkov and using the onboard Armory Crate software to remap my inputs to make it playable on a controller.</p>



<p>At every step of the way, the Xbox Ally X kept me entertained. With the 80Wh battery, you can get a few hours of gameplay out of the device, depending on the game you play and the processing level you pick (Silent, Performance, or Turbo). The ports for charging and audio inputs are nicely located, the buttons are responsive and full-sized, and the unit doesn’t weigh so much that it introduces fatigue.</p>



<p>I was wondering how the Xbox integrations would work, and I’m pleased to report that they’re not disruptive or pointless. They’re practical and make it feel more like a gaming handheld than a Windows 11 PC shrunk into a smaller shell.</p>



<p>If I have one gripe, it’s that ASUS strangely switched around the pause/select/Armory Crate/library buttons compared to the Ally X, which meant I was always pressing the wrong button when I tried pausing my game.</p>



<p>At the press of a button, you can open the Xbox Game Bar, fully customizable with widgets. With another press, you’re in the aggregated library function that collates all your games into one place, regardless of launcher or storefront. Using the Xbox UI is a much more welcoming and user-friendly experience than relying on the Windows 11 interface, and even that feels better than ever.</p>



<p>For example, I always had a problem with <strong>typing </strong>on the Ally X, and bringing up the keyboard often felt fiddly and frustrating. With the Xbox Ally X, that’s not the case, and the tweaks applied on a software level are tangible.</p>



<p>This is a phenomenal handheld, and when fused with Xbox, players open up remote play (with Xbox Series consoles) and cloud gaming potential like never before.</p>



<p>It charges quickly, has expandable memory, a lightning-fast processor, and it looks gorgeous on a stand. The RGB touches are neat (again), the glass and frame have survived a few drop tests, and there are plenty of accessories on the market you can use to customize your ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>Sure, it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-pre-order-rog-xbox-ally-rog-xbox-ally-x-us-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has a price tag</a> of an eye-watering $999 (or £799), but in my opinion, it’s worth every penny. If you travel a lot, game on the go, or simply want something smaller to curl up with in bed as the cold winter nights creep in, you’ll want to invest in an ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>To me, this is the best gaming handheld on the market, bar none.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you plan on buying an Xbox ROG Ally X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>By playing Battlefield 6 online, you’re bound to level up. Completing matches and challenges will give you precious XP, allowing you to level up your profile. If you want to know how far you can go and how many levels there are to ascend, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-6-5-million-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has a lot of content, to say the least. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> will contribute to this, offering the community more ways to level up and earn rewards. Whether you play for the next few weeks, months, or years, chances are you’ll level up a lot.</p>



<p>So we’re checking out how many player levels there are to grind.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-highest-level-in-battlefield-6">What’s The Highest Level in Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bring the fire. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Technically, there isn’t a max level you can hit in Battlefield 6, as your player level can keep going.</strong></p>



<p>It’s believed that your Battlefield 6 player level can reach the high hundreds, maybe even the thousands. This means you can keep playing, keep leveling up, and flex on people with your incredible rank. Yes, remember to go out and touch some grass once in a while, but make sure you return to BF 6 as it’s always a fun journey starting at player level 1 and seeing how far you can progress.</p>



<p>As long as <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> keeps delivering the multiplayer goods—and offers a strong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale</a> component—there’s no reason not to dedicate many hours to BF 6 to see if you can reach the unreachable ceiling!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-level-do-you-stop-earning-battlefield-6-rewards">What Level Do You Stop Earning Battlefield 6 Rewards?</h2>



<p><strong>At the moment, you stop earning Battlefield 6 online rewards once you reach player level 100.</strong></p>



<p>Again, there seems to be no max level cap, but it should be a while until someone finds out anyway. However, once you hit rank 100, this definitely brings an end to your free rewards. At least for now, as EA might decide to increase the rewards cap, and either give you backdated rewards for levels you’ve already reached, or implement a new reward system.</p>



<p>Special events might also be another way to grind levels within the overall grind. Either way, there are plenty of goodies to attain.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-amp-fastest-ways-to-level-up-in-battlefield-6">Best &amp; Fastest Ways To Level Up in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p><strong>Playing in a party, seeking out special Portal maps, and being smart with XP Tokens are the best methods to level up fast in Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>We’re not going to get into the nitty-gritty of each point here, as we already have a useful, in-depth ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Farm XP &amp; Level Up Fast in Battlefield 6</a>‘ guide you should definitely read and bookmark.</p>



<p>But if you’re looking to level up fast, there are many ways you can embrace to make the process easier.</p>



<p>We hope this gave you the information you were looking for. May you level up in style and take pleasure in the misery of others as you defeat them for XP to level up!

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-are-rolling-out-a-fix-for-bullets-not-registering/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s principal game designer has stated that a fix for bullets not registering is on the way. </p>



<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 have done a spectacular job with the game, and the sales reflect that: the game has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-6-5-million-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 6.5 million copies</a> within a few days. However, there is still some work to do, as several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-glitches-exploits-ea-working-overtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bugs and glitches</a> continue to plague BF6. Fortunately, the next patch will address the ghost bullets issue in Battlefield 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-hits-not-registering-will-be-fixed-in-next-patch">Battlefield 6 Hits Not Registering Will be Fixed in Next Patch</h2>



<p>A new post by Battlefield 6’s principal game designer, Florian Le Bihan, on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978405809814987229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) discusses ‘rolling out a fix’ for bullets not registering. The developers have observed an issue “where bullets hit an enemy and where blood splatters are visible but don’t cause damage.” Le Bihan explained that this issue was caused “intermittently with certain weapons and attachments combinations and should now be resolved.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We are rolling out a fix to address the issue seen where bullets hit an enemy and where blood splatters are visible but don't cause damage.</p><p>The issue happened intermittently with certain weapons and attachments combinations and should now be resolved. <a href="https://t.co/rf4L04PpLR">https://t.co/rf4L04PpLR</a></p></div>— Florian – DRUNKKZ3 (@DRUNKKZ3) <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1978405809814987229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a reply to the thread, Le Bihan clarified that some hit registration issues can be caused by poor internet or game server performance; however, players will be informed of this through performance icons at the top left. The principal game designer also confirmed that this Battlefield 6 fix will not address bloom, as that’s “a different issue”. </p>
