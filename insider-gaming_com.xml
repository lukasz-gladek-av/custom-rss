<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 6 leaks have started pouring out, and it seems we might be getting Godzilla and Baymax in the next battle pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SamLeakss</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ResetzFtw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetzFTW</a> via reliable Fortnite insider <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, the Godzilla and Baymax collaboration has been “100%” confirmed for the upcoming battle pass. Shiina also shared an <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1861108459699118349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">image</a> along with the leak, which clearly features Godzilla, Baymax, and several other Japanese-themed characters, cosmetic items, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has various options to play around with when introducing characters like Godzilla and Baymax. In addition to cosmetics through the battle pass, the developers can work towards introducing live events and battle royale integration. However, the extent of these collaborations is unknown, as neither Epic Games nor Fortnite’s official accounts have confirmed this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ASKA Major Update Three, known as Servers &amp; Roads, is now available on the stable branch for all fans of the third-person crafting survival game with town-building mechanics. It’s a big one, too. Alongside the inclusion of dedicated servers, update three features in-game text chat, graphical improvements, path-making mechanics, and so much more. It’s a huge boon to anyone still enjoying the survival game!</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-new-in-aska-update-3-servers-amp-roads">Everything New in Aska Update 3 Servers &amp; Roads</h2>







<h3 id="h-dedicated-servers">Dedicated Servers</h3>



<p>You can now host and join dedicated servers in ASKA via a server application under the tools category in your Steam library. To launch a dedicated server, as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1898300/view/4464851103138187634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">per the studio</a>, simply:</p>

<li>Install this application on the machine you’re using as the server.</li>



<li>Open the server properties file in the installations folder (\steamapps\common\ASKA Dedicated Server).</li>



<li>Specify the world settings, seed, password etc.</li>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-in-game-text-chat">In-Game Text Chat</h3>
