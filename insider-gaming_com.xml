<p>Samsung has taken to the stage at MWC 2025 to unveil a stunning lineup of technology ranging from new OLED television sets to immense gaming monitors – and everything in between. The set included an incredible <strong>500 Hz OLED monitor </strong>and a gorgeous 240 Hz OLED laptop – and a conceptual handheld gaming device <strong>that folds in the middle</strong>.</p>



<p>This is following on from Samsung’s success with foldable mobile phones and tablets, and it’s a natural enough progression point, but is anyone asking for it?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-foldable-gaming-experiences">Foldable Gaming Experiences</h2>



<p>At MWC 2025, <a href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Samsung revealed</a> Flex Gaming, a conceptual device with a 7.2-inch screen that folds down the middle for ease of storage. It was revealed at the showcase, and a demo was held, but it wasn’t confirmed if the device was usable.</p>



<p>It looks as though it boasts a relatively traditional layout featuring a pair of joysticks and a d-pad, but there’s a recess on either side of the device. This is to allow the joysticks to ‘enter’ the device when it’s collapsed, which means it takes up even less space. </p>



<p>It was sat alongside a Steam Deck and Razer Blade 16, and all these devices were being used to run KRAFTON’s ‘popular games’, which included InZOI, a realistic competitor to The Sims.</p>



<p>Tech aficionados flocked to the event to check out Samsung’s new 77-inch QD-OLED televisions, as well as a 31.5-inch QD-OLED monitor, both of which boast utterly remarkably visuals and colour expression.</p>



<p>One of the more bizarre elements of the Samsung lineup was the Flexible Cabinbag, a bag-like device that unfolds into an 18.1-inch display. It can be compacted to fit inside a briefcase, and it comes equipped with – you guessed it – an OLED screen. That’s the order of the day where Samsung is concerned.</p>



<p>Do you think you’d invest in a folding handheld gaming device? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-champions-release%E2%80%94platforms-everything-we-know.1123728/</guid>

<p>Whisper it, but the release of Pokémon&nbsp;Champions instantly gives a Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium feeling. The Pokémon&nbsp;Company surprised everyone with its announcement, but now it’s out in the wild, it’s time to prepare yourself for battle.</p>



<p>Older Pokémon&nbsp;fans will remember the glory of Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium 1 and 2. The larger-than-life titles focused on the series’ core combat and head-to-head encounters. Exhilarating battles brought to life in huge arenas with flashy visuals and sizzling sound effects. The last 25 years have seen a slew of Pokémon&nbsp;titles, but none similar to Stadium. </p>



<p>Say hello to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-champions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon&nbsp;Champions</a>—a seemingly spiritual successor to the Stadium years. It’s an entirely new AAA release, and its launch might surprise you for a couple of reasons.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-pokemon-champions-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is Coming Out?</h2>

<p><strong>Pokémon&nbsp;Champions doesn’t have a release date or an estimated window. All we know for sure is it’s “Now in Development,” and updates on its progress will arrive as and when they are ready.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Pokémon&nbsp;Presents</a> showcase is where we first learned of Pokémon&nbsp;Champions. A new Pokémon&nbsp;title was rumored to be shown off during the presentation. But it was expected to be another remake or perhaps a remaster. </p>



<p>Instead, a full trailer for Pokémon&nbsp;Champions was revealed—showing off its glitz, glamor, and gameplay. You can check out the debut announcement trailer right here.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-champions-platforms">All Pokémon&nbsp;Champions Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is a multi-platform release for Nintendo Switch and mobile.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not just an exclusive Nintendo release and that’s it. Pokémon&nbsp;Champions is also coming to mobile platforms too. The official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik6IGiCzFzQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube trailer</a> announcement’s description confirms as much.</p>



<p>“Look forward to cross-platform battles alongside your favorite Pokémon on Nintendo Switch and mobile, with a variety of different modes available for your desired experience,” it says.</p>



<p>For now, we presume it’s the Nintendo Switch, but a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> release is likely on the cards as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-pokemon-champions">What is Pokémon&nbsp;Champions?</h2>



<p>Even though a lot of the content is quite cryptic, there’s a definite Pokémon&nbsp;Stadium feeling with big-time battles in large arenas again. It also looks like Pokémon&nbsp;can turn into Tera Types too. </p>



<p>It’s also confirmed Champions “Will feature familiar mechanics such as Pokémon types, Abilities, and moves, creating an environment conducive to rich and varied strategies for new and experienced Trainers alike.”</p>



<p>We’re sure we’ll learn much more about Pokémon Champions as time passes.</p>
