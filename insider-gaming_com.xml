<p>The month of September is stacked full of huge releases, with Hell Is Us among them, and in such a busy month, it pays to know which games are included in a Game Pass subscription to save you money.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-is-us-release-date-explained-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4</a>, Hell Is Us is landing in a hectic period of releases, alongside the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, and the flurry of top-class games landing mere days apart will stretch anyone’s wallet.</p>



<p>In these situations, a Game Pass subscription can come in handy by reducing your gaming shopping list, and we’ve got all the details on whether Hell Is Us is joining the service.</p>

<figure><figcaption>No luck. Credit to Nacon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Hell Is Us will not be available to play through an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 4th.</strong></p>



<p>Hell Is Us is not a first-party Xbox title, which would mean automatic inclusion in the service, and there hasn’t been any announcement of the game being added to the service.</p>



<p>While the full wave of <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> releases for September has not been announced by Microsoft, major launches like Hell Is Us are usually given a significant fanfare if they are coming to the service well in advance of release. As we’ve not seen any such news, don’t expect to see the game in the catalog.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hell-is-us-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Hell Is Us Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no news on whether Hell Is Us will come to the Xbox Game Pass service in the future, though it cannot be ruled out.</strong></p>



<p>Developer Rogue Factor does not have previous history of release titles, like Necromunda: Underhive Wars and Mordheim: City of the Damned, onto the Game Pass service. Therefore, it’s difficult to predict what any future approach with Hell Is Us will be.</p>



<p>Game Pass does open up titles to a wider audience, however, so the appeal for inclusion is clear, despite the heavy criticism the service as faced from some in the industry.</p>



<p>One likely thing, however, is that Hell Is Us will have a long wait before any Game Pass inclusion is considered, as big launches like this often have a significant delay before they join services like Game Pass.</p>
