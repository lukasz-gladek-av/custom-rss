<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is already off to an impressive start for sales, as Nintendo Japan reports it has sold almost 6 million copies in its first week.</p>



<p>As the latest in the franchise, Pokémon Legends: Z-A furthers Arceus’ open-air combat and brings it to Lumiose City. Sprawling with Pokémon of all regions and generations, the style and fun of past titles are on full display. Reviews for the title have been great, ranking among the best in the franchise. Plus, with Scarlet and Violet’s okay reception, Legends: Z-A has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-preview-the-new-battle-system-could-become-the-new-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a breath of fresh air</a> for all. Luckily, the sales are proof enough, with Nintendo Japan confirming its insane worldwide sales total for its launch week.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_pressreleases_20251023_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release from Nintendo Japan</a>, the company revealed that Pokémon Legends: Z-A, in its first week, has sold over 5.8 million copies worldwide. This does make the title one of the best-selling Nintendo Switch 2 games yet, which is an impressive feat. Given Mario Kart World, from stats from June 30th, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-sales-nearly-match-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 5.6 million</a> in its launch month, Pokémon is off to an incredible start. Furthermore, the press release claims that almost half of the sold copies were played on a Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>Seeing as Pokémon is one of Nintendo’s biggest franchises, it isn’t too surprising to see it launch with high sales. However, it’s still great for it to get almost 6 million in just the launch week. Furthermore, should the numbers get bigger, it can easily eclipse Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which sold 14.8 million within two months of its release in 2023. Overall, it seems Pokémon is here to stay, and fans wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
