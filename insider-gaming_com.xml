            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With many franchises going open-world when they weren’t before, leaks and rumors indicated that Resident Evil Requiem would follow the herd and make Grace and Leon’s adventure an open-world affair.</p>



<p>Not a single <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> game has ever gone fully open-world. The series has largely stuck to a rigid linearity and occasionally dabbled in semi-open worlds with deeper, interconnected areas to form a larger map.</p>



<p>It was thought that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem </a>might be the one to break the chain.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-resident-evil-requiem-an-open-world-game">Is Resident Evil Requiem An Open-World Game?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem is most definitely not an open-world game, as Leon and Grace’s respective gameplay sections are chopped-up chunks, with different areas being separated by loading screens, scripted events, and more.</strong></p>



<p>If you love the trademark Resi formula for level design, you won’t be disappointed with Requiem.</p>

</ul>



<p>There’s a Spencer Mansion-like hub area where you’ll spend a few hours or more solving puzzles, finding items, and locating keys for locked doors and rooms. There are linear action sequences, even more condensed locales with new puzzles and mechanics, and that’s how it goes for the duration of Resident Evil Requiem.</p>



<p>It’s anything but a seamless open-world design.</p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-9-open-world-rumors-explained">Resident Evil 9 Open World Rumors, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Leaks and rumors in the build-up to Resident Evil Requiem’s launch suggested the game would be open-world, and Resident Evil 9’s director later confirmed this to be true. While he clarified that the proposed rumors were worked on, he made it clear that the plans didn’t get very far.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming covered the news a while back that the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-online-open-world-rumors-were-true/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem online open-world rumors were true</a>.’</p>



<p>Director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed Capcom had tinkered with open-world and online multiplayer elements, featuring multiple players taking on Raid-esque Zombies.</p>

</ul>



<p>However, the team quickly distanced Requiem from these ideas for one simple reason: It’s not something “fans wanted to see or play.”</p>



<p>The wait goes on for an open-world Resident Evil game, and to be honest, it’s not something the franchise is crying out for. That’s IG’s opinion, so let us know if you disagree and you want to see what an open-world Resi title looks like.

<p>The Roulette table located in the Parlor in Resident Evil Requiem seems to be nothing more than just a novelty distraction you can interact with, but it’s actually a little Easter Egg with a fun reward. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> loves filling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> games with secrets. So no one should be surprised that while you’re trying to deal with a homicidal Chef zombie and a creature the size of an entire room, the developer wants you to uncover the mystery of the Roulette table!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-win-at-roulette-in-resident-evil-9">How To Win At Roulette In Resident Evil 9</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Spin the wheel. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You need to shoot either 7, 15, or 29 on the Roulette table with your gun, then spin the Roulette wheel; if your number comes up, you officially beat the Easter Egg.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/organless-corpse-walkthrough-resident-evil-requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Organless Corpse Walkthrough In Resident Evil Requiem</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Before a full explanation, here’s the method:</p>



<ol>
<li>First, <strong>ensure that you save</strong> (or the game has auto-saved) before attempting this, so you don’t waste ammo.</li>



<li>Head to the <strong>Parlor </strong>in the Care Center’s West Wing.</li>



<li>Approach the Roulette table.</li>



<li>Using any weapon (ideally a Pistol), shoot either <strong>Red 7, Black 15, or Black 29</strong> once, on the main part of the Roulette table—not on the wheel!</li>



<li>An audio cue should occur to indicate you’ve done this correctly.</li>



<li><strong>Do not shoot any other numbers once you’ve shot one of the outlined numbers</strong>.</li>



<li>Spin the Roulette wheel.</li>



<li>If it lands on the number you shot, you win.</li>



<li>If the wrong number comes up, you need to repeat steps 4-7 until your number comes up.</li>
</ol>



<p>The most important instruction is to save before attempting this. You have a 1 in 3 chance of your number coming up, but basic maths suggests you could be <em>very </em>unlucky and burn through vital bullets. If you waste so much as one bullet, feel free to reload your most recent save and head back to the Parlor.</p>



<p>7, 15, and 29 are the only numbers that can come up. In our experience, 15 seemed to come up the most, but again, it’s probably through coincidence more than an objective value swaying the odds.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-you-get-for-beating-roulette-easter-egg-puzzle-in-resident-evil-requiem">What Do You Get For Beating Roulette Easter Egg Puzzle In Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p><strong>If you shoot one of the three numbers on the table and it comes up on the wheel, you will be rewarded with an Antique Coin in Resident Evil 9.</strong></p>



<p>The Care Center’s Parlor has four items for you to exchange Antique Coins for: Two steroid injections, an inventory upgrade, and an upgrade for the Blood Collector.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bar-lounge-safe-resident-evil-requiem-combination-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Open Bar &amp; Lounge Safe In Resident Evil Requiem</a></li>
</ul>



<p>But you need more coins for later on, so it’s imperative you collect all Antique Coins—so win at Roulette before you advance in the story.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Terminator: Survivors Might Not Be in Danger as Nacon Posts Update]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-might-not-be-in-danger/</link>
            <guid>1449844</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was a few days back that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nacon-faces-closure-after-filing-for-insolvency/" id="180178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nacon</a> announced an insolvency filing that came as a result of financial difficulties at the highest echelons of the company. This threw several studios, projects, and hundreds of employees’ futures into question, including that of Terminator: Survivors, the highly anticipated post-apocalyptic survival game from Nacon Studio Milan.</p>



<p>However, after more than two months of radio silence, the team at Nacon Studio Milan has emerged on Steam with a lengthy blog post advising prospective fans that all is well – <strong>better than you’d expect</strong>, actually.</p>







<h2 id="h-keep-going-until-we-can-go-no-more">Keep Going Until We Can Go No More</h2>



<p>Terminator: Survivors underwent one hell of a pivot last year. In December, the team at Nacon, now assumedly under threat of insolvency, revealed that Terminator: Survivors had switched from an open-world multiplayer game to a single-player exclusive title.</p>



<p>It was also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-delayed-indefinitely-no-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed <strong>indefinitely</strong></a> at the time, which made fans sceptical about the game <strong>ever </strong>hitting the market.</p>



<p>On Steam, the team explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic “Terminator” experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer. </p>



<p>We know this may come as a disappointment, but&nbsp;<strong>we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Out of nowhere, Nacon Studio Milan surfaced on February 27 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with a new post</a>, putting a face to their studio’s name. They explained that they’ve been running for almost a decade and are made up of experienced and junior developers alike, all eager to produce the best game possible with Terminator: Survivors.</p>



<p>They offered new GIFs showcasing Terminator: Survivors scenery, set pieces, and some of the game’s ambience (including day-night and weather cycles), and explained three core points about the game’s design:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, we wanted to create an&nbsp;<strong>open-world experience</strong>. We believe that a seamless and handcrafted world is a critical component to demonstrate the cause-and-effect of intertwined fates, and shows what “changing the world” really means — for you, and for all those around you.</li>



<li>Secondly, though we do want to tell&nbsp;<strong>a new story</strong>&nbsp;in a new timeline, we still wanted it to feel like a natural extension of the fundamental lore set out in the first two&nbsp;<em>Terminator</em>&nbsp;movies. That meant exploring not only what the themes of the original films were, but also how the pacing of the narrative and the judicious use of cinematic effects built towards such a visceral experience.</li>



<li>Thirdly, while each platform in Skynet’s arsenal should project lethal force, we wanted to pay extra attention to the design of the&nbsp;<strong>T-800</strong>. It needed to properly embody the unstoppable menace it was always meant to be, necessitating extensive testing to hone its lethality as the cutting edge of Skynet’s forces — in both past and present.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>The next major update from the team will arrive this <strong>April</strong>. It was explained that, going forward, updates will arrive with a much more consistent cadence, and the next information drop will include ‘some peeks behind the curtain of development.’</p>



<p>Despite the difficulties at Nacon, the team is adamant that things are looking firm for Terminator: Survivors, and they invited users to join the game’s official Discord server to ask questions and learn about the game’s development.</p>



<p>There are even playtests lined up, which users can access by checking out the game’s Steam page.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie Addresses Marathon UI Gripes and PvP Concerns]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-addresses-marathon-ui-and-pvp-concerns/</link>
            <guid>1449832</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie has posted a feedback sheet regarding the Marathon server slam, and surprisingly, it addresses almost <strong>every major gripe </strong>players have with the fledgling extraction shooter. Marathon has hit a tentative period following the access all areas server slam, which has left many players firmly on one side of the fence or the other.</p>



<p>The full game comes out next week, but Bungie has been quick to address key concerns <strong>right now</strong> based on feedback received from the server slam. That includes worries around the game’s overly complex UI <strong>and </strong>the lack of PvP-based clashes.</p>







<h2 id="h-bungie-recognizes-pvp-woes-in-marathon">Bungie Recognizes PvP Woes in Marathon</h2>



<p>In an article <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2027924343800648062">posted to social media</a>, Bungie acknowledges <strong>six </strong>core issues with Marathon:</p>



<ul>
<li>UI Feedback</li>



<li>PC Performance</li>



<li>PvP Frequency</li>



<li>Movement and Heat Generation</li>



<li>Med and Ammo Economy</li>



<li>Weasel Error Codes</li>
</ul>



<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98">Marathon’s</a> server slam opened, one of the more immediate concerns from players was around the game’s UI (User Interface), which is drastically complex. It’s a nightmare to understand right out of the gate, presenting a critical issue with onboarding. The team at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99">Bungie</a> said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are continuing to gather your posts and will keep iterating post‑launch (which, we’ll keep you posted on with regard to any future timelines once they’re available). Add your thoughts in the UI thread on our Discord so we can track them all in one place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another major worry was around the cadence of PvP clashes. Most players reported going an entire raid without even <strong>seeing </strong>other players, which is far from ideal for a PvPvE extraction game. It’s not at all like competing titles such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> and ARC Raiders, in which player-vs-player clashes are almost guaranteed.</p>



<p>The team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As we continue to keep an ear to the ground on this one, we’re further investigating total player density on non-beginner maps to cover all of our bases. If you’ve got any feedback – be it on Perimeter (Beginner), Perimeter, or Dire Marsh – we want to hear it!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the first update post-launch, the team said that the player count on the game’s earliest maps had been boosted to promote more combat between players.</p>



<p>Movement and ‘heat generation’ have also been named as tricky areas. In Marathon, ‘heat’ replaces stamina, and the more aggressively you move, the faster you burn out and hit a wall. Many have reported that this happens far too quickly and the ramifications are far too impactful, and Bungie is investigating improvements.</p>



<p>Also, the lack of medical and ammo-based loot has been a gripe with players. It seems impossible to find meaningful amounts of ammunition around the map, and that’s a clear issue in a game with bullet-sponge AI enemies.</p>



<p>The Marathon server slam finishes tomorrow, March 2, and the full game hits the market on March 5. Do you think enough changes will be made to make it feel like a ‘better game’ at launch?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix is Disappearing From The PlayStation 3 Platform Tomorrow]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-disappearing-ps3-tomorrow-platform/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was around a month ago that retro gaming fans (kind of) were hit with a major revelation. Netflix, the titan streaming service, announced that it would cease operating an application on the <strong>PlayStation 3 platform</strong>. The console, which dropped <strong>twenty years ago</strong>, will no longer facilitate a working <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/netflix/" id="1142">Netflix</a> app from tomorrow, March 2.</p>



<p>It’s a wonder the application has lasted <strong>this long</strong>. For the last few weeks, users booting their dusty old PlayStation 3 consoles and loading Netflix would have been met with a message warning them of the application’s impending fate.</p>







<h2 id="h-another-nail-in-the-ps3-coffin">Another Nail in the PS3 Coffin</h2>



<p>In February, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-3/" id="436">PlayStation 3</a> users took <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crt/comments/1qubzpj/rip_ps3_netflix/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to social media</a> to discuss the removal of Netflix from their 20-year-old console platform. For some, it marked the end of an era, but for others, it was a total surprise that the application <strong>still worked</strong>… Barely.</p>



<p>One user explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>But was still super slow, quality less good as it took more time to reach the 1080p</p>



<p>And, the worse, often froze at 10 minutes before end on movies&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The biggest concern amongst retro fans is that this was one of the sole remaining ways to consume 4:3 content on Netflix. Those seeking a blast from the past could plug their PS3 into a CRT TV and go wild streaming content from the old days.</p>



<p>Another user wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>2006-2026 o7 One less streaming service on a great multimedia platform</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A third mourned the loss:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dog I JUST mentioned Netflix for the ps3 earlier today. This is tragic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you loaded Netflix on a PlayStation 3 console in the last month, you’d have seen the message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, Netflix will no longer be available on this device after March 2, 2026.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s time to move on, as impressive as it is that the app managed to cling to life this long. It was a similar situation when the Wii Shop closed down in 2019, forcing the removal of the Netflix app from <strong>that </strong>platform, which also facilitated cleaner 4:3 streaming.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Major Call of Duty Brand Shut Down After MLB Legal Clash]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In case you were wondering, the ‘World Series of Warzone’ moniker will never be seen again in an official setting. This is because, earlier this week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/activision/" id="190">Activision</a> suddenly dropped the name and trademark after a brief legal clash against Major League Baseball.</p>



<p>The spat came around the naming convention ‘World Series’, which the baseball folks determined was theirs and theirs alone, as a result of their lengthy history with competitions like the World Series, College World Series, and World Series 200. Activision <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=90906257&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">relented and dropped</a> the World Series of Warzone in the blink of an eye.</p>







<h2 id="h-world-series-of-warzone-is-no-more">World Series of Warzone is No More</h2>



<p>The World Series of Warzone was running for several years before being dropped by Activision. It was the <strong>biggest and most valuable </strong>tournament ecosystem in the Warzone space, accommodating thousands of battle royale fans every year. It was already confirmed that it wouldn’t be a thing this year, with Activision introducing things like the Warzone Resurgence Series instead.</p>



<p>Thanks to a scoop from Stephen Totilo <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/world-series-of-warzone-mlb-trademark-gta-vice-city-stories-sales?hide_intro_popup=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at Game File</a>, we now know why.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On Monday, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (aka the leadership team that runs MLB) officially filed a notice with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to oppose Activision’s long-running attempt to trademark the term “World Series of Warzone.”</p>



<p>That same day, Activision gave up, filing an express notice to the USPTO that&nbsp;it would abandon&nbsp;the trademark.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To avoid any confusion, the folks at Major League Baseball opposed the legitimization of the World Series of Warzone via the trademark office. But it didn’t end there.</p>



<p>The commissioner of the MLB also has an issue with the use of the term ‘zone’ in ‘War<strong>zone</strong>‘, given the connotations it has with baseball and how the term surfaces in many ways in the sport.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>extremely unlikely </strong>they’ll get anyone to budge on that front. It’s like the Fine Brothers trying to trademark ‘React’ to stop YouTube creators aping their grind.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Welcome to March! This coming week is <strong>really </strong>special, because it will mark the arrival of the 1000th NYT Connections puzzle! If you’re waiting for that all-important day to arrive, make sure you check back here every day to smash your NYT Connections puzzles with the best tips and hints around.</p>



<p>For today, we’ve got a doozy of a challenge. It’s a perfect way to get your brain whirring on a sleepy Sunday morning. Below, I’ve got today’s NYT Connections answers just waiting for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-march-1">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (March 1)</h2>
