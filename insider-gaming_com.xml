<p>Hypixel Studios’ founder has confirmed that a new patch is coming with dinosaurs, changes to mining sounds, and more. </p>



<p>The founder had recently discussed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-founder-unhappy-with-games-mining-outlines-thousands-of-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being unhappy with mining</a> in Hytale and asked for suggestions on how to make the process more satisfying, while outlining several other improvements coming to the game. It seems the first set of improvements to Hytale’s mining system should arrive tomorrow.  </p>

<p>A player on X recently tagged the Hypixel Studios founder on X (formerly Twitter) about the issues their avatar’s hair is facing due to the game’s headgear. Simon was quick to <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2011955835270779095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">respond</a> to the player, revealing that a “hide helm” option is arriving next week, which will fix their issue. </p>



<p>In the same thread, he also <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2011957105452855646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that a patch for Hytale is coming tomorrow that will add dinosaurs to Z4 underground, change mining sounds, allow placing torches in dual wield, and more. The patch will also include some fixes; however, details about them were not revealed. </p>

<p>Hytale developers are back again with a new hotfix, this time addressing connectivity and stability issues. </p>



<p>Hypixel Studios’ new sandbox RPG seems to be off to a great start in early access, with even Riot Games, the studio that previously cancelled the game, congratulating them on the successful release. The developers are hard at work to constantly improve the game and have recently released a hotfix to address several concerns. </p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-january-15-hotfix-details">Hytale January 15 Hotfix Details</h2>



<p>As revealed on their <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hotfixes-january-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a>, Hytale’s new hotfix addresses connectivity and stability issues. The game has now received general server stability and network improvements in the new update. After updating, the game switches to offline mode if authentication fails; it used to get stuck before. The last connectivity fix addressed the “invalid token” errors that appeared when the player’s system clock was slightly out of sync. </p>



<p>Regarding stability improvements, client performance has improved through optimization of background task scheduling. Additionally, issues with dropped items getting stuck inside blocks and server crashes in certain situations have been fixed. Interested readers can check out the changes from the previous hotfix <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-hytale-early-access-update-for-january-13-full-patch-notes-included/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mtg-fallout-secret-lair-rad-superdrop-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1408009</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Magic: The Gathering is preparing to expand on the Fallout collaboration that was released in 2024 with an all-new Secret Lair drop. The Secret Lair website was recently updated with a new banner that reveals the crossover as coming soon, but instead of focusing on <strong>the games</strong>, the ‘Rad Superdrop’ will be linked wholeheartedly to the Fallout television series.</p>



<p>Many of the cards were revealed early on, uncovering a stack of premium prints, including Lucy MacLean, The Ghoul, Maximus, the Platinum Chip, and Mindcrank, which was the first card to be unveiled. </p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-s-magic-secret-lair-range-coming-soon">Fallout’s Magic Secret Lair Range Coming Soon</h2>



<p>The Secret Lair range, which sits under the Magic banner, has featured some of the most beloved franchises in gaming and pop culture. The likes of The Last of Us, Uncharted, Avatar, God of War, Horizon, and Ghost of Tsushima have all found a home in the Secret Lair brand, which is described as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>…<strong>the party inside the party at Magic: The Gathering</strong>. We combine everything we love about Magic with the stuff in pop culture that inspires us. Each drop puts a brand-new spin on your favorite cards and might even have something entirely new.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Fallout MTG Secret Lair line is the next big entrant into that universe, and it’s coming soon.</p>



<p>Secret Lair and Magic confirmed that the Fallout Rad Superdrop line will go live on January 26, exclusively <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/#rad_superdrop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the Secret Lair site</a>.</p>



<p>There’s also something special for the diehard fans willing to part ways with a hefty amount of cash – the <strong>Secret Lair x Fallout Silver Shroud Costume </strong>promo card, only available once you’ve spent at least $149 USD.</p>



<p>At the heart of the Fallout Secret Lair pack sits the Beyond Vault 33 centrepiece. This includes the entire line-up of the Fallout TV show characters, imagined in a range of settings and outfits. That’s especially true for Lucy MacLean, arguably the lead of the Fallout show above The Ghoul and Maximus, who is shown in the many outfits she has worn as the show has unravelled.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end there, though – many sub-sets make up the Secret Lair x Fallout drop:</p>



<ul>
<li>Secret Lair x Fallout: Greet the Dog</li>



<li>Secret Lair x Fallout: Rad</li>



<li>Secret Lair x Fallout: Welcome to New Vegas</li>
</ul>



<p>For each pack, foil prices will be between $39.99 and $49.99, while non-foil prices will be from $29.99 to $39.99.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast has advised that stock is likely to sell out very fast, especially given the hype around Fallout as the second season of the show unravels and the game franchise remains extremely popular.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout fans worldwide are preparing to <strong>potentially </strong>step into a real-world vault to live out their post-apocalyptic dreams in the <strong>all-new </strong>Fallout Shelter reality show. The new project was recently unveiled by Prime Video, alongside a casting call for participants. The successful applicants will live with others in a ‘real vault’ and complete challenges to hopefully be the last one left in the shelter.</p>



<p>It looks like Bethesda Game Studios and Prime Video plan to make the ‘experiment’ as close to a Vault-Tec test as possible. The casting call stressed that vault dwellers will be tested with ‘escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral conundrums.’</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-shelter-s-new-reality-show-starts-production-soon">Fallout Shelter’s New Reality Show Starts Production Soon</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Prime Video wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Good morning, prospective Vault Dwellers! In order to best serve you in What Comes Next, we need volunteers for a very real, very scientific opportunity to beta test a better society. Visit this website if you’d like to join Fallout Shelter, a new series full of escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral conundrums. Good luck!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you head to the <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website for the casting call</a>, you’ll be hit with all the information you need. </p>



<p>To apply, you must be at least 21 years of age, must hold a valid passport, and will need to be free for three weeks in June 2026 for filming. The casting call form is <strong>huge</strong> and asks for a heck of a lot of information, and it’s there to allow applicants to really sell themselves to Fallout Shelter’s casting team.</p>



<p>In December 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-shelter-reality-show-adaptation-claim/">it was claimed by</a> an industry insider that Fallout Shelter would be getting a live-action adaptation, but not like the Fallout television series that has been running since April 2024. Instead, it would be getting a ‘reality show’ approach, taking everyday people and throwing them into a vault to complete challenges.</p>



<p>This has materialized as fact, with Bethesda Game Studios and Prime Video officially unveiling the project.</p>



<p>Don’t be deterred, but the short trailer for the casting call stresses that ‘Vault-Tec assumes no liability for injury, dismemberment, or decapitation,’ but that’s just a joke… right?</p>



<p>It was said that the show will take on a ‘Squid Game’ or ‘MrBeast Games’ approach, whittling down the survivors as they’re eliminated one by one. There’s a cash prize for the ultimate victor, but it hasn’t been made clear yet how much that will be.</p>



<p>Fallout is exploding once again (no pun intended) as the second season of the award-winning television show started up again in December and is set to run until February 4th. There are claims of Fallout 3 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-coming-claimed/">Fallout: New Vegas remakes</a> on the horizon, and Fallout 76 just got its biggest update <strong>ever</strong>.</p>







<p>Do you want to apply for the Fallout Shelter reality show? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you think you’d win!</p>

<p>A new leak reveals that the LEGO Zelda 2026 set is LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time; check out the price, release date, and other details below. </p>



<p>For those unaware, LEGO had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a new The Legend of Zelda set late last year, with a release date window set for 2026. It seems that the Nintendo partnership is growing faster than ever, with the Great Deku Tree set in 2024, LEGO Mario in 2025, and the recently revealed LEGO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-reveals-first-five-pokemon-sets-releasing-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon sets</a> for 2026. </p>







<h2 id="h-lego-the-legend-of-zelda-the-final-battle-ocarina-of-time-set-reportedly-releasing-in-march-2026">LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time Set Reportedly Releasing in March 2026</h2>



<p>A new leak on the Brick Tap <a href="https://discord.gg/wgcCpdMk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> reveals that the next set will feature LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time. The reported pricing for this set is $129.99/€119.99/£99.99. The set will feature 1003 pieces, which include Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf minifigures. It will also include Navi the Fairy, brick-built Ganon, the Megaton Hammer, and Recovery Hearts. The new LEGO Zelda set will seemingly release on March 1, 2026. </p>



<p>The previous LEGO Zelda collaboration brought the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set, featuring versions from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. It featured two mini-figures of Link, along with Young Link and Princess Zelda. The set featured 2500 pieces and was priced at $299. </p>
