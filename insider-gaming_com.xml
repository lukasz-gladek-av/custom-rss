<p>IEM Katowice is officially no more, and the competition has moved to Krakow for 2026. This monumental change seemed drastic at the time, but fans are now readying themselves to visit a new city for this supersized tournament. In this guide, we’re breaking down everything you need to know about IEM Krakow 2026, including the schedule, teams competing, and where to watch it.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in IEM Krakow betting or just want to watch your favourite teams and players enjoying Counter-Strike 2 action live on stream, read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-schedule-and-location">IEM Krakow 2026 Schedule and Location</h2>



<p>IEM Krakow 2026 will take place at the TAURON Arena in the city of Kraków, Poland. It’s set to run from January 28th to February 8th, and in that time, 24 teams will fight for the lion’s share of a massive $1 million prize.</p>



<p>Here’s the <strong>IEM Krakow 2026 schedule and format:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Play-In Stage</strong></p>



<p>During this stage, 16 teams come together for the Play-In round, which features a double-elimination bracket and a series of best-of-three matches. It’s a whittling round here, and only the top eight will make it through to the next round to face the higher-seeded competitors.</p>



<p><strong>Group Stage</strong></p>



<p>The Group Stage includes the eight successful teams from the Play-In Stage and the eight that had already qualified with a higher seeding for IEM Krakow. The teams will compete along another double-elimination pathway, with each group being made up of eight teams in total.</p>



<p>The Group Stage <strong>winners </strong>go through to the semi-finals, the <strong>runners-up </strong>advance to the Quarterfinals as <em>high seeds</em>, and the <strong>third-place teams </strong>go through to the Quarterfinals as <em>low seeds</em>. Only the top three teams from each group will land in the Playoffs.</p>



<p><strong>Playoffs</strong></p>



<p>The Playoffs will crown the champion at IEM Krakow 2026. This is a single-elimination bracket with a best-of-five grand final that will see six teams fight for the grand prize – $400,000.</p>



<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-teams">IEM Krakow 2026 Teams</h2>



<p>Here is the full list of the teams qualified to compete at IEM Krakow 2026:</p>



<p><strong>Directly Qualified</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Team Vitality</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Team Spirit</li>



<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>The MongolZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Play-In Teams</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Aurora Gaming</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Legacy</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>



<li>Astralis</li>



<li>PARIVISION</li>



<li>HEROIC</li>



<li>paiN Gaming</li>



<li>FUT Esports</li>



<li>Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>



<li>BC.Game Esports</li>



<li>NRG</li>



<li>GamerLegion</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-iem-krakow-2026-predictions">IEM Krakow 2026 Predictions</h2>



<p>Team Vitality enters the running as the primary title contender, despite recent losses. For a safe IEM Krakow bet, you’d consider backing them, or for similar odds, Team Spirit. FURIA has been on a resurgence of late, and the Brazilian roster could make for a middle-of-the-road bet if you’re playing outrights.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, a swing-tier squad like Team Liquid and Ninjas in Pyjamas could manufacture an underdog win that could result in a nice return for Counter-Strike betting fans.</p>

<p>It’s time to crawl out through the Fallout one more time with episode 8 of Fallout Season 2. Amazon’s stunning adaptation is reaching its conclusion, and Season 2’s episode 8 release date draws closer than a Bloatfly to your irradiated presence.</p>



<p>The Ink Spots famously sang about not wanting to set the world on fire, and yet, Amazon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> adaptation has constantly been on fire. Every episode has knocked it out of the park. Fallout Season 2 has been a joy to watch from start to finish, and the high stakes are about to be raised one more time in New Vegas.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-season-2-episode-8-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Episode 8 will show great steel once more. Credit to Amazon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Tuesday, February 3, is the official release date for Fallout Season 2, episode 8.</strong></p>



<p>The last couple of episodes of Season 2 have been rejigged by Amazon slightly. But you have no excuse for missing it now with this information! The reason for Amazon’s tinkering with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-episode-7-release-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode 7</a> and episode 8 was “Due to strong participation and interest,” which, in short, was to make it available for more regions earlier and cut down on potential spoilers.</p>



<p>No one wants a finale ruined for them, making this a commendable gesture by Amazon.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-episode-8-start-times-amp-dates">Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Start Times &amp; Dates</h2>



<p><strong>The United States claims the first release time for Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 with a 6 PM PT start time on February 3. Insider Gaming has also provided more time zones for you to check out, including GMT and AET.</strong></p>



<p>It’s the United Kingdom who are probably most at risk for an episode 8 spoiler due to the 2 AM start time! Whereas many other regions are getting more favorable start times.</p>



<p>Take a look at this table and see when Season 2 episode 8 airs for you.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Region</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Fallout Season 2 Episode 8 Dates &amp; Release Time</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">6:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">8:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 PM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM—February 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1:00 PM—February 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM—February 4</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If episode 8 is even half as good as the rest, then Fallout’s newest batch of TV is about to go out with a Megaton ending, atomic bomb-sized bang.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good morning, Vault Dwellers! Due to strong participation and interest, we have amended the start times for the remaining Season Two presentations. Episode Seven will now begin Tuesday, Jan. 27 at 6 p.m. PT, and Episode Eight will now begin Tuesday, Feb. 3 at 6 p.m. PT.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The voice actor who portrayed Lara Croft in the first game has been cast in Amazon’s live-action Tomb Raider series. </p>



<p>The Tomb Raider live-action series recently revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazons-tomb-raider-announces-multiple-castings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple castings</a>, including Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, Martin Bobb-Semple, Bill Patterson, and more. However, it seems that one of the names wasn’t included in this list, and it might be a very big one and a nostalgic voice that the die-hard fans might remember. </p>







<h2 id="h-keeley-hawes-joins-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Keeley Hawes Joins Live-Action Tomb Raider Series </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/38027622/keeley-hawes-amazon-prime-lara-croft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Sun</a>, Keeley Hawes, who voiced Lara Croft in the original game, will star in Amazon’s live-action Tomb Raider series. However, she wouldn’t be playing the titular role of Lara Croft, as that has been reserved for Game of Thrones star <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sophie-turner-lara-croft-first-look-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner</a>. There’s also an image from the set that surfaced in the report, showing Hawes in a long raincoat and a shopping bag in her hand. </p>



<p>Readers have already started speculating what role she could be playing, with many guessing it could be Lara Croft’s mother, Lady Amelia Croft, the Countess of Abingdon. However, that hasn’t been confirmed yet. </p>



<p>Hawes has spoken about still meeting fans of the game, stating they are “some of the nicest people I have ever met.” These meet-ups usually go down with her “making them a new answering machine message”. She still sees that as a good thing, stating that fans are so passionate about Lara Croft, with the character being around for over 20 years, and was “a huge part of the teenage years of so many people.” </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/</link>
            <guid>1417690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Map Conditions are a key part of what keeps ARC Raiders feeling fresh and exciting, as they can fundamentally change how a map is played. Not all of them are that drastic, though, and Headwinds’ Bird City is a simple but notable Minor Map Condition. </p>



<p>Headwinds is the first major update for ARC Raiders in 2026, and it brought with it a nice selection of content. The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy Display Project</a> is perhaps the star of the update, but don’t sleep on Bird City.</p>







<p>If you’re wondering what’s different with Bird City in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> and where you can play it, then you’re in the right place. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-maps-is-bird-city-on-in-arc-raiders">What Maps Is Bird City On In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Look out for the Bird Icon. Image by Insider Gaming. </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Bird City, the new Minor Map Condition in ARC Raiders, is exclusive to the Buried City map. </strong></p>



<p>Every hour, map conditions refresh in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-prime-specimen-arc-raiders-arc-deforester-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, with Major and Minor Conditions shifting between the line-up. If you’re looking to jump into Bird City, though, you’ll need to keep your eye on Buried City, as it won’t feature anywhere else.</p>



<p>The lore behind it is that when the Cold Snap defrosted, birds were able to return from their migration. Now they’ve returned in their masses, and they’re making nests all across Buried City—with loot ripe for the taking. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-changes-does-bird-city-make-in-arc-raiders">What Changes Does Bird City Make In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Search every chimney. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>This bird had fine taste. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p><strong>The main thing to look out for during the Bird City Minor Map Condition is the nests that are laid in chimneys across the map.</strong></p>



<p>Considering it’s only a Minor Map Condition, it makes sense that nothing drastic has changed, but it does pose a nice chance to earn some extra loot. The birds have laid nests across Buried City, and you can search them all for Trinkets and Epic Loot. It’s by no means guaranteed; in fact, it’s fairly rare, but these nests are more than easy to find, so get searching!</p>







<p>Here’s the full list of changes made to Buried City during the Bird City Minor Map Condition:</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased amount of Trinkets</li>



<li>Increased amount of Birds</li>



<li>Increased amount of Ziplines</li>
</ul>
