<p>Embracer is, well, embracing more AI use moving forward as part of the company’s future. </p>



<p>In statements made during it’s latest earnings report, CEO Phil Rogers called AI an “increasingly supportive force”. He said that AI use, “smarter collaboration” and “increased streamlining” will “be key to unlocking value and expanding margins.”</p>



<p><strong>“Our ambition is simple and focused: lead with distinctive IP; deliver with clarity and discipline; and realize our full potential,”</strong> he said. <strong>“The choices we make now will determine not just what we achieve, but who we become.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding streamlining, Embracer, as it moves forward to becoming Fellowship Entertainment, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q1-april-june-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-75-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says that its focus will remain</a> on <strong>“continuous improvement as well as targeted cost initiatives.”</strong></p>



<p>These initiatives will target underperforming businesses that will allow them to <strong>“free up capital to deploy with better returns.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“These initiatives could potentially include divestments,”</strong> Rogers said without mentioning if it also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-let-go-nearly-2000-employees-in-the-last-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">means more layoffs</a> could come.</p>



<p>Right now, Rogers said, the company is facing what he calls a <strong>“pivotal moment”</strong> where Embracer needs to “sharpen [its] focus”. He said that the company will “double down” on what he believes is its greatest strength: <strong>“empowering talented teams to deliver unforgettable experiences based on globally loved IP.”</strong></p>



<p>Those IP include franchises like The Lord of the Rings,&nbsp;Tomb Raider,&nbsp;Kingdom Come Deliverance,&nbsp;Metro, and Dead Island, to name a few. Rogers says that the company is “laying the groundwork” for a better development environment for its titles that he believes is <strong>“one of the most exciting IP portfolios in the industry.”</strong></p>



<p>Embracer has nine AAA games in development and set for release without counting any projects financed by partners. A couple of those games, however, might slip into fiscal year 2028/29.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Embracer/Fellowship Entertainment, especially when it comes to AI use and these “targeted cost initiatives”? Let us know in the comments down below.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-rad-eus-trqstme-says-marvel-rivals-regular-patches-make-esports-insanely-difficult/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-rad-eu%E2%80%99s-trqstme-says-marvel-rivals%E2%80%99-regular-patches-make-esports-%E2%80%98insanely-difficult%E2%80%99.1270239/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rad EU star TrqstMe believes it’s “insanely difficult” for Esports teams to compete in Marvel Rivals due to the regularity of patches, but hard work paid off after success in the Ignite Mid-Season Finals in Guangzhou.</p>



<p>The EMEA fought back against the odds in the Grand Final to overcome Envy, a team that had already defeated them twice at the event, to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ignite-mid-season-finals-complete-scores-standings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secure a 4-2 triumph</a>, a grand prize of $160k, and a place in history.</p>



<p>Rad EU’s victory was made even more impressive by the team’s uncertain future, with requests for the entire team to be signed by a new organisation <a href="https://x.com/fate_gb/status/1954738412893987073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared the day after their triumph</a>, giving the team even more challenges to overcome. The biggest of them all, according to TrqstMe, is Rivals’ regular patch schedule.</p>

<p>Speaking to Insider Gaming after the final, TrqstMe described dealing with the regular patches, which now see a new hero releasing every four weeks, as “insanely difficult” and “a full-time job.”</p>



<p>Not only does each major patch bring a new hero, who teams must quickly test out to see how they fit into the meta, but it also brings a range of buffs and nerfs to existing heroes. All this, along with the complexity of the banning system at high ranks, makes it difficult for new players to join the game.</p>



<p>“It’s unapproachable for a newcomer because a lot is going on, especially with the bans and stuff. There needs to be someone who explains it. In the future, more people will be there to analyse and explain it to the casual audience.”</p>



<p>Despite the complexities of the game, TrqstMe is adamant that Marvel Rivals is here to stay and declared that “everyone who hasn’t tried it needs to.”</p>



<p>For TrqstMe and his teammates, the future of the team may be somewhat up in the air ahead of the EMEA Ignite Stage 2 later this year, where the team will battle for a spot in the Grand Finals that offers a whopping $1m prize pool, but it’s clear he will be pivotal to any future success.</p>



<p>“All the effort I spent over the year paid off. I think I was one of the hardest-working players in the world. We did everything for the team, outside of the game and inside, I was leading the team a lot. I’m very happy it contributed to my success.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rematch Crossplay Gets Tentative Release Window From Sloclap]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rematch-crossplay-gets-tentative-release-window-from-sloclap/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nearly two months after its release, crossplay in Rematch appears to finally be on the horizon. </p>



<p>In a post announced details for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rematch-gets-second-major-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s second major patch</a>, developer Sloclap has given a new update regarding crossplay for players. </p>



<p><strong>“Patch 3 should hopefully arrive by the end of August, and will fix some remaining known issues, and importantly introduce Crossplay to the game (at last!),”</strong> they said. </p>



<p>In addition to crossplay coming to the game, Sloclap said that “some gameplay tweaks” may also be added in Patch 3, specifically calling out the Ippy Slide. Those details, however, are “still to be confirmed”.</p>



<p>Crossplay in Rematch was scheduled to be a major feature for the soccer game upon release. Unfortunately, shortly before its launch, Sloclap <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rematch-will-not-have-crossplay-at-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that it wouldn’t</a> be available at that time, though getting it implemented was a “top priority”.</p>



<p>At the time, the developers said that they did their “utmost” to have it available at launch, but “unforeseen technical complexities” prevented it from happening. </p>



<p>Recently, the studio said that <strong>“core work”</strong> <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/mini-dev-update-1-august-12th-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was complete on the feature</a> with it being validated by Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation. </p>



<p><strong>“This milestone represents the most time-consuming phase of the project, involving multiple rounds of collaboration and in-depth testing with each platform,”</strong> Sloclap said. <strong>“Our UI/UX and Online teams have been fully focused on bringing crossplay to life, which has meant fewer updates and improvements to existing features in recent weeks.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We’re now shifting our efforts toward final stabilization and bug fixing, with a special focus on polishing the Social features.”</strong></p>
