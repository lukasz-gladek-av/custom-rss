            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-1-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>There was a lot about Star Wars Outlaws that I thoroughly enjoyed, but its combat wasn’t one of them. I cheesed the system whenever possible, using stealth or outright taking a long route around enemies to avoid combat. It felt awkward, clunky, and barebones. Apparently, that will all change with Star Wars Outlaws title update 1.4, which aims to improve the game’s feel and approach, specifically combat, and embrace player-choice-driven gameplay, allowing you to tackle encounters and missions more freely. It’s a welcome change that we hope will entice returning players.</p>



<p>This reveal stems from a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent official blog post</a> by the Star Wars Outlaws team, which also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-full-release-star-wars-outlaws-get-new-creative-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed a new Creative Director, Drew Rechner</a>, who is taking over for Julian Gerighty. For now, let’s focus on the gameplay enhancements coming in title update 1.4, namely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we’ve focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions particularly around stealth, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we’re looking to improve the game even further.</em></p>



<p><em>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter. Finally, our third key area of focus is centered around the character controls, which means improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls overall.</em></p>



<p><em>You can expect to see more details about how we will be celebrating and embracing player choice more than ever before, whether it’s sneaking through encounters, going in blasters-blazing, or everything in-between. We will provide more specific details about the changes to these areas and more in the upcoming weeks as we provide further updates to you. All of this will culminate in the release of Title Update 1.4 which will release on November 21st alongside the Steam launch and first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thankfully, we don’t have to wait long—Star Wars Outlaws title update 1.4 launches alongside the game on Steam on <strong>November 21</strong>.</p>

<p>The popular video game, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, which was released back in 2019, just had images leaked online of it being tested on PSN (PlayStation Network). Since its release, the game has been a staple within the PC and Xbox community but has never seen the light of day on a PlayStation console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-being-tested-on-psn">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition Being Tested on PSN</h2>



<p>The original Age of Empires II was first released back in 1999. For its 20th anniversary, the game got the Definitive Edition just back in 2019. Xbox and PC gamers were lucky enough to indulge in this classic, but it was never brought over to PlayStation. In fact, no Age of Empires game has ever been released on a PlayStation console.</p>



<p>However, leaked images online show that PSN subscribers could soon be getting the title brought over to their respective consoles.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leak first surfaced when Reddit user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/draconis90/">u/draconis90</a>, posted the image above on Reddit, which shows two players playing the game on PlayStation. </p>



<p>However, the user also states that this could just be a graphics bug.</p>



<p>Still, not too long ago, Tom Warren, a Senior Editor at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>, leaked that the game could be getting a PlayStation release in the early months of 2025. Still, no known information has been released since except for the leaked image above.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-this-all-mean">What Does This All Mean?</h2>



<p>So, what does all of this mean? Will Age of Empires fans finally be getting a title on PlayStation? Or is it simply just a bug that appeared? </p>



<p>While many are speculating on whether or not this image is real, there have been zero other gamers to emerge and claim they have seen the same glitch happen in their game.</p>



<p>Tell us your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p>I wasn’t among the countless who positively despised Star Wars Outlaws upon its release. Sure, it wasn’t the best open-world game, but it certainly wasn’t the worst. It was missing something, and apparently, Ubisoft feels the same, as its latest blog post for the game announces not only Title Update 1.4 but also the fact that Star Wars Outlaws has a new Creative Director, Drew Rechner, who is taking over for Julian Gerighty.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official blog post</a> on the Star Wars Outlaws site, Ubisoft said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Outlaws,</em></p>



<p><em>I’m very excited to be stepping into the role of Creative Director on Star Wars Outlaws and to be working with the incredibly passionate team here at Massive Entertainment along with our talented co-development studios around the world and Lucasfilm Games. I would like to personally thank you, our community, for your positive response to the game. We see and love all the fan arts, comments, and videos you’ve created around the game, and it continues to provide joy and inspiration to the team. We truly hope you’re enjoying your journey across the Outer Rim with Kay and Nix thus far.</em></p>



<p><em>I also want to take the time to say that we hear not only your positive feedback, but your constructive feedback as well. Thank you for sharing with us and helping us make the game even better. Today, I want to share with you the next priority areas we are looking to address to ensure that Star Wars Outlaws is the best experience possible for you.</em></p>



<p><em>From before launch and continuing into post-launch, we have been gathering data from and listening to you. This takes place not only formally through our analytics, user tests, reviews and media feedback, our Star Wars Outlaws Bug Reporter, crash reports, and other mechanisms, but also informally when we see your YouTube videos and Reddit, Discord or other social media posts. We deeply care about your experience with the game, and use all the data and feedback possible to see the friction points you are encountering, what you’re enjoying, and where we can further improve certain elements that matter the most to you.</em></p>



<p><em>Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we’ve focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions particularly around stealth, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we’re looking to improve the game even further.</em></p>



<p><em>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter.

<p><em>You can expect to see more details about how we will be celebrating and embracing player choice more than ever before, whether it’s sneaking through encounters, going in blasters-blazing, or everything in-between. We will provide more specific details about the changes to these areas and more in the upcoming weeks as we provide further updates to you. All of this will culminate in the release of Title Update 1.4 which will release on November 21st alongside the Steam launch and first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</em></p>



<p><em>To our players, thank you again for your support and feedback, and we hope you will enjoy continuing exploring the galaxy with us. And if you’re new to the game, there’s never been a better time to experience the Outer Rim with Kay and Nix!</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’re unsure what’s coming in the next Star Wars Outlaws update. According to the post, the community has highly requested fixes and features, and there are likely plenty of quality-of-life tweaks, but there’s no telling just yet. The team promises to share more about Star Wars Outlaws Title Update 1.4 on social media later, but it’s scheduled to hit on November 21st, so we expect to hear more soon!</p>

<p>I won’t sit here and tell you that I’m a totally stoic horror fan. I don’t miss the big ones, but I’m still a total wuss and trudge through the latest shockingly horrific games at night, which is the only time I get to play anything these days. As we all know, playing horror games in the dark is, like, ten times worse. But when you add more action into the experience, well, I’m all for that. Slitterhead promises action combined with horror, and I’m here for it. But how are the Slitterhead reviews panning out before release? Let’s take a look!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-slitterhead">What is Slitterhead?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, for those who stumbled upon this upcoming horror game, or Insider Gaming in general, let’s go over the nitty-gritty of Slitterhead. It’s certainly a unique name and immediately evokes images of horrific scenery and, in my eyes, body horror. Well, that’s apt, considering the game is primarily about body horror with brain-devouring parasite-like creatures that hunt and consume humans. But you, you’re unique. You’re a Hyoki, which means you can possess humans, too, but for good. You’ll use various blood-based abilities and possessed forms to defeat Slitterheads in all shapes and sizes as they wreak havoc on the city of Kowlong.</p>



<p>Slitterhead is out <span>on <strong>November 8</strong> on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</span>!</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-play-the-horror-game-a-look-at-early-critic-reviews-of-slitterhead">Should You Play the Horror Game? A Look at Early Critic Reviews of Slitterhead</h2>



<p>Now, before you whip out your wallet, especially considering Slitterhead stems from one of the deranged minds behind the original Silent Hill, let’s take a look at a few early critic reviews of the horror game:</p>



<p><a href="https://gamingbolt.com/slitterhead-review-wonderfully-bizarre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingBolt</a>:</p>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>I&nbsp;say this as a compliment-&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>is one of the weirdest games I’ve played this entire console generation, and definitely the weirdest game I’ve played this year. Coming from Bokeh Game Studio – a new indie team formed by Keiichiro Toyama, the creator of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill, Siren,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Gravity Rush&nbsp;</em>– it has certain expectations to live up to, but rather than being a slave to those expectations, it carves out a unique identity for itself. It’s not without its issues, and it certainly isn’t a game that I’d recommend to anyone without any caveats- but if you&nbsp;<em>can&nbsp;</em>look past its issues, there’s a very different and interesting gaming experience on offer here.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/slitterhead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s horrific, but the crux of Slitterhead is its moment-to-moment action. You’re not a helpless dad stumbling through the snowy town of&nbsp;Silent Hill&nbsp;with a lead pipe in hand, but a small militia of civilians armed with razor-sharp clubs conjured up from their own blood. It’s an incredibly ambitious game that reminds me of a time when this industry was far bolder.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slitterhead-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is something of a honeymoon phase to Slitterhead’s early moments, as you admire Kowlown’s murkiness and the general grossness of the yoghurt monsters. Sadly, this haze also quickly starts to dissipate, replaced by a thick fog of jank. Like its namesake enemies bursting forth from an unfortunate meat puppet, Slitterhead eventually reveals its true nature, and reader, it isn’t good.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/slitterhead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Part sci-fi body horror, part thrilling detective yarn, Slitterhead is a story of humanity versus monstrosity in a city where both are plentiful. Bokeh’s debut release bravely takes strides to manipulate, challenge, and evolve how we play horror games, and while some of these risks do not pay off as well as others, Slitterhead’s sheer creative ambition is impossible to ignore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/slitterhead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PushSquare</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s quite a lot going on here, and sometimes the information is buried in tutorial menus. But it makes for a unique combat system unlike anything else you’ve ever played. One character can drop a blood vortex onto the stage, for example, sucking foes in; you can then switch to an unimportant human, prime them for detonation, run into the middle of aforementioned maelstrom, and possess a different body before they explode.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/slitterhead-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechRadar</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Slitterhead won’t be for everyone due to its quirks, it’s a bit clunky and reuses content frequently. But behind its issues lies one of the most unique titles of the past few years. With a great mystery story, impressive world-building for a debut, and a possession mechanic that adds an extra strategic layer to combat. Slitterhead lives up to its pedigree.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-ops-6-update-addresses-issues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Ops 6 has been on the market for more than a week, and players are busying themselves contending with everything from SBMM to the annual camo grind. It’s being mostly well received by the community, but there are a few niggling issues that are being steadily addressed by Treyarch and Co.</p>



<p>The latest Black Ops 6 patch has applied a few tweaks that will help to fix some of these issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-early-changes">Early Changes</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 might only be a week old, but it’s already being adjusted left, right, and centre by Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>The most recent update has made it tougher for users to <strong>snake</strong>, which is where they adjust their stance rapidly to ‘bob up and down’ in a way that makes them hard to hit. Typically, they’ll do that behind cover, and for anyone trying to engage them, it becomes near impossible to land consecutive shots.</p>



<p>Treyarch has also adjusted flashbangs, reducing the amount of time you remain flashed by up to 20%, which is a huge win. Being ‘spam-flashed’ has become a common occurrence on smaller maps like Nuketown, especially with users running Tactical Expert.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the team has tweaked the effective damage range of SMGs to make them tougher at longer distances. Conversely, they’ve reduced the range of ARs and made their headshots less effective at close range, which… Doesn’t make much sense.</p>



<p>They’ve also adjusted spawn logic on several maps and added Nuketown to private matches, which means you can now hunt for easter eggs in earnest. Shotgun slugs have been nerfed, and Recon has been dramatically tuned down to be much less effective, which eradicates many of the ‘wallhack’ comments.</p>



<p>For those concerned about the XP earn rates during this Double XP weekend, Treyarch has adjusted Player XP and Weapon XP earn rates between various modes. </p>



<p>Basically, nothing was done to change Zombies because it’s already kind of perfect.</p>
