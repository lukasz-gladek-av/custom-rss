<p>Hytale’s pre-purchases have helped Hypixel Studios secure development costs for the next 2 years. </p>



<p>Hypixel Studios’ highly anticipated title, Hytale, is all set to release in early access tomorrow, January 13, 2026, and it seems that it could be a massive launch as the founder of the studios is expecting over one million players. The founder may not be wrong, as the pre-purchases alone have helped them secure capital to keep supporting the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-hypixel-founder-reaffirms-his-commitment-to-support-hytale-for-10-years">Hypixel Founder Reaffirms His Commitment to Support Hytale for 10 Years</h2>



<p>Through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Hypixel’s founder revealed that they have “officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases.” That, along with his personal commitment to support the game for the next 10 years, will make the fans happy that the game’s future is in good hands. In the same thread, the founder also revealed that the development team now consists of over 50 developers. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Hytale has had a turbulent history to reach where it is now. Riot Games had closed down the game for good; however, Hypixel Studios decided to reacquire the rights of the title and breathe new life into it. The popularity of the title is now higher than ever, and the early access launch will decide what lies in the future for this sandbox game blended with RPG action and adventure. </p>







<p>In other news, Hytale is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-skipping-steam-initially-to-avoid-negative-reviews-console-launch-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skipping the Steam launch initially</a> to avoid negative reviews during early access, and a console launch is also planned. Additionally, developers have been given the green light to include a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-receives-blessing-to-include-technoblade-tribute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Technoblade tribute</a>.

<p>A new official Palworld card game has been announced, scheduled to release on July 30, 2026. </p>



<p>The game that was dubbed Pokémon with Guns, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued by Pokémon and Nintendo</a>, still seems to be following the same path, with a new Palworld TCG announced. It is being developed by Bushiroad, known for card games such as Cardfight!! Vanguard, Weiß Schwarz, and many more. </p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-tcg-arrives-july-2026">Palworld TCG Arrives July 2026</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://en.palworld-official-cardgame.com/news/post-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> reveals that Bushiroad has announced a brand-new trading card game (TCG) based on Pocketpair’s highly popular title, Palworld. The card game will be released on July 20, 2026, allowing players to take part in 2-player competitive battles, using different strategies and tactics to deploy their favourite Pals. Players will be able to gather resources and build bases as they leverage their Pals’ unique traits to secure victory. </p>



<p>Palworld has faced Pokémon rip-off allegations since its announcement, with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company suing the developers for patent infringement. Announcing a new TCG based around Palworld, knowing full well that Pokémon is a dominating name in that space, is not going to help it beat those allegations. However, TCG is not a realm meant solely for creature-based games; in recent years, we have also seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-tcg-announced-by-cdpr-and-wierdco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games like Cyberpunk 2077</a> enter this realm.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s patent in the Palworld dispute was being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-patent-in-palworld-dispute-is-being-reexamined-by-uspto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reexamined</a> by the USPTO. Additionally, the developers have addressed the possibility of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-dev-addresses-story-based-future-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing a story-based game</a> in the future. What are your thoughts on Palworld TCG? Do you think the Pokémon rip-off allegations will grow even more?

            <title><![CDATA[Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check on Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>

<p>Xbox Game Pass continues to add new games to expand your gaming library, but keeping track of which games are on the service can be tricky, but Insider Gaming is here to help with the details on Quarantine Zone: The Last Check’s Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Launching January 12, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check puts players in control of a crucial checkpoint separating the zombie horde from survivors, tasking you with deciding who gains entry and who is denied, and the choices you make can have serious consequences.</p>



<p>Here’s all the important information on whether Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is on Xbox Game Pass.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-on-pc-game-pass">Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check on PC Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Key step. Image via Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Quarantine: The Last Check is available on PC Game Pass through subscription from day one of the launch on January 12, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Quarantine: The Last Check was a late addition to the Game Pass service for January, having not been listed in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-wave-xbox-game-pass-games-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11 games revealed</a> to be coming to the service this month, despite the release window aligning with the announcements.</p>



<p>Instead, the official Xbox social media account teased the <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/2009788572078137696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal of a new game</a> launching onto PC Game Pass imminently, then later revealed that the game in question is Quarantine: The Last Check, meaning PC players have a new game to enjoy as part of their subscription.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-on-xbox-game-pass-for-consoles">Is Quarantine Zone: The Last Check on Xbox Game Pass For Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Quarantine: The Last Check will not be available to Xbox Game Pass subscribers on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S. Instead, only those with PC Game Pass will be able to play.</strong></p>



<p>Quarantine: The Last Check launches as a PC exclusive and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-playstation-xbox-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not available on other </a>platforms, such as PlayStation and the Xbox family of consoles. Therefore, you need a PC to play the game.</p>



<p>The good news is that Microsoft’s many tiers of Game Pass subscriptions include a host of PC games, though you will, of course, require a platform to play them on, and, at the time of writing, it has not been confirmed which level of Game Pass is required to access Quarantine: The Last Check on PC.</p>



<p>It’s likely an Ultimate subscription will be required, however, as this is the tier that features day one releases across both platforms, whereas the Premium subscription brings new Xbox-published games to the service within 12 months of launch.</p>
