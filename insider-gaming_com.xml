            <title><![CDATA[Will Forza Horizon 6 be on PlayStation 5?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-playstation-5/</link>
            <guid>1410646</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Forza Horizon 6 is racing onto the scene this year, but following the release of its predecessor on PlayStation 5, questions regarding platforms are already starting to appear.</p>



<p>If you’re a PlayStation 5 gamer and you’re looking for details on whether Forza Horizon 6 will be available on PS5, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-playstation-5">Will Forza Horizon 6 be on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Forza Horizon 6 will be playable on PlayStation 5, Playground Games have confirmed, though it won’t be launched immediately on the console.</strong></p>



<p>After the success of releasing Forza Horizon 5 on PS5, the decision to release the sequel on the PlayStation platform has been confirmed in advance of launch, and the wait will be shorter than the many years it took for Forza Horizon 5 to make the move onto the platform.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will, however, initially launch exclusively on Microsoft platforms on Xbox Series X|S and PC, before making a move to PlayStation at a later date.</p>



<p>Just like its predecessor, this will include all content and crossplay, allowing players across all platforms to play together when exploring, racing, or causing chaos.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-playstation-5">When Will Forza Horizon 6 be on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<p><strong>No precise launch window has been announced for Forza Horizon 6 on PlayStation 5, with confirmation stating only that the arrival will be “post-launch”.</strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-6-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forza Horizon 6 reveal</a>, it was stated that, due to “the excitement for this franchise on other platforms,” Playground Games and Turn 10 Studios are “working together to bring Forza Horizon 6 to PlayStation 5 post-launch.”</p>



<p>While the history of Forza Horizon doesn’t provide too much of an insight, given Xbox’s approach to cross-platform launches is relatively new, other titles may provide a hint of how long PlayStation gamers will have to wait.</p>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was released in December 2024 on Xbox Series X|S and PC, with a PlayStation 5 version launching four months later in April 2025. Using that timeframe, expect there to be at least a few months before a PS5 launch of Forza Horizon 6.</p>

<p>Forza Horizon 6 is one of the biggest games releasing from Microsoft-owned developers this year, and the series will be heading to a new location.</p>



<p>After an extended stint in Mexico with the last edition of the game, Insider Gaming has all the details on where Forza Horizon 6 will take place.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-will-forza-horizon-6-take-place">Where Will Forza Horizon 6 Take Place?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A new setting. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 will bring the franchise to Japan, a setting that has been heavily requested by players since the first game in the series.</strong></p>



<p>The setting of Forza Horizon 6 was <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-6-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced by Playground Games</a> at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2025, where it was stated that players “will get to discover a scenic and breathtaking Japan,” while the reveal trailer showed several locations, including Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, and roads lined with cherry blossom trees.</p>



<p>In the reveal FAQ, PlayGround Games added that “Japan has been one of the most iconic and requested locations by the community,” and that bringing the Horizon Festival to the region “has been one of our largest ambitions yet.” </p>



<p>Advancements in technology and design will provide players with a world that they “hope you will fall in love with,” and they can’t wait for players to “discover the beautiful landscapes and rich heritage of Japan” when Forza Horizon 6 releases.</p>



<p>Japan follows on from Colorado, France, Italy, Australia, the UK, and Mexico as the locations in the Forza Horizon series.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-of-japan-will-forza-horizon-6-feature">How Much of Japan Will Forza Horizon 6 Feature?</h2>



<p><strong>The full map size for Forza Horizon 6 in Japan has not been showcased, though it has been announced the setting will be a “region” of Japan, and not a single city or location.</strong></p>



<p>Forza Horizon games usually take an area of a location and reduce its size to be smaller, allowing for a variety of biomes to be featured, which results in the likes of Forza Horizon 5 having barren desert landscapes and lush jungles. On top of this, the seasonal changes significantly tweak the look of the environment.</p>



<p>Tokyo is sure to feature, along with Mt. Fuji, and more details of the map, and how the size compares to previous games in the franchise, will be revealed closer to launch.</p>

<p>A new concept leak offers players a glimpse of the Fable reboot’s locations, items, story elements, and more ahead of its official reveal at the Xbox Developer Direct. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Playground Games had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> the release of the Fable reboot to 2026 last year to give the title more time. We were finally going to receive an extended look at the title at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-games-confirmed-for-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct</a> this week. However, a leak has now revealed some major details ahead of the event. </p>







<h2 id="h-fable-leak-suggests-return-to-bloodstone-a-fable-2-location">Fable Leak Suggests Return to Bloodstone, a Fable 2 Location</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1ST</a> reveals concept art for the Fable reboot, shared in an artist’s portfolio who previously contributed to the game. One of the most important finds in these images is the return of Bloodstone, a port town from Fable 2, known for housing criminals. The castle’s entry was situated between a range of mountains, which is how you might access Bloodstone in the Fable reboot. </p>



<p>Different areas surrounding this location were highlighted, including the Market District, Pub Island, and Arena. Some routes lead to characters like Artisan and Jacobs. The location features signs indicating it operates as a functioning town, such as one showing a man selling his fresh catch of fish and another reading “The Phoenix Feather.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Fable concept art leak revealed another location: a swamp village named Hamlet in the files. Two versions of this location were showcased in the artwork; one depicting its original appearance and the other illustrating the effects of a flood on the village, which could serve as a story element.</p>



<p>Moreover, there are images of the main character travelling through sewers and facing off against a werewolf. The werewolf’s den is filled with hanging corpses along with skulls and bones spread across the area. Lastly, there’s also an image of different versions of chests that players can acquire in the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Readers should note that there is no information regarding when this concept art was created, so details may change by the time the final version of the game is released. We might receive confirmation about some of these details during the Xbox Developer Direct next week.</p>







<p>In other news, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alleged-screenshot-reveals-forza-horizon-6-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged screenshot</a> has revealed the release date for Forza Horizon 6.
