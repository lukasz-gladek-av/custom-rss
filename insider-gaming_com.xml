<p>Dying Light 2 is available on PS Plus this month as a free game, but Techland has gone one step beyond that provision and added a series of PS5 Pro-focused enhancements to the game. One of the best open-world zombie games ever made has just gotten better with these recent changes – read on to find out what they are.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-end-of-the-world-looks-gorgeous">The End of the World Looks Gorgeous</h2>



<p>With a PlayStation 5 Pro, users can soak up several key advantages, from boosted resolutions to enhanced frame rates. There’s a sizeable processing boost under the hood of the PS5 Pro, and many developers have leant on that to strengthen their games. </p>



<p>It was recently revealed that 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human will be added to PS Plus this month as a free game. It was then announced by Techland, the game’s developer, that PS5 Pro enhancements are also inbound.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced graphics settings (Balanced, Resolution, Performance, Quality)</li>



<li>Increased base resolution</li>



<li>Improved shadows, screen-space reflections, and sub-surface scattering</li>



<li>Better weather (including fog)</li>
</ul>



<p>Dying Light 2 already looked phenomenal, boasting one of the best apocalyptic environments in recent years, but this latest round of changes takes things to an entirely new level. If you’re a PlayStation 5 Pro owner and you want to pick up a copy of Dying Light 2 when it goes live on PS Plus, I’d recommend doing so.</p>



<p>In recent news, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-one-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> had surpassed one million wishlists. Are you looking forward to the next instalment in the popular post-apocalyptic series? Let us know in the comments.</p>
