<p>2026 is set to be a mammoth year in gaming, and while PC players won’t be able to jump into the likes of Grand Theft Auto 6 and Marvel’s Wolverine, there are still a whole host of exciting releases on the cards.</p>



<p>PC continues to grow as the platform gets the best of all worlds, with huge platform exclusives alongside major releases from Xbox and PlayStation consoles making their way to the platform, and that trend continues in 2026.</p>



<p>With so many major releases coming in 2026, and more set to be announced as the year progresses, Insider Gaming has selected the biggest games in 2026 that PC players can’t miss.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-pc-games-coming-in-2026">Biggest PC Games Coming in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Haunting. Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Five years after the release of Resident Evil Village, and three years since the Resident Evil 4 remake was released, the next major release in the franchise, Resident Evil Requiem, is on the horizon with a February 27 release date, and is set to be one of the biggest titles released across the whole year.</p>



<p>The return of Leon S. Kennedy to the franchise, alongside the option to play in both first-person and third-person modes, is a major draw for the game, and expectations are high following the staggering success Village achieved many moons ago.</p>



<h3 id="h-007-first-light">007 First Light</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Icon. Image via IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s been decades since a truly great James Bond game was released, a staggering fact considering the strength of the franchise, but 007 First Light has the chance to end that barren stretch, with excitement continuing to rise for the title, due to release on March 26.</p>



<p>The game is in good hands with IO Interactive, who make for a perfect hit given their experience with the Hitman franchise, and there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic for the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-hytale">Hytale</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Finally. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s been a rollercoaster ride for Hytale fans in 2025, with the game being scrapped by Riot Games before coming back under the ownership of its original creators, and a release into early access is slated for January 13, where it will become one of the first big releases of the year.</p>



<p>Initially, Hytale will be PC only, and players have been warned ahead of time that it’s very much an early access title, with a long road ahead for a full launch, but Hytale could be one of the most important releases in all of gaming since Minecraft’s debut in 2009.</p>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Tokyo drift. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Forza Horizon 5 celebrates a fifth birthday in 2026 and is still widely-regarded as the definitive racing game on the market, and the launch of the sixth game in the series could be the biggest yet, with Japan, long requested by the community to feature as a location, finally taking center stage.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will launch immediately onto PC at the same time as it lands on Xbox Series X|S, and there’s no reason to skip this title, as it could replace the fifth game as the best in the genre for the next few years.</p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Revival. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s set to be a massive year for Playground Games, with Forza Horizon 6 coming alongside the long-awaited revival of the Fable franchise, which was initially set to take place in 2025 before being delayed. While a precise date in 2026 is not known, it is expected to land next year.</p>



<p>Microsoft has a lot riding on the success of Fable, having seen a lot of its latest exclusives fall flat compared to their rivals, but there’s every hope that the game can set the world alight due to the established love of the franchise and the long wait for it’s return, while the fact it will be available on PC provides another boost.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Prequel. Image via The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Gears of War franchise is one of those that has fallen in the eyes of players with recent releases, and, in a bid to get things back on track, the franchise is going back to where it all began in Gears of War: E-Day, a title set 15 years before the events of the first game.</p>



<p>E-Day’s immediate arrival on PC is another situation where players on the platform will benefit from a simultaneous release alongside Xbox, though PlayStation 5 players could also join the gang this time around after the franchise debuted on the Sony console in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-slay-the-spire-2">Slay The Spire 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sequel. Image via Mega Crit</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Slay The Spire is widely regarded to be one of the best indie games ever made, and there are high hopes for the sequel that is due to release in March 2026.</p>



<p>Slay The Spire 2’s initial launch comes in early access on PC, allowing players to play an integral part in development and building the game to be a worthy successor to the original title.</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-zero-company">Star Wars Zero Company</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Strategic. Image via Bit Reactor</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a big year in 2026 for the Star Wars franchise, with several major releases on the cards, and Star Wars Zero Company may well be one of the most exciting due to a definitive lack of competition in the genre it is entering and the experience of the devs working on the title.</p>



<p>Developed by Bit Reactor, a studio formed by those who worked on XCOM and major Firaxis Games titles, Zero Company can lean on that experience and the strength of the Star Wars franchise to achieve big success in 2026, luring in both new players and experienced gamers of Strategy titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Fantasy. Image via Pearl Abyss</figcaption></figure>



<p>Originally built as a prequel to Black Desert Online, Crimson Desert was adjusted to be its own standalone single-player title during development and is set for release on March 19, where it lands as one of the most highly anticipated titles releasing in 2026.</p>



<p>The open-world title looks stunning from what has been shown off so far, featuring a fantastical land to explore, a variety of weapons to wield, and lots of secrets to uncover, so it stands as a game where players can easily sink hours upon hours of playtime into.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima Shares Emotional ‘Stranger Things’ Finale Message: ‘This Isn’t a Story About Saying Goodbye’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-stranger-things-finale-social/</link>
            <guid>1396417</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima is a movie and television buff, which is something you’ll learn if you spend even a few minutes on his social media profiles. His games have always been deeply cinematic, and he takes a lot of inspiration from top-tier movies, indie productions, and everything in between.</p>



<p>Most recently, the legendary developer and visionary shared his emotional thoughts about the Stranger Things finale, which aired just a few days ago and shattered the hearts of millions worldwide, including Kojima.</p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-connected-with-stranger-things">Hideo Kojima Connected with Stranger Things</h2>



<p>This week, Stranger Things ended with a tumultuous final episode that ran for more than two hours. It was the culmination of ten years of storytelling, presenting viewers with some closure on a series that they’ve fallen in love with over the course of a lengthy, cacophonous decade.</p>



<p>It proved to be a divisive ending, splitting the community down the middle over the satisfaction of the thing and some of the storylines that have been left up to the viewer’s interpretation and beliefs. All in all, it was the end of a phenomenal journey that certainly had enough finality and emotion to hurl a heaping wave of catharsis over everyone involved.</p>



<p>That includes the gaming icon and veteran developer, Hideo Kojima.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2007305007948054597" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kojima wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>STRANGER THINGS has reached its finale. </p>



<p>For me, it was actually a very special drama series. It began in 2016, during my difficult time right after I went independent, a period filled with anxiety and loneliness. It was also when I first started watching streaming services as a new kind of medium. Over the past ten years, I’ve spent time with Eleven, the others, and the people of Hawkins (including the monsters from the Upside Down), receiving courage from them and being pushed forward again and again. </p>



<p>As I watched them grow through the story, I was also growing in the “real world,” the story’s own kind of Upside Down—struggling, tracing connections, and finding my way forward in much the same way. It’s sad to think that I won’t be seeing them anymore. But there’s always a way to return to this “town.” </p>



<p><strong>This isn’t a story about saying goodbye. </strong>As symbolized by D&amp;D (the table-talk RPG) at both the beginning and the end, the “story” already lives within us. By recalling that world and those characters, and “table-talking” it in our minds, we can create new stories at any time. </p>



<p>Among the many stories born inside us, they will continue to live on forever. There, they’ll meet again and keep adventuring. As long as we don’t forget, it’s always “here.” Thank you, STRANGER THINGS.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a heartfelt take from the creator who finds himself wearing his heart on his sleeve much more as he ages. Kojima is an entertainment aficionado and often shares takes on social media related to television shows, movies, music, and art, but this is one of the longest messages he’s posted in response to a recent release or production.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[8 Major Co-Op Games Coming in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/8-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1396387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When you want to enjoy the casualness of a single-player game and inject a bit of the chaos, togetherness, and realness of an online multiplayer title, co-op is your best friend. 2026 is already shaping up to be another amazing year for co-op gaming, and this list has picked out the ones you need to wishlist and eventually install.</p>



<p>Nothing beats a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-for-family-this-holiday-season-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op game</a> done right. Enjoying the thrills and spills of an action game alongside someone else, or piercing your partner’s eardrum with a banshee-like screech, tackling a horror game in fear. It’s the best of both worlds, and the gaming space isn’t short of fun local and online cooperative journeys to undertake.</p>



<p>2026 is looking more stacked than a heavyweight prizefighter, and it’s no slouch where co-op games are concerned. Here are eight bona fide co-op contenders to keep an eye on.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-co-op-games-releasing-in-2026">Biggest Co-op Games Releasing in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-reanimal">Reanimal</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image from THQ Nordic</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tarsier Studios is doing what it does best in 2026 with its new IP—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reanimal-has-officially-gone-gold-two-months-before-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reanimal</a>—focusing on co-op multiplayer in isolated and claustrophobic environments, leaving playable protagonists more vulnerable than a defrosted chicken fillet in the reaches of a cat. Expect to see many of the flourishes and fear-inducing traits that made Little Nightmares a hit, but with the introduction of less-linear sections.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 13</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Traveller’s Tales</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lovers of Arkham games or Batman in general need to have May 29, 2026, circled on the calendar. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> was an unbelievable experience at Gamescom 2025, and this could easily be in certain GOTY conversations come the end of the year. It deviates from traditional LEGO games and literally goes <strong>full Arkham City and Arkham Knight with an open-world Gotham</strong>, featuring Rocksteady’s trademark free-flowing combat system. Do you know the only thing better than all of this? It has two-player local co-op for crime-fighting dynamic duos.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: May 29</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even now, people are shocked that <strong>The Duskbloods is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</strong>. The power of the Switch 2 has opened significant doors for Nintendo, and FromSoftware has capitalized on this with The Duskbloods. Its gothic, dystopian world embroils the player in a dangerous PvPvE setup. If you feel lonely or have a tingle of trepidation heading into the demanding ARPG, you should be able to charge foolishly into combat with a teammate.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image from Xbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>343 Industries has confirmed that Halo: Campaign Evolved will go off the beaten path here and there in this fully-fledged remake of the 2001 classic. It brings to life a single-player adventure in a bygone era where campaigns were considered the lifeblood of the experience more, rather than the sad afterthought they’ve become in many shooters. The message has also been made very clear that there will be no online multiplayer, but co-op is definitely in!</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon really is coming for everyone and everything, isn’t it? Card games, RPGs, casual photo-taking games, and The Pokémon Company have licensed most types of gaming experiences. One that hasn’t been done and makes complete sense is an Animal Crossing-style Pokémon game. What was that, you’re looking forward to it? Ditto. Oh, we’re not agreeing, it’s just that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaks-confirm-pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalyptic-fan-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a> lets you be a Ditto adopting the form of a human, and it’s better not to ask questions. The main question is whether Pokémon Pokopia has co-op play, and the answer is an emphatic yes, with <strong>four-player co-op possible</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 5</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nioh might be the best Soulslike franchise not made by FromSoftware</strong>. There, it’s been said. Nioh and Nioh 2 honestly don’t get the love that they deserve. They’re ultra-clean and snappy, and the sequel evolves and keeps itself on an even keel with the outstanding first outing. Rise of the Ronin was a fun if uninspired effort to do something different, and Wo Long is also familiar, but Team Ninja’s Nioh world is unmatched. Team up with a co-op partner for Nioh 3’s upcoming barrage of mythological bosses, looking to end you, let you live, then end you again.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 6</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve only been privvy to one reveal trailer at present, but it goes without saying that Forza Horizon 6 is going to be mega—sorry, メガ! The sixth entry takes us to Japan, and while we’ve explored a lot of historical Japan in recent years with Sucker Punch’s ‘Ghost’ games, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and more, a modern-day racing game drifting around the sacred lands of Hokkaido&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tokyo should be sensational. If it has online co-op like FH5, it should hit top speed no problem.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-crashout-crew">Crashout Crew</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Aggro Crab</figcaption></figure>



<p>No doubt, 2026 will have the usual array of Steam indie games that take everything by storm. REPO was a great example of this with its manic multiplayer gameplay, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peak</a> was just as good and as fun. Developer Aggro Crab has already signalled its intention to support Peak, and the team is also working on Crashout Crew. As Steam says, you must: “Work together in online co-op with up to 4 players to fulfill orders of increasingly chaotic, physics-based boxes. Time is money, and safety is no concern… just try not to crash out!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite continues to get bigger and better with regular drops of new content, including major collabs, but there are still some major features missing from the Epic Games title which need to be introduced in 2026.</p>



<p>From updates that would improve a host of different modes, to additions that are major quality-of-life changes, Insider Gaming presents seven big features that Fortnite needs to introduce in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-features-needed-in-2026">Fortnite Features Needed in 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Survival. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-quest-mode">Quest Mode</h3>



<p>Every player has surely been in a situation where they land at a POI to complete a marked story quest, with the intention of solely interacting with an NPC, only to be attacked by a rival player and eliminated before they can tick off the task.</p>



<p>While that’s part and parcel of a Battle Royale mode, sometimes you just want to advance the story and see what’s cooking in the background narrative, but there’s currently no option to do that. Even when you land safely, it’s often a case of button-bashing to quickly advance dialogue before you are attacked.</p>



<p>Adding a quest mode with the removed risk of being attacked by rival players would be a major addition, even if it didn’t award XP for completing them, or even providing a recap in the main menu for players to experience what’s going on.</p>



<h3 id="h-customizable-hud">Customizable HUD</h3>



<p>It’s remarkable that Fortnite is so far into its lifespan without customizable options for the HUD, and that simply must change in 2026 to give players more ability to control their experience.</p>



<p>While this could be limited in ranked modes and tournaments to ensure a fair playing field, there’s no reason why players shouldn’t have the ability to adjust how things look on their HUD, and adding customization features would be a big move.</p>



<h3 id="h-destructible-terrain">Destructible Terrain</h3>



<p>Fortnite’s destruction mechanics are among the best in the business, with considerable improvements already being made in the recent The Simpsons mini-season with smashable windows without having to break down an entire wall, which remained for Chapter 7, but there’s still scope for more.</p>



<p>Currently, destroyed items are removed entirely, and no matter what you do to the landscape, it remains the same. Tweaks would make for a more interesting approach, with explosions, for example, leading to pits being made in the ground, and fallen trees remaining to hide behind.</p>



<h3 id="h-rideable-animals">Rideable Animals</h3>



<p>Fortnite has seen a wealth of travel mechanics added in the past, from vehicles to boats, planes to gliders, but more life should come to the Fortnite island, and rideable animals is a much-needed addition.</p>



<p>There’s easily scope for this to arrive in Chapter 7, which is themed on Hollywood and the west coast of the USA, with the introduction of horses a potential addition for a Wild West POI or environment fitting perfectly into the theme of the chapter.</p>



<p>We’ve seen limited-time rideable creatures and similar introduced to Fortnite in the past, but it’s time for permanent additions to be added.</p>



<h3 id="h-ai-ally-controls">AI-Ally Controls</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Direct. Image via ShiinaBR</figcaption></figure>



<p>Recruiting an AI-NPC has long been a feature of Fortnite’s Battle Royale scene, with collab characters and others available on the map to provide support, but there are limitations with this and, more often than not, they can become a real hindrance and give away your position.</p>



<p>Adding AI controls to provide directions would be a huge boost, allowing players to direct the AI to open fire, move to a different position, or hide away. If this was added in 2026, it would improve the recruitable NPCs dramatically.</p>



<h3 id="h-bot-lobbies">Bot Lobbies</h3>



<p>Long rumored to be on the cards for Fortnite, but still yet to be seen, are bot lobbies, where players can enter a game filled entirely with AI opponents, if they’d rather not face off against other players online.</p>



<p>A bot lobby would be the perfect place for younger players to enjoy Battle Royale modes for the first time, and would provide all players with the opportunity to try out different weapons and approaches without the risk of seeing their plans thwarted by rival players.</p>



<p>Capping XP in the lobby would prevent it from being exploited for those just seeking to complete the Battle Pass swiftly, and there’s the scope for this mode already considering that bots are already widely present across multiple modes.</p>







<p>Fortnite is an extremely social game, and having a hub for players to hang out in would be a great addition for 2026, and we’ve already seen it used for multiple in-game events, so it’s way overdue for a permanent addition.</p>



<p>A social hub could provide direct access to a host of game modes, with the ability to squad-up with other players you encounter, and mini games could also be available to pass the time.</p>



<p>Having the social hub available in the lobby for players would also be a huge addition, particularly when you’re waiting for an AFK friend to return.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Todd Howard Showed No Interest in Fallout 4’s Most Impressive Mod]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July 2024, Fallout: London was released after years of development. The game-sized mod represented one of the most ambitious and long-awaited conversion projects in the history of the Fallout franchise, and it was very well received by fans worldwide. Owing to the size and stature of Fallout: London, it garnered quite a cult following over the years.</p>



<p>However, one of the people who perhaps <strong>should </strong>have been interested in it but <strong>wasn’t </strong>was Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard. In a recent interview, Howard revealed that he hasn’t played and never really followed Fallout: London, arguably the biggest Fallout 4 mod ever created and a transformative, mighty project.</p>







<h2 id="h-todd-howard-plays-it-safe-with-fallout-london">Todd Howard Plays it Safe with Fallout: London</h2>



<p>The driving theory behind Todd Howard’s apparent disinterest in Fallout: London is that he was hampered from praising the project by legal conditions. It’s no big secret that mods walk a grey area when it comes to legitimacy and IP infringement, but they’re part and parcel of the Bethesda landscape regardless.</p>



<p>If Todd Howard started gushing over Fallout: London, he’d have netizens taking to social media the world over to declare the mod canon, or something.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4london/comments/1q03rsp/todd_howard_on_fallout_london/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a> hosted to celebrate the launch of Fallout’s second season, Todd Howard was asked about his interest in the Fallout: London mod, but the recognizable developer played coy:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Only some videos that I’ve seen online; I have not played it.</p>



<p>Only a little bit. I would say we look at a lot of the modding that’s going on, and when you have those total conversions – I just want to say how <em>hard </em>that is.</p>



<p>And so, the fact that it came out, first of all, because most of those never come out, and the fact that it came out… It seems a lot of fans love it.</p>



<p>It’s just – I need to express to everybody out there how difficult and what a journey that is for some of these big mod teams to do stuff like that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It also doesn’t help that he’s probably so busy he’s lucky ever to scrape a few hours playing <strong>any </strong>Fallout game, modded or otherwise.</p>



<p>Fallout: London represents what’s possible when a team of dozens pours resources, time, money, and effort into creating a passion project and turning it into something tangible and wholly accepted by a community. It’s one of the single-biggest mods in the gaming space, and it takes Fallout 4 and manipulates it into something otherworldly.</p>



<p>Team FOLON, the folks behind the mod, did such a good job that one or two of them were ultimately <strong>hired </strong>by Bethesda Game Studios.</p>



<p>When it launched, it was hosted on GOG and was downloaded a whopping 500,000 times in 24 hours, and in 2025, a <strong>VR version </strong>of the mod surfaced. If that wasn’t enough, more than a year after release, an expansion called Rabbit and Pork dropped, fuelling more interest in the mod.</p>
