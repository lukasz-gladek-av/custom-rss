<p>In an exclusive report published by Arizton, it was predicted that the global esports market will be worth more than $5 billion within the next five years. This growth is represented by a huge CAGR of 17.48%, making esports one of the fastest-growing and most lucrative industries in the world.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, the American Football industry boasts a CAGR of around 6.9%, and the global music market has an estimated CAGR of 7.8%, running to 2029.</p>

<h2 id="h-time-to-invest">Time to Invest</h2>



<p>The world of esports is a tumultuous one, and from day to day, things remain fairly volatile. However, it’s one of the fastest-developing markets in the world, and historically, some huge investments have been made into the wider industry.</p>



<p>In the recent report published by Arizton, it was revealed that the esports market, which was worth $1.96 billion in 2023, could be worth as much as $5.17 billion by 2029. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/global-esports-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">This report</a> spoke about the success of various tournaments, like the League of Legends World Championship, and the ‘adoption of digitisation’, which is a global cultural shift that’s seeing the people of our world become one that’s always connected to an online device in some way.</p>



<p>Arizton revealed that MOBA is king in the esports space and that North America is the place to be for esports businesses. It was documented that 44% of the global esports market share is confined to NA, with APAC coming in a close second.</p>

<p>Dr Disrespect, one of the most controversial content creators of all time, has revealed a move to Rumble, breaking away from YouTube in a bid to seek better monetisation. The disgraced streamer found himself at the centre of a dire ‘minor messaging’ scandal mere months ago, and it cost him his friends, sponsorships, and income on YouTube.</p>



<p>Now, the team at Rumble, a developing streaming platform, has revealed that Dr Disrespect will be coming on board. However, he’s not coming as a mere streamer – he’s going to help run the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-interesting-choice">Interesting Choice</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://corp.rumble.com/blog/dr-disrespect-will-lead-rumble-gaming-join-rumble-premium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a>, the Rumble team revealed that Dr Disrespect will broadcast his gameplay on the platform and provide exclusive content via the Rumble Premium ecosystem to his ‘Champions Club’.</p>



<p>It gets deeper, though.</p>



<p>The 42-year-old streamer, who admitted earlier this year to using Twitch to message a minor in 2017, will serve as an advisor and ‘help build the Rumble Gaming community’. His new role lands him in the position of ‘Head of Rumble Gaming’, with the team at the growing platform seeking to lean on Dr Disrespect’s veteran status in the industry to appeal more to gamers.</p>



<p>Historically, Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm has worked at Sledgehammer Games as a community manager and map designer, and he served a pivotal role at Midnight Society before he was cut from the company following the allegations earlier this year.</p>



<p>It was confirmed that Dr Disrespect’s first stream on Rumble will take place on December 2, and the platform has gone so far as to provide a special promotion that users can lean on to secure discounted subscriptions during his first appearance on the site.</p>

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 6 leaks have started pouring out, and it seems we might be getting Godzilla and Baymax in the next battle pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SamLeakss</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ResetzFtw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetzFTW</a> via reliable Fortnite insider <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, the Godzilla and Baymax collaboration has been “100%” confirmed for the upcoming battle pass. Shiina also shared an <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1861108459699118349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">image</a> along with the leak, which clearly features Godzilla, Baymax, and several other Japanese-themed characters, cosmetic items, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has various options to play around with when introducing characters like Godzilla and Baymax.
