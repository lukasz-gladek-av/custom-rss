<p>The Ninja Gaiden 4 release is quickly approaching, allowing players to download the game ahead of launch, and the preload and file size are available now.</p>



<p>If you have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-ninja-gaiden-4-pre-order-bonuses-amp-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-ordered the game</a>, you are just about ready to go, but to make sure you can play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the moment that it’s available</a>, you should get the download out of the way now.</p>



<p>Here is a preload guide for Ninja Gaiden 4 and the pre-launch file size on each platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-you-preload-ninja-gaiden-4">When Can You Preload Ninja Gaiden 4?</h2>

<p><strong>Preloads for Ninja Gaiden 4 are currently available on PC via the Windows Store and Xbox Series X|S. As of this writing, PlayStation 5 and Steam players will have to wait just a little longer before they can start downloading the game.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, we do not have a confirmed date or time that Steam and PlayStation will allow players to start the <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng4/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> preload. The release date is set for October 21, so you should expect it to be available any day now.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-file-size-explained">Ninja Gaiden 4 File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>As of pre-launch, the Ninja Gaiden 4 file size sits at 54.9 GB on PC through the Windows Store, 36.82 GB on Xbox Series X, and 23.55 GB on PlayStation 5. Steam players can probably expect a similar file size to the Windows Store version.</strong></p>



<p>As is pretty usual, the file size on PC is larger because the game has to account for a larger variety of hardware that will be running the game, a lot of which is stronger than you see in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. With that said, the PlayStation 5 version being less than half of the PC version is definitely a testament to the compression work in that version.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that these file sizes are for the game ahead of launch. If there is a day-one patch or update, who knows how much the file sizes could jump up.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-ninja-gaiden-4">How to Preload Ninja Gaiden 4</h2>



<p><strong>To preload Ninja Gaiden 4, you will have to pre-order the game digitally through any of the supported platforms. Anyone looking to get the game physically will have to wait until release, when they have the disc in hand.</strong></p>



<p>If you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-ninja-gaiden-4-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order the game now</a>, there should be an option at checkout to start downloading the game immediately. If you have preordered previously, look in your owned games library for the option to start downloading. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a> can go to the Game Pass app and search for the game to find the pre-install option.</p>

<p>A sequel to A Minecraft Movie is officially in the works, complete with a June 2027 release.</p>



<p>The worldwide sensation Minecraft has kept players occupied with its world-building fun since 2011. Millions of fans have purchased the game, and it has become a household name since. This year, Warner Bros. released a movie adaptation of the game, called A Minecraft Movie. Needless to say, it is currently the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-highest-grossing film of 2025</a>. Now, after months of speculation, it seems we’ll be returning to the mines real soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-sequel-releasing-on-june-27th-2027-director-returning">A Minecraft Movie Sequel Releasing on June 27th, 2027, Director Returning</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AMinecraftMovie/status/1976341544266498142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> post, it was announced that A Minecraft Movie sequel is officially in the works. It’s unknown what the sequel will be named. Furthermore, the original director, Jared Hess, will return to do the second one. With a poster showing two shiny pickaxes, we also have a release date: June 27th, 2027. The date does place it with to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-simpsons-movie-coming-after-almost-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons Movie 2</a>, so it’s sure to be a big day for the box office.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it’s unknown if any of the original cast will return for the sequel. Even more so, we don’t know about the plot, as it’s being kept under wraps for now. Despite that, the movie is sure to be just as popular, especially since it knows what worked. Countless memes like “Chicken Jockey” and “I am Steve” flooded the internet even before its release and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even caused uproars</a> in theaters. Warner Bros. is aware of it and honed in on it for marketing, which likely caused its box-office soar. It’ll be interesting to see how it fares out and if it’ll keep the charm many fans enjoyed.</p>
