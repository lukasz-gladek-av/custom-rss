<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is bringing a brand-new main set, courtesy of Mega Rising. After some brief respite with Deluxe Pack ex, this is a fully fledged set, and it arrives at the end of October 2025.</p>



<p>We enjoyed the much-needed break Deluxe Pack ex gave us. It was a big expansion of recycled and effectively reprinted cards. This is fine, and it means we’ve been able to build up our Pack Hourglasses, and now they are ready to be splashed out frantically on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-debut-mega-evolution-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega</a> Rising.</p>

<p>Let’s face it, thanks to leaks, we already knew a decent amount <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about Pokémon TCG Pocket Mega Rising</a>. Still, it’s always cool actually seeing it announced, and you Pocket users might need to start rethinking your best decks.</p>



<p>The likes of Mega Gyarados ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Altaria ex, are going to cause havoc.</p>



<p>These special cards are loaded with HP, hard-hitting moves, but come with one massive caveat—a defeated Mega Pokémon is worth 3 points, and gives your opponent the immediate win.</p>



<p>Again, this is going to change up the strategy needed quite a bit. <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>‘s Mega Rising drops on October 30, and as it’s set B1, we’re expecting a LOT of cards to collect!</p>
