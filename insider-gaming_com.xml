<p>Marvel Rivals’ November 27 patch introduced the 18v18 Annihilation game mode. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 5 is now live, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-roadmap-reveals-date-for-rogue-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> tells us when all the new characters, maps, events, and more are arriving in the game. However, the developers have released a brand-new patch to celebrate Marvel Rivals’ first anniversary. Along with the new mode, players also receive a new map, events, fixes, and more. </p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-18v18-annihilation-is-a-domination-showdown">Marvel Rivals 18v18 Annihilation is a Domination Showdown</h2>



<p>Unveiled through a new trailer, Marvel Rivals 18v18 Annihilation game mode will take place on a new map called Grand Garden, where players will participate in a Domination Showdown. The trailer reveals how chaotic this mode can get, with swarms of heroes piling up on both sides. At the same time, it also provides opportunities for players to take down waves of other players when timing their ultimates correctly. Check out the new trailer below: </p>

<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that in-game audio issues will receive a “full pass” to solve them. </p>



<p>EA’s Battlefield 6 has been out for close to two months now, and the game has already received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-drops-to-half-price-for-black-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive discount</a> due to a Black Friday mega sale on one platform. However, as sales and marketing for the title progress, the developers are also constantly working to resolve issues, and now they have set their sights on BF6’s in-game audio problems. </p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-in-game-audio-issues-will-receive-a-full-pass-for-fixes">Battlefield 6 In-Game Audio Issues Will Receive a ‘Full Pass’ for Fixes</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/some-battlefield-6-players-still-cant-hear-enemies-creeping-up-on-them-so-devs-are-doing-a-full-pass-to-fix-niggling-sound-issues-for-good-hoping-we-can-share-more-details-on-that-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Florian Le Bihan, principal game designer, recently responded to a comment on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1993685559462527420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) about fixing footstep audio issues in Battlefield 6. Le Bihan stated that “the entire in-game audio is receiving a full pass to solve those issues, including fixing some issues that caused some sounds to completely cut.” The principal designer added that they are still working on the problems and verifying the changes, and they hope to share more details soon. </p>



<p>Florian Le Bihan also spoke about Battlefield 6’s mouse-and-keyboard issues in the same thread. He first confirmed that fine-tuning mouse sensitivity “broke with the last update” and will be fixed in the upcoming patch. For keyboards, he was asked whether Class-related keybinds can be removed, and Le Bihan confirmed that those buttons will be removed from the keyboard after the next patch. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Hellcase a Scam or Legit? Separating Facts from Myth]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hellcase/</link>
            <guid>1366630</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Some people may wonder, “Is Hellcase a scam or legit?” The answer is clear: Hellcase is completely legit, as it not only offers fair and transparent terms of use, for example, its Provably Fair algorithms, but also has an excellent security system that prevents attackers from getting hold of any information about you or your account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The real question isn’t “is Hellcase a legit site,” but “how do I spot the fake sites that impersonate Hellcase?”</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonating-scam-alerts"><strong>Hellcase Impersonating Scam Alerts</strong></h2>



<p>Users sometimes encounter information suggesting that Hellcase might be a scam. In reality, any large brand or website often faces this problem. Because of their popularity, they attract the attention of not only honest players but also scammers. The “Hellcase is a scam” myth you see online is almost always fueled by people who, unfortunately, got tricked by one of these fake sites.</p>



<p>Scammers often create various fraudulent methods to get hold of information. They create various bots, fake websites that may look similar to a Hellcase page, or anything else that can help them steal your personal or account information. These scammers are counting on you to be in a hurry. They want you to click a link from a fake email, a shady Discord message, or a random Steam friend without checking the address bar. Therefore, before entering any personal or account details, always double-check the website and be attentive to the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonators-on-steam"><strong>Hellcase impersonators on Steam</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to fake websites, scammers also frequently use Steam to deceive users. They often create lookalike accounts, using names such as “Hellcase Admin,” “Hellcase Support,” or “Hellcase Bot.” All of this can confuse users, and scammers exploit that trust to deceive them.</p>



<p>Their method is simple: they add players as friends or send a direct message, posing as employees. They might send you a link or directly ask for access to your account, often claiming it’s for security purposes. The message might mention fake winnings, payment issues, fraudulent transactions, or various other topics. However, remember that Hellcase never asks its customers for this type of information, nor does it communicate with them via Steam accounts. This is 100% of the time, always, a scam. So, stay vigilant and be careful.</p>



<p>How do you avoid this? It’s simple:</p>



<ul>
<li>Do not accept the friend request.</li>



<li>Do not click any links they send you.</li>



<li>Never give them any information.</li>



<li>Block the user.</li>



<li>Report the profile to Steam for impersonation.</li>
</ul>



<p>And remember: all official communication takes place EXCLUSIVELY through the support system on the official <a href="https://hellcase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellcase</a> website.</p>



<h2 id="h-real-life-scenarios-of-scam-victims"><strong>Real-Life Scenarios of Scam Victims</strong></h2>



<p>Picture this: you’ve just finished a game, and as you’re closing Steam, you see a friend request from an account named “Hellcase_Moderator” or something similar, complete with the official Hellcase logo. Without suspecting anything, you add the account as a friend. A little while later, you get a message claiming you’ve won a giveaway. To get your skin, you just need to click a link.</p>



<p>After clicking the link, you land on a site that looks just like Hellcase. You enter your details, but nothing happens. When you go back to Steam and message the account to ask why it’s not working, you get no reply. That’s because the scammers created a phishing site to steal your data and, ultimately, your skins.</p>



<p>Let us be 100% clear: OUR STAFF WILL NEVER DM YOU ON STEAM. EVER.</p>



<p>This is one of the real cases that, unfortunately, happen to users simply due to inattention.</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonator-scam-examples"><strong>Hellcase Impersonator Scam Examples</strong></h2>



<p>Scammers register dozens of domains hoping to catch you off guard. Here are just a few examples of fake, scammer-owned domains that are<strong> NOT Hellcase</strong>. If you see any of these, stay away:</p>



<ul>
<li>helfcase(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase(.)com(.)de</li>



<li>Hellcases(.)site</li>



<li>helluese(.)com</li>



<li>hellcasc(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase(.)shop</li>



<li>hellcase-es(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-cz(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-br(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-csgo(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-hu(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-fr(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-de(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase-tr(.)com</li>



<li>heffcase(.)com</li>



<li>hellcsee(.)com</li>



<li>cs2hellcase(.)com</li>



<li>hellcase(.)space</li>



<li>helluese(.)com</li>
</ul>



<p>Look closely. They rely on typos, extra dashes, or different domain endings like .shop or .space instead of .com or .org.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-only-official-hellcase-websites"><strong>The Only Official Hellcase Websites</strong></h2>



<p>This is the most crucial part of this message, so please pay attention.</p>



<p>There are <strong>ONLY TWO</strong> official, legitimate, and safe Hellcase domains. They are:</p>



<ul>
<li>https://hellcase.com</li>



<li>https://hellcase.org</li>
</ul>



<p>You will also sometimes encounter hellcs2.com, which is also one of the official websites, but it is more often used for advertising purposes.</p>



<p>That’s it. No dashes. No extra letters. No “.shop,” “.space,” or “.de.”</p>



<p>Just .com and .org.</p>



<p>Please, before you log in, before you deposit, before you do anything, look at your browser’s address bar. If you’re ever asking yourself, “is Hellcase a legit site?”, the first thing you must do is check that URL. If you are on hellcase.com or hellcase.org, then yes, Hellcase is a legit site. If you are anywhere else, you are on a scam site.</p>
