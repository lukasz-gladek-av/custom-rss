<p>007 First Light developers have just confirmed that they used Daniel Craig’s head on Agent 47 to pitch the game.</p>



<p>007 First Light received its first gameplay yesterday at the exclusive State of Play event, along with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. Since then, players have begun forming impressions about the game, and the developers have also come forward to say it isn’t a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isnt-a-hitman-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reskin</a>” of Hitman. Now, new details have been revealed about how Daniel Craig’s likeness was used when pitching 007 First Light. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-was-pitched-with-daniel-craig-s-head-on-agent-47">007 First Light Was Pitched with Daniel Craig’s Head on Agent 47</h2>



<p>IOI CEO, Hakan Abrak, confirmed during an interview with <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-007/240656/news/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Daniel Craig’s head was placed on Agent 47 and put into World of Assassination when they demoed 007 First Light. Abrak reveals, “We actually did put Daniel Craig in there”, and they modeled his head and placed it instead of Agent 47. This was done for demo purposes only, to provide “an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game.”</p>



<p>Abrak adds that players who are familiar with a level called “Sapienza with the virus in the caves underneath the compound”, should know that some things were shown off there and “it was well received” The CEO explained that they were trying to convey that this is a “360 experience”, which is not just shooting and cutscenes, but also explores the “Bond Fantasy” in social spaces where the character needs to use his “charms and bluff” instead of his fists.</p>



<p>Abrak revealed that this was the first time they had worked on something other than original worlds and characters, and it was essential for them to put their “creative fingerprints” on it. They weren’t interested in “a gamification of a movie or maybe where it’s about technical prowess only, like pushing the pixels on Pierce Brosnan, for example, or just taking some bespoke scenes from a movie and realizing them in gaming.”</p>



<p>Instead, the developers want to create a “game for gamers” which brings players “a genuine Bond experience” where Bond is yet to become the world’s most famous spy and is still learning the ropes of the trade. </p>



<p>In other news, 007 First Light’s collector’s edition will&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-collectors-edition-will-set-you-back-300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set players back $300</a>. Additionally, nsider Gaming received an exclusive&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Preview</a>&nbsp;for 007 First Light and “couldn’t stop seeing Hitman with a James Bond skin.” What are your thoughts on IOI using Daniel Craig’s likeness to pitch 007 First Light?

            <title><![CDATA[Does Dying Light: The Beast Have Early Access?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-dying-light-the-beast-have-early-access.1288584/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Whenever a game is delayed, the desire to play it as soon as possible intensifies. Dying Light: The Beast fans have had to experience this pain, which is why early access would be a terrific boon to lessen the wait.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> was delayed by 4 weeks. If it was the game you were most looking forward to in 2025, I can imagine you’ve been in your own zombie-like state throughout August and the early parts of September. Techland seems confident in The Beast’s revised release date. I can tell you that Insider Gaming’s recent hands-on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-preview-evolution-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview</a> should give you cause for excitement.</p>



<p>It’s hit and miss if single-player games have early access—which is where Dying Light: The Beast comes into the undead equation.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dying-light-the-beast-with-early-access">Can You Play Dying Light: The Beast With Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A hop, a skip, and a thump. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of writing, there is no Dying Light: The Beast early access, meaning the first real opportunity to play the game is via its September 19 release date.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/the-beast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dying Light: The Beast</a> <em>does </em>have a special deluxe edition. But it doesn’t feature 24, 48, or even 7-day early access. It includes special cosmetic skins, the game’s official soundtrack, and other handy in-game items. But there’s definitely no early access to get you to part ways with more money.</p>



<p>In fairness, the deluxe edition is only a handful of dollars more than the standard edition. If it did offer early access, I expect there’d be a greater discrepancy in price. As an old-school gamer, I’m happy when games don’t offer this, as it’s better when everyone can jump in together on the same day, avoid spoilers, and get a chance to experience the hilarious and bizarre antics in unison.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-dying-light-the-beast-demo">Is There A Dying Light: The Beast Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s not even a Dying Light: The Beast demo for you to get a small taster of what’s to come.</strong></p>



<p>Techland is adamant about the game’s content. The only way you play Dying Light: The Beast is on release day. If you need snippets of gameplay and details on the game and its development, though, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderGamingTrailers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Trailers</a> YouTube page has a ton of Dyihng Light: The Beast content to watch.</p>

<p>007 First Light developers have clarified that it isn’t a reskin of Hitman and is different in many aspects. </p>



<p>007 First Light received an exclusive State of Play event yesterday, which featured 30 minutes of gameplay along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date announcement</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-deluxe-edition-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order details</a>. Since then, a new interview has emerged in which the developers have clarified that the James Bond game is distinct from Hitman. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-s-driving-was-a-huge-challenge">007 First Light’s Driving Was A “Huge Challenge”</h2>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/007-first-light-is-not-a-reskin-of-hitman-io-interactive-says-again-and-the-team-brought-in-amazing-fresh-talent-including-devs-with-specific-driving-expertise-to-help-build-car-missions/">GamesRadar+</a>, senior licensing producer Theuns Smit explained how Hitman and 007 First Light are two different games. Smit first talked about how they have a very talented team that has expanded significantly since the game was announced. They were able to bring in fresh talent, which, along with the existing staff, became “a really big growth moment” for the studio. </p>



<p>The new developers were able to bring in “fresh eyes, fresh expertise, all of that” while also relying on IO Interactive’s strengths and their 25 years of massive experience. However, Smit explains that it is about the game and experience first, stating, “If you’re looking at Hitman, it’s the way it is for a particular reason, because that’s the gameplay experience we want to give. For Bond, it’s not exactly that. It’s not a reskin of that.”</p>



<p>Smit then spoke about driving, describing it as “absolutely a huge challenge,” and they had to bring on developers with driving expertise, which included “people that had experience coding, setting up, tweaking, balancing.” He added that it is “a balancing act of making a vehicle feel both exciting, credible, and dangerous at the same time as being approachable and fun for a wide audience.” Finding this balance was difficult and a “new adventure” for them, but they feel they have “landed in an amazing space.” </p>

<p>Techland is set to make us all feel alive again with Dying Light: The Beast—the third mainline entry in the survival horror series. If you want to know Dying Light: The Beast’s release date and launch times, you’ve come to the right, safe place.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-dying-light-docket-codes-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> has been a long time coming. What started as DLC has become a beast within its own right. The Beast is smaller but more focused and dense compared to Dying Light 2. Old-school fans are thrilled to learn that OG protagonist Kyle Crane is back—even if he has become an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpected thirst trap</a>!</p>



<p>We’ve loved Dying Light: The Beast in our initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-preview-evolution-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming previews</a>. So let’s see its release date and what to expect.</p>

<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast is locked in for a September 19 release date across various platforms.</strong></p>



<p>The hearts of the Dying Light community were broken back in July 2025 when Techland announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast was delayed by 4 weeks</a>. The official reasons given were “To allow for extra polishing work” and “Finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscene and player animations further.”</p>



<p>Again, we’ve played The Beast, and the improvements are noticeable. Expectations are very high for Dying Light: The Beast, and its release date (and start times) can’t come soon enough.</p>
