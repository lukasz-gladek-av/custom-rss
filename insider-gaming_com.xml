<p>Hold onto something solid, because the next Marvel Rivals patch might give players what they want: Venom twerking. Get ready for a surge in Venom’s pick rates, as players look like they’ll finally have the chance to throw it back as the symbiote.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-better-not-be-an-april-fool-s-day-joke">This Better Not Be an April Fool’s Day Joke</h2>



<p>Between April 1st and April 4th, Marvel Rivals players that complete the board in the Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure event will be able to claim a special reward. This “special April Fool’s Easter Egg gift” will unlock a “hidden twist surprise,” but the icon on the board on the game’s website has hinted at what the surprise is. Instead of a question mark, which currently appears in-game in that spot of the event page, the official game site shows an outline of what very much looks like Venom throwing it back.</p>

<p>While the outline technically only shows a large, muscular frame with a prominent set of glutes, many players are zeroing in on it being Venom. The “Venom twerk” emote has been a running gag amongst Marvel Rivals players, with many fans online requesting it. Many didn’t think Netease would actually implement it, but some are still skeptical, believing this to just be an April Fool’s Day prank. Still it would be cruel to promise such a cosmetic and not deliver. In order to be eligible to receive the reward, whatever it is, you’ll have to collect all rewards from Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure board.</p>



<p>Cosmetics overall <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been the major focal point behind Marvel Rivals’ live-service business model</a>, especially the hero costumes. While not all of this is directly attributed to Marvel Rivals, Netease said in February that it saw <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/marvel-rivals-40-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.9 billion revenue</a> during the previous financial quarter, up 1.5%. An estimate from Chinese outlet Gamelook from January said that the game alone had brought in around $136 million.</p>



<p>If the Venom twerking emote is real, will you be picking it up? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>
