<p>Sony has <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/news/20241219_E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> the formation of a strategic alliance with Kadokawa, taking over 10% of the company’s shares. As a result, Sony will become the company’s largest shareholder. The transaction, scheduled for January 7, will cost Sony approximately $320 million.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-the-acquisition">What about the acquisition?</h2>



<p>According to the statement, <strong>Sony Group does not intend to acquire any more shares after this move</strong>, which indicates that the Japanese company has given up on acquiring the conglomerate. At least for now.</p>



<p>The strategic alliance will also strengthen the two companies’ IPs. The two companies will sit down in the future to discuss the production of live-action adaptations of prominent IPs, co-produce anime, and expand the distribution of Kadokawa anime globally. In games, Sony is to become a publisher for some of Kadokawa’s games. FromSoftware’s next original IP could become a Sony second party game, for example.</p>



<p>Hiroki Totoki, Sony President and CFO, said:</p>



<p>“<em>Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of KADOKAWA, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining KADOKAWA’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize KADOKAWA’s ‘Global Media Mix’ strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony’s long-term vision, ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.</em>’”</p>



<p>The move also helps protect Kadokawa from acquisitions by other companies. The company attempting a hostile takeover will need Sony to agree to sell its shares, which makes the process more difficult (and expensive).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-actor-gta-6-release-role/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent interview uploaded to YouTube, Johnny Ray Gill, a veteran actor and performer who had roles in GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, makes a thinly veiled suggestion about his involvement in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>During the interview, the American actor and producer explained what he worked on when GTA 5 was in development, and then heavily referenced being involved in ‘another situation in that world that may be coming out in 2025, 2026.’</p>



<p>It’s easy to surmise that he’s talking about GTA 6, given his connections to Rockstar Games and GTA 5.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-slip-of-the-tongue">Slip of the Tongue</h2>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has been one of the most locked-down titles since the leaks blew the lid off the project in 2022. In a sweep, more than 100 GB of content was pulled from Rockstar Games, revealing countless tidbits of information about the most highly-anticipated game ever made.</p>



<p>In December 2023, Rockstar Games published the first GTA 6 trailer, smashing viewership records and sending the world into a frenzy. By today, that’s still the only trailer that has been released. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with ‘Check It TV’ (picked up by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/102238/gta-5-actor-hints-mysterious-role-in-grand-theft-auto-6-and-release-window/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TweakTown</a>), Johnny Ray Gill appeared to talk about his work on Cross a hit television series, but the conversation turned to voiceover work and Grand Theft Auto.</p>



<p>Gill said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Grand Theft Auto was crazy. I was earlier in my career and they put the little helmet on you and they film you, and you’re doing multiple voices – different characters and stuff like that. I will say this…</p>



<p>Stay on the lookout. I can’t say anything, but there’s another situation happening in that world that may be coming out in 2025, 2026 that I’m really happy about.</p>



<p>I mean, I don’t know! I don’t know! Stay tuned.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the interviewer probed further, Gill said: ‘We will see, we will see…’</p>



<p>Here’s the moment in the interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GTA 6 Actor Announced?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VoS71-3B2aM?start=1158&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Given that Gill’s profile has grown immeasurably since the launch of GTA 5 in 2013, he could be appearing in a much heavier role – but only time will tell how he surfaces in Rockstar Games’ next major project.</p>



<p>For now, the GTA 6 release window is holding firm as Fall 2025, and unless Gill has some inside knowledge that nobody else does, the mention of ‘2026’ was likely just conjecture.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dota-2-frostivus-smurfs-ban/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dota-2-frostivus-smurfs-ban/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Frostivus has landed in Dota 2, and until January 15, players will be able to enjoy a special event laden with gifts and rewards. In a new blog post published on the Dota 2 site, it was revealed that some massive steps have been taken to improve the game in the last week, including an enormous ban wave against cheaters and ‘smurfs’.</p>



<p>In case you’ve never heard the term, smurfs are experienced players who create new accounts to play against lower-ranked users, rewarding them with easier matches that aren’t representative of their skill level.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enormous-wave">Enormous Wave</h2>



<p>In the blog post, the team revealed that an end-of-year ban wave has washed over Dota 2, and in it, 65,594 smurf accounts were permanently banned.</p>



<p>Not only that, but ‘a significant number’ of griefers, cheaters, and other malicious operators were also banned from the popular MOBA title:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>King Kringle broke his ban hammer off in some well-deserving asses last year. He’s spent the year constantly reforging and testing it on various smurfs and in-game baddies, and now he’s ready to rechristen it with the blood of the naughty.</p>



<p>While we usually do most of our bans and penalties behind the scenes, it’s become something of a Frostivus tradition for us to pull back the curtain a little bit and talk about this ongoing work. And so: This holiday season, we hope you look forward to some cleaner, friendlier, fairer games, free of the <strong>65,594 smurf accounts</strong> we’ve taken action against this week.</p>



<p>Besides the smurfs, we’ve also dropped the hammer on a significant number of high-MMR griefers, players who try to have fun at the expense of others, exploiting bugs, trading wins, and otherwise undermining the competitive challenge that is at the heart of every game of Dota.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From now until January 15, Dota 2 players worldwide are invited to participate in Frostivus, a limited-time event that yields massive rewards for the average user. The list of rewards includes the new ‘Spirit of Frostivus’ ability and access to the ‘Frostivus Forge’. </p>



<p>In the Winter 2024 Heroes’ Hoard, users can pick up a whopping 17 item sets.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/catly-devs-no-ai-used-in-the-trailer-game-awards/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/catly-devs-insist-no-generative-ai-was-used-in-the-trailer.1065090/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/catly-devs-no-ai-used-in-the-trailer-game-awards/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>At The Game Awards 2024, one trailer stood out from the pack because of how bizarre it looked. It was a showcase revealing ‘Catly’, a strange new game littered with cats that promises a range of activities in a wide-open world powered by feline companions, or something to that effect.</p>



<p>What became the talk of the town was how the trailer reeked of generative AI, and many expected it to be followed up with a reveal that the game was linked to the blockchain or NFTs.</p>



<p>In an interview, developers from SuperAuthenti, the team making Catly, revealed that isn’t the case.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-even-is-catly">What Even is Catly?</h2>



<p>Catly is nothing short of weird, and even the game’s description on Steam doesn’t help to clear things up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>An open-world adventure filled with surprises and joy, side by side with Cats! Build your dream island, meet various characters, and enjoy caring for your cats, dressing up, building, farming, racing, skiing, and much more! Explore freely and have endless fun with your furry companions!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a super-cute game that confused the 154 million viewers of The Game Awards. The trailer looked like something plucked straight out of a generative AI engine, but SuperAuthenti, the company making the game, assured IGN that isn’t what the deal is.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/catly-creator-says-game-has-no-generative-ai-no-blockchain-and-no-nfts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a>, a PR representative of SuperAuthenti said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(We are) very surprised by such speculations. We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They further advised that ‘zero blockchain technology’ has been incorporated into Catly, and also:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our company/project has never issued any blockchain currency and any NFTs. Our company does not and has never owned any blockchain currency and NFTs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team walked IGN through the Catly trailer from a different perspective, reportedly revealing step-by-step how it was made, and uncovering the Unreal 5-powered technologies they used to create the ‘hyper-realistic cats’ featured in the initial trailer, which you can see below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Catly - Official Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/boJ_opzOnB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Strange, right?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Catly doesn’t have a release date at present, and aside from the trailer and a few screenshots, not much is known about the title.</p>



<p>On Steam, it’s said that the game will promote ‘endless creativity’ in a ‘seamless open world’, and that the entire game is centred around adopting and raising cats. It looks like it could be a hotbed for microtransactions, so we’ll have to see what the game’s operating model looks like when it’s fleshed out a little more.</p>

<p>The long-anticipated remake of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion could be revealed next month. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzBn7eW6JJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaker Extas1s</a>, not only is The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake real, but Xbox could announce the game at an Xbox Direct event in January. Not only could it be announced next month, but the game could be released sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous rumors</a>, the remake is being developed by Virtuos and is being built in Unreal Engine 5. Those rumors also hinted at a 2025 release for the game.</p>



<p>If you recall, the first word of a remake or remaster of the game came during the FTC’s investigation into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. At the time, the documents revealed the game was expected during fiscal year 2022, but that, obviously, never came to be. Since then, nothing has been said publicly by Microsoft or Bethesda on its status. </p>

<p>As with every rumor, please take the information with a grain of salt until it’s officially confirmed or Insider Gaming can independently verify the information.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-get-free-counter-strike-2-cases/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-you-get-free-counter-strike-2-cases.1064979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-get-free-counter-strike-2-cases/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Free Counter-Strike 2 cases are hard to come by, and even if you do get your hands on one, it won’t open for free. Counter-Strike cases, the keys that open them, and the items inside have formed the foundation of a trading market now worth millions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to get CS2 cases for free.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-free-counter-strike-2-cases">How to get free Counter-Strike 2 cases</h2>



<p>Players can get one free Counter-Strike 2 case from the in-game weekly care package. Every week, once a player reaches their next XP rank, they can select two of four available rewards. A case is always included in this group of rewards.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The weekly care package resets every Tuesday at 8pm CT. The weekly care package window can be found in the store, but it will pop up automatically after a player levels up their XP rank. Players can level up their XP rank by playing games using official matchmaking. More XP is earned by playing full-length matches in competitive or Premier mode.</p>



<p>Aside from this method, players can also sometimes get free cases from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS2 skin gambling</a> websites. In almost all cases, players have to sign up and use the site in order to get the free cases. Cases on these sites are typically site-specific, and don’t have the same odds and items as the official cases bought and sold through Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-cheap-counter-strike-2-cases">How to get cheap Counter-Strike 2 cases</h2>



<p>Getting only one case per week for free is a very slow method for acquiring cases. Thankfully, players with money in their Steam account can purchase cases for just a few cents.</p>



<p>On the Steam community market, players can go to the CS2 section and filter by the “Container” item type. There they can sort by price and find cases that sell for less than $0.50 like the Recoil Case, the Snakebite Case, and the Fracture Case. Players can even put in a “request to buy” at a specific price that will automatically purchase a case when it reaches a low enough price point.</p>



<p>Which case did you get in your last weekly care package? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
