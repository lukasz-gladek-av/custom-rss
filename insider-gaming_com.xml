<p>There have been rumors for weeks that the Silent Hill 2 Remake was coming to the Xbox. The biggest hint yet is that an Xbox Achievements list for Silent Hill 2 is now live, meaning the official unveiling is scarily close.</p>



<p>A year after its release, Silent Hill 2’s remake got a second lease of life when it arrived free on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-coming-to-playstation-plus-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Plus</a>. We then saw a big leak that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake was coming to Xbox</a>. Fast forward a bit of time, and before you know it, there’s now a full Silent Hill 2 Remake achievements list to view.</p>

<p>Leaks continue to flood in for Chapter 7 in Fortnite following a creator preview event held by Epic Games, including some of the items set to be included in the Season 1 Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Chapter 6 in Fortnite draws to a close next week with a big <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour live event</a>, and, following a period of downtime, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 7 kicks off on November 30</a>—and there’s a big collab in store, according to leaks.</p>







<h2 id="h-leaks-say-marty-mcfly-skin-coming-to-fortnite-chapter-7">Leaks Say Marty McFly Skin Coming to Fortnite Chapter 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Zooming onto the scene. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable leakers, including <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991464160996344068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, Marty McFly from the Back to the Future franchise will feature in the Battle Pass for Chapter 7, Season 1, alongside another big collab that Epic Games has already teased.</p>



<p>McFly’s look will be based on the original Back to the Future films, with high-top trainers, sunglasses, and an orange gilet, and his inclusion comes alongside previous links that indicated the iconic DeLorean car will be featured—with the vehicle already appearing in Epic Games’ Rocket League.</p>



<p>Ahead of the new chapter, Epic Games revealed a collab with Kill Bill, with The Bride shown in a trailer for the upcoming live event, and it’s stated that the iconic look, with the yellow tracksuit, will also feature in the Battle Pass.</p>







<p>The two collabs indicate the widespread rumor that Hollywood serves as major inspiration for the Island in Chapter 7, with a ‘Battlewood’ sign on the hills mimicking the famous Hollywood sign <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991240664986632626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">already spotted</a>.</p>



<p>This also aligns with previous leaks for Chapter 7, which indicate that both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob Squarepants</a> will have collabs during the Chapter.</p>

<p>Embark Studios is well aware that ARC Raiders is a success. This is why the developer keeps supporting the game with new updates and dropping patch notes like it’s hot. The November 20 ARC Raiders 1.3.0 update drops some big changes that you can’t DUCK.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is amazing, but it isn’t perfect. This is why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-nerf-security-breach-perk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embark Studios nerfed ARC Raiders’ most OP perk</a> not long ago. The changes will keep coming, and improvements will shape ARC into <em>the </em>extraction shooter.</p>







<p>We’ve got everything you need to know about the ARC Raiders 1.3.0 update, featuring full patch notes at the end.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-arc-raiders-november-20-changes">Biggest ARC Raiders November 20 Changes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Look out. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Various balance changes have rolled out for the value of certain items, specific damage numbers—such as the Venator—have been readjusted, many bugs have been fixed, and there’s even a nice touch for rubber duck fans.</strong></p>



<p>You will need to think twice when selling certain items in ARC Raiders—such as Power Cells and certain ammo—as Embark has rung the changes. ARCs have been weakened to behave slightly more reasonably, and the Venator’s fire rate has been reworked, as it was “over-performing.”</p>







<p>One of the biggest, growing pastimes in ARC Raiders is collecting rubber ducks. While Embark hasn’t stated specifically what the change is, the dev has been listening to your request:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Your Raider Den has been ducked out.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-all-arc-raiders-patch-notes-for-november-20-update-1-3-0">All ARC Raiders Patch Notes For November 20 Update 1.3.0</h2>



<p>Here’s the complete 1.3.0 patch notes for you to read.</p>



<h3>Balance Changes</h3>



<h3>Items:</h3>



<h4>Deadline</h4>



<ul>
<li>Buy value: From 8,100 to 15,000 Coins</li>



<li>Sell value: From 3,000 to 5,000 Coins</li>



<li>Crafting:
<ul>
<li>Old: 2 Explosive compound + 1 Synthesized fuel</li>



<li>New: 3 Explosive compound + 2 ARC Circuitry&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Deadline trader stock: From 3 to 1</li>
</ul>



<h4>Power cell</h4>



<ul>
<li>Sell value: From 640 to 270 Coins</li>
</ul>



<h4>Launcher ammo</h4>



<ul>
<li>Buy value:
<ul>
<li>Old: 10 launcher ammo for 6,000 Coins</li>



<li>New: 6 launcher ammo for 4,500 Coins</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Sell value: From 200 to 250</li>



<li>Crafting:
<ul>
<li>Old: 6 launcher ammo for 4 Metal parts + 1 Explosive Compound</li>



<li>New: 6 launcher ammo for 1 ARC Motion Core + 2 Crude Explosives</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Launcher ammo crafting is available at the Workbench without needing a blueprint.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Venator</h4>



<p><strong>Dev note:&nbsp;</strong>The fully upgraded Venator has been over-performing recently, capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons. We’re re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well.</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced Fire-rate gained from upgrades from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%.</li>



<li>Increased Weight from 2 to 5.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Explosive Damage</h4>



<p><strong>Dev note:</strong>&nbsp;We noticed that explosives dealt damage to more parts at once than intended, allowing weapons like the Hullcracker to kill larger drones too quickly. We’ve adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change. This will require Hullcracker shots to need a bit more precision while still dealing good damage to the targeted spot.</p>



<ul>
<li>Rebalanced explosive damage against ARC for a more consistent experience.</li>



<li>Explosions on smaller enemies, e.g. Turrets are largely unaffected.</li>



<li>Explosions on larger sized enemies, e.g. Bastion will typically deal a bit less damage.</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3>Content and Bug Fixes</h3>



<h3>ARC</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where ARC could call down reinforcements outside the map.</li>



<li>Shredder
<ul>
<li>Shredder will now detect and move more reliably towards Lure Grenades.</li>



<li>Shredder movement and handling updated: slightly reduced turn speed, improved braking, stiffer suspension, and more consistent reactions to impacts for steadier behavior in combat.</li>



<li>Improved Shredder navigation to prevent it from getting stuck on corners when moving toward the player.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3>Audio&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Reduced volume attenuation for explosion tinnitus and concussion effects to improve clarity.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Maps&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Barricades can no longer be placed overlapping your character, preventing clipping through walls and access to locked rooms.</li>



<li><strong>The Dam Battlegrounds</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would get stuck in the Dam Control Tower elevator shaft.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Spaceport</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added collision to the staircase walls and ceiling in the Hidden Bunker on Spaceport.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players could enter the wall near the Launch Tower ramp on Spaceport, preventing unfair ambushes.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players could access the locked room on the Control Tower without a key.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Blue Gate</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed railing props on Blue Gate that mistakenly blocked bullets; shots now pass through as expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Stella Montis</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a collision issue on Stella Montis near the Train Station that could cause players to fall through the terrain.</li>



<li>Fixed a location in Stella Montis Train Station where players could get stuck.</li>



<li>Removed two player spawns on Stella Montis that were too close to ARC spawn areas.</li>



<li>Fixed missing visibility collision on walls in the Business Center area of Stella Montis that allowed shots to pass through.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when using Raider Voice (proximity chat) on PCs without AVX2 support.</li>



<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when surrendering after reconnecting to a session.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where scavenging parts from the Shredder could leave behind invisible collisions.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the Trials weekly rollover could display an outdated rank; the celebration now reflects the correct current rank and the UI remains accurate during the cooldown period.</li>



<li>Updated recommended AMD graphics driver to version 25.11.1 to reduce recent crash issues on AMD GPUs.</li>



<li>Your Raider Den has been ducked out.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Movement&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Improved enemy ground detection to better handle steep surfaces, reducing erratic movement when traversing angled terrain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Major Fortnite leaks for Chapter 7 content have begun to flood social media following a creator preview event in Los Angeles, with standout details including driveable reboot vans and a dedicated bots mode.</p>



<p>Epic Games is gearing up for the major <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour end-of-chapter event</a> next week, which will be followed by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start of Chapter 7</a>, Season 1, and big changes are on the cards that will impact various core mechanics of the game.</p>

<p>According to reliable leakers, including <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991464160996344068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, some of the biggest gameplay changes coming to Fortnite in Chapter 7 include reboot vans being driveable, an overhaul to the gameplay UI, and a dedicated Solo vs Bots mode.</p>



<p>Bots are nothing new in Fortnite and are widely used to populate Battle Royale lobbies to reduce wait time, but introducing a dedicated mode where solo players go head-to-head with them is a big change. However, there is still plenty to be detailed about the game mode.</p>



<p>Driveable reboot vans align with previous hints towards a revamp of the reboot system in Fortnite, which will result in changes to gameplay tactically as reboot vans will be moveable, thus becoming a core resource later in games to revive fallen teammates, or prevent opponents from bringing back their squad.</p>



<p>Another big change, again leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991290054728159308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, shows that storm sizes are being adjusted in Chapter 7 away from the standard circle closing in, instead having a ‘seven’ shape. However, it’s mentioned that the sizes and timings are not final.</p>



<p>Epic Games will reveal all the major changes to Fortnite in Chapter 7 closer to the release date, likely sharing the full details in a pre-launch blog ahead of the start of the new chapter on December 30.</p>
