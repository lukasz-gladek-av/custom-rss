            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-and-skins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We never thought we’d see a battle pass or traditional season structure in Escape from Tarkov – and we’re kind of <strong>still not. </strong>But Escape from Tarkov: Arena, the session-based multiplayer arena shooter, is getting a battle pass system along with cosmetics and skins soon. On social media, Battlestate Games has spent the past couple of days teasing just that.</p>



<p>In a new post on Twitter, players are given a glimpse at the CQCM Mask, a favourite item amongst the game’s W-key spamming Chads, with a <strong>custom skin</strong>.</p>



<p>It starts with Arena – will it bleed into Escape from Tarkov proper?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-geared-up">Geared Up</h2>



<p>The <strong>free </strong>battle pass that’s coming to Escape from Tarkov: Arena is expected to behave exactly as you’d imagine. It’ll reward players with exclusive items, skins, and boosts in exchange for cold, hard XP grinds. The more you play, the more you’ll unlock.</p>



<p>That’s right, I said it’s <strong>free</strong>. That was something confirmed by Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov two days ago.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov: Arena isn’t free – you need to pay for that as it’s a spin-off from the core extraction shooter title.</p>



<p>Here’s the post on social media that revealed a snippet of the CQCM skin:</p>











<p>Players are now wondering how any crossover impact will ripple throughout the wider Escape from Tarkov ecosystem. Will there be a linking function allowing users to run their skins and cosmetics in Escape from Tarkov’s extraction shooter platform? I, for one, hope so. I’ve wanted to customise my gear more in Tarkov for the longest time.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov uses a ‘wipe’ pattern that typically involves resetting the game once every six months. That could easily pivot to a season structure equipped with a battle pass of sorts, but it would need BSG to pack it with content for it to be interesting. Given that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/months-add-escape-from-tarkov-gun/">takes months to add a single gun</a> to the game, that’s a <strong>huge </strong>ask that probably won’t be delivered.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98a-minecraft-movie%E2%80%99-made-301-million-during-its-opening-weekend.1156581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>‘A Minecraft Movie’ has now become the biggest-ever opening weekend for a video game movie with a staggering $301 million.</p>



<p>The movie completely shattered analysts predictions, who forecasted that movie would only generate $70-$80 million domestically in its opening weekend – A Minecraft Movie hit $157 million opening domestically and $144 million overseas for a global start of $301 million.</p>



<p>Domestically, at $157 million for its opening weekend now puts A Minecraft Movie as the biggest day one and weekend video game adaption, passing the previous record set by The Super Mario Bros. Movie at $146.4 million domestically over three days. A small caveat is that The Super Mario Bros. Movie released on a Wednesday, but even so earned $204 million by Sunday.</p>



<p>The movie has also become the highest-grossing movie during the opening weekend for any film releases in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie’s success means that the movie has already become highly profitable, with the film having a $150 million production budget plus marketing and distribution costs, so it wouldn’t be too surprising to see if a sequel is already being planned.</p>



<p>The video game has sold over 300 million individual copies worldwide since its release in 2011, with its success attracting the eyes of Microsoft, who purchased Mojang (Minecraft’s developers) in 2014 for $2.5 billion.</p>



<p>The film stars Jack Black, Jason Momoa, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, Sebastian Eugene Hansen and Jennifer Coolidge.</p>



<p>It’s numbers become even more impressive after new leaks online show that a version of the film is already circulating online in its entirety, meaning that piracy has already become a huge issue for the blockbuster title.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/schedule-1%E2%80%99s-next-update-is-scheduled-to-release-tomorrow-here%E2%80%99s-what%E2%80%99s-in-it.1156539/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1’s sole developer, Tyler, has said that the next update for Schedule 1 is scheduled to go live tomorrow.</p>



<p>In an update on X, Tyler said that the “next update is almost ready to go” and is set to be fully released on Monday. Its said that the next update in Schedule 1 will include boutique store, a pawnshop, wall decorations, and “some other fancy stuff.”</p>



<p>However, Tyler’s most recent update (which came at the time of writing) said that the v0.3.4 open beta is “taking a bit longer than expected”, and will release first thing in the morning. For those unaware, Tyler is from Australia, so players should expect the BETA update to come sometime in the afternoon for east coast players and later at night for those in the UK.</p>



<p>Schedule 1 has proven to be a massive success for the games single developer, going on to achieve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">414,000 concurrent players</a>, with that number likely to be smashed later today.</p>



<p>It’s success hasn’t come without its issues, though, as the developer is now reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing IP copyright issues and is currently being investigated for infringement</a>. As for what those issues are remains to be seen, but the developer is yet to comment on the matter.</p>



<p>Evidence on the investigation surfaced on the website&nbsp;<a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes,</a>&nbsp;featuring a document entitled: “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/reasons-why-fallout-76-is-good-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/6-reasons-why-fallout-76-is-good-now.1156497/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/reasons-why-fallout-76-is-good-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 76 was released in 2018 to a paltry reception. It was a shell of a game, boasting a bleak open-world environment (even for an apocalyptic game), and ultimately, Bethesda Game Studios had fallen short of its promises for this overly ambitious game. </p>



<p>It was an enormous change to the well-established Fallout formula to introduce an MMORPG to the scene, and five years after its launch, plenty of potential players and uninformed gamers still wonder if Fallout 76 is good now.</p>



<p>Let’s break into a snapshot list and break down the reasons why Fallout 76<em> </em><strong>is </strong>good now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-76-good-now">Is Fallout 76 Good Now?</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 has experienced a lengthy turnaround that has lasted half a decade, and it just keeps on going today. With countless changes having been made to the platform and dozens of updates having been applied, it’s not the same game that it was when it was released in 2018.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-it-has-content-now-and-npcs">1. It Has Content Now – and NPCs!</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Back in the day, Fallout 76 launched with very little content – it almost lacked a core campaign, it was devoid of any NPCs, and overall, it felt dead and bland. Now, following several sizeable updates, Fallout 76 is more of a living, breathing game, and it has had several lengthy questlines, factions, and some large settlements injected into the core of it.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has worked hard to keep up the content stream in Fallout 76, expanding the map and adding new world events, quest branches, and endgame activities, such as running caravans, fishing, and participating in C.A.M.P. build contests.</p>







<h3 id="h-2-it-takes-you-outside-the-map">2. It Takes You Outside The Map</h3>

<p>It started with The Pitt – an ‘Expedition’ that takes players back to Fallout 3’s ‘The Pitt’ expansion. In this Expedition, players are charged with flying hundreds of miles in a ‘Vertibird’ to take on missions outside of the base map – and that’s a concept that Bethesda Game Studios is expanding on over time.</p>



<p>After that, the team introduced Atlantic City, another out-of-the-map expansion that players enjoyed quite nicely. It was after <strong>that </strong>that the team at BGS started expanding the core map of Appalachia, many years after the game hit the market.</p>

<p>It’s a canonical title and pumped full of the lore that Fallout fans the world over both know and love. From the cryptids to the mysterious wrongdoings of Vault-Tec, and from the iconic factions to a whole new host of mutated enemies, there’s a lot of lore and backstory to soak up in Fallout 76. </p>



<p>There are several events referenced in the game that have a huge impact on the complete timeline for the series.</p>

<p>Admittedly, there are still thousands of Fallout fans who’ll say that Fallout 76 ‘isn’t a real Fallout game’ because it’s a multiplayer-only title, but that’s the beauty of it. It’s still remarkable to be able to venture out into this post-apocalyptic, mutated landscape, fight enormous creatures, loot buildings that are hundreds of years old, and complete entire questlines with your friends by your side. </p>



<p>It’s quite a unique experience, and going by the numbers preached by Bethesda Game Studios, it’s a popular one at that.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-it-s-more-resilient">5. It’s More Resilient</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Back before Fallout 76 was given any real attention, it was rather buggy and quite a chore to play. However, thanks to BGS pouring resources into the game’s development – which has included reaching out to third-party studios to give a little support – Fallout 76 offers up a much cleaner, resilient experience today. </p>



<p>It’s a visually pleasing game that manages to edge out Fallout 4 – especially when it comes to vistas – and despite being an always-online game, it’s rare that any network issues are present.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-truthfully-it-s-all-they-ve-got">6. Truthfully, It’s All They’ve Got</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Frankly, Fallout 76 is good now because Bethesda Game Studios has probably realised that this is it for the foreseeable future. There are no other Fallout games in development, and Fallout 5 – the ‘one-pager’ game – likely won’t be released for around another decade or so. </p>



<p>This ‘live service’ model is perfect for Bethesda, as it means the firm can simply keep updating it as time goes on, adding in more content, more questlines, fresh Expeditions, and more ways to experience the post-apocalyptic wasteland with your friends.</p>

<p>Ubisoft is developing a new turn-based tactics game set in the same universe as Rainbow 6 Siege.</p>



<p>It was said that the new Rainbow 6 Siege game is likely one or two years out, but is aiming to be released as a current-generation console title for the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, PC, and possibly Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Two sources, who have knowledge of the game said that the camera is a top-down view somewhat similar to Diablo 4 or XCOM and would see the player take control of Rainbow Six Siege operators. One source said, “just watch some XCOM gameplay if you want to get an idea, I’d say it’s an updated version of that with cinematic cutscenes and so on.”</p>



<p>It’s gameplay loop was said to be similar to Rainbow 6 Siege in a lot of ways, where the players would have to select different operators based on their skills to raid buildings, save hostages, etc. </p>



<p>The total time of the game was said to be aiming for approximately 25-30 hours depending on player skill, but that could change if gameplay content, cinematics, etc. are cut, it was said.</p>



<p>Although the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current plan for Ubisoft’s new subsidiary with Tencent</a> is currently up in the air, some staff working on the project said that it could move to the new business as it falls under the Rainbow Six IP, while others said they currently did not know.</p>



<p>Rainbow 6 is one of Ubisoft’s biggest IPs, with Rainbow Six Siege surpassing well over 50 million players. The last mainline title in the series, though, Rainbow 6 Extraction, failed to meet Ubisoft’s internal expectations and support was quietly removed.</p>



<p>What do you think of a XCOM-style Rainbow 6 game? Let me know what you think in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-fires-back-youtube-age-restriction/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-creator-fires-back-at-youtube-age-restricting-videos-of-the-game.1156455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-fires-back-youtube-age-restriction/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Balatro has been targeted once again on account of it being <strong>kind of </strong>related to gambling. YouTube has started putting age restrictions on Balatro videos, according to one creator, and the game’s sole developer, LocalThunk, has fired back at the Google-owned platform.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. In February, LocalThunk was successful in an appeal to PEGI to get Balatro’s age rating reduced from 18 to 12.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-deja-vu">Dejá vu</h2>



<p>On social media, LocalThunk clapped back at YouTube for putting age restrictions on Balatro content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apparently Balatro videos are being rated 18+ on YouTube now for gambling </p>



<p>Good thing we are protecting children from knowing what a 4 of a kind is and letting them watch CS case opening videos instead</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comments came after this video was posted online by ‘Balatro University’:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Balatro is now 18+ on YouTube." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnhNLWKEbSE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a recent change to the site’s terms of service, YouTube tweaked the rules for creators, stressing that ‘depications or promotions of online casino sites of apps’ are now subject to age restrictions.</p>



<p>Balatro is based entirely around building decks of cards and earning chips to defeat your opponents, but the act of chasing down poker hands is as close as it gets to gambling. It’s a connection, but a minute one that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-luck-be-a-landlord-win-pegi-ratings-appeals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even PEGI was able to overlook</a>.</p>



<p>It seems as though LocalThunk will need to go back on the warpath, this time against Google and YouTube, to potentially rectify this issue. It’s possible that some kind of AI-driven solution was employed to scan the platform and put an age restriction on content that matched a certain model, hence, Balatro got caught by the algorithm.</p>



<p>Have you played Balatro yet? Let me know what you think about the game in the comments.</p>

<p>Last night in the Call of Duty League, Toronto Ultra was forced to give up a series against Boston Breach because of server issues that caused them to ‘rubber band’ all over the map. During the round of Control on Vault, the team was visibly enraged on the face cams, and following a <span>long technical revi</span>ew, the match was chalked.</p>



<p>The team took to social media following the loss, with JoeDeceives especially getting vocal about dealing with this ‘time and time again’ and suggesting that, despite complaints, <strong>nothing ever changes</strong> with the League.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-is-hilarious">‘This is Hilarious’</h2>



<p>After a break of around 30 minutes midway through Control on Vault, Toronto Ultra threw in the towel against Boston Breach, giving them the win with a 2-0 scoreline. Ultra has enjoyed some solid results in recent weeks, including a dominant win over Atlanta FaZe just one day before this debacle.</p>



<p>JoeDeceives summed up the situation perfectly on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>after all the bullshit we’ve (and other teams) been thru with online servers we are not doing that shit again with how bad we are rubber banding, ggs boston play lat next week.</p>



<p>we’ve brought it up to the league time and time again and nothing ever changes, if anything the responses get worse. this is hilarious</p>



<p>Had my own coach recording my pov from behind me and they still don’t believe us, fucking hilarious they have integrity cams behind us to see all of ours povs and they don’t do anything with it just a useless camera behind us for fun</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tempers flared as other pro players came out and made their accusations:</p>



<div><article><p><span>This is what happens when you use Exit Lag</span></p></article></div>







<p>Toronto Ultra’s next fixture will be against the LA Thieves on April 13 – hopefully, the network issues will be resolved by then.</p>

<p>Hours ago, a claim surfaced on social media suggesting that ‘talk of a Fortnite movie’ that was originally passed on would be rethought given the success of Minecraft, which is enjoying the highest opening weekend <strong>ever </strong>for a video game movie.</p>



<p>It wasn’t too long after the claim had surfaced on Twitter (X) that it was shot down unceremoniously with a single word from the CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nope">Nope.</h2>



<p>In a now-deleted post on Twitter, DanielRPK wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You just know Fortnite is next. There was already talk of a Fortnite movie, but some studios passed on it. That’s obviously gonna change now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1908540590255382632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interjected with a single word</a> reply: ‘False.’</p>



<p>DanielRPK has since <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1908582823256338548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">followed up</a> by addressing Sweeney directly, asking whether it’s true that Sony ‘passed on the opportunity to make a Fortnite movie a few years ago.’ Sweeney has yet to respond to this comment at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Minecraft has turned heads this weekend, scoring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a record of $58 million</a> on its first day at the box office. This has defied expectations, with many thinking the film would bomb because of it starring Jack Black and looking bizarre in early impressions and previews. </p>



<p>In recent years, live-action adaptations of video games have soared. The likes of Fallout and The Last of Us have dominated the charts and won prestigious awards, becoming known as some of the top titles in the space to make it to the silver screen.</p>



<p>It appears that Fortnite isn’t one of the games that’s set to get a movie adaptation any time soon, though.</p>



<p>Do you think Fortnite would work as a movie? Let me know what you think in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>‘A Minecraft Movie’ has now become the biggest-ever opening day video game movie with a $58 million opening day.</p>



<p>The movie has also become the biggest opening day so far in 2025, surpassing ‘Captain America: Brave New World’ at $40.9 million.</p>



<p>It’s an impressive start for a movie that was forecasted to hit around $70 to $80 million in its opening weekend, but now updated forecasts predict that it will pass $150 million, 200% more than initial predicted. </p>



<p>The new forecast puts it in the running to surpass the biggest three-day opening ever for a video game movie, which is currently held by ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ at $146 million. Though, it should be worth noting that ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ released on a Wednesday and had already grossed $58 million before the weekend.</p>



<p>The film stars Jack Black, Jason Momoa, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, Sebastian Eugene Hansen and Jennifer Coolidge.</p>



<p>That being said, ‘A Minecraft Movie’ will likely turn a profit after its first week, with the film having a $150 million production budget plus marketing and distribution costs.</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie’s staggering numbers does come as a bit of a shock to those familiar with the game, with many fans criticising the games trailers. Yet, the game is one, if not, the most popular video game ever, so it’s success isn’t too surprising to most.</p>



<p>The video game has sold over 300 million individual copies worldwide since its release in 2011, with its success attracting the eyes of Microsoft, who purchased Mojang (Minecraft’s developers) in 2014 for $2.5 billion.</p>
