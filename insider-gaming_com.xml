<p>Hytale will not be available on Steam when it launches in January, Hypixel Studios confirmed, with the developers keen to avoid negative reviews during the early access stage.</p>



<p>After being axed by Riot Games, Hytale was saved by the initial founders of the game and will be released into early access on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 13</a>, with an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-price-revealed-ahead-of-early-access-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">affordable price of $19.99 for the base version</a>, and, while Steam won’t be available at launch and may never be required, there are plans for a console release.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-skipping-steam-but-coming-to-console-in-future">Hytale Skipping Steam But Coming to Console in Future</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Wait. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Answering a series of frequently asked questions on the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale website</a>, executive director Patrick ‘Lyall’ Derbic confirmed Hytale won’t be supported on Steam at launch, with the intention to avoid “overindexing on negative reviews from players that aren’t as well-informed yet about what we are doing.”</p>



<p>The intention is to spend time “working with the community and improving the game,” and, while “Steam is a great marketing tool,” it’s one that may not ever be required. However, the door hasn’t been closed on a Steam launch entirely.</p>



<p>There are plans for launches on console and other platforms in the future, though the early access period will be on PC only. Launching on console “requires a lot of work on backend systems,” and the initial desire is to “focus on making a good game first.”</p>



<p>A mobile version will also not be available during early access, and it remains to be seen whether it’s on the cards at all, as Hypixel Studios are “still evaluating what it would take to make this a feasible reality.”</p>

<p>Fortnite players are set to be treated to another new game mode, according to leakers, with a mode for five-player squads in the works.</p>



<p>Battle Royale in Fortnite currently supports 1-4 players, but larger groups have been restricted. However, that could be set to change with five-player squads on the horizon.</p>







<h2 id="h-leakers-say-fortnite-will-add-five-player-squads">Leakers Say Fortnite Will Add Five-Player Squads</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More players, more fun. Credit Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Fecooo_/status/1996365066212696385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter post from Fecoo_</a>, five-player squads are “likely coming” to Battle Royale soon, with a sub link code to the data of the playlist of the mode showing details of ‘Quints’, which also confirms that five players can be in a team.</p>



<p>The string has come in the same area where the Battle Royale modes of Solo, Duos, Trios, and Squads are shown, suggesting there is strong legitimacy to the claims.</p>



<p>Five-player squads would be the first variation to the standard Battle Royale since the introduction of Trios in January 2019, which initially came as a limited-time mode before being later added as a permanent option.</p>



<p>Since then, Battle Royale has branched into entirely separate modes with the likes of Blitz, Reload, Fortnite OG, and Delulu, but the lobby sizes have largely remained the same.</p>



<p>The leaks do not specify when to expect the addition of five-player squads to Fortnite, nor is it indicated whether the addition will arrive permanently or as a limited-time mode.</p>



<p>It does serve as further evidence of Epic Games’ plans to continually expand Fortnite to cater to a wider range of players, with the game now containing separate ecosystems with their own passionate playerbase.</p>

<p>Fortnite has confirmed an iconic character has survived the shocking attack that occurred in the trailer for Chapter 7 Season 1, with the Battle Bus poised to return and the driver being safe from harm.</p>



<p>One of the biggest shake-ups in recent history in Fortnite occurred at the start of Chapter 7, with players landing on the Battle Royale Island after surfing a wave after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shocking destruction of the Battle Bus</a>. However, the iconic vehicle isn’t gone for good.</p>







<h2 id="h-battle-bus-returning-to-fortnite">Battle Bus Returning to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Survival. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1996338694383714586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Twitter</a> was shared confirming the safety of the driver, alongside a message that read “The Bus Driver, who was obliterated by an energy beam last week, just texted me this.”</p>



<p>The exchange of messages included one from the driver himself, saying “i lived *****,” and a dramatic return to Fortnite is expected to take place later today.</p>



<p>Players have been hard at work completing quests to repair the Battle Bus, including finding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-custom-battle-bus-pieces-chapter-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom Battle Bus pieces</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-bus-wheels-pump-n-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Bus wheels</a>, and the work has seemingly paid off, with Dummy successful in their repairs.</p>



<p>The return of the Battle Bus coincides with the return of additional modes to Fortnite, following a brief absence, with Reload, Blitz, and Ranked now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-roadmap-blitz-reload-og-delulu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available from December 4</a>.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG remains unavailable for the time being until the launch of a new OG Season on November 11, while Delulu is back for Chapter 7 the following day.</p>



<p>At this stage, it’s not clear whether the surfing mechanic will be removed entirely or retained with a varied approach to landing in matches.</p>

<p>Fortnite has revealed a surprise Nickelodeon collab with Danny Phantom is arriving in the Item Shop tomorrow, with the secret somehow being kept from the flood of leakers on social media.</p>



<p>Epic Games’ boasts a proud history of featuring a wealth of impressive collabs in Fortnite, shown by the recent The Simpsons mini-season, but keeping collabs under wraps and coming as a surprise is difficult. This time, though, they’ve managed to do so.</p>







<h2 id="h-danny-phantom-coming-to-fortnite">Danny Phantom Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Surprise! Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1996323949882523779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teaser post</a> showcasing what to expect to appear in the Item Shop on Fortnite this week, it was subtly revealed that a Danny Phantom bundle will land on December 5.</p>



<p>The bundle will feature skins for Danny Phantom and Samantha Manson, though further items like Back Bling, Emotes, or Gliders have not been showcased, nor has the price been revealed.</p>



<p>Keeping such a huge collab under wraps is a big win for Fortnite, and the fact that Danny Phantom falls under the Nickelodeon banner could open the door to further huge collabs in the future.</p>



<p>It’s already been widely reported that SpongeBob SquarePants is coming to Fortnite later this Chapter, which, along with Danny Phantom, suggests other collabs could be on the cards.</p>



<p>The potential for collabs has increased following the release of Sidekicks, which allows for smaller characters to feature in collabs, whereas previously, there were size restrictions that prevented small-sized characters from starring prominently.</p>



<p>So far, the only Sidekick collabs have come from The Simpsons, with Scratchy and Homer’s Pig, but there are plenty of options for the future.</p>

<p>A long-awaited Fortnite skin has finally been made available, although the initial unlock is locked behind the purchase of a $170 piece of hardware.</p>



<p>Fortnite skins continue to flood out, with both collabs and Epic Games creations becoming hits, and the Clyde skin has been on the eyes of players for a while, providing a mix of a raccoon and a cowboy. However, it won’t be cheap initially.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-clyde-skin-initially-locked-behind-backbone-controller">Fortnite Clyde Skin Initially Locked Behind Backbone Controller</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hefty purchase. Image via Backbone</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although the Clyde skin could be available in the Item Shop at a later date, the initial option to claim the skin is locked behind the purchase of a $170 Backbone Pro Controller.</p>



<p>Existing owners of a Backbone Pro can also receive the Clyde outfit by redeeming a code, which unlocks a quick in-game Quest before Clyde is added to your Locker.</p>



<p>The code is redeemable only once per user, and cannot be resold, exchanged, or redeemed for cash, though that’s unlikely to stop some people trying to flog their codes on the market.</p>



<p>Anyone else wanting the Clyde outfit will have to fork out the price to purchase the controller, or wait for the Outfit to potentially be available in the Item Shop in the future. However, there’s no indication of how long that will be, nor is the price of such a release known.</p>



<p>The Clyde outfit can also only be unlocked by playing Fortnite on iOS, Android, PC, and cloud streaming, although it will be usable across all platforms when unlocked.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is finally in the hands of players worldwide after years of waiting, but players have uncovered that a basic feature is locked behind an Amiibo figure.</p>



<p>18 years after Metroid Prime 3: Corruption was first released, the fourth instalment in the series launched on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on December 4, but early impressions are mixed, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-the-lowest-reviewed-game-in-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critic scores being the lowest in the series</a>.</p>



<p>There’s still time for that to change, however, and user scores may be more positive, but the locking of a basic feature behind a paywall has left one area of the game feeling barren.</p>







<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-desert-music-locked-behind-amiibo-purchase">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Desert Music Locked Behind Amiibo Purchase</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Locked. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/lukestephens/status/1996340617497227440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Luke Stephens</a> on Twitter, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond’s music in the desert, an area explored while driving the Vi-O-La bike, is absent unless you purchased the $29.99 Samus Amiibo.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/hardware/amiibo/game/bgw5a_2/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo’s product description</a> lists background music as a perk from owning the Samus Amiibo, along with the ability to activate a shield that will block up to 99 damage and fully restore Samus’ life once per day.</p>



<p>The description doesn’t inform you, however, that without the Amiibo figure, the desert landscape in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be eerily silent, and offers nothing if you haven’t splashed out on the figure.</p>



<p>There are also two other Amiibo figures to purchase to get additional bonuses in the game, with the Samus &amp; Vi-O-La figure providing customizable colors, the ability to check total distance travels, and a once-per-day increase to the rate of regeneration for Viola’s Boost Energy.</p>



<p>The final figure, Cyrax, allows you to see the full version of the movies that are shown in fragments throughout the game, once you have completed it, a feature that is otherwise locked behind achieving a 100% scan rate and item collection rate.</p>
