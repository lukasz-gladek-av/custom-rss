            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie has posted a feedback sheet regarding the Marathon server slam, and surprisingly, it addresses almost <strong>every major gripe </strong>players have with the fledgling extraction shooter. Marathon has hit a tentative period following the access all areas server slam, which has left many players firmly on one side of the fence or the other.</p>



<p>The full game comes out next week, but Bungie has been quick to address key concerns <strong>right now</strong> based on feedback received from the server slam. That includes worries around the game’s overly complex UI <strong>and </strong>the lack of PvP-based clashes.</p>







<h2 id="h-bungie-recognizes-pvp-woes-in-marathon">Bungie Recognizes PvP Woes in Marathon</h2>



<p>In an article <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2027924343800648062">posted to social media</a>, Bungie acknowledges <strong>six </strong>core issues with Marathon:</p>



<ul>
<li>UI Feedback</li>



<li>PC Performance</li>



<li>PvP Frequency</li>



<li>Movement and Heat Generation</li>



<li>Med and Ammo Economy</li>



<li>Weasel Error Codes</li>
</ul>



<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98">Marathon’s</a> server slam opened, one of the more immediate concerns from players was around the game’s UI (User Interface), which is drastically complex. It’s a nightmare to understand right out of the gate, presenting a critical issue with onboarding. The team at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99">Bungie</a> said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are continuing to gather your posts and will keep iterating post‑launch (which, we’ll keep you posted on with regard to any future timelines once they’re available). Add your thoughts in the UI thread on our Discord so we can track them all in one place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another major worry was around the cadence of PvP clashes. Most players reported going an entire raid without even <strong>seeing </strong>other players, which is far from ideal for a PvPvE extraction game. It’s not at all like competing titles such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> and ARC Raiders, in which player-vs-player clashes are almost guaranteed.</p>



<p>The team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As we continue to keep an ear to the ground on this one, we’re further investigating total player density on non-beginner maps to cover all of our bases. If you’ve got any feedback – be it on Perimeter (Beginner), Perimeter, or Dire Marsh – we want to hear it!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the first update post-launch, the team said that the player count on the game’s earliest maps had been boosted to promote more combat between players.</p>



<p>Movement and ‘heat generation’ have also been named as tricky areas. In Marathon, ‘heat’ replaces stamina, and the more aggressively you move, the faster you burn out and hit a wall. Many have reported that this happens far too quickly and the ramifications are far too impactful, and Bungie is investigating improvements.</p>



<p>Also, the lack of medical and ammo-based loot has been a gripe with players. It seems impossible to find meaningful amounts of ammunition around the map, and that’s a clear issue in a game with bullet-sponge AI enemies.</p>



<p>The Marathon server slam finishes tomorrow, March 2, and the full game hits the market on March 5. Do you think enough changes will be made to make it feel like a ‘better game’ at launch?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix is Disappearing From The PlayStation 3 Platform Tomorrow]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-disappearing-ps3-tomorrow-platform/</link>
            <guid>1449826</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was around a month ago that retro gaming fans (kind of) were hit with a major revelation. Netflix, the titan streaming service, announced that it would cease operating an application on the <strong>PlayStation 3 platform</strong>. The console, which dropped <strong>twenty years ago</strong>, will no longer facilitate a working <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/netflix/" id="1142">Netflix</a> app from tomorrow, March 2.</p>



<p>It’s a wonder the application has lasted <strong>this long</strong>. For the last few weeks, users booting their dusty old PlayStation 3 consoles and loading Netflix would have been met with a message warning them of the application’s impending fate.</p>







<h2 id="h-another-nail-in-the-ps3-coffin">Another Nail in the PS3 Coffin</h2>



<p>In February, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-3/" id="436">PlayStation 3</a> users took <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crt/comments/1qubzpj/rip_ps3_netflix/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to social media</a> to discuss the removal of Netflix from their 20-year-old console platform. For some, it marked the end of an era, but for others, it was a total surprise that the application <strong>still worked</strong>… Barely.</p>



<p>One user explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>But was still super slow, quality less good as it took more time to reach the 1080p</p>



<p>And, the worse, often froze at 10 minutes before end on movies&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The biggest concern amongst retro fans is that this was one of the sole remaining ways to consume 4:3 content on Netflix. Those seeking a blast from the past could plug their PS3 into a CRT TV and go wild streaming content from the old days.</p>



<p>Another user wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>2006-2026 o7 One less streaming service on a great multimedia platform</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A third mourned the loss:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dog I JUST mentioned Netflix for the ps3 earlier today. This is tragic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you loaded Netflix on a PlayStation 3 console in the last month, you’d have seen the message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, Netflix will no longer be available on this device after March 2, 2026.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s time to move on, as impressive as it is that the app managed to cling to life this long. It was a similar situation when the Wii Shop closed down in 2019, forcing the removal of the Netflix app from <strong>that </strong>platform, which also facilitated cleaner 4:3 streaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In case you were wondering, the ‘World Series of Warzone’ moniker will never be seen again in an official setting. This is because, earlier this week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/activision/" id="190">Activision</a> suddenly dropped the name and trademark after a brief legal clash against Major League Baseball.</p>



<p>The spat came around the naming convention ‘World Series’, which the baseball folks determined was theirs and theirs alone, as a result of their lengthy history with competitions like the World Series, College World Series, and World Series 200. Activision <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=90906257&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">relented and dropped</a> the World Series of Warzone in the blink of an eye.</p>







<h2 id="h-world-series-of-warzone-is-no-more">World Series of Warzone is No More</h2>



<p>The World Series of Warzone was running for several years before being dropped by Activision. It was the <strong>biggest and most valuable </strong>tournament ecosystem in the Warzone space, accommodating thousands of battle royale fans every year. It was already confirmed that it wouldn’t be a thing this year, with Activision introducing things like the Warzone Resurgence Series instead.</p>



<p>Thanks to a scoop from Stephen Totilo <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/world-series-of-warzone-mlb-trademark-gta-vice-city-stories-sales?hide_intro_popup=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at Game File</a>, we now know why.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On Monday, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (aka the leadership team that runs MLB) officially filed a notice with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to oppose Activision’s long-running attempt to trademark the term “World Series of Warzone.”</p>



<p>That same day, Activision gave up, filing an express notice to the USPTO that&nbsp;it would abandon&nbsp;the trademark.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To avoid any confusion, the folks at Major League Baseball opposed the legitimization of the World Series of Warzone via the trademark office. But it didn’t end there.</p>



<p>The commissioner of the MLB also has an issue with the use of the term ‘zone’ in ‘War<strong>zone</strong>‘, given the connotations it has with baseball and how the term surfaces in many ways in the sport.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>extremely unlikely </strong>they’ll get anyone to budge on that front. It’s like the Fine Brothers trying to trademark ‘React’ to stop YouTube creators aping their grind.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Welcome to March! This coming week is <strong>really </strong>special, because it will mark the arrival of the 1000th NYT Connections puzzle!

<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why.

<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is, as we still know, coming out in November 2026. This has been reiterated numerous times by Take-Two and Rockstar Games since the original release date was pushed back <strong>for the second time</strong>. It has been a painful wait, but as far as we know, we’re getting ever closer… For now.</p>



<p>Recently, it was noted that a fresh wave of Grand Theft Auto 6 ‘title IDs’ was added to the PlayStation database, which could indicate that pre-orders are about to start rolling.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-could-be-priced-up-soon">GTA 6 Could Be Priced Up Soon</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, PlayStation Game Size revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">GTA 6</a> title IDs have surfaced in the PlayStation back-end. This is usually one of the last steps before pre-orders open up for a game, but there’s no hard and fast rule as to <strong>how long it takes </strong>between the IDs being listed and the prices and pre-order packages being confirmed.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Grand Theft Auto VI title IDs have been added to the PlayStation database.  </p><p>I expect we’ll see something about the game soon, probably the start of pre-orders. <a href="https://t.co/PBda1Jvr5p">pic.twitter.com/PBda1Jvr5p</a></p></div>— PlayStation Game Size (@PlaystationSize) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaystationSize/status/2027951263602626570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>But this puts us one step closer to knowing how much GTA 6 will cost and what the pre-order bonuses for the game will be.</p>



<p>Recently, a digital storefront listed GTA 6 with a placeholder price of as much as $120, prompting concern from fans worldwide. We still have no idea how much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rockstar-games/" id="1648">Rockstar Games’</a> latest open-world epic will cost, and it’s a wildfire point of contention.</p>



<p>PlayStation Game Size addressed in a comment how long it might be before we see pre-orders go live:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To be honest, it completely depends on the publisher, and it’s not something I know for sure. </p>



<p>But I don’t think there’s going to be a long wait.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA 6 pre-order listings would represent a critical last step before a concrete launch. As they’d be digital, they’d reveal the game’s final price point, as well as what users <strong>receive </strong>for pre-ordering the game. It’ll be in-game items of some kind, but at this point, the bonuses are 100% based on conjecture.</p>







<p>Will you pre-order GTA 6 as soon as the listing becomes available? Let us know what you’re planning on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
