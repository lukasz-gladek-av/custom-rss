<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 has already set a world record, thanks to Xbox, helicopters, and a gigantic TV screen.</p>



<p>Releasing on October 21st, the newest entry in the Ninja Gaiden franchise is shaping up to be quite the title. With the help of PlatinumGames and Xbox, Team Ninja finally made <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new mainline entry</a> after almost thirteen years. The game, which features two protagonists, Ryu and newcomer Yakumo, plans to bring the epic 3D fights to the new generation. Luckily, thanks to Xbox and a few outliers, the title is already setting a pretty impressive world record.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQje3P-QW58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a video released by Xbox</a>, a world record attempt was made for the largest helicopter video game display flown in Miami Beach, Florida. With the help of Team Ninja’s community manager, Emmanuel “Master” Rodriguez, and rapper Swae Lee, they played Ninja Gaiden 4 in a helicopter. The 26-foot wide display was being flown by another helicopter piloted by Heli-D. It took place 20 m² (215 ft² 40 in²) in the air. Luckily, Guinness World Records bestowed Team Ninja and Xbox <a href="https://x.com/GWR/status/1980266739947499719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with the world record</a>.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4, set to launch on Xbox Game Pass, has shown a lot since it’s February reveal. With previews of the title calling it a return to form, fans may be in for quite the treat. While the world record isn’t for it’s sales or gameplay feats, it doesn’t make it any less impressive. On that note, Xbox also has a first-party title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-outer-worlds-2-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, releasing next week, making for two major titles for the company in October. Plus, both are playable on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asus ROG Xbox Ally</a>, so you can enjoy them on the go whereever you are.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Minnesota Rokkr in the Call of Duty League has rebranded as G2 Berlin, unveiling the brand in a short trailer posted on social media earlier today. This is the latest in a long line of rebrands that have shaken up the face of the CDL in recent months.</p>



<p>The pretty bizarre trailer revealed the G2 Berlin name but confirmed that the team will remain tied to Wisconsin. Per the team’s social bio, G2 Berlin is the home of G2 Esports in the Call of Duty space.</p>



<h2 id="h-enter-g2-berlin">Enter G2 Berlin</h2>



<p>Minnesota Rokkr’s rebrand is the latest to hit the CDL space in the last few months. We recently saw the Vegas Falcons rebrand to the Riyadh Falcons in recognition of the team’s ownership, and then Atlanta FaZe became <strong>FaZe Vegas</strong>, filling the slot.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Some teams have yet to reveal their rebrand, such as the LA Guerrillas M8, which is <strong>believed </strong>to be relocating to Paris for the 2026 CDL season. It has been rumored that a Paris Major will surface late into the new season, taking place just before the Call of Duty League Championship, set to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-champs-2026-hosted-faze-las-vegas/">hosted in Las Vegas by FaZe</a>.</p>



<p>It has been a wild off-season when it comes to ‘rostermania’. We saw aBeZy and Simp split for the first time in <strong>years</strong>, with the former sticking with FaZe while the latter took off to join a super team in LA Thieves. The LA Thieves now goes into the 2026 season with HyDra, Kenny, Scrap, and aBeZy on the roster.</p>



<p>FaZe, on the other hand, boasts Drazah, Simp, 04, and Abuzah, the latter two being young and hungry superstar competitors from Vancouver Surge who had a white-hot run through the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Cellium <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cellium-parts-ways-faze-seven-years-org/">also split from FaZe</a>, finding a home in the Riyadh Falcons.</p>



<p>What team do you think will rebrand next? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Could Launch a Week Early, It’s Suggested]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-could-launch-a-week-early-it%E2%80%99s-suggested.1329820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In social circles, rumors are being passed around that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <strong>could be released a week early</strong>. It’s set to drop on November 14, but if the suggestions are true, it could launch around November 7. Before getting into this one, it must be stressed that Activision has said <strong>nothing </strong>about this and it’s based on some loose claims at present.</p>



<p>It doesn’t mean a whole lot if Black Ops 7 is released early. It wouldn’t be the first game to do it and it certainly won’t be the last, but it does mean that fans don’t have to wait <strong>as long </strong>to sink their teeth into it.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-7-coming-out-early">Is Black Ops 7 Coming Out Early?</h2>



<p>Black Ops 7 could be coming out early, if online claims are to be believed.</p>



<p>On social media, some prominent profiles have propagated the rumors, with some suggesting that evidence is leaning towards the earlier launch window for Black Ops 7, set to be released otherwise on November 14.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seems like there’s some evidence of a potential release date change for Black Ops 7 where it could move up a week. Not sure I buy it yet but would be a pleasant surprise if it happens.</p>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1980279695112319158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>It’s looser than loose right now and nothing is concrete until Activision confirms it. We’re not able to corroborate the rumors, either.</p>



<p>Some have suggested on social media that the game’s campaign should drop a week early, which it has done in the past, to allow users to get the single-player portion of the game finished before tackling multiplayer a week later.</p>



<p>Recently, the Black Ops 7 beta kicked off and had some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-beta-cheaters-disrupted/">issues with cheaters</a>, which were reportedly ironed out quickly enough by Activision, with Team RICOCHET stressing how successful the game’s anti-cheat measures were during the beta periods.</p>



<p>In other news, Glen Schofield, co-founder of Sledgehammer Games, suggested that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-call-of-duty-director-says-none-of-the-games-have-been-very-good-since-he-left/">quality of Call of Duty games</a> has dropped since he stopped making them years ago.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-made-the-xbox-ally-x-1000-not-microsoft.1329781/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X (and Ally) have just been released, and they’re turning heads on account of a) their processing power and capabilities, and b) their eye-watering price tags. The Xbox Ally X will break the bank at $1,000, which is a huge hurdle for adoption. In a recent interview, Xbox’s president revealed that Microsoft didn’t have any guidance when it comes to pricing.</p>



<p>It was stated that the Xbox Ally X at $1,000 and the Xbox Ally at $599 came straight from the head honchos and market analysts at ASUS, and neither Xbox nor Microsoft had a say in the price tag.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-is-why-the-xbox-ally-x-is-so-expensive">This is Why The Xbox Ally X is So Expensive</h2>



<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a phenomenal piece of equipment, offering cutting-edge handheld capabilities on a device that’s comfort redefined. It has a great battery life, neat cooling solutions, room for expansion, and a splash of RGB, all packaged alongside tactile buttons, a high-quality and durable screen, and punchy speakers.</p>



<p>That was all summed up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our review</a>, anyway.</p>



<p>What the Xbox Ally X also has is a $1,000 price tag, which is enough to put off first-time buyers. In a recent interview <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Variety</a>, Sarah Bond, the President of Xbox, confirmed that Microsoft had no input whne it came to pricing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware. That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the staggering price point, Bond revealed that the Xbox Store sold out ‘really quickly’ and suggested that the value that’s being given to gamers for the price is more than worthwhile.</p>



<p>But she has to say that, right?</p>



<p>Bond used the current line of Xbox marketing spiel to further promote the Xbox Ally X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It should be something you can have with you anywhere. You should be able to play any game you want with anyone you want on any device.</p>



<p>We want to make sure that people have a choice.</p>



<p>We want to make sure there’s an option for the power players who want the latest innovations, that want to push the edge of what’s possible, the most demanding players. And then, if someone is looking for PC gaming on the go, they’re a casual gamer, they’re a gaming enthusiast, then there’s Xbox Allys for them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think the pricing point for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is fair, or are you waiting for a price cut before you make that investment? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
