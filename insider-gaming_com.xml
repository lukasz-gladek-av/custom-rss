            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A huge dataleak has struck the world of Pokémon, revealing huge details about upcoming titles and the long-awaited arrival of Gen 10, said to be titled Wind &amp; Waves.</p>



<p>A series of leaks have dropped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details about Gen 10</a>, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap for future titles and DLC</a>, and teases the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMO mechanics in the next era</a> of the franchise.</p>



<p>Keeping on top of all the leaks is practically impossible, but we’ve made it easier for you to track everything revealed about Pokémon Gen 10, Wind &amp; Waves, in this guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-we-know-about-pokemon-wind-amp-waves">Everything We Know About Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-game-location">Game Location</h3>



<p>Pokémon’s tenth generation will return to the Asian continent, having ventured to Europe and Hawaii in recent years, with the islands of Indonesia and Southeast Asia serving as the location.</p>



<p>The island locations will certainly be reminiscent of Sun &amp; Moon, based on Hawaii, and these rumours have been circulating for some time, though it was previously indicated that it would be based on the Greek islands. That appears not to be the case, however, with Indonesia and surrounding nations set to star.</p>



<h3 id="h-seed-pokemon">Seed Pokémon</h3>



<p>Seed <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> will reportedly be introduced in Pokémon Gen 10, with a particularly unique mechanic. According to datamines, the evolution of the Seed Pokémon will be based on the unique island you discover (more on that later), meaning your evolved form will feature unique patterns and colors.</p>



<p>There has been some confusion, however, as the Japanese use of ‘Seed’ for Pokémon description is also used in the TCG to describe ‘Basic’ Pokémon, so it may be that this Pokémon is ‘Basic’ and not ‘Seed’. However, the evolution mechanics seem to stand.</p>



<h3 id="h-underwater-exploration">Underwater Exploration</h3>



<p>Underwater exploration, not seen since the Hoenn games, is returning for Gen 10 and is said to be a huge feature, with datamined images showing a player riding on the back of Lumineon. Footage leaked from the graphics engine suggests it will have free exploration, not just available on designated routes.</p>



<h3 id="h-riding-amp-petting-mechanics">Riding &amp; Petting Mechanics</h3>



<p>Pokémon games have had riding mechanics in the past, notably with Pokémon Legends: Arceus having various mounts with different uses, but Gen 10 is seemingly set to take that to the next level with mechanics that make every Pokémon rideable, or pettable—likely depending on their size.</p>



<p>It’s noted that these details were in the planning document from 2020, so the feature may have been adjusted or removed entirely during development.</p>



<h3 id="h-model-redesigns">Model Redesigns</h3>



<p>It’s not surprising to see Pokémon getting model redesigns in new eras of the franchise, and it seems it’s happening once again for Gen 10 as images showing several images comparing Pokémon to their new forms and older models have been shared.</p>



<p>Pikachu, Charizard, Lumineon, and Machamp are all explicity stated as receiving new models for Gen 10, though it’s likely all Pokémon will be adjusted to fit the new era.</p>



<h3 id="h-mmo-features">MMO Features</h3>



<p>MMO features are set to be introduced in Gen 10, the leaks state, with a mix of open-world and MMO elements. Though not confirmed, this sounds like exploration areas will be limited to parties and groups, while main areas, acting as hubs, will have players across the world joined together.</p>



<p>The features are seemingly going to serve as a soft-launch ahead of being expanded in the Pokémon Seed project, a game that joins several regions together including Hoenn and Sinnoh. A similar approach has been seen in the past, with large open-world areas introduced in Legends: Arceus, which occurred before the huge open-world map seen in Scarlet &amp; Violet.</p>

<h3 id="h-release-window">Release Window</h3>



<p>As expected, Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves, the tenth generation, will launch in 2026, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the franchise. This would come four years after the release of Scarlet &amp; Violet, slightly longer than the standard three-year gap we’ve seen in the past.</p>



<p>These plans have seemingly been updated; however, as documents initially stated Gen 10 was planned to release in 2025, likely as a big lure alongside the Switch 2 launch, with Legends: Z-A launching in 2024. That is not the case, however, as we know.</p>



<h3 id="h-procedural-generation">Procedural Generation</h3>



<p>Procedural generation is reportedly going to be a huge feature in Gen 10, with islands generated randomly for you to explore. If you like what you find, you’ll be able to share an island with your friends.</p>



<p>It’s not known whether you can save islands permanently and have them serve as a ‘base,’ or if they’ll merely be for exploration and catching new Pokémon. </p>



<h3 id="h-switch-2-exclusive">Switch 2 Exclusive</h3>



<p>Unsurprisingly, it has been confirmed that Gen 10 of Pokémon, Wind &amp; Waves, will be exclusive to Switch 2 and won’t be available on the original console, unlike Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A is likely to be the final Pokémon title released onto the original Switch console, with Pokopia arriving next year and confirmed to be a Switch 2 exclusive. </p>



<h3 id="h-sustainable-development-goals">Sustainable Development Goals</h3>



<p>Similar to Scarlet &amp; Violet, there will be a group of objectives rather than just the standard gym badges, with the theme said to be inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<p>In total, there are 18 challenges, one for each type, and completing them all allows you to challenge the champion. However, if you want to, you can skip this whole stage entirely and head straight to the final boss as soon as open-water exploration in the game is unlocked.</p>



<h3 id="h-characters">Characters</h3>



<p>Descriptions for several characters have been unearthed, including the protagonist, a child whose mother wins a lottery and a vacation to the region. A sibling is also mentioned, with their development playing a key part in the story, and there’s the customary friend/rival to challenge you along the way.</p>



<p>The antagonist is said to be the chairman of a group of hotels, who initially planned to build resorts where humans and Pokémon could co-exist. However, an accident led to the loss of a child, changing his views. There’s also a younger sibling to that child who survived and is described as “naive” about the world.</p>



<p>The role of the evil team is taken by a Land Development Team, who destroy nature to expand land for profit, likely working for the hotel chairman. Finally, the professor is younger than we usually see in the franchise, age 21, and is known as the “Survival Professor,” with survival skills being a core strength.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Creator Doubles Down on Who Dropped The First Nuke]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-creator-double-down-first-nuke-drop/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-creator-doubles-down-on-who-dropped-the-first-nuke.1324096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In 2023, Fallout’s creator, Tim Cain, uploaded a video explaining <strong>which country </strong>dropped the first nukes in the Fallout universe. It was revealed that it was <strong>China </strong>that fired first, which put to rest the assumptions made by many over the game’s twenty-plus-year history.</p>



<p>Now, in an all-new video, Tim Cain has doubled down on his confirmation, explaining in more depth <strong>why </strong>China fired first. It’s lore that is mostly understood by die-hard fans, but it’s always nice to get a little more of a backstory for a universe so expansive and densely populated as Fallout’s.</p>



<h2 id="h-china-fired-first">China Fired First</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-first-nukes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Two years ago</a>, Tim Cain confirmed that China dropped the first nuke in Fallout, kicking off the Great War and bringing about the destruction of the entire planet:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The reason we got nuked is: bio-weapons were illegal and somehow China found out we were doing FEV. And they were like, ‘You have to stop it.’ And we went, ‘Okay’. But all we did is move it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a new video, Cain once again touched on the topic and went into more depth about why China dropped the first wave of nukes on the United States:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>China nuked first.</p>



<p>It’s pretty obvious from the game. This isn’t canon, but let me explain what I mean and why we thought that. </p>



<p>In the original game we had established that the US was doing bio-weapons research. We weren’t supposed to, we had signed a UN treaty saying we wouldn’t do that, and I think you can find that out in the game. China discovered that we were doing it, but how did they discover that? </p>



<p>Espionage. </p>



<p>We went, ‘Oops our bad we’ll stop doing it. But we just kept on doing it, we just moved the research to another base. It’s the hidden base where you discover ZAX the supercomputer.</p>



<p>They just nuked us. We nuked back, other countries nuked, because all anyone saw was missiles flying. China technically started it by firing the first nuke, but you could argue that technically the US started it by doing illegal bio-weapons research then lying about it multiple times.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>It’s an expansion on what we already knew, but Fallout fans <strong>love </strong>this kind of lore, so they’ll eat it up (myself included).</p>



<p>In the video, Tim Cain goes on to talk about Fallout-themed tidbits, such as why Vault Suits look the way they do, and how some brands wound up being implemented in the universe. It’s a treasure trove for the game’s biggest fans, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>If you’re planning on booting up Battlefield 6 with a Cronus Zen attached, there’s bad news waiting for you. In a series of posts on social media, it has been revealed that users are receiving account suspensions from Electronic Arts when trying to play Battlefield 6 using a Cronus Zen, an infamous piece of technology mostly used by malicious operators in games.</p>



<p>An image uploaded to social media showed that<strong> </strong>Electronic Arts is <strong>permanently blocking access </strong>to Battlefield 6 for those found to be using a Cronus Zen in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-won-t-prosper">You Won’t Prosper</h2>



<p>The Cronus Zen input device has long been the face of controversy in the gaming world, simply because it offers malicious advantages to those using it. It can massively reduce recoil, aid with accuracy, and introduce macros that users can lean on to gain an upper hand over their opponents, and it works on both PC and console platforms.</p>



<p>In a string of posts on social media, users started sharing images of bans after trying to boot Battlefield 6 with a Cronus Zen engaged:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The discourse has proven that both console and PC platforms are being impacted by these punitive actions, which have been met with jubilation from fans worldwide. In one post, a user wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Cronus</strong> Zen community is losing their minds and getting banned on <strong>Battlefield</strong> 6 lmao. How about play the game how it was intended to be played and have fun?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stated that the ‘lead programmer’ for the Cronus lineup has mentioned how the device is ‘cooked’ for Battlefield 6, and that the team has advised users <span><strong>not to</strong></span><strong> </strong>use their Cronus Zen when playing the all-new FPS title.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a huge win for Electronic Arts? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-matches-beta-cheaters-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-beta-matches-were-%E2%80%98nearly-99-%E2%80%99-cheater-free.1324084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on social media, Activision’s Team RICOCHET has highlighted that ‘nearly 99%’ of matches in the Black Ops 7 beta were free of cheaters. This statistic has already been met with criticism, with many users claiming that they had cheaters or other malicious operators in their matches during the open beta.</p>



<p>Team RICOCHET has remained positive, emphasizing continuous improvements, and the median time to identify cheaters has been reduced to ‘under three matches’. What’s not clear is how many matches that 1% represents. Is it 1000 matches, or 100,000 matches?</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-still-won-t-be-free-of-cheaters">Black Ops 7 Still Won’t Be Free of Cheaters</h2>



<p>It’s impossible to rid Black Ops 7 of cheaters entirely, as with each new improvement made by Team RICOCHET, the world’s cheat manufacturers respond with their own evolutions. It’s a never-ending battle that can only <span><strong>improve&nbsp;</strong>and will never be entirely resolved</span>.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1977766811916746869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent post</a> on social media, Team RICOCHET stressed those improvements:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve crunched the numbers for Black Ops 7 Beta, and RICOCHET Anti-Cheat achieved the strongest Beta results in Call of Duty history. </p>



<p>Each&nbsp;day, our cheat detections got faster and your matches got cleaner. </p>



<p>By the end:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nearly 99% of matches were cheater-free</li>



<li>The median detection time for cheaters was three matches.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Clips still surfaced online of cheaters ruining the fun for legitimate players worldwide, but Activision was quick to stamp these out and point out that the wrongdoers had been forcefully removed from the Call of Duty platform.</p>



<p>In recent years, Call of Duty has suffered immeasurably under the weight of cheaters, especially in modes like the game’s ranked play platforms. It’s a gruelling place to try and enjoy yourself, and it always seems like it ebbs and flows quite dramatically.</p>



<p>This year, the hope for Call of Duty players is that Team RICOCHET is in the best place possible and that foul cheaters worldwide have their attentions fixed elsewhere, such as on the recent release of Battlefield or the upcoming 1.0 launch of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>I’m not wishing ill will on those games, but the diversification might help spread the cheaters across a wider base rather than having them all focus on one game.</p>



<p>Will it be enough to propel Black Ops 7 into a better space when it’s released next month? Let me know what you think on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Jurassic World Evolution 3 Have Early Access?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-early-access.1324075/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is right around the corner, but is there early access so you can play even sooner than that normal release date?</p>



<p>Looking at the calendar will fill sandbox fans with joy that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date is nearly here</a>, but sometimes, the super fans will do all they can to get their hands on a game as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Here is the answer to whether or not Jurassic World Evolution 3 has early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-jurassic-world-evolution-3-in-early-access">Can You Play Jurassic World Evolution 3 in Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can you guys see any early access up there? Image via Frontier</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access available for Jurassic World Evolution 3. Everyone will have access to the game on October 21 at 10 AM ET.</strong></p>



<p>Life may find a way, but early access did not find a way to follow <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> to release. The sandbox and park simulation game will have you building up your own Jurassic World amusement park, which has always gone well for people in the movies, right? Whether that is on PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X, you will have to wait until the 21st to get your dino fix in.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a video game release will work in a three-day early access release for players who purchase a deluxe edition, but that is not included this time around. Instead, all you get for the extra $15 spent on the deluxe is four additional family units and some bonus skins and scenery. Whether or not that is worth it is completely up to your tastes.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-jurassic-world-evolution-3-have-a-playable-demo">Does Jurassic World Evolution 3 Have a Playable Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, no, there is not a playable demo available for Jurassic World Evolution 3 either. Your only chance to play the game is to buy it outright.</strong></p>



<p>With this being the third game, you could maybe find the previous two games for cheap to see if you like it before spending the full price tag on <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>. That, or if you are an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, you can play the second game with your subscription.</p>



<p>When it comes to demos, many games these days avoid offering them to players. The thinking for that is, while it could be exciting for some players to give the game a try and fall in love with it, others may be turned off, and then the developer and publisher wouldn’t get any money out of the deal. It sucks, but that is where we are in gaming.</p>

If you are curious if one of your favorite critics or content creators is covering the game, you should consider checking their social media accounts. Many have already posted that they are playing the game early and will be working on a review when the time comes.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-review-scores-prediction">The Outer Worlds 2 Review Scores Prediction</h2>



<p><strong>Given that the game is a direct sequel and will do many of the same things that the original did, but expanded, you can probably expect The Outer Worlds 2 to have a similar review score to the first game. Somewhere between 83-87 makes sense for this kind of game.</strong></p>



<p>The first Outer Worlds game sits at 85 on MetaCritic, with the remastered Spacer’s Choice at 72 because of performance issues and not really bettering the experience in any way. Unless the sequel is absolutely mired in bugs and glitches, it shouldn’t fare too poorly with critics.</p>



<p>To some who are thinking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-outer-worlds-2-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> might be their most anticipated game of 2025, an 85 might seem low. Of course, we haven’t played the game yet to know for sure, but that is actually a very good score for any game release, let alone an RPG. That being said, if you are expecting the game to contend with other top games this year that reach well into the 90s, you might come away disappointed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Obsidian Entertainment</a> is a brilliant development studio with tons of talent and a great back catalog of games, they’ve never been one to have a game score 90 on MetaCritic outside of Pentiment, which was a shock to just about everyone. We’re willing to be surprised, but don’t expect it.</p>
