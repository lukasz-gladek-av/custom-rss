            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Unless you’ve been hiding away under a rock somewhere, you’ll likely have heard about the ongoing debate regarding ARC Raiders and Embark Studios’ use of AI to create dynamic voices in the game. It warranted one particular outlet to give the game a shockingly low score, prompting the game’s Metacritic rating to tank by a couple of points.</p>



<p>In a bid to defend the game, Nexon’s CEO Junghun Lee has taken to the airwaves to suggest that more developers are using AI than you realize. He directly suggested that ‘every game company’ is using AI in some capacity, and that the ‘AI voice debate’ in the ARC Raiders world is a non-starter.</p>







<h2 id="h-should-we-ignore-the-ai-generated-voices-in-arc-raiders">Should We Ignore The AI-Generated Voices in ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p>The presence of AI-generated voices in ARC Raiders is a point of contention for some, but for the majority, it’s not an issue. The game has managed to sell four million copies in a week and has peaked on some platforms with staggering concurrent player counts.</p>



<p>By numbers, <a href="https://loaded.pxf.io/4G1L4L" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-highest-rated-multiplayer-shooter/">highest-rated multiplayer shooter</a> in a decade, and the top-rated extraction shooter <strong>ever made</strong>.</p>



<p>But that hasn’t stopped some from lambasting the post-apocalyptic shooter on socials, striking it down for what seems to be a misunderstood use of generative AI. Embark Studios has been transparent and pointed out that voice actors provided their talents to be replicated by AI and were paid fairly for their work, but that’s not enough to placate some.</p>



<p>Junghun Lee, CEO of Nexon, the parent company of Embark Studios, explained <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in an interview</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI. But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness.</p>



<p>AI has definitely improved efficiency in both game production and live service operations.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Using AI allows Embark Studios to bring this game to the market and float it with updates that are delivered faster and more cost-effectively. The team also uses machine learning algorithms to encourage dynamic animations of the game’s ARC enemies, but it’s the AI voices that most people have issues with, as it walks a blurry line that many are reluctant to accept as becoming the de facto standard.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s anything to be concerned about regarding Embark Studios’ reliance on AI for voice lines? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to several gaming insiders, Ubisoft is currently working on a new multiplayer shooter. Furthermore, some concept art and even an in-progress screenshot of the game have been shown.</p>







<p>Ubisoft has had a fair share of shooters over the past 40 years. From the iconic Tom Clancy series to the wild Far Cry franchise, it’s served up quite a few good ones. Still, the company has only managed one success in the multiplayer FPS world: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege</a>. With many companies like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-fy25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation/Bungie</a> and EA getting in on the trend, a supposed leak teases that Ubisoft wants in. Now, we may know what that vision the team is shooting for may look like, and it’s literally out of this world.</p>



<h2 id="h-project-scout-an-fps-sci-fi-competitive-shooter-from-ubisoft-possibly-leaked">Project Scout, An FPS Sci-Fi Competitive Shooter from Ubisoft, Possibly Leaked</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Twitter/X leaker Shiny <a href="https://x.com/Shiiny77/status/1988305728784744488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted a message</a> surrounding a new multiplayer title from Ubisoft. The FPS, supposedly made in <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>, takes place in <strong>a sci-fi world</strong>. It would include <strong>competitive multiplayer</strong>, including <strong>crossplay</strong>, and be on <strong>a larger scale</strong> than other titles. </p>



<p>Later on, user 6leaks furthered Shiny’s claim, <a href="https://x.com/6leaksgg/status/1988397275266334782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posting screenshots of the title</a>, known as <strong>Project Scout</strong>. The images, seen above, show what appears to be a loading screen with concept art and an in-game screenshot with developing assets and the game’s UI. We can also see one of the characters on the bottom left, as well as some interesting interface systems like a compass and ‘crew level’.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>Ubisoft has not confirmed Project Scout or any new multiplayer game</strong>, so <strong>take the news with a grain of salt</strong>. We have reached out to Ubisoft to confirm and will update if and when we get a response. Regardless, the concept does look pretty cool, and it’ll be interesting to see, if true, how the core gameplay will work. </p>







<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s Project Scout? Do you think it’s real? Do you want it to be? Think it can make another multiplayer shooter and succeed? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>PlayStation is entering the gaming monitor market with its very own PC monitor.</p>



<p>Announced at the end of Tuesday’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-november-2025-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play Japan showcase</a>, the PlayStation Gaming Monitor is the first of its kind under the PlayStation brand. It’s also designed for use with both the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and PC.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-gaming-monitor-s-features">What Are The Gaming Monitor’s Features?</h2>



<p>The PlayStation gaming monitor—not to be confused with Sony’s INZONE brand—comes in at 27″ with a Quad High Definition (QHD) IPS display at a max 2K (2560 x 1440p) resolution. It also includes High Dynamic Range (HDR) support with Auto HDR Tone Mapping. For refresh rates, the monitor supports up to 240 Hz on PC and 120 Hz on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles as well as Variable Refresh Rates (VRR). </p>



<p>One of the more unique features is the built-in charging hook for DualSense and DualSense Edge controllers.</p>







<p>Input wise, it has two HDMI 2.1 inputs and one DisplayPort 1.4 input. There are also two USB-A ports and one USB-C port. Lastly, the monitor has a built-in speaker and 3.5mm audio output while also being VESA compatible for mounting. </p>



<p>The PlayStation gaming monitor will launch sometime in 2026 though no sepecific date or price was confirmed. What was announced, however, was that it will only be available in the United States and Japan.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up the PlayStation gaming monitor whenever it releases? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re at the midway point of the week and raring to go with another NYT Connections puzzle. Below, I’ve provided the top NYT Connections hints and solutions you’ll need to smash today’s challenge. How’s your week going? Let me know in the comments if you’ve been playing any other puzzling games and what you might like to see more hints for!</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections answers you’re looking for. Today’s puzzle is a little bizarre as it features <strong>exclusively </strong>four-letter words. You’ll see what I mean below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-12">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 12)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #885:</p>



<ul>
<li>YOLO</li>



<li>POLO</li>



<li>LOCO</li>



<li>DODO</li>



<li>COMO</li>



<li>FOMO</li>



<li>JUDO</li>



<li>BOGO</li>



<li>BOZO</li>



<li>ROJO</li>



<li>YO-YO</li>



<li>SUMO</li>



<li>POCO</li>



<li>DOPE</li>



<li>GOLF</li>



<li>GOAT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>These all involve physical competition, but not your everyday gym workout.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Terms for someone who’s not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>Internet-born abbreviations that pack a punch.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>You might hear these in Madrid or Mexico City.</em></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 12.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-12-885">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 12 (#885)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– GOLF, JUDO, POLO, SUMO</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BOZO, DODO, DOPE, YO-YO</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOGO, FOMO, GOAT, YOLO</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COMO, LOCO, POCO, ROJO</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
