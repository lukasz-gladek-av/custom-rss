<p>On Thursday, February 27, The Pokemon Company held its Pokemon Presents event for February 2025. The event coincides with Pokemon Day, a day to honor the original Japanese release of Pokemon Red and Green on February 27, 1996. </p>



<p>While nothing was confirmed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for the event</a>, it should be expected that players will get a new look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A, Pokemon Go, Pokemon TCG Pocket, and, possibly, a look at Pokemon gameplay running on Nintendo Switch 2. There is also speculation of a remake of Pokemon Black and White in the works along with the next games in the “Let’s Go” series.</p>



<p>Follow along as everything is announced. Because this is a running article throughout the show, make sure you refresh starting at 9am ET/2pm GMT for everything announced.</p>



<p>And be sure to let us know your thoughts on the showcase in the comments or join the discussion further in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. It’s worth noting that everything is in the order it was shown.</p>
