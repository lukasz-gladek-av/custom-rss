            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The thought-lost Hytale project has arisen. Hypixel Studios has resumed work on the upcoming sandbox game, and it’s drawing plenty of comparisons to Minecraft. If you’re unsure of what the game is and why people are so excited, this guide has a full explainer for you.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was officially canceled</a> in mid-2025 after 10 years of development. The title’s complexity was deemed one of the main factors in the game (and Hypel Studios) closure. There were also suggestions that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-hytale-dev-says-issues-were-all-internal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘issues were all internal’</a>. </p>



<p>However, merely months later, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was brought back to life</a> by founder, Simon Collins-Laflamme. </p>







<p>Here we are in late 2025 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale about to enter early access</a>, and many still don’t know what it is.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-hytale">What Is Hytale?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do and explore. Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale is a sandbox game that allows you to create, build, and explore a procedurally generated world.</strong></p>



<p>From its blocky art style to the ability to uncover and unearth your innermost building skills, Hytale bears resemblance to another popular sandbox game (more on this later), but has more than enough of its own nuances to stand out.</p>







<p>Hytale was initially devised as a Hypixel server in Minecraft. After the spin-off server’s revenue potential was stunted by Mojang-enforced EULA changes in 2014, the idea was coined to make Hytale a standalone game.</p>



<p>Here’s how the official Hytale website describes the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Hytale blends the freedom of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block. Our Early Access release focuses on polished core systems – exploration, responsive combat, and robust building – alongside creator‑first tools for making your own content, crafting minigames, and running community servers.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-an-mmo">Is Hytale An MMO?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hytale is described as an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) game as players will be able to interact and share the same game space in servers.</strong></p>



<p>In the developer’s words: “Why not invite a friend or two to share the experience and leave a mark on the world together?”</p>



<p>The game features player-run servers and encourages the Hytale community to bond and come together. It’s unclear how many people can be in one server at a time, but make no mistake that the MMO aspect is real.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-like-minecraft">Is Hytale Like Minecraft?</h2>



<p><strong>Despite being developed as a Minecraft server within Minecraft, meaning it is like the game, to an extent, Hytale is its own game, and doesn’t claim to be like Minecraft.</strong></p>



<p>The Minecraft comparison feels obvious at first glance. However, once you watch the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-coming-soonand-shows-off-16-minutes-of-minecraft-like-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale gameplay</a> and understand the devs’ vision, it might be more appropriate to describe it as ‘the <em>next </em>Minecraft.’</p>



<p>An emphasis on variety with creation tools, mini-games, and the encouragement to share worlds and have players in your server is a big part of Hytale’s identity. The combat is more extensive, and it leans further into RPG elements.</p>



<p>You should check out a 16-minute gameplay trailer to see it for yourself.</p>

<p>You better believe that Hytale will be very popular once it hits early access. We’ve not got there yet, and announcements have already revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-reveals-plans-for-proximity-chat-multiplayer-portals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans for proximity chat and Multiplayer ‘Portals’</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Palworld’s Ultrakill crossover finally has a release date, and the update is scheduled to arrive on December 17, 2025. </p>



<p>Pocketpair announced Palworld’s crossover with the fast-paced, ultraviolent retro FPS, Ultrakill, back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-next-crossover-is-with-ultrakill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2025</a>; however, at the time, we were only told that players would be able to experience iconic weapons from the FPS. Now, a new trailer reveals all the content the crossover entails, along with a tease for update 1.0.</p>



<h2 id="h-home-sweet-home-update-as-ultrakill-collab-along-with-new-base-customization-options">Home Sweet Home Update as Ultrakill Collab Along with New Base Customization Options</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8ey7cKfYo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> kicks off with an Ultrakill character showcasing all the latest weapons players can use in Palworld with the upcoming update. A few of these weapons have shots that can change their trajectories mid-travel to hit their targets, and some have explosive capabilities as well. Some weapons also have the ability to deflect some attacks right back at the Pals with the help of coins. The Home Sweet Home update will also add the ability to colour your bases, along with the new customization option. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="New Trailer for Palworld's December &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; Update!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rq8ey7cKfYo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That’s not all: towards the end of the trailer, we cut to a black screen, with the music and theme completely changing. For a split second, we see a humongous Pal’s silhouette intimidating the characters in the area before the trailer ends with the words, “Palworld 1.0 -2026”. For those unaware, the release of Palworld 1.0 will mark the game’s exit from early access, and its release window was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this year. </p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s patent in the Palworld dispute is being reexamined by the USPTO. Additionally, an anti-Palworld patent was recently rejected in Japan.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-suffers-worst-launch-in-20-year-history/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-suffers-worst-japan-launch-in-20-year-franchise-history.1362724/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It wasn’t beyond the realms of possibility for Black Ops 7 to struggle in 2025. The shooter market is fierce, and the impact of rival franchises seems to have hit Black Ops 7 hard, as it’s recorded the worst Japanese retail launch sales ever in the series.</p>



<p>The poor reception to Modern Warfare 3 didn’t stop Black Ops 6 from bringing the franchise back with a bang. It was a tough task for Black Ops 7 to repeat this success, and early gameplay footage and trailers didn’t do much for the game’s hopes. The realisation hit home hard when it was reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sales-are-down-50-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 sales were down 50% in Europe</a>.</p>



<p>Japan’s Black Ops 7 sales have hit a new low.</p>







<h2 id="h-lowest-call-of-duty-retail-sales-in-japanese-history-for-black-ops-7">Lowest Call of Duty Retail Sales In Japanese History For Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time for some soul-searching. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s first week retail launch sales (shown by <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Zuby_Tech</a>) were <strong>12,311</strong>—with the PS4 version reportedly adding to this by allegedly selling under 1,800 copies.</p>







<p>According to a graphic, this is lower than 2007’s Call of Duty 3, which registered 14,117 retail launch units. It doesn’t include the first two Call of Duty titles, but there’s every chance that the result would be the same.</p>



<p>The Japanese market certainly isn’t one of the most popular for Call of Duty games. However, when we’re looking at overall data—factoring in Europe sales again—patterns are emerging across the board. Black Ops 7 isn’t being well-received.</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how Black Ops 7 would have done without competition, but the fact is that Battlefield 6 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-soared-sales-two-days-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> are both doing exceptionally well with sales and player count numbers. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 versus Black Ops 7 player count</a> debate was over in one week.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Interest in Call of Duty is currently as low as it’s been for years. Head to the Insider Gaming Discord Server and share your thoughts on whether this is a wake-up call for Activision or not. What does the company need to do for Call of Duty 2026 to rectify the situation?</p>

<p>Every new update on Stellar Blade seems to suggest that the game has defied all expectations. Now, it’s understood that Stellar Blade has beaten out Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, Marvel’s Spider-Man, and others to be the best-selling PlayStation exclusive on PC.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade news has been coming thick and fast recently. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/">Stellar Blade sequel is confirmed to be in development</a>, and the bombshell was dropped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade is going multiplatform</a>. The original game was a success on launch and continues to escalate in terms of popularity and sales.</p>



<p>Shift Up has revealed a new graphic showing this to be the case.</p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-destroys-other-playstation-exclusives-on-pc">Stellar Blade Destroys Other PlayStation Exclusives On PC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Eve is the Queen. Credit to Stellar Blade</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stellar Blade developer Shift Up showed off an impressive chart showing the biggest PlayStation-exclusive games that have received a PC port.</p>



<p>The graphic (shown by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki</a>) shows the top six games for sales on PC. The data shows Stellar Blade hit a peak of 192,000 concurrent players on Steam at launch, with the next best being 77,000 players for Ghost of Tsushima.</p>







<p>The headline sentence also says: “Best-selling PlayStation-exclusive launch IP in history.”</p>



<p>Based on the numbers, this isn’t just the case; it’s conclusive. We reported a couple of weeks ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuhei-yoshida-absolutely-wanted-stellar-blade-on-playstation-after-playing-it/">Shuhei Yoshida ‘Absolutely Wanted’ Stellar Blade on PlayStation after playing it</a>. PC players eventually got a chance to experience it—which was clearly snapped up!</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Shift Up released a chart showing that Stellar Blade is the best selling PlayStation exclusive single-player PC launch in history!</p><p>– Reached 192k peak concurrent players on Steam at launch<br>– Over 2.5x more than the previous record <a href="https://t.co/BEuNUm9QhB">pic.twitter.com/BEuNUm9QhB</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1992891077335154995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GFA Games has announced that PIONER, an ambitious post-apocalyptic MMO, will launch in early access on December 16, 2025. This date comes mere weeks after a successful beta test, which saw the game skyrocket to over 500,000 wishlists on Steam. The PC-exclusive MMO has been described as a perfect balance between the likes of Fallout, STALKER, and Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>PIONER features a massive open-world environment, stacks of customization options, and an immersive atmosphere that encourages players to prioritize exploration and development over anything else.</p>



<h2 id="h-pioner-hits-early-access-soon">PIONER Hits Early Access Soon</h2>



<p>PIONER, which has been compiled by GFA Games, a studio headquartered in Serbia, is set to be released <strong>in early access </strong>on December 16. This news dropped today, along with a new trailer, which you can see below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PIONER - Together" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZDY7I4VS70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The team at GFA Games also revealed the Deluxe Edition of PIONER, which comes with stacks of digital content:</p>



<ul>
<li>Unique Skin: “Renegade” – a unique, exclusive armor and gear design</li>



<li>Weapon Skin with VFX – a unique weapon skin for the entire AR platform, including AR-12,<br>AR-16, and AR-16 Ifrit</li>



<li>Exclusive Founder Title – a status symbol for social interaction</li>



<li>Premium Currency – 500 Efritanium Crystals</li>



<li>Weapon Accessory: “Creepy Charm” – cosmetic trinket for a weapon</li>



<li>Gadget: “Katana” Watch – inspired by the iconic 80s Japanese watch design; a retro-futuristic style that fits the world of PIONER</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s blurb reveals how much potential this game has:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>PIONER takes players to a vast, atmospheric post-apocalyptic island, where remnants of the Soviet era create an incredible alternate reality. The game emphasizes realism over traditional mechanics, offering an open world of over 50 km2 filled with hidden dungeons, story quests, and faction missions that influence alliances and rewards. As a social-focused MMO, PIONER combines story-driven exploration with intense PvE and PvP gameplay. Players shape the world through their actions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PIONER has an expansive campaign that eases players in with a great tutorial section, and it has grown over several years of development to become something that could stun in early access.</p>
