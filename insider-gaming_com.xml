<p>Pokémon has revealed the first teaser for a special anniversary TCG launching worldwide later this year, featuring reprints of classic cards from over the years.</p>



<p>Showcased during the Pokémon Presents stream celebrating 30 years of the franchise, a first look detailed some of the cards that are set to return.</p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-anniversary-set-revealed">Pokémon TCG Anniversary Set Revealed</h2>



<p>In a teaser trailer, fans were shown a slew of cards, including Charizard from the original base set, Pikachu &amp; Zekrom Tag Team from the Sun &amp; Moon era, along with Lv. X, V, Crystal, and other gimmicks from over the years.</p>

<p>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, the classic Nintendo GameCube title, is coming to Nintendo GameCube classics in March. The announcement was made during the recent Pokémon Presents: 30th Anniversary livestream. No specific date was announced.</p>



<p>The game was originally released in August 2005, and was a console released more in line with the traditional Pokémon RPG games on Nintendo’s handheld consoles at the time. The game also featured the debut of Munchlax and Bonsly. It received mediocre reviews at the time, but plenty of fans are excited to have access to it again.</p>



<p>Pokémon Colosseum, which was released first on GameCube, was not shown during the presentation.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company also recently announced that Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen would be available on Nintendo Switch 2. The titles are available now, bringing those Game Boy Advance classics back to players. </p>



<p>Unlike Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, those games are not available on Nintendo Switch Online. Rather, they are full digital downloads available for $20 per game.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming will provide further news on the game’s release when a release date is announced.

You’ll attract and gather new Pokémon to join your island as you create various habitats to create a world in your vision.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-details-for-pokemon-pokopia">New Details For Pokémon Pokopia</h2>



<p>Three major new details were shared for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a> during the showcase, the first being a brand new Rotom form, DJ Rotom.</p>
