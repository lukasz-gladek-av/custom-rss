<p>Iconic Capcom, PlatinumGames, and now Clovers dev Hideki Kamiya has commented on Resident Evil Requiem’s leaks, which arose after the game’s physical street date was broken by well over a week.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is 2026’s first major AAA game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a>‘s franchise returns to a decimated Raccoon City. The hype has been huge, and the expectations are bigger than a skyscraper made entirely of El Gigantes. Unfortunately, countless buyers were able to get their hands on the game early, and it began a huge wave of Requiem spoilers.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for a game’s physical street date to be broken, resulting in copies of the game being distributed days before launch, but Resident Evil Requiem went out roughly 10 days or more before launch. Leaks were inevitable, and social media was flooded with story spoilers and much more very quickly.</p>

</ul>



<p>Hideki Kamiya has shared his thoughts on the leaks and used a previous experience to summarize his thoughts. Here’s what he said, according to Google Translate:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I remember back with Bio2, the late-game plot twist got totally scooped by some photo weekly mag, right… For your own selfish satisfaction, you’re trampling all over the feelings of users who were looking forward to it, and the feelings of the creators who poured their all into making it—a detestable act that destroys everyone’s happiness and deserves a thousand deaths… May you be cursed to never play games again…</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Kamiya directed Resident Evil 2, the first Devil May Cry, and Bayonetta, and has attached his talents to many other projects. Needless to say, he’s not someone you should want to disrespect.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new leadership team has been announced for the Assassin’s Creed franchise, including a head of brand, a head of content, and a head of production excellence. </p>



<p>Since the announcement of <span>Ubisoft’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank">restructuring</a>&nbsp;and the future of&nbsp;</span>the Assassin’s Creed franchise, fans have been waiting for more clarity on the way forward. We have recently discovered that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two Far Cry games</a> and several Assassin’s Creed titles are currently in development. Additionally, we have been informed about the leadership behind these projects.</p>







<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-franchise-gets-new-trio-as-leadership">Assassin’s Creed Franchise Gets New Trio As Leadership</h2>



<p>Announced through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2025967126498910596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), three seasoned leaders have been revealed to carry forward the Assassin’s Creed Franchise. They will be responsible for driving the Assassin’s Creed brand’s long-term vision, creative ambition, and continued growth. </p>



<p>Martin Schelling will take on the role of Head of the Assassin’s Creed Brand and will focus on the “overall strategy and long-term vision of the brand.” Schelling has a “profound understanding of Assassin’s Creed” thanks to being a part of leadership in games like Revelations, Black Flag, Origins, and Valhalla. Most recently, he served as Ubisoft’s Chief Production Officer. </p>



<p>Then we have Jean Guesdon, who will serve as Head of Content for the Assassin’s Creed franchise and will be responsible for leading overall creative direction, supporting individual games, and guiding the future. Guesdon has been the creative director for both Origins and Black Flag. </p>



<p>Last but not least is François de Billy, who has been named as the Head of Production Excellence in Assassin’s Creed’s new leadership. François de Billy will be responsible for strengthening production practices and execution across the brand. He was previously the Production Director on Valhalla and Origins. </p>



<p>The trio will be joining the rest of the Assassin’s Creed leadership team in the coming weeks, including Andrée-Anne Boisvert, Producer for Assassin’s Creed’s cross-brand initiatives and Head of Technological Excellence, and Lionel Hiller, VP Brand and Go-to-Market Strategy. </p>

            <guid>1443808</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Considering how popular the concept of pirates is, it’s a surprise that there aren’t really that many successful pirate video games. Aside from the likes of Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag and Sea of Thieves, it’s slim pickings, but there appears to be a new kid on the block, going by the name Windrose.</p>







<p>It’s still in Early Access, but that hasn’t stopped the title from blowing up in popularity, and fans are eagerly jumping into the brand-new demo. However, although it’s multiplayer, there’s a lot of confusion surrounding whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/windrose/" id="3630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windrose</a> will feature PvP combat, so Insider Gaming has done some sleuthing and struck gold, as the answer has been revealed. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-windrose-have-pvp">Does Windrose Have PvP?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll have to settle for these thugs instead. Image by Windrose Crew.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite the fact that Windrose has multiplayer features, there is no PvP enabled, as it is a strictly PvE adventure. </strong></p>



<p>Windrose has been on a long, arduous development journey, and plenty of changes and course corrections have been made over the years. Originally, the game was titled Crosswind, and it was set to be an open-world pirate MMO full of Pirate PvE—and PvP.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-gaming-show-most-wanted-everything-announced/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-gaming-show-most-wanted-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted</a></li>
</ul>



<p>However, since then, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/windrose-crew/" id="3635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windrose Crew</a> has drastically altered its plans. Instead, Windrose will now be a survival-focused adventure title, chock full of PvE encounters on both land and sea, with PvP laid to the wayside. </p>







<h2 id="h-will-windrose-have-pvp">Will Windrose Have PvP?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, it looks like that ship has sailed, as there seems to be no intention of bringing PvP combat to the high seas of Windrose.</strong></p>



<p>That might be disappointing to some fans out there, as the concept of naval combat against other players is admittedly a thrilling one. However, the developers behind Windrose clearly felt that their ambitions better aligned with a PvE experience, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/windrose-surpasses-1-million-steam-wishlists/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/windrose-surpasses-1-million-steam-wishlists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s early success</a> makes it seem like that might have been the right call. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-co-op-multiplayer/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-co-op-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Does God Of War: Sons Of Sparta Have Multiplayer?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Plus, the concept of PvP would have been much better suited to the MMO genre, with large-scale battles on the cards. Now that the game has instead opted for a more focused experience, it appears that it was a good call for PvP to walk the plank. </p>
