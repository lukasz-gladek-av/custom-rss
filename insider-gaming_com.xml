<p>New reports suggest that Hellblade 2 and Gears of War will be making their way to the PlayStation 5 later this year.</p>



<p>That’s according to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/the-game-im-most-excited-for-in-2025-is-already-discounted-before-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WindowsCentral</a>‘s Jez Corden, who corroborated yesterday’s rumors that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> would be making their way to other platforms.</p>



<p>In the new report, Corden states that Hellblade 2, Age of Mythology, and potentially Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition are all also slated for PlayStation 5 later this year.</p>



<p>Corden also points out that most of Xbox’s upcoming games slate will primarily be timed exclusive games for Xbox and PC, which is a direction I think most of us in the industry expected Microsoft to go eventually.</p>



<p>As for when all of these games will be announced to be coming to other platforms, it remains to be seen, but seeing those slated for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acknowledges-recent-nintendo-switch-2-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> would be welcomed announcements whenever Nintendo decides to hold its next Nintendo Direct. The games going to PlayStation may be announced during some “third-party” conference, possibly around the time of Summer Games Fest in June, if those releases are in the latter half of the year.</p>



<p>From the original rumors, NateTheHate also suggested that Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, both PlayStation 5 console exclusives, will come to the Xbox platform soon.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft changing its gaming strategy to release its exclusive games on other platforms? Do you think Microsoft runs the risk of alienating its hardware?
