<p>Black Ops 7 brings back Call of Duty campaign co-op for the first time in a long time. You can experience Treyarch’s newest story offering with other players, but there’s some uncertainty surrounding Black Ops 7 and split-screen multiplayer for the campaign.</p>



<p>You might have heard one or two interesting things about the Black Ops 7 campaign. It’s true that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-cant-pause-the-black-ops-7-campaign-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t pause the Black Ops 7 campaign, ever</a>. There is also the odd suggestion of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giant Skibidi Toilet Boss</a>—don’t adjust your glasses or wipe your phone, you read that right.</p>



<p>But let’s see if any of this matters due to a potential lack of local split-screen multiplayer in Black Ops 7.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-7-campaign-split-screen">Is Black Ops 7 Campaign Split-Screen?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A unit, to an extent. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite the Black Ops 7 campaign being capable of co-op, this feature is restricted to online only, meaning you can’t play the campaign in local co-op split-screen.</strong></p>



<p>You can enjoy the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign with friends, but you have to do it through online multiplayer. BLOPS 7’s campaign is an online-only experience for the first time, which might prove finicky where local co-op is concerned.</p>



<p>If you want to tackle the story’s main missions and reach the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-skip-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endgame</a>, you’ll either have to do so by yourself or online with other players.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-players-can-play-black-ops-7-campaign">How Many Players Can Play Black Ops 7 Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>Up to 4 players can team up in Black Ops 7 campaign multiplayer, which is made easier because you all have your own screen to see.</strong></p>



<p>4-player local split-screen is seldom seen in modern gaming. It’s difficult to do, and presumably easier to code and develop with online multiplayer in mind. On the plus side, if you have three friends you want to spill blood, banter, and bullets with, the Black Ops 7 campaign allows you to.</p>



<p>If one or more of you need the game, we recommend you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">use this link to buy Black Ops 7 for cheap!</a></p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-black-ops-7-campaign-co-op">How To Play Black Ops 7 Campaign Co-Op</h2>



<p><strong>You must invite one or more users to your party in Black Ops 7 to play the campaign in online co-op</strong>.</p>



<p>Like you would with a normal Call of Duty party, invite your friends to a private party, and once you have a squad of between 2-4 players, head into the Black Ops 7 campaign.</p>



<p>Whoever is the party leader will determine what you play: It could be main missions, or it could be Avalon!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss%E2%80%94giant-boss-battle-meme-explained.1355053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Skibidi Toilet meme is a sign of the times, and the popular meme has now spread to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. If you keep seeing Skibidi Toilet mentioned in the same breath as Black Ops 7, we’ll, unfortunately, explain why.</p>



<p>Like ourselves, I’m sure many of you could’ve gone your whole life without knowing what Skibidi Toilet was. With meme culture being as big as it is, evolving on a day-to-day basis, new memes and trends can sometimes pass in the blink of an eye. One that is fervently sticking around is Skibidi Toilet—yay.</p>







<p>The meme has piqued more interest than usual because of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>. A certain viral section of gameplay from the game has caused this.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-skibidi-toilet-boss-in-black-ops-7">What Is The Skibidi Toilet Boss In Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What were they thinking? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Skibidi Toilet Boss in Black Ops 7 refers to the Harper Boss Fight, where Mike Harper—part of the main protagonist team throughout the campaign—has a breakdown, due to a story revelation, and you end up briefly fighting your ally who has morphed into a giant, somewhat resembling the Skibidi Toilet meme.</strong></p>



<p>That’s a lot to take in, I know. But here are the basics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Harper learns the truth about something big that happened in the past. (<strong>Keeping it spoiler-free</strong>)</li>



<li>He drags the team into a weird vision/memory/hallucination.</li>



<li>The unstable Harper suddenly turns into a giant boss, where you can only see the top half of him.</li>



<li>To many on the internet, Harper looks like the Skibidi Toilet meme because it looks like his torso could be sticking out of a toilet.</li>
</ul>







<p>That’s it, that’s the meme. It’s unclear if this was intentional on Treyarch’s part or a complete accident. Either way, the encounter has gone down in infamy as the ‘Skibidi Toilet’ boss fight in Black Ops 7.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-does-skibidi-toilet-meme-come-from">Where Does Skibidi Toilet Meme Come From?</h2>



<p><strong>YouTuber DaFuq!?Boom! is the creator of the meme, which has since been replicated across all corners of the internet.</strong></p>



<p>As a boomer, I might not be down with the kids enough to explain this very well, so here’s an explanation courtesy of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/skibidi-toilet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">KnowYourMeme</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Skibidi Toilet&nbsp;is a series of&nbsp;Source Filmmaker&nbsp;videos by YouTuber DaFuq!?Boom! featuring a remix of “Give It To Me” by Timbaland and&nbsp;“Dom Dom Yes Yes”&nbsp;by Biser King in which an army of toilets with men’s heads coming out of them are shown singing the song in various settings. The series follows a plot about the Skibidi Toilets taking over the world and men with cameras for heads known as CameraHeads fighting against them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You can now sleep easy tonight knowing what the Black Ops 7 Skibidi boss fight is, AND where the original meme came from!</p>



<p>If you’ve played Black Ops 7, what did you make of the literal larger-than-life boss?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-hits-13-years-of-development-nearly-900-million-in-funding-and-its-still-in-alpha/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-citizen-hits-13-years-of-development-nearly-900-million-in-funding-and-it%E2%80%99s-still-in-alpha.1355020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long road to Star Citizen’s full release looks to be continuing, as it’s been 13 years since the game was announced. We’ve checked back in from time to time, and the latest update is that Star Citizen is still in alpha, and it’s swiftly closing in on $900 million of crowd-funded money.</p>



<p>Say what you want, yes, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Citizen</a> actually looks like a quality game. On the other hand, it probably should do when it’s had the development time that many multi-game franchises get and enough money to fund several Hollywood-level movies. Cloud Imperium Games’ Star Citizen could end up being one of the most fascinating games of our time.</p>







<h2 id="h-star-citizen-approaching-1-billion-in-funding">Star Citizen Approaching $1 Billion In Funding</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is the game lost in space? Credit to Cloud Imperium Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Star Citizen has been playable since 2017. To be fair, it somewhat mirrors Escape From Tarkov, which was first playable in 2016, and eventually came out in 2025 for its 1.0 launch. However, there doesn’t seem to be anything similar planned for Star Citizen right now, and the team continues to work on refining the game and adding new content.</p>



<p>There does come a point where the lines are blurred between ‘early builds’ and a complete release. You could argue that a game can’t stay in testing forever, especially not 8 years of alpha testing.</p>







<p>Since it was announced in 2012 (13 years ago), as of October 2025, Star Citizen has accumulated <strong>$885,286,273</strong> in funding—At the time of writing.</p>



<p>It’s figured that Star Citizen is in the top 3 most expensive video games ever made. The data varies from source to source. The crucial difference here is that funding shows no signs of slowing down. We expect the space-based combat simulation game to cross $900 million before long, and unless the beta phase—or full launch is announced—the $1 billion mark surely beckons.</p>



<p>Let’s make it clear: We are not criticizing the game or its development. But it certainly is a curious case, and after we learned a few months ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-loses-integral-staff-responsible-for-server-meshing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Integral Staff’ responsible for Server Meshing</a> are no longer with the company, you have to wonder if this road ever has an end.</p>



<p>Have you played Star Citizen or contributed to its ongoing funding? Give us some insight: Why do you enjoy it, and what do you think the holdup is?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-%E2%80%9Cwe-need-regulations%E2%80%9D.1355008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Much of the Black Ops 7 discourse since launch has focused on the game’s AI usage. Activision has admitted to using AI in the creation of various art and materials in the game, and US Congressman Ro Khanna has issued a statement on AI use in general.</p>



<p>Certain gaming subjects leave us all divided. However, the use of AI is a fairly one-way street where opinions are concerned. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-accused-of-using-generative-ai-art-for-black-ops-7-calling-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision was accused of using AI for Black Ops 7 Calling Cards</a>. Amazingly, and to their credit, the company responded quite soon after the accusations became loud, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responding to the AI claims in full</a>.</p>



<p>The conversation is getting loud as even the US Congress is getting involved, to an extent.</p>







<h2 id="h-us-congressman-responds-to-black-ops-7-ai-use">US Congressman Responds To Black Ops 7 AI Use</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Does AI need to be limited, or removed altogether? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>American politician Ro Khanna (a Member of the&nbsp;U.S. House of Representatives) was quoted as saying: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits. Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed. They should share in the profits and there should be a tax on mass displacement.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Interestingly, the message was used with a quote tweet of Pirat_Nation’s X message about the Black Ops 7 Calling Cards and AI claims.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 uses a large amount of AI-generated artwork across core assets (calling cards, posters, reward icons) instead of human-crafted art—despite being a major blockbuster title charging full price. <a href="https://t.co/vGbtG8NYM7">pic.twitter.com/vGbtG8NYM7</a></p>— Pirat_Nation 🔴 (@Pirat_Nation) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pirat_Nation/status/1989339040945233984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Since all of this happened, Ro Khanna has been spotted reposting a CharlieIntel message about his response to Black Ops 7 AI, and the politician has gone one step further by posting a fresh statement on the controversy:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A company replacing artists with AI is not much different than one that replaces truck drivers. AI cannot just be for enriching tech billionaires. AI must be for us, not them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>AI use has become ubiquitous across all industries in the last few years. The gaming landscape has certainly been rocked by AI, and there’s a fear that too many talented artists and developers will be phased out in favor of AI. </p>



<p>We learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-developers-used-ai-extensively/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Steel Frontiers developers used AI ‘Extensively’</a>, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ceo-defends-ai-voices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexon’s CEO has defended ARC Raiders’ AI Voices by saying ‘Every Game Company’ is doing it</a>.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A company replacing artists with AI is not much different than one that replaces truck drivers. AI cannot just be for enriching tech billionaires.</p><p>AI must be for us, not them. <a href="https://t.co/bZlIgS6ke7">https://t.co/bZlIgS6ke7</a></p></div>— Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) <a href="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1989752374790164827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Will the continued use of AI and the ousting of human talent lead to action from the US Congress down the line? Is the AI issue in gaming only just beginning?

<p>Use these Spin A Brainrot monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including a variety of Dice and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spin A Brainrot isn’t all that different from all the other brainrot-related games that have been trending on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> over the last many months. With the younger generation consuming more and more brainrot content every day, the likelihood of every brainrot game that comes out gaining massive popularity is quite high.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Spin A Brainrot does have a few minor differences, though, as unlike the other games in the genre, it allows players to acquire brainrot characters by simply spinning a Dice. That’s easier said than done, however, as Dice spins don’t come cheap in this game. To make the grind a little bit smoother, players can make use of the following codes. These codes reward players with different kinds of Dice, making it easier to acquire your favourite brainrot in no time. With items like potions and passive stat upgrades on offer as well, using these codes can help players get ahead of the competition.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of yet another week, and hopefully, you’re maintaining that NYT Connections streak. If you’re just starting out, I’m still here for you, providing the best NYT Connections hints you’ll find anywhere. Today’s puzzle is a trickier one in that respect, as very few of the words seem to relate to one another.</p>



<p>Regardless, I’ve got you covered with the NYT Connections solutions for today’s puzzle. Read on to learn what you need to know.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-16">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 16)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #889:</p>



<ul>
<li>RUGBY SHIRT</li>



<li>PEDESTRIAN</li>



<li>APPROACH</li>



<li>AVENUE</li>



<li>BARCODE</li>



<li>EVERYDAY</li>



<li>SCHOOL</li>



<li>TAX</li>



<li>IBM LOGO</li>



<li>BANAL</li>



<li>RAILROAD</li>



<li>PHILOSOPHY</li>



<li>HUMDRUM</li>



<li>ZEBRA</li>



<li>METHOD</li>



<li>PARKING</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about the way someone “goes about” something, not the thing itself.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>This set sits firmly in the realm of routine and low sparkle.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Don’t just look for animals—think design language and uniform aesthetics.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Zero in on square names, board events, and charges you might encounter while circling the track.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 16.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– APPROACH, METHOD, PHILOSOPHY, SCHOOL</li>

<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BARCODE, IBM LOGO, RUGBY SHIRT, ZEBRA</li>

</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Fans Have Strong Opinions on Black Ops 7 Campaign]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-reddit-reactions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-fans-have-strong-opinions-on-black-ops-7-campaign.1354912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With Black Ops 7 now on the market, Call of Duty fans have expressed their opinions on the game’s campaign. However, the reactions are a bit underwhelming than what they expected.</p>







<p>In Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the campaign brings the series back to the Mason family, particularly David. The family, which was featured from Black Ops to Black Ops 2, has taken a back seat until now. With Black Ops 7, the campaign, fully multiplayer, takes players on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nightmare-induced fever dream</a> where the team, including David, confronts Menendez and The Guild. Compared to other titles, especially last year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-black-ops-6-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, it’s a bit of a crazy one. As you can expect, some have some strong opinions, good and bad, about how things were handled.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-campaign-garbage-lackluster-says-call-of-duty-fans">Black Ops 7 Campaign ‘Garbage’, ‘Lackluster’, Says Call of Duty Fans</h2>

<p>Since Black Ops 7’s release, the Call of Duty Reddit has been going through the motions, in a way. The reactions towards the game have ranged from hot garbage to series-best. However, there is a common thread between them: the game’s co-op campaign is not great. In a Reddit post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/cod_the_warzonification_and_zombification_of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AdBudget5468</a>, the user argues that the success of other modes like Zombies and Warzone have ‘ruined’ campaigns, with Black Ops 7 being a prime example. </p>



<p>In the comments, many fans expressed the same reaction. For some, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/novr5x3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Solid_Snek120</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/noxcdq6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shadowdemon210</a>, it feels reminiscent of 2023’s Modern Warfare 3, which had a very controversial campaign. Others, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/novtolj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Top_Limit_</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/nowr2da/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SetScary9216</a>, brought up how polished Black Ops 6’s campaign was and how Black Ops 7’s just doesn’t match up. </p>



<p>Currently, the game isn’t doing as hot as Activision may like. As it stands, Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t even reached 100k</a> while rival shooters ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 still get over 200k and even 300k on Steam. Despite this, the title will likely sell well, though it’s unknown just how well compared to other entries. Hopefully, as someone who enjoys the campaign, the next games can take from Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare and craft something all can enjoy without being a ploy to earn a battle royale mode.</p>
