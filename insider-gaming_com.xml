<p>Helldivers 2 is getting a new Warbond called Redacted Regiment on January 20, 2026; here’s what you need to know about it. </p>



<p>Arrowhead Game Studios is back again with a new Warbond for players to try out. The last few Premium Warbonds saw developers introduce features such as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2s-next-premium-warbond-will-introduce-a-minigun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minigun</a>, the return of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-returns-as-a-legendary-warbond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killzone collaboration</a>, and more. The latest Premium Warbond will focus on suppression technology and spec ops fashions. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-weapons-and-stratagems">Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment Weapons and Stratagems</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment Premium Warbond will introduce two primary weapons for players to try out. The first is a mid-range precision rifle with an integrated suppressor called R-72 Censor. The other is a fully automatic assault rifle with a non-removable suppressor called AR-59 Suppressor. There’s also a dart-firing P-35 Re-Educator, which releases “a chemical agent that induces delirium in organic targets and delirium-like malfunction in inorganic ones.”</p>



<p>Coming to the Stratagems, first up is the B/MD C4 Pack, a backpack that comes with six adhesive C4 charges and a wireless detonator. The other is the TM-01 Lure Mine, a throwable anti-personnel mine that attracts enemies by producing sounds and flashing lights. The mine will detonate when the target enters its proximity. </p>

<p>First up are the Helldivers 2 Redacted Regiment, and players get two of them this time. First up is RS-89 Shadow Paragon light armor, which comes with “multitudinous pads and pouches to hold all your tactical EDC items”. The other is the RS–67 Null Cipher medium armor, which has been coated with “a radar-absorbent polymer and null-signature heat baffle to turn you into a real sensor ghost.” Both armours feature Reduced Signature passive, which results in reducing the player’s noise level and also the range the enemy can detect them in. </p>



<p>There are two new capes as well, the Pillar of the Abyss and Triangulation Veil capes. Additionally, a new victory post called Target Sighted and a new player title, [Redacted], have been added as well. Lastly, there’s a new booster called Concealed Insertion, which deploys a smokescreen from your Hellpod in impact, allowing you to enter stealth mode as soon as you land. </p>

<p>Hytale coming back from the dead has revitalized an expectant community and is sure to bring in a lot of players. However, it’s not ideal if the Hytale servers aren’t cooperating, and this guide has the latest.</p>



<p>Servers, servers, servers, you both love them and hate them. Without them, you don’t get to play online games, but with them, there’s the constant headache of relying on them <em>to</em> work. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-expects-one-million-players-at-early-access-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale’s early access</a> is very much a game in its infancy, and initial player count figures are expected to be high.</p>



<p>If you’re struggling to get on Hytale, here’s the latest on the game’s servers and potential issues.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-the-hytale-servers-working-right-now">Are The Hytale Servers Working Right Now?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of January 13, the servers are working and operational, but it might take you some time to get into the game.</strong></p>



<p>Launch day for any new, hyped online game is always a wild one. Having the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/download-hytale-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale Launcher</a> installed is one thing, but your place in the game’s servers rests entirely on Hypixel’s server’s shoulders.</p>



<p>It was never expected to be plain sailing on day one, and it will take time to iron out the kinks and see just how many people log in at first.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-access-hytale-servers">How To Access Hytale Servers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quite simply, you need to be patient and wait for your chance to access the Hytale servers, as they are overloaded with players and likely working at, or beyond, capacity.</strong></p>



<p>Check for developer updates and comments on X. The <a href="https://x.com/Hytale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale X</a> page is a great source for new updates and announcements on the game, and you should also check founder <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simon Collins-Laflamme</a>‘s X page, as they post regularly about the game.</p>



<p>You should also keep checking back with this Insider Gaming server status page, as it’ll be updated with new tweaks if there are any outages or significant changes to the game’s servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-can-t-i-download-the-lastest-update-or-patch">Why Can’t I Download The Lastest Update Or Patch?</h2>



<p><strong>Again, the reason you can’t download the latest patch is that the servers are overloaded, making it difficult for you to get the required space and memory to download the contents.</strong></p>



<p>Are you having any difficulties accessing the Hytale servers? Have you experienced any unusual error messages or login issues? Share your thoughts and scenarios through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, where you can communicate with other Hytale players to see if there are solutions to be discovered.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Duckov and Tarkov Collab Could Be Coming Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-tarkov-collaboration-coming/</link>
            <guid>1404541</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Extraction shooter fans everywhere are preparing for a collaboration that writes itself. Recently, the Escape from <strong>Duckov </strong>team posted a cryptic image and message on social media talking about the game’s <strong>first </strong>collaboration event. The image was decoded quickly enough by fans, and it looks like <strong>Escape from Tarkov characters </strong>will be headed into the duck-themed extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Escape from Duckov was released in October 2025 and quickly sold millions of copies, soaring to a peak concurrent player count of 301,000 users on Steam. It’s a satirical, tongue-in-cheek stab at the unwelcoming extraction genre, and it parodies Escape from Tarkov, the hyper-challenging shooter, in multiple ways.</p>







<h2 id="h-are-tarkov-and-duckov-joining-forces">Are Tarkov and Duckov Joining Forces?</h2>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the Escape from Duckov folks from Bilibili and Team Soda posted an image showing one of the game’s duck-like characters studying a whiteboard.</p>



<p>On that whiteboard, we see two perfectly normal ducks turn into something threatening. One is wielding a large hammer and wearing an armored vest, while the other has rippling muscles and a large rifle.</p>



<p>The post was accompanied by a message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>【Two ……. interconnected memory …… bloodline …… exceptional combat …… instability.】</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is almost a direct reference to <strong>Tagilla </strong>and <strong>Killa</strong>, two of Escape from Tarkov’s most iconic boss characters. They’re brothers (interconnected memory and bloodline), and one has exceptional combat skills, while the other is somewhat unstable.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>【Two ……. interconnected memory …… bloodline …… exceptional combat …… instability.】</p><p>QUACK! 🦆 Our FIRST in-game collab is coming! Guess what will arrive in Duckov. </p><p>Comment with your prediction — a weapon, an object, a crossover character… anything​ — and get… <a href="https://t.co/oOD86cYMlX">pic.twitter.com/oOD86cYMlX</a></p></div>— Escape from Duckov (@GameDuckov) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameDuckov/status/2010653800777081200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The collaboration effectively writes itself, and it means we could see these two characters emerge in a game <strong>other than </strong>Escape from Tarkov for the first time.</p>



<p>On October 22, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, praised Escape from Duckov’s successful launch and one million copies sold in just a few days. Little did we know that would be a precursor for things to come (or potentially come, at least).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Duckov has maintained a relatively solid player base on Steam, standing at around 11,000 peak players every day. Escape from Tarkov is primarily played via Battlestate’s proprietary launcher, so it’s hard to tell how many people are playing it, but 26,000 or so were playing at the time of writing <strong>on Steam alone</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Hytale Have Controller Support? PlayStation & Xbox Controller Support, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-controller-support-playstation-xbox/</link>
            <guid>1404493</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hytale feels like the spiritual successor to Minecraft in many ways, and it could be one of the big games over the next few years. Its early access release has been met with various questions, including whether Hytale includes controller support or not.</p>



<p>The tension building for Hytale’s thought-impossible launch has been seismic. After getting the green light to continue production in mid-2025, Hypixel Studio has been working hard on an old build to ensure the game is in a good state for early access.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-has-secured-development-costs-for-the-next-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale has secured development costs for the next two years</a>, which is great, but it could mean nothing without controller support for some.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-use-a-controller-for-hytale">Can You Use A Controller For Hytale?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale doesn’t support any form of official controller support for its early access launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you struggle with a mouse and keyboard, you might come unstuck at times trying to negotiate Hytale. The developer has been very transparent over many of the details surrounding Hytale’s early access build, and the official website has even addressed the question of controller support.</p>



<p>Under <a href="https://hytale.com/accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Accessibility</a>, here’s what the information has to say.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We are currently missing controller support.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, there’s no second-guessing if you can hook up a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S pad to play Hytale—you can’t, and it’s unfortunate, as it will ultimately exclude a handful of potential users.</p>



<p>On the plus side, it’s not all doom and gloom.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-controller-support-being-added-to-hytale">When Is Controller Support Being Added To Hytale?</h2>



<p><strong>Hypixel Studios has said that controller support is a “top priority” that the team is looking to add ASAP.</strong></p>



<p>You might have to hang fire just a little bit for controller support. From the sounds of it, you might not be waiting too long. Once again, let’s check in with the game’s Accessibility page:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This [controller support] is one of our top priorities and is expected to be available soon after release.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>How soon is ‘soon,’ is anyone’s guess. It could be a week or a month. Time is relative here and affects different groups of players. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-expects-one-million-players-at-early-access-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale expecting one million users during the early access launch</a>, stability and a structurally solid framework could be the goal at first.</p>



<p>Hopefully, controller support arrives in the time it takes to get stomped on by a dragon in the game’s world.</p>



<p>Is a lack of controller support at the early access launch a big no-no for you? What other key features is Hytale missing for its debut? Share some ideas via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, and start up some Hytale conversations.</p>
