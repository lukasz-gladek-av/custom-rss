<p>The latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has completely broken matchmaking, with players reporting they cannot get into the game.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Activision has yet to offer an update or patch notes for both Black Ops 6 and Warzone, but currently, no one is seemingly able to play the game.</p>



<p>But don’t worry; the Call of Duty store works fine if you’re planning to spend some of your hard-earned cash.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://mobile.x.com/CODUpdates/status/1878856625920065848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Updates</a> X account, the current issues are a result of the update being distributed to everyone. </p>



<p>The latest patch update is Call of Duty Black Ops 6’s and Warzone’s first update since the Call of Duty development teams took leave for the holidays. As for what exactly the patch entailed, it remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Call of Duty has been under fire in recent weeks due to the game’s massive number of bugs, inaccurate bans, and hackers, which has seen the game lose players on mass over the holiday period. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game lost 38.9 of its Steam player base in December, the highest percentage lost during this period in the past few years.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, SteamDB shows a further 20.8% loss during the past 30 days. Today’s news for Call of Duty keeps on getting worse, as earlier in the day, one leaker reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-is-reportedly-returning-to-warzone-in-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk will be returning during Season 3</a> rather than Season 2.</p>



<p>Waht do you think of Call of Duty’s latest blunders? Let us know down in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>According to new information revealed by a known leaker, Nintendo Switch 2 could be revealed this week with a new trailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i0fwdx/natethehate_nintendo_switch_2_will_be_revealed_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Nate the Hate has released a new video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> titled “Nintendo 2025 Predictions”. In it, he discusses when the Switch 2 will be revealed, what kind of support it will get, and other details. In the video, Nate states, “The Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed in the coming week.” He has been told that the Switch 2 announcement trailer will arrive on Thursday, January 16.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nate added that the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal will “focus almost exclusively on the console itself”. The reveal will not have any games present unless a game is shown “running on the screen”, depending on how the trailer comes out. He has explicitly stated that “software is not going to be a focus”, so players shouldn’t be “too surprised” if no games are revealed for the Nintendo Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nate elaborated that this week’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer might only showcase the system, its functionality, the new logo, and maybe some packaging. He’s heard that a separate software showcase for Switch 2 games will be scheduled for late February or early March, where we might see new Nintendo games and third-party titles.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-balatro-have-cross-save-or-cross-progression/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro having cross-progression or cross-save would mean you can play the roguelike on any platform, save your data, and resume your progress on another format. Many games utilize a similar infrastructure, but a lesser indie title like Balatro isn’t guaranteed to use this.</p>



<p>Developer LocalThunk’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game of the Year</a> card game has an easy premise. You battle through several rounds (Antes), needing to score enough points to advance from Blind to Blind. Each new run sees you use different Jokers and utilize a variety of upgrades. The sense of progression comes when you unlock new Decks—such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-plasma-deck-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plasma Deck</a>—and new Jokers: I’m looking at you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-hit-the-road-joker-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hit The Road</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-brainstorm-joker-in-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brainstorm</a>.</p>



<p>Unlocking new content makes future runs more fun. However, say you’re playing PS5, and want to start on Mobile, cross-progression is handy. Let’s tell you</p>



<p> everything we know about a cross-save system and its status.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-balatro-have-cross-progression">Does Balatro Have Cross-Progression? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Losing progress sucks. Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Balatro currently does not incorporate any type of cross-save or cross-progression functionality.</strong></p>



<p>The game’s <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official FAQ</a> features a question titled, “Can I carry my game progress over from another platform?” If you open up this query, it explains “<strong>At this time, it’s not possible to transfer your profile from another platform to mobile.”</strong></p>



<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, or Nintendo Switch, your Balatro progress has to stay on one platform. I find this disappointing as I can’t bring myself to start a whole new save file when I have so many hours invested on PS5.</p>



<p>You don’t need to feel downhearted as it doesn’t look like it’ll stay like this forever.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-balatro-get-cross-save-or-cross-progression">Will Balatro Get Cross-Save or Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>Developer LocalThunk has confirmed cross-progression and/or cross-save <strong>“is on the roadmap for future updates.</strong>“</p>



<p>Again, using the FAQ as a reference point, when discussing game progress, a future patch is looking to bring cross-progression in. Unfortunately, we can’t find a timeframe for this yet, meaning it could be in the next update, or a few months from now.</p>



<p>I for one am desperate to see this included. Once cross-save is a thing, I’ll be happy to sink hours into Balatro via my phone. A final, tense run before bed is the perfect remedy to help me sleep, right?</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we look to bring you an update on this feature being added.</p>



<hr>



<p>Will cross-progression’s planned addition encourage you to pick up Balatro on more platforms? Could this be a feature to catapult Balatro into the stars and cement itself as an inclusive roguelike catering to its die-hard community?</p>
