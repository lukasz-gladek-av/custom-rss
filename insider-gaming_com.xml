<p>Counter-Strike 2 has not been spared from the discourse about “dying” that surrounds multiplayer and live service games in recent years. Counter-Strike as a series has been around for decades, and the state of the game has been a constant discussion point since.</p>



<p>But is there any truth to the arguments that CS2 is dying?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-are-players-saying-that-cs2-is-dying">Why are players saying that CS2 is dying?</h2>



<p>There are a number of issues that the wider Counter-Strikes 2 player base has with the state of the game.</p>



<p>One of these issues has been Valve Anti-Cheat, the anti-cheat program that’s supposed to keep cheaters and hackers at bay. Many players claim that VAC hardly keeps cheaters out, and that they are constantly running into cheaters on a frequent basis.</p>



<p>Other issues plaguing the game include client performance, a lack of new content (seasonal operations), more frequent crashes, subtick issues, and various bugs.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-2-dying">Is Counter-Strike 2 dying?</h2>



<p>Despite the issues facing Counter-Strike 2 currently, the game is not dying. While the player numbers for CS2 have always fluctuated, there’s been no consistent dropoff. The <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peak player and average player numbers</a> as of December 2024 are lower now than they were in April or May, but higher than they were in January or February.</p>



<figure><figcaption>CS2 player peaks and averages, per SteamDB.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These numbers will typically spike after a large update, whether that be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a change to the map pool</a> or a return of the Major pass. While these larger updates feel more sparse when compared to other popular multiplayer titles, players are still logging back in to play. Valve is also still (slowly) releasing updates regarding some of the major issues.</p>



<p>CS2 is still the most played game on Steam at any given time, and likely will remain that way for a long time.</p>



<p>Thoughts on CS2 as whole? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> is arguably the most legendary franchise in gaming, proving time and again why it’s so overwhelmingly popular. It has produced some of the most instantly recognisable protagonists in the business – and even the franchise’s side characters are just as memorable. With Grand Theft Auto 6 on the horizon, we thought it’d be appropriate to rank the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto/">Grand Theft Auto</a> protagonists, figuring out once and for all which main character in the GTA series is the best.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-grand-theft-auto-protagonists-ranked">Grand Theft Auto Protagonists Ranked</h2>



<p><em>It’s driven mostly by opinion – if you have your own ranking for the Grand Theft Auto characters, feel free to drop a comment saying who you’d put where in this list!</em></p>



<h4 id="h-10-victor-vance-vice-city-stories">10. Victor Vance (Vice City Stories)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vic Vance first appeared as a minor character in Vice City and had his own journey documented later on in Vice City Stories, which was a prequel of sorts. He becomes embroiled in the seedy, criminal underbelly of Vice City to support his family, and while his game boasted a good story, it wasn’t overwhelmingly impactful – hence the rating.</p>



<h4 id="h-9-johnny-klebitz-the-lost-and-damned">9. Johnny Klebitz (The Lost and Damned)</h4>



<p>Back when Grand Theft Auto actually had story-based expansions, players were introduced to Johnny Klebitz. As a part of the Grand Theft Auto IV saga, Johnny took centre stage in The Lost and Damned, a gritty expansion based around an outlaw motorcycle club that was strewn with themes of brotherhood, loyalty, and the constant threat of brutal death. </p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-grand-theft-auto-cross-platform/">Is Grand Theft Auto Cross-Platform?</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-8-tommy-vercetti-vice-city">8. Tommy Vercetti (Vice City)</h4>



<p>Tommy Vercetti is an iconic PlayStation 2-era character, emerging from the very heart of Vice City as one the most ruthless and headstrong characters in the GTA series. As a former hitman for the Mafia, Vercetti has the tools needed to survive in the trade, and there are hopes he’ll resurface in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<h4 id="h-7-claude-gta-iii">7. Claude (GTA III)</h4>



<figure><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gta-5/"></a></figure>







<p>Claude was a silent protagonist who ushered in a new generation of gaming with the introduction of Grand Theft Auto III, the first 3D game in the series. It changed the paradigm for open-world adventures, and despite Claude never uttering a word, he’d become known as one of the most impactful Grand Theft Auto protagonists ever.</p>



<h4 id="h-6-franklin-clinton-gta-v">6. Franklin Clinton (GTA V)</h4>



<p>Franklin Clinton was always more of a follower than a leader – first with Lemar Davis and then with Michael De Santa – but he had remarkable talents that made him shine in Grand Theft Auto V. His struggles ultimately turned themselves around, and in a relatively short period of time, Franklin Clinton became a legend of the streets, making millions, living in Vinewood Hills, and pulling off immense heists.</p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-gta-5-still-so-popular/">Why Is GTA 5 Still So Popular?</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-5-trevor-philips-gta-v">5. Trevor Philips (GTA V)</h4>



<p>Trevor Philips was as unhinged as they came, but he was one of the most entertaining Grand Theft Auto protagonists to ever grace our screens. His anger management issues made for some hilarious situations, and despite his insanely hot head, he was an overwhelmingly talented marksman with a cold and calculating mind for business, and that’s what made him such a strong GTA protagonist.</p>



<h4 id="h-4-tony-cipriani-liberty-city-stories">4. Tony Cipriani (Liberty City Stories)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tony Cipriani is one of the few GTA characters to bridge that gap between more than one game, appearing in both Grand Theft Auto III as a main character and in Liberty City Stories as the protagonist. He was a driving force in the Leone Crime Family that was based in Liberty City, and as both a fiercely loyal individual and a talented combatant, he made his mark on the franchise and proved that someone can perfect the balance between being a <strong>family man </strong>and a <strong>made man</strong>.</p>



<h4 id="h-3-michael-de-santa-gta-v">3. Michael De Santa (GTA V)</h4>



<p>In many ways, Michael De Santa was the driving force behind the Grand Theft Auto V story – he was the catalyst and the spark that triggered events and snowballed them into the grand adventure that hundreds of millions of players have enjoyed. He’s a skilled criminal, even in his later years, and he’s unbelievably talented with any form of weaponry. He’s also a master thief, a charismatic individual, and what’s more, he recognises the need to help youngsters develop themselves into something greater than what they are. </p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-source-code-partially-leaks/">Learn About The GTA 5 Source Code Leaks</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-2-carl-cj-johnson-san-andreas">2. Carl ‘CJ’ Johnson (San Andreas)</h4>



<p>Carl Johnson was introduced to the world in 2004’s GTA San Andreas, and he would ultimately go on to become one of the most iconic Grand Theft Auto protagonists of all time. He’s a die-hard family man and a ruthless fighter with a heart of gold, and he wants what’s best for those closest to him. He’s multi-talented, oozes charisma, and his journey across San Andreas turns him from a back-street gangbanger to a legendary icon of the series.</p>



<h4 id="h-1-niko-bellic-gta-iv">1. Niko Bellic (GTA IV)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) players were introduced to a darker, more serious tone – and it was a total break away from what we’d come to know and love from the series thus far. However, it was a smash hit, and it put Niko Bellic on the GTA map. </p>



<p>As the man who sits atop the list of the best Grand Theft Auto protagonists, Niko has earned his spot for many reasons. Firstly, he’s a stalwart protector of his family and friends, which makes him honourable. He does what he does with the best of intentions in mind, and somehow, he manages to be likeable even when he’s going on a rampage to protect those he loves.</p>



<p>He’s a mysterious, storied character with a background that players simply desire to learn more about, and his journey through Liberty City is monumental. He goes from being an immigrant fresh off the deck of a cargo boat to being a respected, revered criminal presence in the city. </p>



<p>That’s why he’s the best Grand Theft Auto protagonist in the series.</p>

<p>Lots of enjoyment is to be had on PlayStation 5. Whether your kids beg for something new to play or could use a fun distraction, there’s no going wrong with the games on this list. There are also a few notable, kid-friendly PlayStation exclusives not to be missed. In no particular order, we’re compiling some of the best PlayStation 5 Games for children.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-ps5-games-for-kids">Top PS5 Games for Kids</h2>



<p>Look no further than this list for the best breakdown possible:</p>



<h2 id="h-1-astro-bot">1. Astro Bot</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Astro Bot is one of the highest-rated PlayStation 5 games of 2024 and probably the <strong>best </strong>game for kids on PS5. It features a wealth of worlds to explore, puzzles to solve, and obstacle courses to overcome. If you’re a PlayStation fan of any kind, you’ll adore digging through Astro Bot to find all the cameos and ‘guest appearances’, and there’s plenty of meat on these bones to keep children entertained for hours on end.</p>



<p>It’s a follow-on from Astro’s Playroom, and it’s one of our key picks for PlayStation 5 games for children.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-astro-s-playroom">2. Astro’s Playroom</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you already have, or plan on getting, a PlayStation 5 then you’ll have Astro’s Playroom already pre-installed on the console. This game is pretty short but it’s got huge appeal. Astro’s Playroom is more than a tech demo for the PS5. It’s a culmination of what Sony has accomplished with the PlayStation over the years. </p>



<p>In addition to featuring the DualSense controller’s unique capabilities, players can uncover hidden collectables that contain renderings of past PlayStation consoles, controllers, and accessories. A gacha machine, within the game, can also yield additional memorable goodies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-3-super-monkey-ball-banana-mania">3. Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Super Monkey Ball has kept the good times rolling for years, literally. Banana Mania will keep kids busy for hours. The game is a compilation of over 300 stages from the original Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2, and Super Monkey Ball Deluxe. </p>



<p>Whether you’re speeding directly to the goal, or collecting every banana for a perfect run, there’s no wrong way to enjoy these games. The DualSense controller’s motion controls make this one an easy pick. Kids can also customise their characters and play several minigames involving racing, bowling, soccer, and baseball.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-4-justice-league-cosmic-chaos">4. Justice League: Cosmic Chaos</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>When the kids have a superhero itch that needs scratching then Justice League: Cosmic Chaos is just the thing. Play as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman in a light-hearted action-adventure to stop the prankster, Mr. Mxyzptlk. </p>



<p>That is not a typo. It’s got simple combat but boasts lots of DC Comics Easter eggs, humour, unlockable outfits for the superheroes, and a dynamic levelling system.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-5-sonic-frontiers">5. Sonic Frontiers</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>When you gotta go fast in an open-world platformer, an obvious choice is Sonic Frontiers. It’s the first game in the Sonic series to truly go open-world. The Starfall Islands contain several action stages with their own challenges to complete. The real treat of the game is exploring the islands themselves. </p>



<p>Each has obstacle courses and some platform puzzles to solve. The only drawbacks are that the game has a tedious level-up system, a so-so combat system, and some texture pop-ins. But fun is always to be had when exploring up, down and all around Sonic’s surroundings.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">6. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>LEGO games are great picks for the best PlayStation 5 games for children. They’re easy to pick up and keep kids (and adults) of all ages preoccupied. Although a plethora of PS4 Lego games are forward compatible with the PS5, we’re specifically looking at Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. </p>



<p>The game features a startling 380 playable characters pulled from all manners of Star Wars medium Because the saga is within the subtitle, players can expect to visit many worlds and scenarios spanning the Prequel, Original, and Sequel trilogies. Kids can play as lightsaber users or blaster wielders alike. </p>



<p>The gameplay is also interwoven with random encounters like TIE Fighters swooping from the sky, Tusken Raider attacks, and dog fights with Star Destroyers.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-just-dance-2024-edition">7. Just Dance 2024 Edition</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If parents are reading this you may recall a little thing back in the day called “Now That’s What I Call Music” compilations. The Just Dance series is the closest equivalent to that. Modern-day musical hits and those from yesteryear are set against vibrant, colourful backdrops. </p>



<p>Chances are you know what a Just Dance game entails and it says so in the title. On-screen avatars perform the dance moves while the kiddos follow along. The smartphone Just Dance app will keep track of accuracy and kids hold it in hand. Put down the controller, turn the volume up, and dance.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-ratchet-amp-clank-rift-apart">8. Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is a third-person shooter action-adventure that guarantees a fun, entertaining story. This time around the conundrum is that Ratchet has accidentally opened a rift in the space-time continuum. With a lot of media nowadays covering multiple universes, kids can immerse themselves in this colourful adventure. </p>



<p>Dr. Nefarious is ever the comic foil, but now he is joined by his opposite, Emperor Nefarious who has assumed rule of his own galaxy. What’s more, is that he’s never been defeated, so go change that. Rift Apart is among the best PlayStation 5 games for children.</p>







<h2 id="h-9-kena-bridge-of-spirits">9. Kena: Bridge of Spirits</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Similar to Ratchet &amp; Clank before it, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is like you’re in control of a beautifully produced animated movie. In this action-adventure platformer, kids control Kena, a young spirit guide. Joining Kena in her adventure throughout her mystical world are small spirit companions called the Rot. </p>



<p>The Rot can assist Kena by carrying objects to solve puzzles, distract enemies, or assist in battles. Kena utilizes an enchanted staff for combat, exploration, and platforming. It may be on the short side, but exploring Kena’s beautiful world for upgrades and treasure hunting needs to be experienced by every PS5 owner.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-sackboy-a-big-adventure">10. Sackboy: A Big Adventure</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>One of the best PlayStation 5 games for children is a side-scrolling platformer similar to Super Mario Bros. Sackboy: A Big Adventure can be compared closely to Super Mario 3D World regarding its gameplay structure. However, this time around, Sackboy’s moveset has expanded to best suit a new way of play. </p>



<p>Flutter jump, roll, dive, and slap everything in your way. The generous customization features of LittleBigPlanet carry over into Sackboy. There’s no end to the hysterical cosmetic decorations. Whether platforming solo or together, Sackboy keeps the smiles coming.</p>



<h2 id="h-11-minecraft">11. Minecraft</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>You can’t talk about the best PS5 games for children and <strong>not </strong>name Minecraft. This classic, decade-old game is a staple for any child looking to game from a young age. It promotes healthy learning and exploration, and it’s one of the best games for new players who are just starting to explore a controller.</p>



<p>In Minecraft, you and your kids can explore an infinite open world, build whatever you can imagine, and go on an adventure that only ends when you’re ready for it to. It’s the best-selling game of all time for a reason.</p>



<h2 id="h-12-overcooked">12. Overcooked!</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>For kids who enjoy cooperative play, Overcooked is a cooking simulator with a cartoony flair. Prepare yourselves though, you have to work through the laughs to become an ultimate chef. The gist of Overcooked, and its sequel, is preparing dishes by following onscreen instructions. It’s not as simple as lading soup into a bowl. </p>



<p>Some dishes will require cooking and preparing food to order such as managing temperatures, chopping vegetables, and preparing the plate. The real challenge is doing this against a time limit and setting time aside to clean dishes for the next order.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-13-moving-out">13. Moving Out</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another fun cooperative simulator, Moving Out is not unlike Overcooked in its gameplay style. As you would expect, kids have to move household amenities like couches, fridges, and microwaves out of the house and into a moving truck. It’s not that quite simple, however, as there are hazards that can disrupt your progress. </p>



<p>Almost like Home Alone traps, players have to be wary of fires, icey flooring, and ghosts. Fortunately, for the kiddos who need to dial back on the difficulty, Moving Out has an Assist feature that can remove stage hazards and increase the time limit.</p>







<h2 id="h-14-hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged">14. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Racing games are plentiful but here’s a newly released suggestion. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is a great improvement on the shortcomings of its predecessor. This sequel contains beautifully stylized racetracks that are set against home backdrops. The racetracks you can only dream of building in your house are fully realized in video game form. </p>



<p>Whether racing as miniature muscle cars, bikes, or big rigs, each with its own specifications,&nbsp; Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is one of the fastest racing games you can get your hands on.</p>



<h2 id="h-15-crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled">15. Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another racer that is gushing to the brim with content, Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled is a must-have for any racer. No pun intended but developer Beenox went the extra mile with this reimagining of the original Crash Bandicoot kart racer. Nitro-Fueled brings back all the racetracks from that game plus additional racetracks from the Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Tag Team Racing games. </p>



<p>It got a lot of flak at launch for its use of microtransactions after promising there would be none. Online multiplayer is not as populated as it used to be, but the single-player story experience is solid. By this point,t it shouldn’t hurt the bank either.&nbsp;</p>
