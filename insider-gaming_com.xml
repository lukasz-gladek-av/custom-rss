            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has confirmed the first major collaboration between Escape from Tarkov and another game, and it’s been brewing for weeks. In a post on social media, the team unveiled the ‘Escape from Tarkov x Escape from Duckov’ crossover event, and while nobody knows what it entails, it was promised that it’s <strong>coming soon</strong>.</p>



<p>In the last few weeks, we’ve seen teasers posted by both Battlestate Games and Team Soda, the developer behind the satirical extraction shooter, Escape from Duckov. Now it’s time to make good on those teases.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-duckov-is-coming-to-tarkov">Escape from Duckov is Coming to Tarkov</h2>



<p>A new image posted on social media confirmed that the Escape from Duckov and Escape from <strong>Tarkov </strong>crossover is indeed happening. We don’t know <strong>when</strong>, but the team at Battlestate Games promised it would be <strong>soon</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s just over a year since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-preview-gamescom/">Escape from Duckov</a> was released, emerging as a jokey extraction game that amassed a very real and surprising audience. It plunges players into a hardcore extraction concept populated by birds, mostly ducks, and gives them all the tools of the trade that we’d usually associate with Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>That means customizable weapons, vendors, multiple maps, a hideout to build, and multiple quests.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What started as something of a joke has become something much more tangible, and now Escape from Tarkov’s developers are open to making Duckov the sole target of the first-ever cross-game collaboration in the EFT space.</p>



<p>While we don’t know what the crossover will include, fans have been quick to speculate on social media. Some are predicting seeing ducks running rampant around Tarkov’s maps, while others have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-crossover-teased-promo-code/">used earlier teasers</a> to guess that Tarkov’s bosses will be reimagined in Duckov as… Well, <em>ducks</em>.</p>



<p>And they’d be mostly right! On the <a href="https://x.com/GameDuckov/status/2017432651918131223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Duckov side</a>, it was confirmed that the collaboration arrives in <strong>that game </strong>on February 10, and it includes a new map, ‘festival content’, and Tarkov bosses reimagined in duck form. Happy days!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Miami Heretics Kick Off Lower Bracket Run Hopes at CDL Major I]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/miami-heretics-cdl-major-i-elimination-run/</link>
            <guid>1421626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League’s Major I tournament is unfolding in Dallas, Texas, and waves are already being made. In the opening days of the competition, some hard eliminations were made, including Toronto KOI, the Carolina Royal Ravens, Vancouver Surge, Boston Breach, and Cloud9 New York.</p>



<p>The narrow majority of those eliminations came at the hands of the Miami Heretics, which kicked both Toronto and Vancouver out of the running for the grand prize. Miami Heretics has had a mixed season thus far, but a lower-bracket run could be in store for the squad.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-miami-heretics-run-through-the-elimination-bracket">Can Miami Heretics Run Through The Elimination Bracket?</h2>



<p>Miami Heretics came into Major I with fairly lacklustre stats. The team has managed to stump up a 3-4 match win record this season, sitting in ninth place out of the twelve teams going to bat this year. At the time of writing, Heretics sit between Toronto KOI and Boston Breach, fairly far down the CDL standings.</p>



<p>However, some kind of resolve tightening must have happened going into the event, as Heretics managed to cling on against Toronto KOI and eliminate the team after an extremely close 3-2 series. It was neck and neck the entire way, and the final round of Search was only separated by two rounds.</p>



<p>The series against Vancouver Surge was more of a wash. Heretics managed to eliminate Surge, currently the last-placed team in the rankings, without the latter managing to secure a single map.</p>



<p>Heretics will arguably face a much tougher test in the next series, as it’s going to be against either Paris Gentle Mates or the LA Thieves. The first- and fifth-placed teams respectively, and both the subject of massive overhauls during the recent off-season.</p>



<p>If there’s one thing this season of the Call of Duty League has proven thus far, it’s that it might be one of the hardest years of COD esports to judge. Presently, the top four teams boast an identical match win record: Gentle Mates, FaZe Vegas, Riyadh Falcons, and the Carolina Royal Ravens. That’s followed closely behind by LAT and OpTic.</p>



<p>As the year unfolds, we’ll see more of a separation hopefully surface, but for now, it’s really (almost) anyone’s game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-season-dates-seemingly-leaked/</link>
            <guid>1421572</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a>, 2K Sports is leaving the traditional DLC packs in the past in favor of a new Ringside Pass. </p>



<p>This new pass is WWE 2K26’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-is-going-to-have-a-ringside-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">version of the Battle Pass system</a> that has made its way to all sorts of games over the years. The Ringside Pass will offer players 60 free tiers and 40 premium tiers to unlock. With the Ringside pass, players who reach tier 40 each season will be able to unlock new wrestlers, customization options, exclusive content, and more. </p>







<p><strong>“The Ringside Pass Premium replaces the previous DLC model, rewarding players with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-new playable characters</a> unavailable on the base game roster, including current Superstars, Legends, Personas, and some unexpected names,”</strong> 2K Sports said. </p>



<p>2K Sports is going to roll out the Ringside Pass in seasons throughout the game’s year on the market. The first season is scheduled for launch day with five others planned in the following months. And, now, thanks to the Nintendo eshop, those five other season dates have seemingly been leaked.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-season-release">WWE 2K26 Ringside Pass Season Release</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the first season will come on launch day–for King of Kings, Attitude Era, and Monday Night War Edition owners—on March 6. </p>



<p>Season 2 is scheduled for May 4; Season 3, June 29; Season 4, August 24; Season 5, October 19; and Season 6, December 14. </p>







<p>While we have the dates, specific details of what’s included in each season has yet to be announced. Those will come as each season approaches. </p>



<p>WWE 2K26 promises the largest roster in the history of the franchise with over 400 playable characters. With the Ringside Pass, 2K says players will have more options than ever before in a WWE game.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 launches globally for all players on March 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. </p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/apex-legends/" id="27">Apex Legends</a> will end service for the original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302">Nintendo Switch</a> on August 4. The Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Switch 2</a> version of the game, which launched in August 2025, will remain live.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/respawn-entertainment/" id="95172">Respawn Entertainment</a>, via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" id="52204">EA</a>‘s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/update-on-nintendo-switch-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, announced that season 29 will be the final update for Nintendo Switch, with all future updates continuing on the console’s successor. Season 30 begins on August 4.</p>



<p>The development team stressed that all progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to players’ individual EA accounts, and everything will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, regardless of when you purchase the console. It also stressed that the game will continue to be supported on all other platforms and that the reason for the switch, no pun intended, is to deliver the best possible experience and utilize the power of the Switch 2.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our goal is to deliver a high-quality experience. Thanks to Nintendo’s investment in the Nintendo Switch 2, the platform offers a great handheld experience for Apex Legends.”</p>

<p>As 2026 will be the first full calendar year with the Nintendo Switch 2 on the market, the transition away from the original Switch continues. Nintendo recently held a dedicated Direct to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reveals-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-release-date/" id="172885">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>. This is one of the final games designed specifically for the original Nintendo Switch, and it will also be playable on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Additionally, major Nintendo releases such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-release-date-announced/" id="171439">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> are receiving dedicated editions for the new Switch 2, adding enhanced visuals and new modes, further encouraging players to switch over.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard </a>has added a new gameplay mode, now available to play.</p>



<p>Highguard has added a 5v5 Raid Mode. The mode is now live, but it will be available for a limited time. The mode is experimental and is only playable this weekend. It’s a separate playlist and will not replace the 3v3 raids.</p>



<p>Lobbies have been updated to allow for parties of 5 for the weekend. Additionally, in this mode, Raids are now 10 lives instead of 6, and respawns are slightly longer to allow for generators to be planted or diffused.</p>



<p>A new base has also been added to Highguard. In addition to the new game mode, they have also added a new base, Soul Well. Described as a dark relic from a lost age, the new base has been added to the rotation in all game modes.</p>







<h2 id="h-quality-of-life-improvements-are-also-coming-to-highguard-in-this-patch">Quality-Of-Life Improvements Are Also Coming to Highguard in This Patch</h2>



<p>Additionally, there are several updates for optimization and quality of life. Several optimizations improve animation performance, projectile behavior, and other gameplay systems. These updates benefit both console and PC and will also include features such as a motion blur toggle.</p>



<p>The developers note that players in 3v3 playlists should see some improvements, but they ask for some leeway during testing of the new game mode. Also, Firing Range does not currently support 5v5.</p>
