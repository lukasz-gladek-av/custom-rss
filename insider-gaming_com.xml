<p>Space Marine 2’s update 12.0 is live now, introducing the new Techmarine class, more PvE content, a weapon, a new map, and so much more. </p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is on schedule with their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 2 roadmap</a>, with the new class, missions, and cosmetics arriving with Patch 12 in Q1 2026 as announced. Many details of this update were revealed in the PTS (public test server) patch notes, and it is now officially live. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-the-space-marine-2-techmarine-update-12-0">What’s New in the Space Marine 2 Techmarine Update 12.0? </h2>



<p>Space Marine 2 update 12.0’s highlight is the new playable class, Techmarine. This class features a technician with expertise in crowd control and defense. A lot of changes have been made to the class as part of the PTS update, including fixes and balancing adjustments. The Techmarine class also features a new weapon, the Omnissian Axe, which can deal damage to single enemies as well as surrounding crowds. </p>



<p>Then players can look forward to the Tarantula Sentry Gun as part of PvE content in this update, with Techmarines able to activate Sentry Turrets in PvE missions. The new PvE Map is called Disruption, and it takes the Space Marines to the Hive City of Avarax, where they have to “reinforce the overwhelmed Cadian defenses against a massive Tyranid swarm.”</p>



<p>The latest update for Space Marine 2 introduces several new features for players. These include new PvE equipment, Restorative Stims, and Shared Heads for both PvE and PvP characters, enhancing customization options. Additionally, a new Tech feature, Siege Host Migration, has been added, along with a VO Selector. </p>



<p>The update brings 21 new battlefield conditions, a Custom Stratagems Mode for PvE, and Heroic Items. Players can also look forward to fresh DLC content from the Raven Guard Champion Pack, gameplay and balancing tweaks, new custom armor set pieces, and various fixes.

<h3>New Class: Techmarine</h3>



<p><em>We are introducing a new playable class: the Techmarine! This mighty technician specialises in crowd control and area defense, handling multiple combat tasks simultaneously. This is primarily possible with his Servo-Gun ability. When activated, it locks onto enemies in a line of sight and automatically fires at them while the Techmarine continues fighting in melee or range. Furthermore, the Servo-Gun allows executing Gun Strikes without interrupting other actions.</em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce.

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>
