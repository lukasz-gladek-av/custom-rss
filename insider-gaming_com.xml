            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-kilo-141-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warzone Season 3 marks the long-awaited return of the Kilo 141 to cause chaos in Verdansk. Our Loadout will make the iconic AR dominate just as much as it did back in 2021.</p>



<p>Longtime series veterans will feel right at home on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> in Season 3. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CR-56 AMAX</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/">HDR</a>, Grau, and Kilo 141 are all back, giving players access to the four weapons that initially reigned supreme on the map.</p>



<p>In addition, Verdansk has a fresh coat of paint, as Raven Software improved the beloved map with enhanced visuals, lighting, and new textures. As players return and try to determine which AR is the best in Season 3, the Kilo 141 stands out as a clear contender.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Which Optic you use comes down to personal preference, but the other attachments are a must. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/wz3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueGameData</a>, The <strong>AK-74 and CR-56 AMAX</strong> have the <strong>two fastest time-to-kill speeds</strong> among long-range meta weapons. In saying that, the Kilo 141 isn’t too far behind, and the AR is easier to control due to its forgiving recoil pattern and steady fire rate.</p>



<p>Although you won’t get the same damage output from the Kilo 141 as with the CR-56 AMAX or AK-74, the reliable AR has a faster fire rate and bullet velocity than other top choices and shines even brighter with this set of attachments. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Willis 3X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Monolithic Suppressor </li>



<li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Reinforced Barrel </li>



<li><strong>UnderBarrel: </strong>Vertical Foregrip </li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag II </li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Be aware that this SMG does have some kick despite the attachments. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>Since the Kilo 141 is better suited for medium and long-range engagements, the best sidekick for this AR is an SMG to support short-range gunfights between 0 and 10 meters. </p>



<p>After having its maximum, medium, and minimum damage ranges buffed in Season 3 and its upper torso damage multiplier, the Kompakt 92 has the fastest time-to-kill of 550 milliseconds up to 13 meters away. A difficult-to-reign-in recoil pattern means using this SMG requires significant skill, but it’s lethal in the right hands. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Volzhskiy Reflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Compensator </li>



<li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Reinforced Barrel </li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>Vertical Foregrip </li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Infiltrator Stockn</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>Scavenger</strong>, <strong>Tracker</strong>, and <strong>Alertness</strong> are the best trio of Perks in Season 3.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1: </strong>Scavenger (Start equipped with maximum reserve ammo for your primary weapon. Resupply ammo equipment and plates from dead enemies)&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2: </strong>Tracker (See enemy footsteps. Bullets you fire briefly outline an enemy for you and your squad)</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3: </strong>Alertness (Sense enemies when enemies are nearby. Tell when you are being aimed at by the enemy)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Since armor plates are so hard to come by, <strong>Scavenger</strong> is a must-use Perk for every loadout because you can get more armor off dead enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, losing enemies while chasing after them on Verdansk is easy, so <strong>Tracker </strong>allows you to see their recent footsteps. Also, hitting an enemy further away increases the time they are outlined. And even though Raven Software added new objects on the map to provide cover in open areas, there is always the danger of getting taken out by a one-shot sniper or an enemy with better positioning than you. <strong>Alertness</strong> alleviates this issue by pinging your screen when someone sees you.</p>







<p><strong>Overkill</strong> is the best Wildcard to use. In Season 3, Raven Software removed the ability to purchase loadout weapons from the Buy Station. As a result, the only way to acquire loadout weapons is through loadout drops. </p>



<p>So, while having three extra attachments on a weapon with the Gunfighter Wildcard would be nice, we recommend using Overkill to give you a second primary weapon because acquiring one will otherwise be difficult. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-kilo-141-in-warzone">How to unlock Kilo 141 in Warzone</h2>



<p><strong>The Kilo 141 is a reward in Warzone’s return to Verdansk event, meaning all you have to do is log in to the battle royale to unlock the AR instantly.</strong></p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2 will be released on April 8 across all platforms. It will bring improvements, bug fixes, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-title-update-1-0-2">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2</h2>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows development team has been working on this first batch of improvements since launch, and the changes in this update have been inspired by player feedback. Title update 1.0.2 for AC Shadows features several highlights, including selling and dismantling multiple items, the ability to reset mastery nodes, horse improvements, an Investigation Board shortcut and PS5 Pro enhancements. Check out all the new improvements and changes in the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Title Update 1.0.2 below:&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-horse-improvements">Horse Improvements</h3>



<p>The first significant improvement from tomorrow’s AC Shadows update features changes towards the horse. Players can activate the pathfinder to enable Auto-Follow, and the horse will automatically follow the road to the destination. Also, horses are now quicker in cities, so players can glide through these areas much faster.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-mastery-nodes-reset">Mastery Nodes Reset</h3>



<p>Many fans will appreciate this change as it lets them fine-tune their builds according to their preferred play styles. Players can now reset Mastery Nodes for both Yasuke and Naoe, allowing you to test different play styles before finding what suits you the best. It also lets you explore all the game has to offer gameplay-wise.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-selling-and-dismantling-multiple-items">Selling and Dismantling Multiple Items</h3>



<p>This is an exciting update for players who have been hoarding resources during exploration. It will allow them to manage and utilize their surplus items efficiently. The new update will add an option to tag and sell/dismantle multiple items in shops or while dismantling gear at the Forge.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-investigation-board-shortcut">Investigation Board Shortcut</h3>



<p>One of the features of the new update will let you reach the investigation board faster than ever before. After the update is released, you only need to hold the ‘Options’ button for a few seconds to teleport to the Investigation Board. A single press will still let you open the inventory.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-ps5-pro-improvements-for-ac-shadows">PS5 Pro Improvements for AC Shadows</h3>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has received dedicated PS5 Pro improvements in Title Update 1.0.2. Firstly, PSSR support has been added, and players playing before the upcoming update must manually enable this mode through video settings. Also, the balanced mode will feature ‘Raytraced Specular,’ providing visual fidelity close to PS5 Pro Quality mode.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-12-year-low-amid-company-uncertainty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s stock prices have continued to fall, hitting a 12-year low on both the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UBI-FR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paris Stock Exchange</a> and <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/market-stock/0NVL/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">London Stock Exchange</a>. As of the markets closing in the region, Ubisoft stock is trading under €9 for the first time since April 2013.</p>



<p>As of publishing, the stock is sitting at €8.80 after falling another 7.83% on Monday. At one point it sat at €8.27 before it rose back to the closing number.</p>



<p>The reasons for the continued drop of Ubisoft’s stock prices should be surprising to anyone who has followed the company over the years. Since April 2024, Ubisoft’s shares have fallen 62.9% from its 52-week high of €23.70 to the €8.80 it currently sits. The company’s shares fell under €10 back in late October 2024 when it was announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows would be delayed to 2025. However, it rebounded slightly back to over €14 per share not long after.</p>







<p>Fast forward to late March and early April, the company’s prices continued to gradually drop again. The big drop came, however, after Ubisoft announced it had reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a deal with Tencent</a> on a new subsidiary that would include the publisher’s three biggest franchises—Far Cry, Rainbow Six Siege, and Assassin’s Creed—and give Tencent a 25% stake in the new venture. After a slight uptick, stock prices fell from €13.15 on March 27, the day of the deal, to €10.70 in just three days of trading. Since then, the prices continued to fall to what they are now. </p>



<p>There’s also the global uncertainty surrounding a potential recession that has the entire market falling over the last handful days. </p>



<p>Do you make anything of Ubisoft’s stock prices continuing to fall lately? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
