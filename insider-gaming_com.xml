<p>Chances are, you’ve come across the Organless Corpse in the Examination Room in Resident Evil Requiem. You need a set of Artificial Lungs and an Artificial Heart to complete this puzzle, and this walkthrough will guide you every step of the way.</p>



<p>The Care Center isn’t the most friendly and hospitable of places in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, at least not in its current state. There are locked doors, mean zombies, and an open corpse of all things. This particular body has something you desperately need, and the Organless Corpse puzzle is a fun one.</p>

<h3 id="h-1-get-level-1-id-wristband">1. Get Level 1 ID Wristband</h3>



<ol>
<li>If you’ve found the corpse, it means you’re far enough into the game to be able to start this quest.</li>



<li>You need to go up the stairs (just South of the <strong>Nurse’s Station</strong>) and deal with the two zombies at the top of the stairs.</li>



<li>Collect the <strong>Level 1 ID Wristband</strong> from the floor.</li>



<li>Run away and escape from the giant baby AKA Chunk Zombie.</li>
</ol>







<h3 id="h-2-get-the-corrosive-substance">2. Get The Corrosive Substance</h3>



<ol>
<li>Once you’re free, head to the <strong>Conference Room</strong>.</li>



<li>Be warned, there are three regular Zombies and a shrieking Zombie.</li>



<li>It’s advised you deal with all of them—especially the shrieking Zombie, as it’s tied to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-trophies-achievement-list/" id="177773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophy</a>.</li>



<li>In the room with the shrieking Zombie, you will find the <strong>Corrosive </strong>sitting on a surface under a light.</li>



<li>Pick it up to add to your inventory.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-3-get-the-notebook-amp-sun-quartz">3. Get The Notebook &amp; Sun Quartz</h3>



<ol>
<li>Head straight to the <strong>Lead Researcher’s Office</strong>.</li>



<li>Use the <strong>Corrosive</strong> on the blue lock attached to the puzzle box in the back office.</li>



<li>The room has pictures of the researchers, which piece the solution together if you want to solve it yourself.</li>



<li><strong>Spoiler: </strong>The answer will be the next step.</li>



<li>Enter Star, Sun, Moon, and Sun.</li>



<li>Take the Sun Quartz and <strong>Notebook</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-4-artificial-lungs-in-garage">4. Artificial Lungs In Garage</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<ol>
<li>Head to the <strong>West Wing</strong>.</li>



<li>Go past the <strong>Parlor </strong>and deal with the Zombie in this corridor—this Zombie can become mutated, so it might be wise to use a Hemolytic Injector on it!</li>



<li>Use the Level 1 ID Wristband on the door at the end of the corridor.</li>



<li>Go into the <strong>Custodian’s Office</strong>.</li>



<li>Grab the <strong>Wrench</strong>.</li>



<li>Head into the <strong>Garage</strong>.</li>



<li>Take the <strong>Organ Transport Box</strong> from the truck.</li>



<li>Rotate it so that you can access the lock mechanism.</li>



<li>Use the <strong>Notebook</strong> you obtained from <strong>Sun Quartz Puzzle</strong> to find the solution and open the box.</li>



<li>You now have the <strong>Artificial Lungs</strong>.</li>



<li>Shoot the zombie in the digger to overcome the mini-boss fight.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-5-artificial-heart-in-cold-storage">5. Artificial Heart In Cold Storage</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Cold Storage</strong> room.</li>



<li>Interact with the valve (you might have already, it doesn’t matter) so that it falls off.</li>



<li>Use the <strong>Wrench </strong>in its place to open the door.</li>



<li>Grab the <strong>Artificial Heart</strong> from the hook in the middle of the room.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-6-renaimate-the-organless-corpse">6. Renaimate The Organless Corpse</h3>



<ol>
<li>Take the heart and the lungs all the way back to the <strong>Examination Room</strong>.</li>



<li>Place them inside the open body.</li>



<li>The corpse will suddenly come to life and attack you.</li>



<li>Defeat it.</li>



<li>Take the <strong>Level 2 ID Wristband</strong>!</li>
</ol>

            <title><![CDATA[BLAST Revamps Counter-Strike Calendar with $10 Million Investment]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blast-counter-strike-calendar-investment/</link>
            <guid>1449538</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>BLAST has set the stage for one of the biggest structural overhauls in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/counter-strike/" id="482">Counter-Strike’s</a> history, unveiling a massive redesign of the BLAST Premier circuit that will kick off in 2027. This update marks a decisive pivot towards a full LAN-focused model, deeper integration with Valve’s Regional Standings, and a significant financial boost aimed at stabilizing the competitive scene.</p>



<p>At the heart of the overhaul sits a whopping $10 million investment directly into teams and the wider ecosystem, which is a leap up from the $8.5 million commitment in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-blast-bags-bigger-financial-commitment">BLAST Bags Bigger Financial Commitment</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blast/" id="3530">BLAST</a> has promised that the $10 million investment for 2027 will be spent across four critical pillars:</p>



<ul>
<li>Prize Money</li>



<li>Team Payments</li>



<li>Acceptance Fees</li>



<li>Player Experience Investment</li>
</ul>



<p>The lion’s share of the $10 million goes to team payments, with $4.5 million being attributed to ‘performance-based compensation retained by organizations.’</p>



<p>Behind that, there will be $3 million prize money, and $1.8 million reserved as rewards for teams attending events. The player experience portion of that investment concerns upgrades to travel, accommodation, and on-site conditions.</p>



<p>This is all part of BLAST’s drive to produce a more LAN-centric competitive structure. The endeavour means that some major changes have taken place:</p>



<ul>
<li>BLAST Bounty is reduced from 32 to 16 teams and will now focus 100% on LAN play</li>



<li>More regional open qualifiers will be hosted across all territories</li>



<li>An extra week of competition has been added to the overall season</li>
</ul>



<p>BLAST Bounty, Open, and Rivals have all been brought back with key refinements, but it’s Bounty that faces the biggest changes.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://blast.tv/cs/news/premier-2027-new-formats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a>, Anne Banschbach, the Programme Director for BLAST Premier, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are evolving BLAST Premier to better serve the entire Counter-Strike ecosystem.</p>



<p>Increasing our investment to $10 million is not just about bigger prize pools, it is about revamping our formats to deliver a more sustainable and premium experience for teams, players and fans.</p>



<p>With a fully LAN-focused structure, stronger VRS impact and the removal of main event online matches, the biggest moments will play out on the biggest stages.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>BLAST Rivals remains the ‘crowning jewel’ of the ecosystem in 2027, and will retain the same eight-team format. <strong>But</strong>, in 2027, the prize pool will be increased to the maximum possible – $1.25 million.</p>
