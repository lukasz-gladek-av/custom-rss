<p>According to a new court filing, the Former Activision Blizzard CEO stated that Call of Duty’s performance fell by 60% compared to 2024 due to games like Battlefield 6. </p>



<p>New developments have started popping up in the Delaware lawsuit against Microsoft, Activision, and other board members, including Kotick. The former CEO has already claimed that this lawsuit was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kotick-says-activision-lawsuit-was-meant-to-help-embracer-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed to benefit the Embracer Group</a> at Activision’s expense. Additionally, he has spoken about Call of Duty’s performance visibly declining since his departure.</p>







<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-s-performance-affected-by-battlefield-6-defeats-ftc-s-argument-about-lack-of-competition">Call of Duty’s Performance Affected by Battlefield 6, Defeats FTC’s Argument About Lack of Competition</h2>



<p><span>A report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bobby-kotick-activision-microsoft-ap7-lawsuit-embracer-group" target="_blank">GameFile</a></span>&nbsp;indicates that Kotick has acknowledged that Microsoft has benefited from the Activision Blizzard deal. However, he noted that the recent performance of the company has fallen “well below” their long-term targets. Kotick specifically addressed the performance of Call of Duty, mentioning that it is projected to perform over 60 percent below last year’s figures due to intense competition from titles such as Battlefield.</p>



<p>Kotick also points out that this fall effectively undermines the FTC’s argument regarding a “lack of competition in the first-person action game category” due to the acquisition. For those unaware, the FTC was attempting to block the deal, arguing that it would diminish competition in both the console and cloud markets, ultimately harming consumers by leading to higher prices and reduced innovation in the gaming industry.</p>







<p>In other news, EA has announced that the start of Battlefield 6 and Battlefield REDSEC Season 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been delayed</a>. Additionally, Activision has released&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-releases-new-black-ops-7-patch-with-weapons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new patch</a>&nbsp;for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 that updates several weapons.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new court filing from the Former Activision Blizzard CEO claims that the Delaware lawsuit was designed to benefit Embracer Group; however, Embracer has denied these allegations.  </p>



<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bobby-kotick-activision-microsoft-ap7-lawsuit-embracer-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameFile</a>, the Delaware lawsuit was initiated by the Swedish pension fund Sjunde AP-Fonden, commonly known as AP7. This fund has accused the former CEO of accelerating the acquisition process in order to overshadow the sexual misconduct scandals that were emerging against the company in late 2021. The lawsuit against Microsoft, Activision Blizzard, and various board members, including Bobby Kotick, has now been met with a response from the former CEO.</p>











<p>The former CEO of Activision Blizzard stated that “this Delaware lawsuit was apparently aimed to help pave the way for Embracer to increase its foothold in the California market at the expense of Activision.” Kotick’s response added that this situation made it more difficult for Activision to attract new talent and hindered its ability to expand through mergers and acquisitions, a strategy it has historically relied on for growth. </p>



<p>The Embracer Group has denied the claims made by the former Activision Blizzard CEO, stating that “perhaps difficult to accept for Mr. Kotick, but we did not and do not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision.” </p>







<p>In other news, Activision has released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-releases-new-black-ops-7-patch-with-weapons-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new patch</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 that updates several weapons.

            <title><![CDATA[Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake Rated By ESRB]]></title>

            <guid>1405384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is getting close as it’s finally gotten an official rating from the ESRB.</p>



<p>The game has been rated T for Teen, keeping it in line with the rating for the original game. According to the official ESRB page the game received the rating it did for blood, partial nudity, sexual themes, and violence. </p>







<p><strong>“This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of a Persian prince on a quest to break a curse,”</strong> the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/37363/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rating summary reads.</a> <strong>“From a third-person perspective, players traverse platform environments, sole puzzles, avoid traps (e.g., spike pits, wall-mounted blades and saws), and battle cursed soldiers and creatures made of sand. Players use swords and daggers to defeat enemies in melee-style combat.”</strong></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the summary it mentions that fights feature sword clashing along with cries of pain and blood splatter. There’s also a 2D side-scrolling sequence that depicts blood pools when the prince dies. </p>



<h3 id="h-when-will-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release">When Will Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake Release?</h3>



<p>Insider Gaming has reported on the plans for the release of the game. At one point, based on internal documents seen by Insider Gaming, the plan was to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release the game sometime</a> in mid-January. While those plans could always change, it does appear that Ubisoft is getting ready for some sort of announcement regarding the long-awaited remake of the 2003 classic. To add to it, it appears the game’s website has <a href="https://x.com/TheRealZephryss/status/2010732617235378684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently been seeing updates</a>, as well.</p>







<p>One thing worth mentioning is the rating mentions the game coming to the Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. There’s no mention of the PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch 2. That’s certainly going to be updated whenever Ubisoft officially announces the game’s release. </p>



<p>When do you think Ubisoft will announce something regarding the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake now that its ESRB rating is public?
