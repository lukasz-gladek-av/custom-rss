<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-zombies-split-screen-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Zombies</a> brings the traditional round-based format back, and players have been digging their teeth into Liberty Falls and Terminus, reaching high rounds and discovering the Main Quest for both maps.</p>



<p>Treyarch love to hide little secrets and Easter eggs in Zombies, which have become an integral part of the experience in the mode. Speaking of which, you may have found Loot Keys in both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a> and wondered what they are and how to use them.</p>



<p>So, here’s what to do with Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-loot-keys-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to use Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>You can use Loot Keys to <strong>open safe deposit boxes in the Liberty Falls Vault and lockers in Terminus Armory</strong>. You can get different rarities of Loot Key. The higher the rarity, the better the loot will be in the respective caches.</p>



<p>If you’re lucky enough, you can earn yourself a free Perk, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapon</a>, or even a Legendary weapon. You can also get Equipment, Scorestreaks, Salvage, and more. You can only open one safe deposit box or locker per Loot Key.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-liberty-falls-vault-combination-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Liberty Falls Vault combination in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>The Vault is in the Liberty Falls Bank and you’ll need to enter the combination to enter it. You can find the combination by following these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>On the front desk of the Bank, you’ll find a yellow post-it note with a number and three blank spaces. This is the first number for the Vault combination. </li>



<li>You’ll find the second number in Fuller’s Liberty Lanes on the front desk just under the desk lamp to the right of the lanes.</li>



<li>The final number is in Olly’s Comics on the inside of the shelf in the middle counter area where the employee’s dead body can be found.</li>
</ol>



<p>Combine the numbers in the correct order and enter the combination at the Vault to open it and earn some great loot. </p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-use-loot-keys-in-terminus">Where to use Loot Keys in Terminus</h2>



<p><strong>You can use Loot Keys on Terminus in the Armory</strong>, which is located in the same room as Stamin-Up (lower floor of the Control Center). Here, you’ll see a door with some computers near it and a set of windows looking into the Armory. Simply walk to the door, enter the Armory, and use a Loot Key on one of the lockers to earn some loot.</p>



<p>You don’t need to do anything to unlock the Armory door, all you need to do is walk up to it and enter. Don’t worry about Zombies pilling up outside the Armory either, as once you leave a massive blast will eliminate Zombies in the area so you can get out scot-free.</p>
