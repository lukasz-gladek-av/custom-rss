<p>Xbox is set to get a new game from a “legendary Japanese IP” in 2025. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-2025-predictions-and-overview-microsofts-most-promising-games-line-up-in-history-meets-a-platform-under-duress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden</a> of Windows Central, the mystery game during Xbox’s upcoming Developer Direct will be from a classic Japanese franchise.</p>



<p>Corden didn’t spoil anything regarding what the game may be, but did say it has “decades of history”.</p>



<p>“[Our] sources indicate that it is a new entry in a legendary Japanese IP which has decades of history, and should make a lot of fans happy,” he said.</p>



<p>He continued: “Indeed, Microsoft has won some strong support from the region lately from studios like Square Enix for Final Fantasy, HoYoverse for Genshin Impact, and Sega/ATLUS for Persona, and we suspect this new game will help further that trend.”</p>



<p>Aside from the unknown Japanese title, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct</a> on January 23 will feature looks at games like South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>







<p>“Presented by the game creators themselves, Developer_Direct offers an in-depth look at upcoming titles, how they’re being created, and who’s creating them,” Xbox says. </p>



<p>In addition to the four games expected to be shown during the event, Xbox is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-xbox-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gearing up for a strong</a> 2025. The company also has Avowed scheduled to release in February as well as the reboot of Fable expected to launch sometime this year.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of 2025’s most anticipated games. It’s a direct continuation of the 2018 title that introduced Warhorse Studios’ open-world RPG universe to the wider gaming community. Like many games these days, many players are asking one question about this impending release: ‘Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 coming to Game Pass?’</p>



<p>Let’s dive into that topic and find out if this game will be released on Xbox or PC Game Pass – or both.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-kingdom-come-be-on-game-pass">Will Kingdom Come Be On Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will not be on Game Pass at launch</strong>, but it could be added to the service further down the line. In 2019, the first Kingdom Come title was added to Game Pass – but it has since been removed.</p>



<p>Those seeking to enjoy Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on Xbox and PC will need to do so after paying full price for the game.</p>



<p>When Kingdom Come Deliverance was added to Game Pass all those years ago, it was still a relatively unknown, assuming title – little more than an indie release at that point. This time around, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a highly anticipated, epic title backed by a big publisher and years of development. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-being-added-to-ps-plus">Is Kingdom Come Being Added to PS Plus?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s no indication that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be added to PS Plus</strong> – it’s the same situation as the Game Pass question.</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2022, Kingdom Come Deliverance appeared on PS Plus. It was removed a few months later at the start of 2023, just a short while before the follow-up title was announced.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on February 4, 2025. Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you intend to buy the game when it’s out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Call of Duty Down? COD Server Status and Problems]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty is a series that boasts one of the most diverse multiplayer-based gaming ecosystems in the industry. From a popular battle royale game to a thriving mobile platform, Call of Duty is known and loved by hundreds of millions of gamers around the world. However, the game almost <strong>requiring </strong>an internet connection to work means that players will often run into issues. </p>



<p>In this guide, I’m going to help answer one core question: ‘Is Call of Duty down?’ If it <strong>is</strong>, we’ll let you know how to get back online as soon as possible.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-server-status-guide">COD Server Status Guide</h2>



<p>It’s relatively simple to find out if Call of Duty is offline, whether that’s Black Ops 6, Warzone, or Call of Duty Mobile. If you’re finding that Call of Duty is down for you, you can access the following link and check out COD’s server status:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.activision.com/onlineservices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision Support Server Status Page</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s typically updated in real-time, but what if Call of Duty is down for you even if that status page reflects that everything is fine from a technical standpoint?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-call-of-duty-down-here-s-what-you-can-do">Is Call of Duty Down? Here’s What You Can Do</h2>



<p>Let’s say you’re enjoying a Call of Duty session and suddenly you find that Black Ops 6 is offline for no real reason. What do you do in that situation?</p>



<p>Firstly, you can check the status page as referenced above. It’s also a good idea to check out Down Detector, a service that allows users to report issues with games, applications, and websites. Failing that, consider jumping onto social media and running a search with a term like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Is Black Ops 6 down’</li>



<li>‘Is Call of Duty down’</li>



<li>‘Is Warzone down’</li>



<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re racking your brain for an answer, consider reaching out to <a href="https://twitter.com/ATVIAssist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Activision Support team</a> on Twitter (X). </p>



<p>There are a few generic networking tips you can take advantage of if you’re still not finding an answer. For instance, you can try rebooting your device (a hard reset if possible), using a wired or alternate connection, rebooting your router, or taking the last-ditch action to simply wait, play something else, and come back later.</p>



<p>If Call of Duty is down at that moment, it might not be in an hour or two.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It appears that Konami is set to release Metal Gear Solid Delta on the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 this year. This according to the leaker Nate the Hate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who’s been in the news</a> for his other Switch 2 reports.</p>



<p>The news comes from his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest podcast</a> which also says that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-revealed-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo will reveal</a> its Switch 2 console this week.</p>



<p>“[Other] third party games I have heard include Metal Gear Solid Delta, which is coming out in 2025,” Nate the Hate said. “Right now, it lacks a release date for all platforms, and I’m hopeful that maybe it’s a day and date release when it does come to Switch 2, because if that game, let’s say comes out in the summer of 2025, there’s no reason it shouldn’t be day and date.”</p>



<p>In addition to Metal Gear Solid Delta, Nate the Hate says that Ubisoft will be releasing a number of games on the new system. Those games reportedly include Assassins Creed Shadows, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Division, and even Rainbow Six Siege. </p>



<p>As always none of the above information has been confirmed. Until it is—or Insider Gaming can independently verify—please take it all with a grain of salt.</p>
