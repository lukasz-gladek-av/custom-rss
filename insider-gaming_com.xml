<p>A development build for Titan Quest 2 has been leaked online. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://en.gamegpu.com/game/v-set-utekla-sborka-titan-quest-2-beta-3-1-for-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameGPU</a>, the build is a beta version of the game from early November. This build, dupped Beta 3.1, doesn’t feature any multiplayer aspects. Rather, it’s deployment was for internal testing of various gameplay features. You can watch some of the leaked gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVIDMQ_DNYQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">if you’d like</a> should it not be taken offline.</p>



<p>Obviously, it’s not a final build of the game and players should expect changes between what they see and what they’ll get.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to THQ Nordic and developer Grimlore Games for comment on the reported leak. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>



<p>A sequel to 2006’s Titan Quest, fans have been waiting nearly 20 years for the next game in the series. The mythology-themed action RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t feature any</a> pay-to-win or loot boxes, according to its developers.</p>



<p>“We do despise this with a passion,” Grimlore Games said. “There will never ever be any monetization mechanic in the game, urging you to spend money on any gameplay-related item to give anybody an advantage.”</p>



<p>Regarding its planned early access release, they added that they want players involved from the start, and for the game to “stand its own ground”.</p>



<p>“We want Titan Quest 2 to stand its own ground within the ARPG genre and we are convinced that there is only one way to pull it off: swarm intelligence,” they said.</p>



<p>Titan Quest 2 is scheduled to launch in sometime in 2025, and will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. An exact release date has yet to be announced. </p>

<p>The latest trailer for Atomfall, Rebellion’s upcoming open-world survival shooter, has emerged online. It’s a seven-minute trailer that explores the game’s core mechanics, including interactions with NPCs, crafting and upgrading items, traversing quests, and dealing with factions.</p>



<p>It’s a fantastic glimpse into this upcoming title, which is set to be released in March and is coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one. I was fortunate to play Atomfall at Gamescom and speak to the developers – I can attest to how stellar this game is.</p>



<p>And yes, it’s kind of like Fallout in the UK.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-atomfall">Prepare for Atomfall</h2>



<p>Atomfall is <strong>kind of </strong>like Fallout, but it’s perfectly unique. It’s set in the UK’s Lake District, which means it’s an idyllic game with gorgeous vistas and sumptuous, lush environments. It’s an alternate history game, taking the real-world Windscale Nuclear Disaster of 1957 and making it something otherworldly and almost ethereal.</p>



<p>From tussling with brutal ‘raiders’ in above-ground post-apocalyptic settlements to diving into twisted, horrifying bunkers, Atomfall promises to offer a varied and diverse experience. It’s all about survival, and that means that the typical mechanics you’d expect are present:</p>



<ul>
<li>Scavenging, buying, and bartering for resources</li>



<li>Upgrading and repairing weapons and other items</li>



<li>Looting and trading across the open world</li>



<li>Building a character that suits your playstyle</li>



<li>Managing weight, health, and tools</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>

<p>I’m a huge Fallout fan, and I’m mourning the immense weight on our plates until Fallout 5 comes out. While Atomfall isn’t technically a <strong>fully </strong>post-apocalyptic game set in a nuclear wasteland, it’s damn close. Most importantly, it <strong>looks </strong>like a Fallout game, featuring robots, some bizarre weapons, kooky faction members, and a branching, winding story filled with side content.</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s a blend between Fallout and STALKER.</p>



<p>When I played Atomfall at Gamescom, I was immediately won over. Not only does it look stunning, but it plays well, and as it’s a survival game at heart, decision-making is key. Should you take a cricket bat and try to overpower a guard in a settlement to get a gun before using a few rounds to fight the others, or should you try and stealth-kill everyone in the camp? Or avoid it entirely? It’s up to you.</p>



<p>Atomfall will be released on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and PC on March 27.</p>
