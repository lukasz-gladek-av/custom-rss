<p>Game Science has dropped a tease at an expansion to the story of Black Myth: Wukong, confirming the Journey to the West is not over.</p>



<p>The title, which was released last year and is finally joining Xbox on August 20, was a breakout success for the studio, with many expecting DLC would be announced at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Instead, the finale of Gamescom Opening Night Live was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-zhongkui-revealed-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer for Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>, a brand-new title from Game Science that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-zhong-kui-a-sequel-to-black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong</a>—but more could be on the horizon.</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a> for Black Myth: Zhong Kui, a series of questions and answers were shared about the development of the new title, with one stand-out entry concerning the decision to develop a brand-new game and not create a sequel for Black Myth: Wukong.</p>



<p>Explaining the decision, Game Science stated the aspiration to “take a tentative first step” to “build more game experiences,” “challenge ourselves with bolder features,” and “bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design.”</p>



<p>The key detail concerning Wukong, however, came right at the end with a message that said: “And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong, the westward journey won’t end here.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear whether the story from Wukong will continue in a new title as a direct sequel, or whether DLC is planned for the original title.</p>



<p>If the plan is for a direct sequel, that would likely come after the release of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, which itself is a long way off, considering development is in very early stages and “even Yocar himself has absolutely no idea” when a release will be.</p>



<p>Do you want to see DLC released for Black Myth: Wukong, or are you happy to wait for a direct sequel? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3347/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Game Science dropped a huge surprise during Gamescom Opening Night Live with the reveal of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, and the title immediately raises questions on whether it is a direct sequel to Black Myth: Wukong.</p>



<p>The finale of Gamescom Opening Night Live was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-zhongkui-revealed-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal of Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>, with the footage showing the character from Chinese mythology riding on the back of a giant tiger, earning awe from the audience.</p>



<p>As both titles share the Black Myth name, some confusion around Zhong Kui’s sequel status has emerged, but we’ve got all the answers you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-myth-zhong-kui-a-black-myth-wukong-sequel">Is Black Myth: Zhong Kui a Black Myth: Wukong Sequel?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Menacing. Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Black Myth: Zhong Kui is not a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong, Game Science has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>, several questions on the development of Black Myth: Zhong Kui were answered, including why a decision was made to release a new title and not provide a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong first.</p>



<p>The question itself makes it clear that Zhong Kui is not a sequel to Wukong, instead telling a story elsewhere within Chinese mythology, though there could be references and Easter Eggs connecting the game to Wukong.</p>



<p>There are many similarities between the games, however, with Black Myth: Zhong Kui sharing “the same foundation of ancient Chinese myth and folklore,” while the game will remain a standard single-player ARPG, “following the same business model as before.”</p>



<p>Given the very early stage in development, however, full details on Black Myth: Zhong Kui are not yet known, and it could be a while before more concrete reveals are shared.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-myth-wukong-receive-a-sequel">Will Black Myth: Wukong Receive a Sequel?</h2>



<p><strong>Game Science has not confirmed whether Black Myth: Wukong will receive a sequel or additional DLC, though it appears the door is open.</strong></p>



<p>At the end of the question on the website concerning why Black Myth: Zhong Kui was chosen for development, players were assured that “the westward journey won’t end here.”</p>



<p>No further details have been provided, however, but stay tuned for more news from Game Science in the future, particularly given the long-awaited Xbox release.</p>

<p>Returning from Ghost of Tsushima, the free co-op Legends mode will launch in 2026 for Ghost of Yotei. </p>



<p>The original Ghost of Tsushima added Legends, which brought fans to an otherworldly battleground. You and four resurrected warriors would take on the demonic forces to survive. While not included in the base game at launch, Legends was a huge success and brought many back to the game. Now, Ghost of Yotei plans to bring it back in 2026.</p>



<p><strong>This story is breaking news, so updates, including more information, will be done after publication.</strong></p>

<p>While we don’t see any gameplay of it, the stinger at the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM08YoziYJs">latest Ghost of Yotei trailer</a> revealed that Legends is returning. It will bring back the four-player co-op experience from Ghost of Tsushima, now for new audiences. As mentioned by Geoff Keighley at Gamescom Opening Night Live, the experience will be free, so all can play it. It is currently set to launch sometime in 2026, but it’s likely we’ll hear more closer to Ghost of Yotei’s October 3rd launch.</p>
