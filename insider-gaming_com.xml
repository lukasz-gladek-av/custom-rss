            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 launched to high praise back in late 2025, and before long, Season 1 kicked off the live-service model for the title. Just as fans were beginning to get excited for Season 2, though, EA broke some very sour news—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2 had been delayed</a>. </p>



<p>Instead of a new Season kicking off on January 20, it was revealed that Season 2 had been pushed back to February 17, leaving three weeks devoid of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new content</a>. Luckily for fans, EA has revealed its short-term plans to fill the gap with the Frostfire Bonus Path.</p>







<p>If you’re still playing Battlefield 6 and eager for new content, check out what’s in store while you wait for Season 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-frostfire-bonus-path-in-battlefield-6">What Is The Frostfire Bonus Path In Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New content isn’t too far off. Image by EA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Frostfire Bonus Path is a new pathway of rewards coming alongside the Season 1 Battle Pass, launching on January 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>At this moment in time, the full Bonus Path hasn’t been shared online, but some details have been made available. Rewards will range from a new Weapon Package and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-fans-art-copy-call-of-duty-ghosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soldier Skin</a> to various XP Boosts.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, not all of it will come for free. EA have confirmed that some content will require the purchase of the Season 1 Battle Pass. Here are some of the upcoming Frostfire Bonus Path content broken down into free and paid rewards.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Free Rewards</th><th data-align="center">Paid Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Hardware XP Boost</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Package</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vehicle Skin</td><td data-align="center">Career XP Boost</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Playercard Customization Items</td><td data-align="center">Additional Customization Items</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-are-rewards-unlocked-on-the-frostfire-bonus-path-in-battlefield-6">How Are Rewards Unlocked On The Frostfire Bonus Path In Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hopefully more maps are on the horizon. Image by EA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Rewards on the Frostfire Bonus Path are unlocked with Bonus Path Points; these are earned by completing Weekly Challenges.</strong></p>



<p>The Frostfire Bonus Path can be completed alongside the Season 1 Battle Pass, so you won’t need to choose to make progress between the prior paths and the new one. To make progress through the Bonus Path, though, you’ll need Bonus Path Points, with every ten unlocking a new reward.</p>







<p>Weekly Challenges are the source of these points, but the amount of points varies depending on the difficulty of the challenge. That being said, not all Weekly Challenges reward Bonus Path Points, so be sure to check the in-game Challenges menu for more detailed information.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hitman: World of Assassination is getting a cross-progression update on February 3, 2026. </p>



<p>It has been a long time since we received an update for Hitman: World of Assassination. The last update we saw was a big one, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eminem-joins-hitman-world-of-assassination-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eminem</a> was announced as part of an Elusive Target Mission in the game. Now, the latest update doesn’t feature any content, but it’s still handy for players who play across different platforms. </p>







<h2 id="h-hitman-world-of-assassination-cross-progression-details">Hitman: World of Assassination Cross Progression Details </h2>



<p>As revealed in the new <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Hitman: World of Assassination’s Cross-Progression update will allow players to carry their in-game progression to any device they choose. Ahead of the update, a Steam patch will be released to ensure the feature works properly before it is released to the public. </p>



<p>While the Cross Progression feature is enabled, players can store and share their progress online across devices linked to the user’s IOI account. One device will serve as their primary progression profile, and all other platforms will be linked to it. While using cross-progression in Hitman: World of Assassination, Game License, DLC License, and DLC-based unlocks will not be shared, only the following data is shared across all platforms: </p>



<ul>
<li>Experience&nbsp;</li>



<li>Player Level&nbsp;</li>



<li>Challenges&nbsp;</li>



<li>Location Mastery&nbsp;</li>



<li>Unlocks and Inventory&nbsp;</li>



<li>Achievements / Trophies&nbsp;</li>



<li>Freelancer Mode Progression&nbsp;</li>



<li>Campaign Story Progress&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The DLC content should be owned on the platform they are playing, or else it won’t be accessible. Additionally, old save games from non-primary devices cannot be loaded via cross-progression; to load them, you will have to turn off the feature. Additionally, the Hitman 2 to Hitman 3 carryover process will be disabled from February 3, once cross-progression launches for Hitman: World of Assassination. </p>







<p>In other news, Hitman 4 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hitman-4-unofficially-confirmed-by-io-interactive-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unofficially revealed</a> by the IO Interactive CEO last month.

            <title><![CDATA[Russia’s ‘Call of Duty’ Could Cost 10 Billion Rubles, But The Government is Ready]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/russia-call-of-duty-10-billion-rubles-government-ready/</link>
            <guid>1410808</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Russia is still preparing to make good on a promise to create a homegrown rival to Call of Duty. The dream is edging closer to reality, as government ministries signal they are prepared to offer immense financial support, tax breaks, and other incentives to <strong>any Russian studio </strong>willing to take on the gargantuan task.</p>



<p>The idea, which was first pushed by State Duma deputy Mikhail Delyagin, has now procured an official response from Russia’s Ministry of Digital Development. The numbers being lobbied are <strong>staggering</strong>, and the appropriate bodies could grant as much as <strong>10 billion rubles </strong>($128 million) to the right studio.</p>







<h2 id="h-russia-s-call-of-duty-clone-could-become-reality">Russia’s Call of Duty Clone Could Become Reality</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve discussed Russia’s gaming aspirations in recent years. In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/putin-russia-gaming/">Vladimir Putin ordered</a> Russian tech titans to manufacture a range of home consoles that could eventually compete with the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. That front has gone somewhat quiet, but a new, software-based dream has emerged.</p>



<p>Russia wants to make a Call of Duty competitor.</p>



<p>According to an original report from <a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/social/news/2026/01/20/27657577.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gazeta.Ru</a> (and circulated by <a href="https://ixbt.games/en/news/2026/01/20/instituta-razvitiia-interneta-podderzit-sozdanie-rossiiskogo-analoga-call-of-duty.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IXBT</a>), the ministry <strong>confirmed </strong>that developers who propose a large-scale military shooter that echoes Activision’s Call of Duty could qualify for support from the Internet Development Institute, one of Russia’s key state-funded digital initiatives.</p>



<p>But how much support is the government offering?</p>



<p>Early estimates suggest that building a Russian AAA shooter on par with Call of Duty could cost as much as 10 billion rubles, or around $124 million. It would easily make it amongst the most expensive gaming-related projects in the nation’s history. It <strong>has </strong>been stressed before that ‘no domestic studio’ could accomplish the task without substantial government support.</p>



<p>Hence, the lobbying for a potentially enormous grant.</p>



<p>The quote from the Ministry reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If the IRI receives an application for the allocation of funding for the development of a game on a topic corresponding to that indicated in your letter, it will be considered in the established procedure within the framework of the current competitive mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Beyond potential funding, the Ministry of Digital Development reminded Russian reporters that the government offers a ‘suite of financial benefits’ for IT companies innovating like this. That includes reduced corporate income tax rates, lowered insurance premiums, and partial VAT exemptions.</p>



<p>This news comes mere weeks after the State Duma, the ‘lower house’ of Russia’s parliament, called for an investigation into Call of Duty. By their claims, the franchise preaches Russophobia, by ‘always’ making the ‘bad guy’ a Russian individual or group.</p>



<p>It has been suggested that Russia’s Call of Duty would flip the script, allowing users to fight against American, British, and Ukrainian forces. It was dubbed a ‘strategically important’ game for Russia, but whether it would leave the confines of the country is another thing entirely.</p>







<p>Do you think Russia’s game developers could ever muster up the ability to create a Call of Duty rival? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
