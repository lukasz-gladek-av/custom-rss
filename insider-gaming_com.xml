<p>You know, I’m a total sucker for Stardew Valley. I grew up playing cutesy farming sim games, like the original Harvest Moon titles, and that love stuck with me despite my gaming tastes becoming more mature. It’s easy to love the indie farming hit, as developer ConcernedApe continuously updates and improves the core experience. Now, we’re treated to the latest Stardew Valley console update—update 1.6—and it’s enormous!</p>



<h2 id="h-stardew-valley-update-1-6-patch-notes">Stardew Valley Update 1.6 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Prepare yourself because this is a positively huge update that touches upon most aspects of gameplay, including festivals, an all-new farm type, the ability to acquire multiple pets, a world map for Ginger Island, bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, better mod support, and so much more. It enhances Stardew Valley on consoles tenfold!</p>

</ul>
</li>



<li>Price changes:

<li>Friendship gain is reduced by 33% for spouses.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Rebalanced the&nbsp;crop fairy&nbsp;event: the chance no longer depends on the number of planted crops, it can no longer happen on the last day of the season (to avoid growing crops that might die overnight), and it can no longer choose dead crops to grow.</li>

<li>You can no longer plant trees in the beach farm tunnel.</li>



<li>Randomization no longer produces simple repeating patterns in many cases (e.g. clay farming, mushroom level prediction, crab pot fish offset, etc).(You can enable “Use Legacy Randomization” in the&nbsp;advanced save options&nbsp;to use the old randomization, though some specific patterns may still change due to the underlying changes. That option is mainly intended for speedrunners; most players should keep it disabled for the intended experience.)</li>

<p>Old School RuneScape’s mobile version turns six years old today, and to celebrate that milestone, Jagex has rolled out a major update that adds new features and ‘revamps’ the game’s UI to make it more streamlined and intuitive.</p>



<p>It has been almost 24 years since RuneScape was first released, and it’s still one of the world’s most popular MMORPGs today. The mobile version of the game is how gamers on the go are enjoying an open-world, retro adventure.</p>



<p>Read on to check out the changes the team has made to Old School RuneScape on mobile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-better-than-ever-before">‘Better Than Ever Before’</h2>



<p>Per a press release, Jagex has tweaked the mobile experience of Old School RuneScape to ‘make playing the classic MMO on the go better than ever before.’</p>



<p>That’s a bold claim, but if the patch notes are anything to go by, the team has certainly gone some way towards making that true:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Side Stones:&nbsp;</strong>Players can find their stones for high-intensity gameplay and more laid-back encounters divided into columns, complete with a handy button to minimise the second column for when you need to focus on the task at hand.</li>



<li><strong>Hotkeys:&nbsp;</strong>Five custom hotkeys allow for a variety of actions, settings, and stats to be displayed. Swap between PvM and Skilling as easy as the touch of a button and alter your hotkeys based on the activity at hand with ease.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Popout Panel:&nbsp;</strong>The Popout Panel gives players an insight into future additions coming to the game well as XP tracking, settings for Ground Item Indicators, and lots of features and options. With a new compact design, the Popout Panel provides a minimalist aid for players to keep the focus on gameplay.</li>



<li><strong>New Chat:&nbsp;</strong>With a new polished interface, the chat function can now be collapsed with the brand-new toggle button, featuring a bigger and better easy-to-use keyboard button to make gameplay the forefront of the screen.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Menu Entry Swapper:&nbsp;</strong>A recent major quality-of-life improvement, the Menu Entry Swapper has landed in the mobile version of Old School RuneScape. The MES, allows players to swap interactable elements of both NPCs and other entities, as well as Examine, Use, Cancel and more.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>HiScores:&nbsp;</strong>Get ready to have a deeper understanding of your opponents as HiScores become available to find within the game client. Stored alongside the side panel with the XP Tracker, HiScores will let players get the upper hand on hopeful opponents climbing up Mount Karuulm and the Agility Shortcut.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The update is available for free to all users from today.</p>
