<p>Blizzard has announced that 6v6 matches are coming back to Overwatch for a limited time with Overwatch: Classic. The — new? — mode launches November 12 for all players and will run to December 2.</p>



<p>The announcement came alongside a new teaser video for the mode showing the original cast of characters, game modes, and maps.</p>

<p>“Eight years ago, Blizzard released a completely new gaming world called Overwatch,” Blizzard said <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a blog post</a>. “Connected by a theme of fighting for the future, millions of you jumped in to experience new heroes like a time-jumping adventurer, an esports champion turned mech pilot, and a genetically-modified gorilla from the Moon.</p>



<p>“Now you’ll be able to relive the nostalgia in a series of new limited-time events in Overwatch 2, where you can experience the original heroes, abilities, and maps in the classic 6v6 team-based action you remember.”</p>



<p>Overwatch: Classic will see access to 21 characters from the original launch of the game. The mode takes players back to Overwatch 1.0 from May 2016 with classic abilities from the heroes. The heroes will be grouped into their original classes, but the mode will feature the No Hero Limits rule meaning you can have a full team of the same heroes.</p>



<p>Regarding maps, all 12 original maps will be available along with the four original game modes.</p>



<p>As far as if Overwatch: Classic is the way for Blizzard to bring 6v6 back permanently, the studio says not right now.</p>



<p>“We are running separate 6v6 test modes in future seasons to gather feedback and gauge player interest on that format,” Blizzard said.</p>

<p>It’s only fitting that NieR: Automata, one of the titles that inspired Stellar Blade initially, would enjoy a crossover with the action-packed PlayStation 5 exclusive. Directors Kim Hyung Tae and Yoko Tara, two long-time video game developers with deep respect for each other, join forces to bring console fans a collaboration unlike any other.</p>



<p>How does the NieR: Automata DLC work in Stellar Blade? According to the recent announcement, Emil from Emil’s Shop in NieR appears in Stellar Blade, selling eleven collab-specific items that somehow help combine both game worlds. </p>

<p>On top of the NieR: Automata DLC, Stellar Blade also receives a photo mode on November 20. The game’s upcoming photo mode allows you to pause the action at any point, snapping screenshots of Eve in various poses, expressions, landscapes, and even battle scenes for the ultimate action shot.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There seems to be a brand-new side quest in the game that teaches you how to utilize the photo mode and rewards you with money and items upon completion. It’s an excellent way to introduce the mechanic and spark creativity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, on the same day as the photo mode and NieR: Automata DLC—November 20—a patch will launch simultaneously that includes additional appearance cosmetics, lip-sync language support, additional songs for camp, character customization, new battle mechanics, like auto-targeting and ballistics correction, and more!</p>
