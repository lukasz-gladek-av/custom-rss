            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Resident Evil 2 director recently stated that action-game-like mechanics were tested and then scrapped from the original game.  </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-1-experimented-with-action-mechanics-like-charged-attacks-before-the-devs-realized-it-was-comical-and-ruined-the-fear-factor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Resident Evil 2 director Hideki Kamiya recently spoke about one of the situations he remembered from the development of the original Resident Evil game. Kamiya’s new thread on <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1951891041583550541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), which comes as a response to Silent Hill F gameplay, states that several people in the development team of the first game requested features like a “sidestep” or a “charged knife slash”. The director of Resident Evil 1, Shinji Mikami, let them test out these features, only to make them realise why they were not necessary. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">バイオ1開発時チーム内で「サイドステップ欲しい」「ナイフ溜め斬り欲しい」と声が出て、三上さんは訝しみつつも試験実装を見守ってたんだけど、実際溜め斬りが実装されるとゾンビが全く恐怖の対象でなくなり…<br>三上さん「な？」<br>…というわけでボツとなって我々は大きな学びを得た…のを思い出した… <a href="https://t.co/UXlMCZ5kkz">https://t.co/UXlMCZ5kkz</a></p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1951891041583550541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Kamiya explains that when these combat mechanics were added to Resident Evil 1, “the zombies immediately stopped being scary”, and hence, they were scrapped. The development team realised that these features would be “immersion-breaking and comical.” This situation also helped Hideki Kamiya understand why Shinji Mikami kept saying “the theme of this game is fear”. Mikami had also deliberately made the retreating animation slower, likening it to a “frightened backward stumble,” as this would help create fear.  </p>



<p>The Resident Evil 2 director also revealed another instance where Chris Redfield would receive a sword. The suggestion was that while Chris was exploring a mansion, he would have the option to pick up a European-style sword from the environment and use it to attack the zombies. However, as this made him look “too heroic”, the idea was ultimately scrapped. </p>



<p>In other news, Resident Evil 2: Deadshot has been introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-2-has-been-turned-into-an-arcade-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as an arcade version</a> of the popular survival horror title. Additionally,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-leak-reveals-link-to-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a new leak</a> suggests that the Resident Evil movie could be set around the events of RE2 and RE3. Do you think action game-like mechanics should have been a part of Resident Evil 1, or did the director make the right decision? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>A new Elden Ring Nightreign datamine reveals that developers are working on an endless ranked mode called ‘Deep of Night’. </p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign’s developers, FromSoftware, have been constantly churning out new content for the game for players to immerse themselves in. They recently added the highly requested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-1-02-patch-notes-july-31-update-duos-finally-added-along-with-relic-filter-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duos mode</a> and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-set-of-everdark-sovereigns-arrive-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new set of Everdark Sovereigns</a>. Interestingly, the latest development reveals that FromSoftware could be cooking a brand new game mode for the title. </p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-s-endless-ranked-mode-has-skill-based-matchmaking">Elden Ring Nightreign’s Endless Ranked Mode Has Skill-Based Matchmaking </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, a new post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adminisitrator/comments/1mh908l/elden_ring_nightreign_new_mode_deep_of_night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> talks about Elden Ring Nightreign’s upcoming endless ranked mode, which was datamined from the duos mode patch. The upcoming game mode is called ‘Deep of Night’ and it will be added to the Expeditions menu. The description states that players will not be able to choose these targets, and “difficulty increases with depth”. The player’s rating will increase with every victory, allowing them to proceed to “even greater depths”. The last statement says, “The boundless dark stretches out unto infinity.” </p>



<p>The player ratings in Elden Ring Nightreign’s endless ranked mode will be recorded through ‘Depth’. Victories will increase the player’s Depth rating, and losses will decrease it. There are 5 Depth Tiers to progress through: Depth 1 (Rating 0-999), Depth 2 (Rating 1000-1999), Depth 3 (Rating 2000-3999), Depth 4 (Rating 4000-5999), Depth 5 (Rating 6000+). Once a player is promoted to a higher tier, they cannot be demoted. Also, players will be matched with others of the same Depth; however, if there aren’t enough players in the same Depth, then the pool will be expanded.  </p>



<p>Regardless, players should take this information with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source and wait for an announcement from FromSoftware. </p>
