<p>Helldivers 2’s long-awaited Xbox arrival is far from the end of the road, and a new Premium Warbond is right around the corner. Here, we’ve got all the details for the Dust Devils launch.</p>



<p>Though the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a> understandably took the headlines following the Xbox launch, new content is coming thick and fast. The Dust Devils Warbond is just a part of this, which comes alongside the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Into the Unjust update</a>.</p>



<p>We’ve got all the details on the Helldivers 2 Dust Devils Warbond here, including the exact start time and what it includes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-prologue-go-wayback-has-%E2%80%9Cinfinite-number-of-maps%E2%80%9D-says-playerunknown-ceo-brendan-greene.1280793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battle royale is in the rearview mirror for PlayerUnknown CEO Brendan Greene. The father of battle royale has moved on from PUBG and the genre he popularized, and formed PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions. The first major project it’s working on is Prologue: Go Wayback!, and Brendan walked me through the game’s map potential, what to expect from Prologue, and what the end goal is.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/brendan-greene-pubg-creator-three-game-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a> is single-player and carries an open-world-survival vibe. It features randomly generated maps on every visit. In case you haven’t realized, this is <em>wildly </em>different from PUBG. Brendan has already explained to Insider Gaming how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pubg-creator-brendan-greene-is-humbled-by-battle-royale-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">humbled he is by battle royale’s success</a>.</p>



<p>But his new company has a new game, and it’s called Prologue: Go Wayback!</p>



<h2 id="h-it-takes-about-two-hours-to-get-across-the-map-in-prologue-go-wayback">“It Takes About Two Hours to Get Across The Map” in Prologue: Go Wayback! </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Brendan was kind enough to make this for us! Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.playprologue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Prologue</a> encourages you to explore a vast expanse. Each map is new, but the goal is the same: To survive and reach the Weather Tower. Brendan makes it clear from the outset: Prologue: Go Wayback! is about size, scale, and serendipitous exploration in the game’s unique procedurally generated 64km2 maps.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It generally takes about two hours to get across the map. We have this interesting machine learning type that creates a new base map every time you play. So you’ve got essentially infinite worlds you can explore, and all 8×8 and looking quite nice.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are no vehicles, and all exploration is purely on foot. Prologue will remain a single-player game for now, as the newfound company “Doesn’t have the resources for now” to add a fully integrated multiplayer component. However, Brendan explained to me how there is still room for multiplayer functionality even now.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Like with the map editor, you can just create and share maps with friends and race across maps, because if you pass a seed to someone with the schematic, they get the same map as you. We’re thinking maybe, like, I want to look into maybe doing some kind of asynchronous, or no, like a multiplayer where you’re maybe playing with the ghost of your friend. So like it’s not a real multiplayer, but at least you can play together.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I was interested to learn that reaching the Weather Tower doesn’t necessarily define the gameplay experience. Brendan is happy for people to explore their bespoke biomes.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We have one guy who survived 17 hours in a Discord because there’s no end limit. Like, you have to get to the weather tower, but I don’t care if you do or not. We had one guy who posted a picture of this cabin on the edge of a cliff and he was like, ‘I found my home.’ He just wanted to stay there. Which I love because I’m just creating an emergence space. I fell back in love in gaming through Day Z, which is just emergence. It’s like tell your own story, do your own thing, and that’s the kind of spaces I want to create.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is part of the studio’s Project Artemis vision—which is likely to be Brendan’s final game overall.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 is getting a fresh content drop next week with its Into the Unjust update, following on from the long-awaited Xbox launch and Halo ODST Legendary Warbond.</p>



<p>The stacked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/">Halo ODST Legendary Wa</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/">bond</a> is full of treats, but comes at a price, though the next big update in Helldivers 2 is right around the corner, bringing with it a host of new content.</p>



<p>From a new Premium Warbond filled with new weapons and armor, to new challenges to explore, the Into the Unjust update has plenty to offfer.</p>

<p>Announced in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, Into the Unjust in Helldivers 2 pushes players into a fresh battle against the Terminids into unknown territory, seemingly with a challenge that won’t allow you to call in Stratagems.</p>



<p>The teaser blog details disappearing “into the fog” to “discover new dangers”. It’s explained that “because of the nature of the caves, your Super Destroyer won’t be able to give you full support.” As a result, it’s your squad facing up against the Terminids alone.</p>



<p>New enemy types are also detailed, with “a new subterranean species of Terminid Warriors, Bile Spewers, and Chargers,” along with the Dragonroach, and “more terrifying creatures lying in wait on Hive Worlds.”</p>



<p>New challenges include escorting a mobile oil rig, locating and destroying the Hive Lung, along with new optional and sub-objectives too.</p>



<p>As is customary in Helldivers 2, the new drop of content also comes alongside a new Premium Warbond, called Dust Devils, which will “ensure survival in the harshest conditions these worlds can throw your way.”</p>



<p>The Warbond includes a primary weapon, a new throwable, and three unique stratagems, all of which launch on September 4.</p>
