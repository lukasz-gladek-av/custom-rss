<p>Bungie’s former chief legal officer, Don Mcgowan, recently revealed that the studio hired fans as they were okay with working for a smaller paycheck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKfUWDnsE2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IATSE</a> on YouTube (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/former-bungie-legal-exec-studio-hired-fans-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamePost</a>), McGowan, a former member of Bungie’s general counsel, discussed how gaming companies hire fans to “get away with lower pay” because they are working on a game they love. McGowan states that they “totally took advantage of that at Bungie,” adding, “We hired fans because fans would work for less.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>McGowan has also previously worked with companies like Pokemon and Microsoft Games. During the interview, he reveals how peers asked him, “How much of a pay cut are they making you take?” when he moved to Bungie. He explained that people in the industry would assume that the studio is making you take a pay cut, which is “a horrible reputation for you to have”. “But when you only hire fans, you can get away with that”, concluded McGowan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first shot at Bungie by an ex-employee this week; the former Marathon game director has also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-denies-conduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued the studio and Sony recently</a>.
