<p>Avowed hit the market just a few days ago, and players worldwide have been getting to grips with Obsidian’s latest ambitious RPG. This semi-open-world title boasts sumptuous visuals and an innovative story, plus all the trappings of a fantasy RPG that we’ve come to expect over the years.</p>



<p>The single-player marvel could have been something entirely different, though. In a recent report published by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, it was revealed by Carrie Patel, the game’s director, that Avowed started life as an MMO that was dubbed ‘multiplayer Skyrim’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>Given that the industry’s MMO category is well and truly oversaturated these days, I’m rather thankful that Avowed took on a fresh form following a dramatic reboot.</p>



<p>In a recent report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-21/new-xbox-game-avowed-took-six-years-two-reboots?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bloomberg</a>, Obsidian’s Carrie Patel explained that a 2021 pivot led to a total reboot of Avowed, which had until then been designed as a multiplayer title. The game was preparing to enter production in earnest, but Microsoft’s acquisition of Obsidian took a drastic turn, and a relatively large team was ordered to shake things up.</p>



<p>Patel expanded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Normally if you’re stepping back and reevaluating your creative direction, putting together a new vertical slice and revised production plans, you would do that with a very small team. </p>



<p>We did not have a very small team at that point.</p>



<p>A lot of lessons we learned as we were building this game, ideally we would’ve learned on a small scale with a true preproduction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a further twist, Avowed’s open-world model was switched out for a ‘zone-based’ structure akin to 2019’s The Outer Worlds. This has since been reviewed by Avowed’s development team, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-not-open-world-because-zones-tough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been pretty public on the reasons</a> for that creative and logistical decision.</p>



<p>Patel wrapped the interview with Schreier by signing off with a nod to the future of the Avowed label:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that we’ve built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I’d love to see us do more with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Are you happy that Avowed is a single-player RPG, or would you have preferred an MMO? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netease-studio-closures-dozen-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netease-could-cause-the-closure-of-%E2%80%98more-than-a-dozen-studios%E2%80%99-report-claims.1116132/</guid>

<p>Earlier this week, we reported on the layoffs that had hit the Marvel Rivals team at NetEase. In one sweep, an entire department in North America was laid off, despite the rampant and ongoing success of Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Now, a fresh report published by Game File’s Stephen Totilo has expanded on NetEase’s current situation. The gaming titan has been in a sticky spot of late, and studios it has opened or invested in have started to experience layoffs and closures, such as Liquid Swords, which this week also announced redundancies.</p>



<p>Per Totilo’s report, the devastation is yet to unfold in full, and ‘more than a dozen studios’ could be facing closure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-constant-review-and-evaluation">‘Constant Review and Evaluation’</h2>



<p>In Game File’s most recent report, it was stressed that NetEase’s cuts aren’t ending with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/liquid-swords-the-next-studio-to-hold-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liquid Swords</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-ceo-debated-having-marvel-rivals-canceled-and-removing-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Marvel Rivals team</a>.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was stressed by Stephen Totilo</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>NetEase is actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios—many of the very same ones it announced over the last three years—two people familiar with the company’s efforts tell Game File. Neither individual was authorized to speak about NetEase’s plans publicly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Those sources have claimed that NetEase wants to divest ‘overseas teams’, an action that could lead to the closure of more than a dozen game studios around the world. The situation would be exacerbated if these studios can’t secure funding once ‘dropped’ by NetEase.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, NetEase neglected to comment on these insider reports, but it was mentioned that the company and its studios are ‘in constant review and evaluation, and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made.’</p>



<p>In a one-year window, Embracer Group laid off more than 4,500 employees and brought about the closure of 80 projects, as well as shutting down some prolific studios. This NetEase situation could mirror that to some extent. </p>



<p>The Chinese company is the fifth largest game firm by revenue, sitting just behind Nintendo and a step ahead of Electronic Arts. It collectively employs around 30,000 people, which represents a concerning amount of ‘fodder’.</p>



<p>I’m most concerned about Rebel Wolves, which NetEase invested in back in 2022. Recently, the Polish studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-first-trailer-rebel-wolves/">revealed Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, an intriguing title pieced together by former Witcher developers. That could be one of the studios impacted by these changes.</p>



<p>For now, everything remains up in the air.</p>

<p>In a recent leak published on social media by eXtas1s, fresh references to the ‘new Xbox controller’ were uncovered. These details gel nicely with what we already know about the ‘Sebile’ controller that was leaked in the FTC vs. Microsoft documents almost two years ago. If nothing else, this new update is a testament to the controller <strong>still existing</strong>.</p>



<p>Per the update posted by eXtas1s, dataminers have uncovered references to the ‘Sebile’ controller in new XCloud files. It was originally thought that the upgraded, next-generation controller would be released alongside whatever console comes next, but these latest details suggest it could arrive sooner.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-sebile">What is Sebile?</h2>



<p>In September 2023, the FTC vs. Microsoft court case led to many documents being publicly revealed, with some outlining the future of Xbox hardware and peripherals. One such peripheral that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-leak-new-xbox-controller/">was fully unveiled was ‘Sebile’</a>, otherwise dubbed ‘the new Xbox controller’ by Microsoft.</p>



<p>Back then, the documents suggested it would have a ‘lift to wake’ feature, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-be-bringing-haptic-motors-to-xbox-controllers/">precision haptic feedback</a>, better ergonomics, and a rechargeable battery as standard. It was also stressed it would have seamless connectivity mechanics, better accessibility for repair and disassembly, and an accelerometer.</p>



<p>In a recent post published on <a href="https://xcancel.com/extas1stv/status/1893094238549590287?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media by eXtas1s</a>, those very same features are discussed again. In recent XCloud files uncovered by dataminers, references to the following were found:</p>



<ul>
<li>Codenames: Sebile_Delgado, Sebile_EV1B, Actium_Duet, Actium_EVO</li>
</ul>



<p>EXtas1s expands on the codenames by reiterating the proposed technical specification:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Modular with improved haptics, similar to the DualSense. Goodbye to batteries, now with a rechargeable battery. Gesture to ‘wake up’ the controller. Part of the console renewal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the tech specs seem to be nothing more than a look back at what we already know, the modern references to the codenames in the XCloud files are new and are more or less confirmation that Microsoft is still working on Sebile.</p>
