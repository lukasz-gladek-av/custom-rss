<p>Borderlands 4’s release date is screeching into sight and is set to be one of the biggest releases in 2025, and we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview of Borderlands 4</a> at Gamescom raised our excitement levels for the title, which comes a whopping six years after the previous entry in the series landed, and there’s plenty to take in, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 billion guns featured</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to lock in for release, perhaps calling in sick from work for the day, we’ve got all the crucial release datte and start times information you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-borderlands-4-coming-out">When is Borderlands 4 Coming Out?</h2>

<p><strong>September 12 is the official release date for Borderlands 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with Nintendo Switch 2 players having to wait a while longer until October 3</strong>.</p>



<p>With the Borderlands 4 release date now locked in and on the horizon, there shouldn’t be any changes to the release date. Gearbox has already made the rather unusual move of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-move-forward-after-randy-pitchford-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing the Borderlands 4 release date</a> forward, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/randy-pitchford-addresses-gta-6-release-date-rumors-after-borderlands-4-is-moved-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Randy Pitchford then denying</a> the decision had anything to do with Grand Theft Auto 6. </p>



<p>The release date was brought forward by “confidence in the game and development trajectory,” giving fans a nice early bonus. As mentioned, however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 players have a little while longer to wait</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-start-times">Borderlands 4 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Borderlands 4’s official start times are yet to be announced, but listings on the PlayStation store suggest it will be available a midnight regionally.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UK PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-au/games/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Australian PlayStation Store</a> both have midnight in their respective time zones, while the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US PlayStation Store</a> has a midnight release in Eastern Time stated—though it’s unclear whether this means those in other US time zones will gain access at the same moment.</p>



<p>A midnight regional release would also open the door for players to gain earlier access by switching their time zone, which is much easier to do on Xbox Series X|S than it is on PlayStation. However, we won’t know for sure if this is possible until the release times are confirmed.</p>



<p>For easier viewing, the table below shows the release times in popular time zones. Please remember that these are subject to change; we’ll be sure to keep them updated.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Borderlands 4 Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">21:00 – September 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">23:00 – September 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">00:00 – September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">00:00 – September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">00:00 – September 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/under-par-golf-architect-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/under-par-golf-architect-hands-on-preview-a-golf-tycoon-simulator-scoring-more-birdies-than-bogeys.1279632/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gamescom 2025 was my first hands-on with Under Par Golf Architect. A fully golf-centric tycoon simulator where you control all aspects of golf course management. As a huge golf fan, this was right up my street. It’s the perfect hybrid of golf sim and golf creation aspects, it irons out any doubts I had, you should putt this on your wishlist if you’re a golf fan, and you wood be doing yourself a disservice if you didn’t.</p>



<p>It feels apt that I’m writing this as the 2025 Tour Championship has concluded to wrap up the FedEx Cup. Whereas everyone was waiting for the monolithic presence of Scottie Scheffler or Rory McIlroy to take home the richest prize on the PGA Tour, it was a relative underdog in Tommy Fleetwood who comfortably prevailed.</p>



<p>In this scenario, EA Sports PGA Tour and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-trophy-list-all-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2K’s PGA Tour</a> are Scottie and Rory, and Under Par Golf Architect is rightly Tommy.</p>



<h2 id="h-makes-the-complexities-of-a-golf-complex-rather-simple">Makes The Complexities of a Golf Complex Rather Simple</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The control is in your hands. Credit to Broken Arm Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>I love playing real golf, and I also can’t get enough of simulated golf, where I can immerse myself in a virtual world to pretend I’m actually good at golf and escape my real-world inadequacies and lack of talent. From the 00s Tiger Woods games to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-pga-tour-gets-latest-major-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports PGA Tour</a> and HB Studios’ decade-long golf-game efforts, I’ll play everything.</p>



<p>So it was intriguing to hear about <a href="https://www.underpargame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Under Par Golf Architect</a>. I can’t think of a dedicated golf sim game on this macro level since Sid Meier’s SimGolf in 2002. I had to see it for myself at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-2025-awards-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025</a>. A private setup gave me a hands-on look and learning experience. Its premise is similar to any other ‘tycoon’ game: Micromanage every aspect of a golf course’s infrastructure.</p>



<p>You build a golf course in a plot of land, surround it with amenities to increase public satisfaction and optimize consumption of the facilities, appease your patrons, earn lots of money, and maximize customer enjoyment. You do this by tweaking the golf course to adhere to the golfer’s feedback, ensuring your workforce is on top of course maintenance, and various other factors. I visibly giggled every time I saw raccoons feeding on the course’s rubbish if left untidied for too long.</p>



<p>I quickly whipped up a nice little brute of a Par 3 surrounded by water, offering a horrendously undulating green. The controls were easy enough to execute my vision, and the hole design seemed funny to me. However, I quickly realized the novelty would soon be met with the hostility and incredulity of visitors—you need to be smart and channel your inner Pete Dye or Alister Mackenzie.</p>







<p>I exhaled a slight “ooo” when Broken Arms Games CEO Yves Hohler showed me what was essentially an AI data model you can use to test your golf holes. It takes into account High, Mid, Low, and Scratch Handicappers and simulates how they’d all play the hole. It gives you useful insight into where they’re landing their shots—or where the less-talented of us would inexplicably be spraying and praying our golf ball around the property.</p>



<p>This foresight and knowledge can help you make vital changes to the course. But don’t make the course too easy, or your more experienced golfers will scoff and leave in search of a challenge. On the contrary, you need to be mindful about not making every hole narrow, hazard-filled, and with green speeds even Augusta National would consider a glass-like menace.</p>



<p>Under Par is a single-player tycoon sim with multiple levels and biomes arriving at launch. I’ve been assured that the playing aspect was added in response to community feedback and is there if you fancy a quick knockabout. The business and simulation principles are where the game’s priorities lie. If you find PGA Tour 2K’s course creator to be a bit advanced, time-consuming, or cumbersome, I think you’ll really enjoy this.</p>



<p>A lot of love has gone into making Under Par Golf Architect. Time will tell if it’s a bona fide major winner, but I think it’s earned its tour card and is ready to see if its vision can become par for the course.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is bringing the neglected franchise back to life after a few years of dormancy, and we’ve got all the details on whether the title is available through Game Pass.</p>



<p>Releasing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 28</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trophy-list-all-achievement-trophy-differences-in-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full achievement list for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> shows details of the adventure that lies ahead of Solid Snake, though confirmation that<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-multiplayer-mode-doesnt-have-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the title doesn’t feature crossplay is a blow</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence about purchasing Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and are wondering if it will be included in a Game Pass subscription, we’ve got all the details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Almost time. Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will not be available through an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on August 28th.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/eu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is not a first-party Xbox title, which would result in automatic inclusion in the service, and there has not been any announcement of it landing on the service. As such, it won’t be included.</p>



<p>Microsoft has already announced the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-august-2025-wave-2-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second wave of August titles coming to Game Pass,</a> covering until the end of the month, and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater did not feature. If it was, it would’ve been one of the highlights of the service, receiving a lot of attention.</p>







<p><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is unlikely to come to the Xbox Game Pass catalog in the future, and any inclusion would surely be quite far away.</strong></p>



<p>Virtuos, co-developer of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater alongside Konami, has released several titles on the Game Pass service in the past, though the final decision with this title will more than likely fall upon Konami.</p>



<p>Konami’s publishing on Xbox is much more limited, and their titles barely ever feature in the Game Pass catalog, so it seems unlikely that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will make an appearance in the library anytime soon. However, stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>If you do want to play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater on Xbox, the best approach is to purchase the game for launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA’s long-awaited Skate sequel is in the works. We know it’s progressing well, and confirmation of this comes courtesy of the game’s X account, which has not only showcased its awesome cover art but also gone one step further and teased us with a tricky early access release date notice.</p>



<p>15 years—yes, FIFTEEN—years have come and gone since Skate 3. EA released one of the most popular skating games in history. Then capitalized on this by…doing nothing. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eas-skate-does-not-have-an-offline-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skate</a> fans have had to wait a long time for a new game, and even then, development on the new Skate title has taken several years. However, the updates are coming thick and fast, including news on its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skate-promises-big-update-next-week-as-early-access-looms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access release date</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-skate-early-access-release-date-coming-very-soon">Skate Early Access Release Date Coming Very Soon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re ready for the grind. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The official EA Skate <a href="https://x.com/skate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X page</a> has shown off the stunning new Skate art. The vibrant and almost pastel-like cover is a clean and smooth image, and is all the game cover needed to be. It’s a win-win in my books.</p>



<p>But even more eye-catching is the news of Skate’s early access release date. While the X account hasn’t let the info slip just yet, we know it’s arriving imminently: <strong>August 26</strong>, to be exact.</p>



<p>“We’re stoked to reveal the official skate. cover art! Come back on Tuesday 8/26…we’re giving you the Early Access release date. See ya then,” said a post on Skate’s social media page.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is nearly upon us, and all eyes are cast towards the review scores, and we’ve got the details on when the review embargo lifts.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases Sep</a>tember 4, and is included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription, with anticipation for the title reaching fever-pitch levels following the long-awaited release date announcement.</p>



<p>Whether you’re on the fence about playing or want to see how hyped everyone is for the launch of Hollow Knight: Silksong, here are all the review embargo details.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-review-embargo-date-explained">Hollow Knight: Silksong Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Almost here. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Hollow Knight: Silksong review embargo is expected to be September 4, when the game releases, with Team Cherry reportedly not distributing early codes.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a> stated that Team Cherry is not planning on sending out early codes for Hollow Knight: Silksong, so players should not expect to see any reviews until after the September 4 launch.</p>



<p>This is because the developers “felt like it’d be unfair for critics to be playing before Kickstarter backers and other players,” though they are also a small team and it would take a lot of time to get codes and distribute them, particularly given the amount of work that lies ahead before the release.</p>



<p>Therefore, players shouldn’t expect to see any reviews published until the September 4 release, and, even then, the first drop may not be a full reflection of the game and may be an in-progress review as journalists, like everyone else, push through to complete the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-hollow-knight-silksong-scores-can-we-expect">What Hollow Knight: Silksong Scores Can we Expect?</h2>



<p><strong>Hype for Hollow Knight: Silksong has been in overdrive for a while, and, given the success of the first game, expect to see the sequel rate very highly.</strong></p>



<p>Our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a> resulted in a verdict that the title is well worth the wait, with no suggestion that Hollow Knight: Silksong will score poorly. In fact, it could end up being one of the most successful launches of the year, score-wise.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/hollow-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a> for the original Hollow Knight is impressively high, with an average of 90 from critic reviews, while the user score, based on 4,321 reviews, puts the game at 9.1.</p>



<p>Though the first game set a very high bar, we expect Silksong to follow suit with some equally impressive numbers to establish itself as one of the must-play titles of the year.</p>

<p>Years of waiting for Hollow Knight: Silksong are finally coming to a close with a release date announced, which may have alarmed those unsure of what platforms the title will release on, but we have all the details.</p>



<p>Set to land on September 4, our hands-on preview with Hollow Knight: Silksong showed it was well worth the wait, with years of development paying off.</p>



<p>With a release now on the horizon, here are all the details you need on the platforms that Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PlayStation 5 at launch.</strong></p>



<p>Silksong has one of the widest releases in recent years, touching almost every platform imaginable, and PS5 is set to take an important role. This is despite the fact that a lot of the marketing attention has been from Microsoft and Nintendo, which may have confused you into thinking it was platform-exclusive for the pair.</p>



<p>That isn’t the case, however, and Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PS5.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on Xbox Series X|S, with Microsoft having played a big role in marketing for the title.</strong></p>



<p>Not only will Silksong be available on the platform, but those with an active <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass subscription will be able to play Hollow Knight: Silksong on release</a> without paying an additional fee—perhaps giving Xbox an edge over other titles.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-pc">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PC through various storefronts, so you can choose your favorite.</strong></p>



<p>Those with a PC Game Pass subscription will be able to play Hollow Knight: Silksong for no additional fee through the Xbox App, and you can add the title to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> launcher through this service, if you’d prefer.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-nintendo-switch">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on both the original Nintendo Switch console and Nintendo Switch 2 at launch.</strong></p>



<p>In fact, the Nintendo family of consoles will be the first to receive physical editions early in 2026, for those who want to add to their physical games library, before later releasing a physical version of Hollow Knight: Silksong on other platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-ps4-and-xbox-one">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on PS4 and Xbox One?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PS4 and Xbox One, meaning those yet to upgrade to current-gen consoles won’t miss out.</strong></p>



<p>Though it may come as a surprise that a huge title like Hollow Knight: Silksong is releasing on last-gen platforms, remember that the game has been in development for seven years. Therefore, development would have begun on these consoles before switching over to new-gen models.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription immediately when it launches on September 4.</strong></p>



<p>Available on both Xbox Series X|S and PC, Hollow Knight: Silksong will undoubtedly be one of the biggest highlights in the Game Pass catalog in September, following on from an already impressive Wave 2 in August.</p>



<p>As it’s available at launch, it’s expected that Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on the Game Pass service indefinitely, although precise details have not been stated.

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Gamer Celebrates 15,000th Platinum Trophy]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-gamer-celebrates-15000-platinum-trophies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-gamer-celebrates-15-000th-platinum-trophy.1279416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I like to consider myself an avid gamer, and then I come across someone like ‘timpurnat’, who has just celebrated unlocking his 15,000th <strong>Platinum Trophy </strong>on the PlayStation Network. I don’t even dwindle in comparison; I’m a mere speck in timpurnat’s overwhelming universe of completion.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, timpurnat, self-proclaimed Trophy Hunter, revealed that he’d 100% completed 15,000 PlayStation games, hitting level 999 on PSN and securing a total of 387,000 individual Trophies in his bid to become the most completed PlayStation gamer in the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-one-from-top">One From Top</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/timpurnat/levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN Profiles</a>, timpurnat sits in second place behind dav1d_123, <strong>but not by much</strong>. The number-one PlayStation gamer has 21,228,060 points on the platform with 15,489 Platinum Trophies, while timpurnat is in second place with 20,422,230 points and 15,020 Platinum Trophies.</p>



<p>Dav1d_123 boasts a <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/447928-most-playstation-platinum-trophies-won" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Guinness World Record</a> for the most verified Platinum Trophies, which he received in December 2023.</p>



<p>In timpurnat’s fight for the top spot, the gamer has completed 16,300 games with a completion rate of 99.23%, and has earned an average of 112.2 Trophies <strong>every day</strong>.</p>



<p>I don’t think I unlock 112.2 PlayStation Trophies <strong>a month</strong>.</p>



<p>These attributes have landed timpurnat with the number-one rank in his country, and the number-two rank <strong>in the world</strong>.</p>



<p>On social media, timpurnat can frequently be seen discussing his Platinum awards in sequence, offering a tidbit about the games that he uses to climb further up the leaderboard. Most recently, he wrote about his 14,929th Platinum, unlocked for Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nice music and easy platinum, I was surprised to see they made this one so much easier than previous entries. Even if you fail a song, you’re still progressing towards the platinum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Timpurnat’s efforts enabled him to move up the charts on PSN Profiles, overtaking the gamer now in third place, ginko765.</p>
