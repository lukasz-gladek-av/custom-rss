<p>Kinetic Games, the development studio behind Phasmophobia, has announced the launch of a new publishing label to provide independent game studios with legal assistance, marketing support, and more. </p>



<p>Named Kinetic Publishing, the company aims to provide the support Kinetic CEO Daniel Knight wished he had when he was the sole developer launching the pivotal horror game in 2020. Kinetic Games has since grown to a team of over 30 individuals.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-vision-behind-kinetic-publishing">The Vision Behind Kinetic Publishing</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/news/announcing-kinetic-publishing" rel="nofollow">In a press release,</a> Knight touted the company’s growth, noting that it now has the capacity to support other studios. He also said that his experience will now allow him to provide the support he would have appreciated.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s such an exciting time for indie game development, I can say that in the past five years I’ve learned so much. The fact we’ve grown so much as a company means we’re now in the place where we want to support studios who come under our wing, and provide the support I’d have appreciated at the start of my journey.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Five of Kinetic’s senior members will head the Kinetic Publishing team, each overseeing their respective areas of expertise. Among them is Asim Tanvir, Kinetic’s Director of Marketing and Partnerships. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/phasmophobia-developer-kinetic-games-launches-indie-publishing-label" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Tanvir encouraged developers interested in partnering with Kinetic’s new branch to be authentic and proud of their work, and to provide the best information possible to represent their game’s potential.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Focus on the information that best represents your game and highlights its potential, as this will help you and our team, too. Also, be authentic and proud of what you’re working on. If you are, that will come through and shine in your submission. We’re really looking forward to seeing a variety of pitches come through.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Kinetic Publishing aims to collaborate with small teams and individual developers worldwide. Specifically, they are looking for developers with a clear vision for their game who are about a year and a half from launch. Insider Gaming will continue to track Kinetic Publishing’s growth and provide additional details on the new label as more information becomes available.

<p>Obsidian Entertainment is officially bringing Avowed to the Sony PlayStation 5 on February 17, 2025. In addition, a new anniversary update to the game introduces several new features for players to explore.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA4J6ByZPR0" rel="nofollow">During the New Game+ Showcase on January 8, 2026,</a> Avowed’s gameplay director, Gabriel Paramo, and lead character artist, Dimitri Berman, touted the amount of additions to the game including new character races coming and the feature of the New Game Plus, allowing players to start a brand new game with all of the previous items they collected through their first playthrough. However, weapons will reset to their default levels, requiring players to level them up again.</p>







<h2 id="h-other-new-features-being-added-to-avowed">Other New Features Being Added to Avowed</h2>



<p>Additionally, a new photo mode was announced, allowing players to take photos of their Envoy. There are also new character presets and numerous creative options for players, which Dimitri and Gabriel say they were unable to complete to their satisfaction in the lead-up to the game’s launch. The game, published by Xbox Game Studios, initially launched in February 2025 on Xbox platforms. However, as more Xbox exclusive games begin coming to New platforms with Microsoft’s “Everything is an Xbox” campaign in full swing, PlayStation players are now getting the chance to experience the world of the Living Lands in the Pillars of Eternity universe.</p>

<p>The Obsidian representatives stated Avowed would be available for pre-order on January 8, but as of this Friday, the PlayStation Store has not made the landing page accessible. Insider Gaming will report when PlayStation officially makes the game available for pre-order.</p>

<p>A new Gameplay Overview trailer highlights features of the upcoming Mario Tennis Fever game, coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Among other highlights, it was confirmed that the game will feature the most playable characters ever available in a Mario Tennis game, including the debut of Baby WaLuigi.</p>



<p>Mario Tennis Fever was first announced during the September Nintendo Direct, in a segment focused on the 40th anniversary of the Super Mario Bros. franchise. In the new trailer released on January 8, 2026, there was a more detailed breakdown of the new features, including a look at the full roster, with debuts of Goomba, Baby WaLuigi, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-more-mario-party-tennis-fever-features">More Mario Party Tennis Fever Features</h2>



<p>In addition to the extensive roster, the game features the new Fever Rackets. There will be over 30 rackets, each with its own ability. For example, the Shadow Racket creates a duplicate of the character you’re using to have your opponent see double. There is also a range of new modes. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/get-ready-for-tennis-with-a-twist-in-the-new-mario-tennis-fever-overview-trailer/">Nintendo describes</a> the Mix It Up mode as a way to play matches with unique twists. For example, Ring Shot Mode, where players try to hit balls through rings to score points. Also, there’s Forest Court Match, where feeding Piranha Plants a stream of tennis balls expands the court.</p>



<p>There’s also the previously announced Adventure Mode, which features Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, and WaLuigi being transformed into babies by monsters. With the help of Donkey Kong, who is acting as a babysitter, they must overcome challenges to return to normal.</p>

<p>In addition to all of the new information regarding Mario Tennis Fever, Nintendo also announced the first new colored Joy-Con 2 controllers. The new light purple and light green variants will arrive on February 12, the same day Mario Tennis Fever launches on Nintendo’s new console. </p>
