<p>A new Chapter in Fortnite means new bosses to track down and defeat, but finding the specific boss locations is tricky if you don’t know where to look. Fortunately, this guide can direct you straight to Human Bill.</p>



<p>Human Bill is one of three bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, offering powerful items when defeated that can change the course of a match and put you on course to secure victory, but the blue alien can be tough to track down.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has detailed where to find Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, along with the loot offered once defeated.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-human-bill-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">Where to Find Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The hunt is on. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Human Bill does not have a single set spawn in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, and can instead appear in several locations across the map.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite has adopted travelling bosses with varying spawns in the past, including in The Simpsons mini-season, and it seems this mechanic will remain. Although it can be frustrating if you want to farm the boss, it does make every match more interesting with no single set spawn that all players can flock to.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of where Human Bill can be encountered in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ripped Tides</li>



<li>Classified Canyon</li>



<li>Painted Palms</li>



<li>South/East of Wonkeeland</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Human Bill, the areas around Wonkeeland are a good place to start, particularly Sunset Falls. The benefit of starting your search here is that Painted Palms, another potential spawn location for Human Bill, is a short distance away if you’re unsuccessful in your initial search.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-human-bill-loot-drops-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Human Bill Loot Drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>The most important loot dropped by Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is the boss transform item, transforming you into Human Bill and providing a special ability.</strong></p>



<p>Human Bill’s Kit can be activated for Low Gravity for a short period, making traversal to hard-to-reach places much easier and providing a quick escape. Transforming into Human Bill also provides an increased bar for Health and Shields, making you tough to beat.</p>



<p>Beware, though, as transforming into a boss will permanently mark your exact location to nearby players, in a more precise manner than Medallions have done in previous Chapters and Seasons.</p>



<p>Weapon-wise, defeating Human Bill drops Human Bill’s Arc-Lightning Gun, a Mythic version of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapon introduced this season</a>. It takes significantly longer to overheat, making it easier to defeat enemies without needing to switch weapons or wait for the Arc-Lightning Gun to cool down.</p>



<p>Finally, Human Bill also drops a Chug Jug when defeated, which is always a useful item but is even more so when transformed into a boss, as it restores the higher amount of Health and Shield you have earned.</p>

<p>A new chapter has kicked off with Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings a new map into the fray with a variety of NPC characters to find, and this guide has details on them all.</p>



<p>Chapter 7 kicked off after a dramatic end to Chapter 6 with the Zero Point live event, which led to significant changes in gameplay, including the removal of several modes. However, the dates for their return have been revealed by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-roadmap-blitz-reload-og-delulu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 7 Season 1 Roadmap</a>.</p>



<p>NPCs can be of real assistance in every season in Fortnite, and it’s worth knowing their locations and what they offer, so Insider Gaming has all the details of where they are found in Chapter 7 Season 1.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-npc-characters-amp-services">All Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 NPC Characters &amp; Services</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to find. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 10 NPC Characters scattered across the map in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, with additions and removals likely as the season progresses.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous chapters and seasons, not all of the NPC characters have defined services and, instead, their offerings will vary each match. There are four potential options for each of the non-specialist characters to offer in a match, which are as follows.</p>



<ul>
<li>Gain Gold based on your match performance (Free)</li>



<li>Spawn a Rift (500 Gold)</li>



<li>Restock Ammo (500 Gold)</li>



<li>Health &amp; Shields (500 Gold)</li>
</ul>



<p>Specialists, meanwhile, are NPCs available to hire that will follow you for the remainder of the match, providing support based on their class, like ammo and health items, and will attack enemy players. Hiring a specialist costs 600 Gold.</p>



<p>A full list of all NPC characters in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is shown below. This article will be updated with any additions and removals as the season progresses.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>Kingston does not show as discovered on the Fortnite map this season after interacting with him, but this should be fixed soon. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Gulag became a popular meme when Warzone first released, and Fortnite could be set to bring its own version of the infamous battle arena to the colorful world.</p>



<p>‘1v1 me in the Gulag’ is a line (and meme) associated with the Covid era. Many took shelter from the pandemic in their homes and sank hundreds and thousands of hours into CoD Warzone as a means of escape. Warzone’s Gulag became the new Rust, and whenever you died in Warzone, the Gulag was your main entry point back into the game.</p>



<p>Now, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-bus-wheels-pump-n-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> Gulag could finally be following suit.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-gulag-takes-inspiration-from-call-of-duty-warzone">Fortnite Gulag Takes Inspiration From Call of Duty: Warzone</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fight me. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s fair to say that Fortnite doesn’t need to copy anyone’s homework. Epic’s shooter is still ridiculously popular nearly 10 years later, and keeps finding ways to freshen up the gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 7 Season 1</a> brought <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-leaks-reveal-driveable-reboot-vans-bots-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">driveable reboot vans, a Bots Mode</a>, along with a wingsuit, and many other ideas. According to renowned leakers Shiina and <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX"></a>HYPEX (through <a href="https://x.com/l3stei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@l3stei</a>), a Fortnite Gulag is on the way.</p>







<p>It will reportedly be called ‘Restarter Island’ and will have players compete in a series of mini-games to determine the winner. The traditional Gulag is basically a quick 1v1 gunfight where it’s the first player to eliminate the other.</p>



<p>In Fortnite, you will allegedly battle in Rock, Paper, Scissors, some kind of Shockwave Grenades mini-game, and more.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>FORTNITE GULAG SYSTEM COMING SOON</p><p>– Called "Restarter Island"<br>– Includes Rock, Paper, Scissors<br>– Classic rules, best of 3<br>– Shockwave Grenades granted over time, used to knock opponents off their platforms</p><p>(via <a href="https://twitter.com/l3stei?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@l3stei</a>) <a href="https://t.co/1oEgYmWwVp">pic.twitter.com/1oEgYmWwVp</a></p></div>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1994896784154661265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>

<figure></figure>



<p>Fortnite does feel like an amalgamation of every top battle royale idea at this point, and why not? Millions of players still hop in every day. As long as it’s implemented right and in a fun way that doesn’t detract from Fortnite, is a new Gulag a good idea?

            <title><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red Confirms The Witcher 4 Not Releasing In 2026, New Trilogy Sticking To 6-Year Plan]]></title>

<p>The Q3 earnings call for CD Projekt Red revealed a ton of fun details. One of the most eye-catching statements mentioned The Witcher 4, letting us know it’s not releasing in 2026, but giving us a full launch window for the three new The Witcher games.</p>



<p>It feels like a millennium has passed since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 3</a> launched. The RPG of a lifetime will go down as an all-time great, and after the development of Cyberpunk 2077, its release, and the vast clean-up operation following its debut, we’re all ready for The Witcher 4 and beyond.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-trilogy-releasing-over-6-years">The Witcher Trilogy Releasing Over 6 Years</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It looks great already. Credit to CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-hits-new-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 has hit a new sales milestone</a>, showing the incredible turnaround of the game’s fortunes following its horrific 2020 release. Phantom Liberty was another hit, but it’s high time CD Projekt Red turns its full focus back ot The Witcher franchise.</p>







<p>During the company’s <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 earnings call</a>, speaker Michał Nowakowski (Joint CEO at CDPR) was asked: “Can you share more detail about where you are in The Witcher 4 development process? What are the key technical/design risks that could shift the release window?”</p>



<p>Nowakowski respodned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re not disclosing any details regarding the target release date, so there’s not a point in time I could refer to when answering such a question. The only think we’re commenting is that we’re not launching in 2026, and we’re also not typically getting into any specifics regarding technical or design matters. There’s nothing out of the ordinary, I’d say, in that area happening with TW4 – it’s just full scale production proceeding at its pace, as per our internal plans. I think that’s as much as we can say.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was probably to be expected, as you’d imagine CDPR doesn’t want to repeat the mistakes of Cyberpunk 2077. On the other hand, it was quite surprising to learn that CDPR intends to stick with its trilogy release plans:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time – as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between TW4 and TW5, between TW5 and TW6 and so on.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Again, The Witcher 4 in 2026 would be great, but the year is going to be stacked enough with games. As for the remaining games in the trilogy, as long as they’re well-made and exude that typical CDPR premium quality, three full-scale The Witcher games in six years would be special. Let us know if you think this is unrealistic, and you can do so through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1368922</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update is settling in nicely, but players are finding that things are unfolding a little haphazardly. Ahead of the launch of 1.0, the world of Tarkov was introduced to Black Division, a new and high-tier faction that was reportedly set to patrol Terminal, the new ‘endgame’ map.</p>



<p>However, in recent hours, players have started encountering Black Division and RUAF, another new faction, on multiple maps, <strong>including Factory</strong>. Presently, it seems that they’re only roaming in PvE, which has led many to believe that Battlestate Games is using the PvE platform as a testing base before releasing into PvP.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-division-is-roaming-in-tarkov">Black Division is Roaming in Tarkov</h2>



<p>In a series of shots shared by VeryBadSCAV on social media, we see clear evidence that Black Division fighters are being spotted on maps <strong>outside </strong>Terminal, the mysterious environment yet to be revealed by any Escape from Tarkov player.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Black Division fighters were found in a Factory raid on the PvE platform, which has many thinking that Battlestate is using the mode to prepare for PvP drops of the newest factions, Black Division and RUAF. Users have also reported spotting RUAF fighters roaming on various maps in large packs.</p>







<p>VeryBadSCAV continued in later posts, suggesting that Battlestate Games is ‘sneaking in’ Terminal and the recently teased Winter Update that will blanket Tarkov in snow, just as it has the last few years.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First image is the patchnote, which is too small for 6 hr downtime.<br>I call this Red herring, just like Labyrinth update was a surprise.<br>Since Black division &amp; RUAF members suddenly started to spawn in multiple maps right before the update (SS &amp; multiple reports).<br>Its very likely… <a href="https://t.co/eMDY8uluDu">pic.twitter.com/eMDY8uluDu</a></p>— VeryBadSCAV (@VeryBadSCAVR) <a href="https://twitter.com/VeryBadSCAVR/status/1995363538408477037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Some players are sceptical about the imminent arrival of Terminal, and many are confused about the ‘soft lock’ situation. No Escape from Tarkov player has managed to make it to Terminal, with many having completed the game’s new story and sitting on a ‘wait objective’ that instructs them to hold fire until an escape path is outlined.</p>



<p>Until then, Tarkov players will need to be satisfied with Black Division and RUAF gunning for them at random across other maps.</p>

<p>It has been revealed that Call of Duty is getting a crossover that wasn’t on many prediction slates for 2025. On December 11, a <strong>Street Fighter collaboration </strong>is landing in Call of Duty Mobile, bringing four legendary characters from the fighting franchise into the first-person shooter world.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty x Street Fighter crossover will yield new Operators, a host of themed weapons linked to the Street Fighter universe, and more exclusive rewards for those participating in the event through December.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-street-fighter-come-to-call-of-duty">When Does Street Fighter Come to Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>Call of Duty Mobile fans can take advantage of the Street Fighter crossover starting December 11, when the Hero’s Collection Operator Series Armory opens up, officially introducing the Street Fighter characters to COD Mobile.</p>



<p>The lineup includes some of the most recognizable characters from the fighting game’s roster:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ryu</li>

</ul>



<p>On December 13, the crossover will be expanded via the Champion’s Collection Weapon Series Armory, which introduces the unique weapon skins to bolster the collaboration.</p>



<p>It’s a bold crossover that nobody really anticipated, but it’s a welcome one nonetheless. Call of Duty Mobile is, without a doubt, the most expansive and popular COD title ever made, and it’s doing the live-service model perfectly compared to the annual releases of the core multiplayer shooters.</p>



<p>This collaboration heralds the game’s sixth anniversary, and it’s the latest in a <strong>very </strong>long line of crossover events. In recent history, we’ve seen the likes of Gundam, Nier, Rambo, and even sporting icons like Lionel Messi make their way into the Call of Duty Mobile universe.</p>

<p>The all-new Gentle Mates CDL roster has stepped up and shocked the scene to secure a win in Kaysan’s $50,000 Black Ops 7 tournament. The Kaysan Showdown VIII was the perfect opener for the Black Ops 7 season, pulling together four teams with unparalleled prospects for the upcoming year of competitive play.</p>



<p>It was FaZe Vegas, LA Thieves, OpTic Texas, and Gentle Mates that took to the stage, but when the dust settled, it was a surprise for many to see Gentle Mates standing with the trophy (virtually, of course).</p>







<h2 id="h-an-unpredictable-season">An Unpredictable Season</h2>



<p>On paper, nobody would have thought that Gentle Mates would beat the other three teams. You’ve got the back-to-back-to-back world champions in OpTic Texas, the cash-backed ‘super team’ in LA Thieves, and FaZe Vegas, a new, rebranded roster with serious potential.</p>



<p>Gentle Mates <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gentlemates-cdl-roster-revealed-2026-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled its new roster</a> just days ago, revealing the squad that will carry the hopes of the French organization through the 2026 CDL season. If Kaysan’s tournament is anything to go by, those hopes are <strong>high</strong>.</p>



<p>The clips emerging from the tournament, which was an online event, were white-hot, showcasing a blistering Gentle Mates side that leaned heavily into the fast-flowing nature of Black Ops 7, which launched last month to a mixed reception at best.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gentle Mates is going all in with this Call of Duty League roster through the 2026 season. Last year was a poor showing for the organization, which only just surfaced in the COD space after acquiring the LAG spot and rebranding for the impending season.</p>



<p>The new roster signing, a jersey refresh, and promoting some new sponsorships, like a clean Scuf controller variety, are all indications of Gentle Mates’ investment in Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The <strong>VALORANT Game Changers Championship</strong>, a massive $500,000 tournament, has wrapped in South Korea, leaving Team Liquid Brazil the victor over all comers. Ten of the best women’s and marginalized-gender teams came together in Seoul to fight for a considerable prize, and in the closing moments of the tournament, it all came down to two rival teams.</p>



<p>The Grand Final was a dramatic showdown between Team Liquid Brazil and Shopify Rebellion Gold, two of the most capable squads in the Game Changers scene. What unravelled was one hell of a VALORANT series.</p>



<h2 id="h-team-liquid-secures-180-000-in-seoul">Team Liquid Secures $180,000 in Seoul</h2>



<p>Shopify Rebellion Gold broke into the Grand Final after a defiant lower-bracket run, meeting Team Liquid, the tournament’s dominant upper-bracket organisation sitting on a white-hot streak. The best-of-five final lived up to the expectations set by fans, with both sides trading maps as the series unravelled.</p>



<p>Shopify led the charge with an easy win on Haven, but the series was set to go the distance, and it went down to the wire on the final map.</p>



<p>Team Liquid’s win denied Shopify a third consecutive Game Changers Championship win, and it was a redemption of sorts for the former team, having collapsed against Shopify during the 2023 Championship Final.</p>



<p>Beyond the Grand Final, the Game Changers tournament in Seoul represented the power of the Americas in the VALORANT space. MIBR GC and KRU Blaze brought up the rear, securing a third- and fourth-place finish, respectively, both of which hail from South America.</p>



<p>Team Liquid walks away from Seoul with the trophy and $180,000 in earnings, which is a nice payday after a hard-fought tournament.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Turok Origins To Be Released in 2026, Dev Claims]]></title>

<p>Turok Origins was given a short but sweet reveal trailer by Saber Interactive almost a year ago, and since then, things have run quiet. We’ve got a few details about the game, and fans of the title have busied themselves pulling every shred of information out of that trailer, but until now, Saber has remained mostly silent on the topic.</p>



<p>Recently, one developer’s profile was uncovered on LinkedIn, bearing a clear indication that Turok Origins, which doesn’t have a release window at present, will launch in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-turok-origins-coming-out">When is Turok Origins Coming Out?</h2>



<p>If you head over to the Turok Origins website, you’ll see that it can be wishlisted on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series XS, and Steam, but there’s no indication of a release window – <strong>not even a year</strong>.</p>



<p>It has been a fair while since Turok Origins was revealed, and fans are wondering when this all-new dinosaur-slaying epic could drop.</p>



<p>It was recently discovered on a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/javi-bermejo-969b1a181/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer’s LinkedIn profile</a> that Turok Origins is ‘forthcoming’ in 2026:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The developer, a sound designer, also worked on Saber’s Radikal Fighters and is supporting the development of an ‘unannounced project’ at the studio.</p>



<p>Turok Origins is said to take players across various worlds as they explore a multitude of biomes throughout an immersive, ‘epic story’ that can be experienced either alone or with friends. The game has a diverse array of weapons and abilities to uncover, and it can reportedly be digested from both a first- and third-person perspective.</p>



<p>Here’s the snapshot trailer, in case you’re interested:</p>
