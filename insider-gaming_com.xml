<p>Arrowhead Game Studios recently spoke about their next title, revealing that it shouldn’t be too far from Helldivers.</p>



<p>We have been hearing a lot about Helldivers 2 recently, with the developers also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-ceo-comments-on-switch-2-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting on a Switch 2 port</a>. However, we have yet to hear new details about the next game that Arrowhead Game Studios has been working on. The latest comments from the devs don’t provide too much information, but should be enough to make Helldivers fans happy. </p>



<h2 id="h-arrowhead-studios-next-game-will-not-be-too-far-from-helldivers">Arrowhead Studios’ Next Game Will Not Be ‘Too Far’ from Helldivers</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowheads-next-game-wont-be-something-thats-too-far-off-from-helldivers-2-creative-lead-says-were-looking-to-continue-the-legacy-of-what-weve-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Arrowhead Game Studios CCO, Johan Pilestedt, spoke a bit about their next title. Pilestedt first revealed that the game is currently in his favorite phase, the part he loves the most. The CCO revealed that he loves getting a new team together, breaking down boundaries among themselves, and getting to the heart of “who we are as people, and what games do we want to make together.”</p>



<p>Talking about what Arrowhead devs want to make, Pilestedt states that the team is “looking to continue the legacy of what we’ve created already.” The CCO added that the next title is “something that’s too far off from Helldivers”, which means that people who are massive Helldivers fans will be able to jump into their next game and “recognise the DNA” they have become familiar with over the years. The devs didn’t provide any more details about the game or explain how Helldivers will inspire it. </p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2’s Xbox port helped increase the sales and engagement for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 and PC versions</a>.

<p>The team behind FiveM has officially announced support for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition, allowing users to convert Legacy assets for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition through a new tool called Alchemist. </p>



<p>As we wait for Rockstar’s next big thing to arrive, GTA 6, players still have time to sink their teeth into all that Grand Theft Auto 5 and GTA Online have to offer. Recently, we were informed that GTA Online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-now-included-with-gta-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be included</a> with a GTA+ membership. Now, the modding community has some good news to celebrate, thanks to mods being updated for Enhanced Edition support. </p>



<h2 id="h-alchemist-will-convert-fivem-mods-for-gta-online-enhanced-edition">Alchemist Will Convert FiveM Mods for GTA Online Enhanced Edition</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-alchemist-for-fivem/5366795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> by Cfx.re (via <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/new-fivem-conversion-tool-released-by-rockstar-games-owned-team/#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Intel</a>), Alchemist is the first tool in a series of updates set to arrive for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition to support FiveM. The new tool will allow players, server owners, and creators to convert assets that were originally made for the GTA 5 Legacy edition and make them compatible with the Enhanced Edition. Alchemist also lets users refine existing Legacy assets to address potential formatting or compatibility issues introduced by earlier tools.</p>



<p>The Asset Conversion feature in Alcehmist allows users to convert a folder and all its content automatically. When choosing the folder, Alchemist can identify all GTA 5 Legacy assets inside the subfolders and “convert them to the GTAV Enhanced format inside the selected target directory.” The tool will also copy scripts, interfaces, and configuration files without altering them. </p>



<p>In other news, GTA 6’s delay could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-delay-could-impact-halo-remake-gears-e-day-next-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact the launches</a> of Halo Remake, Gears E-Day, and the next Call of Duty. Additionally, Rockstar’s recent firings have led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-after-firings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal issues</a> with IWGB.

<p>Your graphics card is going to get even more expensive. According to a new report from Taiwan’s UND, AMD is set to raise the cost of its GPUs due to rising memory costs.</p>



<p>This follows recent rumors that the company had begun notifying its board partners of the plan. </p>



<p><strong>“The continuous rise in memory prices has led to a sharp increase in graphics card costs,”</strong> <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/11162/9158350?from=edn_maintab_index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report says</a> via machine translation. <strong>“Industry sources indicate that AMD, the second-largest graphics card manufacturer, has notified its partners of a second price increase across its entire product line. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“The increase is estimated to be at least 10%.”</strong></p>



<p>As of writing, you can still get AMD graphics cards for somewhat affordable prices. This new price point is likely to go into effect for new builds and next-gen cards. </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that AMD has yet to officially confirm its plans, so this claim should still be taken with a grain of salt until it happens. That said, Insider Gaming has reached out to AMD for clarification on what graphics cards will be impacted and if ones already manufactured will be hit with a price increase. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>
