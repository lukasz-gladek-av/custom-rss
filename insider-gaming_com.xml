<p>Sony’s CFO has revealed that Ghost of Yotei’s sales have performed better than those of Tsushima in the same period. </p>



<p>One of the biggest releases for Sony PlayStation this year was Ghost of Yotei, the highly anticipated sequel to Sucker Punch’s 2020 hit, Ghost of Tsushima. Sony had confirmed that the title sold 3.3 million copies in the first month, and the budget was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yoteis-budget-is-very-similar-to-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very similar</a> to the previous title. Now we know that the latest instalment is also performing better. </p>







<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-sold-better-than-tsushima-in-the-same-period">Ghost of Yotei Sold Better than Tsushima in the Same Period</h2>



<p>Sony CFO Lin Tao’s comments on Ghost of Yotei sales were revealed through an <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/2019316878162948307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) by Genki_JPN. Tao stated that Yotei was a “tentpole title” released in 2025 and “exceeded the sales of the previous title in the same period of time.” Sucker Punch’s latest instalment also contributed “significantly” to the financial results of the latest quarter. </p>



<p>Ghost of Yotei was released on October 2, 2025, for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5</a> and PlayStation 5 Pro. We have yet to receive an announcement for a PC version, which could help boost the sales event further. Yotei has been out for a little over 4 months, and its performance during this period has been better than Tsushima’s. No sales figures were revealed. </p>



<p>What else could help boost the sales is a DLC for the title, and the developers have already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-possible-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a potential expansion</a>. It just depends on whether they feel players really want to know more about a particular relationship or story element in the game. </p>







<p>In other news, Sucker Punch could work on a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sly Cooper or Infamous</a> game next.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite players around the world have been locked out of the game on February 5 as Epic Games deploys the latest update to the title, with players impatiently waiting for the Fortnite servers to be back up.</p>



<p>After a huge South Park collab in January, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth is entering a new month with a fresh drop of content, keeping the game alive until the next major seasonal change early in March.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Fortnite downtime and everything coming in the February 5 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New content. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite Servers are down for several hours for the update on February 5, and there is no confirmed time of their return. However, previous updates indicate how long players need to wait.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, which means that the Fortnite servers should be back up after the v39.40 update somewhere between 2 AM PT and 2 AM ET.</p>



<p>However, downtime can be longer if issues are discovered or if there is a larger patch to deploy, and social media is the best place to keep track of the server status.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-february-5-update">What’s In The Fortnite February 5 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The biggest addition in the February 5 update in Fortnite is the start of a new Fortnite Festival season, with Chappell Roan as the headline act.</strong></p>



<p>After plenty of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festivals-next-major-collab-may-have-been-found/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks and rumors</a>, her inclusion as the star of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-13-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Festival Season 13</a> was revealed by Epic Games, and the new season, of course, means a new Festival Pass to progress through.</p>



<p>In the Battle Royale scene, the South Park collab has now completed, with the Born in Chaos Mini Pass expiring. Unfortunately, if you didn’t complete the pass, those free rewards are now unavailable, though they could return to the Item Shop for purchase in the future.</p>



<p>The Valentine’s Day event is also set to be added, though the dates for its duration are not yet confirmed, and there’s a slew of big collabs coming to the Item Shop, including the second wave of KPop Demon Hunters and two character skins from Marvel Rivals; Magik and Luna Snow.</p>

<p>The Sony PlayStation 5 can officially claim victory over the Nintendo Switch 2 during the 2025 holiday season.</p>



<p>Sony recently released its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 FY2025 earnings.</a> The data show that 8 million <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-5/" id="38">PlayStation 5 </a>units were sold in the quarter ending September 30, 2025. In the same quarter, Nintendo sold 7.01 million Switch 2 units. Of note, this was the first full quarter with the Nintendo Switch successor on the market.</p>



<p>The Sony PS5 has been on the market since 2020 and has sold<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-passes-90-million-units-sold/" id="174295"> over 90 million units </a>to date. The<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908"> Nintendo Switch 2 </a>was released in June 2025 and had <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold 17.37 million units </a>as of New Year’s Eve 2025.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-battle-between-sony-and-nintendo-rages-on">The Battle Between Sony and Nintendo Rages on</h2>



<p>Although Sony had a stronger quarter, the Switch 2 outsold the PS5 in the United States in 2025. Nintendo’s original Switch is currently the second-best-selling console of all time, with 155.37 million units sold. However, Sony’s PS2 remains the best-selling console a quarter of a century after its release, with 160 million units sold worldwide.</p>







<p>Sony’s PlayStation 6 may not be released until 2027, giving Nintendo a head start in this generation. Learn more about the potential release of a PS6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" id="151319">here</a>.
