<p>Call of Duty players are already chomping at the bit, as they can’t wait for Ranked Play in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a>. Unfortunately, the competitive mode hasn’t been available at launch, but Treyarch have confirmed that the game will have it. That said, its absence and the recent trend in previous CoD titles to introduce the mode late has left the community wondering when it will arrive.</p>



<p>Here’s everything we know about when Ranked Play is coming to Black Ops 6.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-black-ops-6-ranked-play-release-date">Black Ops 6 Ranked Play release date</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-does-ranked-play-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ranked Play work in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-what-modes-are-in-black-ops-6-ranked-play">What modes are in Black Ops 6 Ranked Play?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-will-black-ops-6-have-ranked-play-rewards">Will Black Ops 6 have Ranked Play rewards?</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-ranked-play-release-date">Black Ops 6 Ranked Play release date</h2>



<p>Ranked Play will arrive in Black Ops 6 on<strong> November 14, 2024</strong>, which is also when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/">Season 1</a> begins. As soon as the first season update lands for Black Ops 6, players will be able to dive in and start their competitive journey, where they’ll be progressing through ranks and playing against similarly skilled enemies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-ranked-play-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ranked Play work in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.treyarch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Treyarch</a> will likely follow the same format as previous Ranked Play modes, with teams of 4 battling it out on a pool of carefully selected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/">maps and modes</a>. Players will have to build their loadout, working around restricted weapons, Perks, and Equipment in the Gunsmith. </p>



<p>The restrictions and rules are based on the Call of Duty League (CDL), the esports scene for the iconic FPS franchise. Players will climb <strong>Skill Divisions</strong>, which could be the same ones found in MW3, Bronze to Iridescent. As you win games, you gain Ranked Points that move you up these divisions, while if you lose the opposite happens.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-modes-are-in-black-ops-6-ranked-play">What modes are in Black Ops 6 Ranked Play?</h2>



<p>We expect Black Ops 6 to have <strong>Hardpoint, Control, and Search and Destroy</strong>, but Treyarch are yet to confirm the modes. This is based on the modes that were available in MW3’s Ranked Play, which we expect to be similar to BO6’s.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-ops-6-have-ranked-play-rewards">Will Black Ops 6 have Ranked Play rewards?</h2>



<p>We haven’t got much information regarding Black Ops 6’s Ranked Play just yet, but <strong>we assume that the mode will come with a reward system</strong>. Players will likely receive various rewards based on the Skill Division that they reach, the higher up the ladder they climb, the better the rewards. </p>



<p>If the rewards are similar to previous iterations of Ranked Play, you can expect to earn Calling Cards, Emblems, Weapon Skins, and more.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled a series of images showcasing the in-progress rework of Customs, one of the most iconic and popular maps in the pioneering extraction shooter title. It has been years since Customs was first added to the game, and it already been altered a few times, but this latest change is nothing short of an overhaul.</p>



<p>Check out the images below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mad-changes">Mad Changes</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games is taking Customs and turning it on its head, implementing some major changes that’ll make it seem like an entirely new map. That’s what the team did recently with Factory, adding new areas and adjusting what was existing to make it feel much bigger and more detailed.</p>



<p>The latest images reveal the opening of buildings that were previously inaccessible, or adding extra details to those that were. </p>

<p>It looks like the Repair Shop and the area around it have been upgraded immeasurably, and some of the smaller interiors around the Scav Checkpoint have been altered. Further underground portions have been added, which will add more depth to the relatively one-dimensional map. </p>



<p>Battlestate flicked through <strong>many </strong>changes coming to Escape from Tarkov in the next and future updates, including a rework to hipfire and ADS mechanics, winter clothing, new weapons, and an array of grenades and attachments. It’s a tasty package, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s super-spooky Halloween event is live now, and it’s forcing players to contend with bloodthirsty zombies on Labs. As if the map wasn’t tough enough already, the latest update has pumped the undead into The Lab, and entry to the map, which is usually locked behind a keycard, is free.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-locked-and-loaded">Locked and Loaded</h2>



<p>If you’re heading to Labs, you’ll need to go loaded for action – zombies are running rampant and taking no prisoners.</p>



<p>Because zombies don’t really do that.</p>



<p>When you enter the map, you’ll be hit by a blast of radiation that doesn’t dissipate and surprise, surprise – there are no gas masks to be found anywhere within easy reach. </p>



<p>Presently, it seems like there are no special tactics involved in taking them down, but they are tanky. It’s best to go with the age-old tactic of shooting them in the head with some large-calibre weapons if you want the most successful journey through the map.</p>



<p>Players are still discovering the event as we speak, so more secrets may be revealed as the night goes on and Halloween hits in earnest.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Escape from Tarkov and are eager to explore the Halloween update? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In a fitting reveal for Halloween, NetherRealm Studios has revealed the first look at gameplay for Ghostface in Mortal Kombat 1. The gameplay was revealed by franchise co-creator Ed Boon on <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1851993028170219571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>.</p>



<p>Ghostface, for those who don’t know, is the main antagonist from the popular Scream series. What makes them so unique is that it’s never the same person under the mask in the movies. In total, there have been 14 people behind the mask.</p>



<p>In the clip, which you can see below, Ghostface fights Johnny Cage. They have their distinct voice-changer that keeps their identity hidden while also equipped with a knife.</p>



<p>Ghostface will be available in Mortal Kombat 1 starting November 19 for those with Early Access. Everyone else can start slashing away on November 26.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eeum7kp35B-QY9tv.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Ghostface is just the latest fighter to be added to Mortal Kombat since the game’s release in September 2023. He is the 10th overall addition, and a part of the game’s Kombat Pack 2. Future additions to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster will include Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2.</p>



<p>NetherRealm will announce those releases at a later date. Whether there will be a Kombat Pack 3 also remains to be announced.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ghostface coming to Mortal Kombat 1? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>
