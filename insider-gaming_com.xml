<p>It has been announced that there will be a network test for Elden Ring Nightreign from February 14 to February 17.</p>



<p>Announced on X (formerly Twitter), the network test will be available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X, and applicants can register to gain access by January 20. To apply for registration to the Elden Ring Nightreign test, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-join-the-elden-ring-nightreign-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a brand new co-op action-adventure game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced during The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>



<p>However, despite being a co-op game, the game will not be playable as a duo, as the developers announced that the game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed to be played either solo or trio</a>. </p>



<p>The developers have already said that the network test is a “preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests,” the test description reads.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how much of the actual game content will be available to players, but anyone with a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series S|X can sign up.</p>



<p>First released in 2022, Elden Ring has sold 28.6 million units by September 2024, making it one of the best-selling games of all time, and the fastest-selling game published by Bandai Namco. Shadow of the Erdtree, a DLC for Elden Ring, sold five million copies in its first three days of release.</p>



<p>Will you be signing up for the Elden Ring Nightreign network test? And what do you think of it being solo or trio only? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2 come at a pivotal moment. CoD remains absolute and steadfast in its consistency, but its popularity is waning. Season 2 is a chance to rekindle the FPS fire, and we’re here to run through the latest info.</p>



<p>When former Call of Duty World Champion legend Seth “Scump” Abner describes CoD as “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scump-on-call-of-duty-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kind of depressing</a>,” it’s deeply concerning. Many are switching over for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Season One Eternal Night Falls Update</a>. Player counts are dropping big time and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> isn’t as hot as it was, despite fun variations in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-squid-game-event-release-date-details-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squid Game event</a>. Warzone isn’t doing so hot either, and Season 2 is paramount to CoD’s coming weeks.</p>



<p>Warzone and Black Ops 6 Season 2 needs to be special and must hit harder than an Archangel Launcher.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-amp-warzone-season-2-release-date">Black Ops &amp; Warzone Season 2 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s see if CoD can restore some faith. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 2’s release date is January 28 and it was confirmed by Activision through patch notes.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">January 9 patch notes blog</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 discussed stability fixes. It goes into greater detail, and ends up saying, “<strong>Look for both of those fixes when Season 02 launches on Jan. 28.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s quite uncommon for a date to be revealed this way, but we’re not complaining. We already imagined this to be the date due to the Battle Pass end date, but it’s now official. You only don’t have long left to complete your Season 1 Battle Pass and secure limited-time unlocks.</p>



<h2 id="h-possible-warzone-amp-black-ops-6-season-2-content">Possible Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 Season 2 Content</h2>



<p>There have been no leaks or suggestions as to what content is coming in Season 2. But it’s safe to assume Black Ops 6, Zombies, and Warzone are getting the usual slew of content: <strong>New Maps, Guns, Perks, limited-time modes, Operator Bundles, and a new Battle Pass</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s funny, sometimes we know of at least something fresh by now, but we don’t—and no one does. Season 2 is being kept under wraps, and fingers crossed it’s because it’s a big one. </p>



<p>Black Ops 6 players want a Ranked game mode without hackers, the Warzone community wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> back now, and Zombies is unlikely to get major content after the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-sword-upgrades-in-citadelle-des-morts-bo6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle del Morts</a>—an LTM could be fun given the novelty of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-win-dead-light-green-light-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Light Green Light</a>.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we’re going to update this guide once we learn any news or rumors about Season 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-bo6-amp-warzone-season-2-battle-pass">BO6 &amp; Warzone Season 2 Battle Pass</h2>



<p>Again, it’s not officially revealed, <strong>but a Season 2 Battle Pass is inevitable for Black Ops 6 and Warzone</strong>.</p>



<p>An even bigger question is if Activision is going to continue with additional Battle Passes. The Squid Game event didn’t just bring new game modes and special skins, but also a <strong>controversial Event Pass</strong>. It had a free version, along with a Premium Tier. This didn’t go down well with the player base, so we’ll see if this is addressed once Season 2 is announced.</p>



<hr>



<p>Call of Duty is a huge talking point at present. What do you like and dislike about it? Is Black Ops 6 dying? Does Warzone need a content injection? Let us know your thoughts below.</p>
