<p>Big releases continue to come thick and fast in 2026, and fans of the strategy genre should have their eyes cast towards the release date of MENACE.</p>



<p>The title from Hooded Horse will be available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> only on release, and the game has been compared to the likes of XCOM, which is sure to ignite further excitement in the passionate strategy playerbase. </p>



<p>With over 50k followers on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, MENACE looks set to make a big impact on its arrival, and Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date and the exact time you will be able to jump in and play.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-menace-release">When Does MENACE Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strategy. Image via Hooded Horse</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>MENACE has an official release date of February 5, 2026, though this may change based on the region where you are located.</strong></p>



<p>While the majority of players will be able to jump in on that date, others will have to wait until the early hours of the morning on the following day before the doors open to them.</p>



<p>This is because MENACE has a global release structure, becoming available simultaneously to players across the world, and not a staggered release.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-menace-release">What Time Does MENACE Release?</h2>



<p><strong>MENACE will be released at 6 AM PT on February 5, with the release taking place later in the morning for those elsewhere in the United States.</strong></p>



<p>For those in Europe, MENACE releases in the afternoon, while those in Australia and nearby regions will have to stay up late to jump in immediately. Details of the release time come via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2432860/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for players on console, there’s no news on a MENACE release on other platforms yet, so PC will be the only way to play at launch.</p>



<p>The table below highlights the release time of MENACE in major regions across the world, so you can count down exactly how long remains until the game is accessible.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Feb. 6</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has confirmed that Rebirth and Part 3 are coming to Xbox. </p>



<p>Square Enix just released the first instalment of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series on new platforms, Xbox and Switch 2, and now players are waiting to see when the next instalments will release. We have already received reports that Rebirth is coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-arrive-for-switch-2-this-summer-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 </a>and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> in 2026, and now the director has confirmed that Xbox ports do exist. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-director-confirms-xbox-ports-for-parts-2-and-3">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Series Director Confirms Xbox Ports for Parts 2 and 3</h2>



<p>In a new post on <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/2016312724599472214" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed that the next instalment will have Xbox ports. The director stated that he was happy that Xbox players were enjoying FF7 Remake, followed by confirmation that Square Enix will bring “REBIRTH and the last part of the trilogy” to Xbox as well. The director also thanked Sarah Bond and Phil Spencer for supporting the Final Fantasy series. </p>



<p>Back in September 2025, the director had stated that Final Fantasy will expand to “major platforms moving forward”, which includes PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. This week, the director also confirmed in a new interview that Rebirth and the third instalment are in development for the Switch 2, and the Switch 2 version’s gameplay experience is “pretty much exactly the same as all the other&nbsp;platforms.”</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-for-xbox">When Will Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Release For Xbox </h2>



<p>Even though we have received official confirmation on Rebirth and Part 3 coming to Xbox, we still do not have a release window. A recent report claims the Switch 2 version could arrive this summer, and a reliable source says Switch 2 and the Xbox version of Rebirth should arrive together. So players could expect the Xbox version of FF7 Rebirth to arrive in the summer of 2026 if this report is accurate. </p>







<p>In other news, the Final Fantasy 6 Remake series&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-should-be-led-by-someone-else-says-ff7-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should be led by someone else</a>,&nbsp;according to the FF7 Remake director. Additionally, the game experience for part three is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>.” What are your thoughts on Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth featuring the same gameplay experience on Switch 2 as other platforms?

<p>According to a new report, it seems that Square Enix is planning to release the Switch 2 port for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth in the Summer of 2026. </p>



<p>A reliable insider recently claimed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still scheduled to release for Xbox</a> in 2026, and the director of the series also spoke about both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-gameplay-experience-will-be-similar-to-other-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 2 and Part 3 being in development</a> for the Switch 2. Now, the new development indicates that the port could be released sooner than expected. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-release-window-reportedly-revealed-for-2026">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Switch 2 Release Window Reportedly Revealed for 2026</h2>



<p>The Summer release window for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s Switch 2 port comes through a report by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-summer-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>. According to their sources, that’s the launch window Square Enix is planning for part 2 of the series. However, the schedule may change or be delayed due to additional development time. However, as of now, it seems like they aim to release it this summer. </p>



<p>If that is indeed true, then it is exciting news for Final Fantasy 7 Remake series fans across other platforms, considering Intergrade was released for Xbox Series X/S just over a week ago. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-also-release-for-xbox-this-summer">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Could Also Release for Xbox This Summer </h2>



<p>Additionally, it seems Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth might also release for Xbox Series X/S this Summer, along with the Switch 2 port. Reliable source, NateTheHate, stated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-gamer-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-switch-2-port-could-release-this-summer.1418122/#post-150602587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> that the Xbox and Switch 2 ports “should release at the same time just as Remake did.” So, fans on other platforms might be getting the second part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series very soon. </p>







<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-stick-to-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sticking to Unreal Engine 4 </a>for development. Additionally, Part 3 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-bring-back-the-snowboarding-mini-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring back the snowboarding minigame</a> and enhance Queen’s Blood.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier today, images surfaced online of a system message apparently sent by PlayStation direct to users on PlayStation <strong>4 </strong>consoles. The message was suggesting they take a look at the latest deals on PlayStation 5 consoles to upgrade and avoid missing out on some of the biggest games set to launch in 2026.</p>



<p>Midway through 2024, the split between PS4 and PS5 players was around 50-50, with tens of millions of gamers worldwide still using the 2013 console as their flagship gaming device.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-time-to-give-up-the-playstation-4">It’s Time To Give Up the PlayStation 4</h2>



<p>The PlayStation 5 has been on the market for more than five years, and the first PlayStation 4 console dropped in 2013, so perhaps it’s time to finally bite the bullet and make that upgrade. That is, unless you’re holding out for the launch of the PlayStation 6 and are prepared to skip a generation.</p>



<p>In a recent image that surfaced on social media, one user claimed to have received a message from PlayStation that was quietly encouraging them to upgrade from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5. The <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/2016232719949189348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message read</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Whether you’re catching up with hits from 2025 like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, ARC Raiders, and Ghost of Yotei, or getting ready for the most-anticipated games of 2026, including SAROS, 007 First Light, Nioh 3, and so much more, now’s the perfect time to upgrade to a PS5 console.</em></p>



<p><em>Scan the QR code to see the latest deals on PS5 consoles.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Perhaps it’s good guy Sony trying to pull players in the right direction with their gaming hardware, or maybe it’s a method designed to coax players away from a withdrawing platform that they’ve started sunsetting.</p>



<p>In October 2025, it was revealed that some PlayStation 4 titles would have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-is-sunsetting-some-playstation-4-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certain PSN features switched off</a> in 2026. It’s an effort by Sony to start winding down what has fast become legacy hardware and software, especially as eyes turn to whatever comes next in the PlayStation 6.</p>

<p>Wildlight Entertainment is working hard to address player concerns regarding some of the quality-of-life mechanics in Highguard. Or rather, some of the <strong>missing </strong>quality-of-life mechanics. The game came out just two days ago, and players quickly discovered that some settings they expected to be there simply weren’t.</p>



<p>The Highguard team posted a message on social media addressing the issue and stated that player feedback will be addressed with some rapid patching.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-fov-sliders-incoming">Highguard FOV Sliders Incoming</h2>



<p>Highguard has already had a tough time since jumping onto the market on Monday. It was a bold experiment by Wildlight Entertainment to fuse multiple genres in a bid to create something innovative, but a lot of the effort appears to have been lost in the delivery of the thing.</p>



<p>The launch of Highguard followed more than a month of radio silence after the game’s first trailer landed at The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley, who is also being burned after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop/">promoting the game at length</a>.</p>



<p>In a recent social media post, the team at Wildlight stressed that some quality-of-life improvements are coming to address what players are asking for the most:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been listening to feedback and working to add some highly requested features, including FoV sliders for consoles, toggle settings for ADS &amp; crouch, and more graphics scaling options for PC. We’re targeting to release a patch tomorrow, with full patch notes once it’s live.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For some, it’s bizarre that Highguard was released with some of these options missing. Regardless, Wildlight is going to right that wrong with a patch that promises to be pushed out today.</p>



<p>For those hanging around, Highguard has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/">a year-long roadmap</a> stacked up and waiting to be delivered. Time will tell how many players are present to see all the content drops unravel this year, though.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employee-suspension/</link>

<p>A long-time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> employee has taken to social media to claim that he has been placed on an unpaid disciplinary suspension for comments regarding the recent return-to-office mandates.</p>







<p>Posting on LinkedIn, David Michaud-Cromp, who has worked at Ubisoft for more than 13 years, says the company notified him that he would receive a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension.</p>



<p>According to Michaud-Cromp, the suspension, which is set to start tomorrow, was issued in response to public comments he made about Ubisoft’s return-to-office policy and an “alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.”</p>



<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-forcing-full-return-office-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5-day return-to-office mandate</a>, which Insider Gaming understands has proven to be an extremely unpopular move with employees, David took to LinkedIn to say:</p>



<p>“So… Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office… because they “believe in collaboration”… but c’mon, we’re not completely stupid… we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office…”</p>



<p>Michaud-Cromp alleges that these comments led to the three-day suspension.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, and should one be received, we will update this article.</p>



<p>What do you think of employees now being suspended from Ubisoft for voicing their frustrations online?
