            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever played a multiplayer game, the chances are you’ve brushed up against a <em>cheater</em>. If not in the conventional sense, then at least in the realm of someone doing something <strong>malicious </strong>to disrupt the entertainment of legitimate players. It’s a bigger problem than people realize, and it’s costing some developers millions of dollars to combat.</p>



<p>In recent years, the plague of cheaters impacting the many multiplayer games out there has become an increasingly complex issue. As cheat manufacturers become more intelligent, traditional firefighting routes are being overwhelmed, and it’s now up to companies like <strong>Play Safe ID </strong>to find alternate ways to push back against the onslaught.</p>



<p>I recently sat down for an episode of Access Granted with Andrew Wailes, CEO and co-founder of Play Safe ID, to learn about the shocking truth behind cheating in games, and how we might all be overwhelmed if something doesn’t change soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-old-ways-are-gone-and-cheaters-are-unstoppable">The Old Ways Are Gone, and Cheaters Are Unstoppable</h2>



<p>For those developing a multiplayer game, few things are more critical than securing a solid anti-cheat engine that <strong>genuinely </strong>prevents malicious players from surfacing – and <strong>punishes them accordingly </strong>if they do. It’s not a cut-and-dry topic, though, as it has been likened to fighting a multi-headed hydra at times.</p>



<p>In 2025, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov, the face of Escape from Tarkov, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheating-situation-nikita-speaks/">described it as a ‘never-ending battle’</a>. His game is an extraction shooter, and it’s one of the most commonly-targeted titles in the gaming space, because there’s money to be made via RMT (real-money trading).</p>



<p>When Embark Studios released ARC Raiders in October 2025, a similar concept surfaced. On social media platforms, groups surfaced promoting RMT circles, and where that exists, cheaters surely follow. If they can get into a game, secure some rare loot via nefarious means, and sell it on some pseudo black market, <strong>they will</strong>.</p>



<p>In a drastic turn of events, one popular streamer named ARC Raiders <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/">‘worse than Call of Duty for cheaters’</a>, and that’s saying something.</p>



<p>But why is the situation getting worse all the time? Is it because more people than ever are playing on PC and have easier access to cheats, or is it because our world is becoming increasingly technical and more gamers know how to break games with complex hacks?</p>



<p>According to Andrew Wailes, the CEO and co-founder of Play Safe ID, an anti-cheat and player protection company, the truth is much more concerning.</p>



<h2 id="h-hundreds-of-thousands-of-cheat-developers-are-out-there">Hundreds of Thousands of Cheat Developers Are Out There</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cheaters can often easily see everything.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Andrew Wailes joined me in the most recent episode of Access Granted to talk about the state of play for <strong>cheating in gaming</strong>. Play Safe ID is revolutionizing the space by ensuring <strong>accountability </strong>takes precedence, working directly with developers and publishers to foster stronger communities where cheaters simply cannot prosper.</p>



<p>When I mentioned the ‘cat-and-mouse’ concept of the cheat development industry, Andrew assured me I’d hit the nail on the head.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a company like Battlestate or Embark, or any studio. You’re really well-funded, you’ve got a really successful, lightning in a bottle game, you’ve maybe got twenty people working on DevOps, anti-cheat detection, stuff like that.</p>



<p>You’ve got Easy, or BattlEye, VAC, Punkbuster, whatever. You’ve got this suite of tools.</p>



<p>But no matter how hard you’re working and all of your employees are working, there are <strong>thousands, to tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands </strong>of developers who make way more money than any of your staff ever will for cracking this puzzle.</p>



<p>Cheat developers aren’t necessarily <strong>bad people</strong> or evil, they’re usually very intelligent software developers that like complex, ever-changing problems and they like making a lot of money from solving them. </p>



<p>It’s just a business for them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the words of Sun Tzu, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.” That’s the concept that Play Safe ID is working with, and Andrew has built a solid profile of the entities he’s trying to help eradicate.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There are so many cheat developers who are so smart and who have a much more vested interest in getting their cheats to work than the anti-cheat does to be reactive and defeat it.</p>



<p>It’s not even like it’s an even fight, where you have the same number of cheat devs fighting as the number of people working to defend it. You have an overwhelming force of people trying to generate these cheats and break the system, and a minority force trying to fight it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The modern go-to for anti-cheat companies is to use artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven tools to combat cheaters. But Play Safe ID recognizes that even <strong>they </strong>aren’t silver bullets or a catch-all solution to fighting malicious operators.</p>



<p>Wailes said, ‘Do you know who also has AI? The people developing the cheats, and now that they can iterate and test much quicker, much more aggressively… There is no easy solve to this.”</p>



<p>Play Safe ID wants to make people <strong>accountable</strong>, using a data-driven ecosystem to empower players to represent themselves more transparently. They use a zero-retention data system to identify players across a range of integrated games, and if they cheat and are detected and subsequently banned on one platform, <strong>they’ll be banned across the suite of games</strong>.</p>



<p>Some developers, like Gamepires (SCUM), have used Play Safe ID to generate <strong>protected servers </strong>populated <strong>only </strong>by players registered with the platform. It’s a way to guarantee only verified, detectable players are using those servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-play-safe-id-the-solution">Is Play Safe ID The Solution?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can Play Safe ID combat cheaters in games like Escape from Tarkov?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Play Safe ID is trying to innovate in a very tricky space. Talking to Andrew, I learned more about the most litigious organizations that are using the power of the courts to chase down cheat manufacturers, but dipping back to the hydra analogy, for every company shut down, two more surface.</p>



<p>In some countries, such as South Korea, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-issues-thousands-of-10-year-bans-to-clamp-down-on-cheaters/">cheating in video games</a> is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison or the imposition of a massive fine. Wailes labelled it ‘a great attack vector’, but stressed you need to also encourage <strong>personal accountability</strong> on the end user and not just on those building the cheats.</p>



<p>It might not be the <strong>ultimate </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/">solution to cheating</a>, but it’s a sorely needed implementation that’s set to make waves. Some huge updates are coming to Play Safe ID’s corner of the market, and the hope is that the company can make a large enough impact to bring about tangible changes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It seems the Nintendo Switch 2 price increase will be carefully considered with the surge in memory costs. </p>



<p>With the recent increase in memory costs, the industry has been concerned about a rise in hardware prices. We have already seen AMD <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase the prices of its graphics cards</a>, NVIDIA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-reportedly-no-longer-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinue some of its GPUs</a>, and the questions about console prices are looming. However, it seems we have somewhat of an answer for the Switch 2. </p>







<h2 id="h-switch-2-price-increase-will-be-carefully-considered-says-nintendo-president">Switch 2 Price Increase Will be Carefully Considered, Says Nintendo President</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://jp.reuters.com/markets/world-indices/TUUSCEPJHBPUHI4W2N5VLZTRAA-2026-02-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> report, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa recently addressed the effects of rising memory costs on the company and the pricing of the Switch 2 during the latest earnings call Q7A. He stated that Nintendo does not expect this cost increase to have a “major impact” on its performance in the current fiscal year.</p>



<p>Coming to the Switch 2 price increase, Furukawa stated that they will “carefully consider the matter while taking a comprehensive look at the state of adoption of the platform, current sales trends, costs, profitability, market environment, and other factors,” (translated by Google)</p>



<p>Talking about the current profit margin situation, Furukawa stated that the company doesn’t see it as a “major issue.” Their priority is to “popularize the hardware” and then try to improve profit margins by maximising software sales. </p>







<p>In other news, Nintendo’s earnings call yesterday revealed that Switch 2 remains the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-crosses-17-million-units-sold-to-remain-fastest-selling-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s fastest-selling platform</a>, and that nearly half of Switch game sales <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nearly-half-of-nintendo-switch-games-sales-are-phyiscal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were physical</a>. Additionally, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-partner-direct-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a> for the Nintendo Partner Direct tomorrow has finally arrived.

            <title><![CDATA[Nikita Confirms COR3 Isn’t Related to Escape from Tarkov or Battlestate Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-confirm-cor3-not-related-battlestate-or-tarkov/</link>
            <guid>1425289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On Sunday, the mysterious project that Nikita Buyanov is connected with, known as ‘COR3’, was unveiled with a first-look trailer. It has already been compared to ‘Escape from Tarkov in space’, which is a concept fuelled by similarities and some ‘easter egg’ nods in the one-minute trailer that the shrouded team posted this weekend.</p>



<p>Today, Nikita emerged on social media to quell the rumors, stating clearly and simply that COR3 is <strong>not </strong>connected with Battlestate Games <strong>or </strong>Escape from Tarkov. It might look similar in some ways, but it’s totally unrelated.</p>







<h2 id="h-cor3-is-not-escape-from-tarkov-in-space">COR3 is NOT Escape from Tarkov in Space</h2>



<p>Weeks ago, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio that makes Escape from Tarkov, started posting cryptic teasers and puzzles related to COR3. This <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cor3-first-trailer-revealed-shooter-tarkov/">secretive new sci-fi game</a> has emerged after what’s believed to be a couple of years of development, but all we’ve seen so far is that first-look trailer and an interactive website that boasts a little lore about the project.</p>



<p>Until now, nobody in the world except Nikita has promoted COR3. That was enough to assume that it’s a project <strong>away </strong>from Battlestate Games and Escape from Tarkov, but it took the man himself taking to social media to set the story straight to quash the questions.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nikita also confirmed (in a Russian comment translated by Grok) that Escape from Tarkov isn’t being abandoned, so he can work on whatever COR3 is. The ongoing development of Escape from Tarkov’s post-launch period continues, and there are expansions on the horizon, including the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-dlc-scav-life/">first major DLC, <strong>Scav Life</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-duckov-collaboration-confirmed/">a new collaboration</a> is preparing to surface between Escape from Tarkov and Escape from Duckov, a parody extraction title that has joined forces with Battlestate Games in the <strong>best way</strong>.</p>







<p>We still don’t know much about what COR3 is, but we have confirmation now that it’s <strong>not </strong>linked to Escape from Tarkov.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When people sit down to watch Super Bowl LX on Sunday, many will be more excited to watch the commercials than the game itself. For those on that side of the fence, one commercial that you’ll see involves everyone’s favorite pocket monsters, Pokémon. </p>



<p>In a teaser posted online on Wednesday, The Pokémon Company announced that a commercial for Pokémon’s 30th anniversary will air during the big game. </p>







<p>As far as where it airs, that remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Going back to the teaser, it’s only 22 seconds long, but features Jigglypuff. In the video, Jigglypuff appears to be in a backstage room waiting to be called. Their seen pacing, singing, and floating around.</p>



<p>The screen eventually changes to the Pokémon 30 logo with a date of February 8.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The commercial during Super Bowl 60 is just one of likely a long list of plans for the franchise’s 30th anniversary. With Pokémon Day coming up on February 27, it could be assumed that there will be more surprises and announcements for fans in short order. </p>
