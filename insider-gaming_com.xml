<p>Rumors continue to swirl about a new PlayStation event, but with no official confirmation in sight, what PS5 exclusives might arrive in 2025?</p>



<p>Luckily, unlike the quieter 2024—which focused on new IPs and games from partners—next year seemingly looks packed with first-party AAAs!</p>



<p>Before we dive in, though, let me clarify that we’ll soon have a similar article focusing on Xbox, and this is nothing more than speculation on what we believe could be released in 2025.</p>



<p>Last but not least, this list focuses on console exclusives, meaning the games mentioned are confirmed only for PS5 and PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-ps5-exclusives-for-2025">PS5 exclusives for 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei </h3>



<p>Details about the sequel to Ghost of Tsushima are still a bit scarce, but the game was announced with an exciting trailer earlier this year. more importantly, it’s one of the only first-party games for PlayStation with a launch window of 2025. Since PlayStation has a tendency to repeat its dates too, so it seems plausible that this second installment of the “Ghost of” series will drop sometime in June.</p>

<p>In this new adventure, we won’t be controlling Jin Sakai; instead, we’ll play as a woman named Atsu. Set in 1603, 329 years after the first game’s events, the time skip might allow for more varied gameplay.</p>



<p>During this period, European countries heavily influenced Japan, leading to a “technological exchange.” For instance, Japanese soldiers began using firearms for the first time, which could add more variety to Atsu’s adventures. </p>



<h3 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach </h3>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach came out swinging with its first trailer, and in pure Kojima fashion, no one quite understood what exactly was happening. Its various trailers since have continued to keep people on their toes and guessing what’s next in the Death Stranding universe. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Unlike Ghost of Yotei, Death Stranding 2 at least seems to be a direct continuation of the first game, but the big question is how Kojima will manage to surprise us again and what new gameplay he has in store.</p>



<p>Since the first game launched in November 2019, the safest bet for this sequel’s release is sometime in the second half of 2025, especially if Ghost of Yotei takes up the first half.</p>



<h3 id="h-horizon-online">Horizon Online </h3>



<p>According to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent job</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/">listing</a>, Horizon Online is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to arrive sometime next year</a>.</p>



<p>Many hope it will have gameplay similar to the Monster Hunter series, but is that the direction in which Guerrilla Games is going? Will it be an open world, or are we looking at a hub-based system? Will there be PvP? How will progression work? Unfortunately, we only have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12-minute video from the game’s alpha</a> to go on, and with so much potentially changing since the leak, it’s challenging to know what exactly is in store.</p>



<p>With Monster Hunter Wilds launching at the end of February, I imagine PlayStation is tentatively looking to put Horizon Online in the second half of the year.</p>



<h3 id="h-lost-soul-aside">Lost Soul Aside </h3>



<p>Fans of Lost Soul Aside definitely deserve an award for their patience! The game was first announced back in 2017 and still doesn’t have a release date in sight.</p>

<p>However, there’s a good reason for the delay. The project was initially led by a single developer, Yang Bing, but it caught the attention of PlayStation, who decided to back the game.</p>



<p>They were so impressed that they took on the role of publisher. The game showcased a solid video at ChinaJoy 2024, indicating that things could be coming together for a 2025 release.</p>



<hr>



<p>What do you think about the PS5 exclusives set to arrive in 2025? It’s worth noting that more titles will likely launch throughout the year, but these probably will be smaller-scale projects. One example is AI-Limit, which is a game that’s a part of the PlayStation China Hero Project. But who knows, maybe PlayStation is hiding some surprises up its sleeve?</p>



<p>There are rumors that Marathon might show up next year, too, but given the project’s current state, I think that’s highly unlikely, especially considering the failed launch of Concord.  I strongly suspect that PlayStation has some real concerns about its live-service slate of games and is reevaluating its strategy. Unless, of course, Bungie is in a rush to get the game out the door, which has its own problems.</p>



<p>Other announced games, like the temporary exclusive KOTOR Remake, the<span> </span>highly anticipated&nbsp;Phantom Blade 0,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Marvel’s Wolverine, will probably not appear until sometime in 2026.</p>

<p>Palworld developers PocketPair have announced that Palworld will be getting one of its most extensive updates yet in December, with a new island around six times bigger than Sakurajima.</p>



<p>The announcement came earlier today on Palworld’s <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861922963936923656/photo/4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official X account</a>, where the new map was described as “the largest, harshest, and most mysterious new island in Palworld!”</p>



<p>“The size of the new island is about six times more than Sakurajima,” they said.</p>

<p>PocketPair is currently in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal battle with Nintendo and The Pokemon Company over Palworl</a>d. Nintendo is seeking damages of 10 million yen (around $66,000 USD) for alleged patent infringement.</p>



<p>PocketPair says that they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings” on the lawsuit.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the lawsuit hasn’t stopped the company’s ongoing success and drive to keep the game fresh. Earlier this week, the company also announced a Palworld X Terraria collaboration that would happen sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>Palworld sold eight million units in the first six days since its January 19, 2024 release date, and, as of February 2024, announced that the game had sold 15 million copies on Steam and reached a further 10 million players on Xbox. </p>
