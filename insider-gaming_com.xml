<p>A new report reveals the release date for Samsung’s upcoming flagship model, the Galaxy S26. </p>



<p>The Galaxy S series is the top range of smartphones released by the South Korean tech giant, Samsung, and it seems that their next instalment will be revealed very soon. At the moment, there is no information about the new features or any details regarding the tech; only the release date has been revealed. </p>







<h2 id="h-samsung-galaxy-s26-to-be-released-in-march-2026">Samsung Galaxy S26 to Be Released in March 2026</h2>



<p>The release date for the Samsung Galaxy S26 was revealed in a report by reliable insider <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/samsung-galaxy-s26-series-on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-60832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a> (translated by Google).

The release will be accompanied by a range of accessories for the smartphone. </p>



<p>As mentioned above, the technical specifications haven’t been revealed, but considering this is their top-of-the-line model, users can expect a notable overhaul over the previous model.

    <div>
        
<p>Intel integrated graphics seem to be getting a significant upgrade with the next generation. One known leaker has gone online to give insight into just how big of a boost they’ll be getting.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, known hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/OneRaichu/status/2008504896476348601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OneRaichu</a> spoke about the in-development Intel Nova Lake CPUs and what it entails from the integrated graphics perspective.</p>







<p>They say that the new architecture, Xe3P, which is expected to launch with the new CPU lineup in 2027, will see a performance uptick of “20-25%” with “even more [performance] uplift for the Xe3P-12C.”</p>



<p>Currently, Intel is preparing to launch its Panther Lake Core Ultra 300 series processors. Those will feature the Xe3 architecture that is also expected to be the main architecture behind the Intel Celestial graphics card line up. Those aren’t expected to be seen, however, until late 2026. </p>







<p>As with all rumors and leaks, until it’s made official or confirmed by Insider Gaming, take the information with a grain of salt. Even from leakers that have been reliable in the past.</p>



<p>What do you think about the rumored performance jump for Intel’s integrated graphics? Does it really matter to you?

<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is a unique hybrid as it features puzzle, strategy, and action elements rolled into one. You need to be a detective one second, and a tough decision-making zombie killer the next. If Quarantine Zone: The Last Check has piqued your interest, this guide will break down its platforms.</p>



<p>Gaming would be infinitely easier if every new title were released on every available platform. Obviously, this is never going to happen for various reasons, but it means we always have platform problems and console conundrums. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-release-date-demo-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check</a> is the perfect example, as it’s a promising indie title, but the audience doesn’t know where to seek shelter.</p>



<p>Time to see if PlayStation and Xbox owners have missed the quarantine period.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-on-playstation">Can You Play Quarantine Zone: The Last Check On PlayStation?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>For the time being, Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is aptly being quarantined away from all PlayStation consoles.</strong></p>



<p>Despite the interest and polish of the product, there will be no PlayStation port of The Last Check for now. The PS4 and PS5 consoles are powerful beasts, but any infected beasts are being kept on PC for now.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say a PS5 (or PS4) port won’t happen in the future. It’s happened many times in recent memory where a game does really well on PC and Steam, and later commissions a console release—REPO being a great example of this.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for future updates on The Last Check coming to PS4 or PS5.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-quarantine-zone-the-last-check-on-xbox">Can You Play Quarantine Zone: The Last Check On Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>If you’re an Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S owner, you also have to miss out on Quarantine Zone: The Last Check’s initial launch, with no Xbox port being talked about.</strong></p>



<p>There will be no console launch for The Last Check: PlayStation, Xbox, and even Nintendo Switch 1 and 2 owners need to hang fire at the checkpoint for now. Brigada and Devolver need to see how Quarantine Zone: The Last Check pans out on PC first. If it sells well, it’s reviewed well, and its player numbers can be sustained, an Xbox launch down the line is not out of the question.</p>
