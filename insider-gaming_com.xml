<p>Less than 24 hours ago, the Battlefield 6 beta kicked off, and millions of fans have already found their way into the game, <strong>including Insider Gamingâ€™s team</strong>. Unfortunately, the cheaters have also discovered how to bypass the much-discussed Javelin Anti-cheat system set up by Electronic Arts to support the gameâ€™s integrity.</p>



<p>On social media, several clips of (alleged) cheaters have surfaced and are being circulated, showing how much of a joke Javelin is to some malicious operators.</p>



<p>Why people feel the need to cheat in a <strong>beta </strong>is beyond me.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-good-thing">Good Thing?</h2>



<p>It could be argued that cheaters finding their way into Battlefield 6 in the beta is a good thing, as it allows Electronic Arts and all associated studios to firm up their anti-cheat engine ahead of the gameâ€™s full launch on October 10.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the gameâ€™s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-to-the-day-we-die-confirmed/">leadership team revealed</a> just how important it is to keep cheaters out of the game, but itâ€™s a never-ending battle thatâ€™s constantly evolving.</p>



<p>On social media, clips of cheaters spoiling the Battlefield 6 beta for legitimate players have surfaced:</p>



<div><article><p><span>ðŸš¨CONFIRMED: Cheats are already working in Battlefield 6.

This footage proves CHEATS are FULLY FUNCTIONAL on Day 1 of Early Access Beta. </span></p></article></div>



<div><article><a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1953553413972877435" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replying to @CODUpdates</a><p><span>Just a quick heads up! Forcing players to enable TPM 2.0 and Kernel-level driver anti-cheat system doesnâ€™t prevent hackers/cheaters spoofing and/or use 3rd party cheat software. Believe it or not, it is still happening on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Battlefield</a><span> 6 Open Beta test!</span></p></article></div>







<p>The beta isnâ€™t perfect, but itâ€™s feeling very polished already. Iâ€™ll dismiss the videos of streamers finding map exploits that allow them to hide in the terrain and still attack enemies across the map for now and give the game the benefit of the doubt, but the cheating situation has to be nipped in the bud.</p>



<p>In the days leading up to the Battlefield 6 beta kicking off, fans were wrestling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-secureboot-not-enabled-error/">with the SecureBoot topic</a>, with some being actively prevented from booting Battlefield just because they have some kind of third-party application (accessories, lighting, etc) enabled on their PC.</p>



<p>Have you been impacted by a blatant cheater in Battlefield 6? Let me know in the comments.</p>
