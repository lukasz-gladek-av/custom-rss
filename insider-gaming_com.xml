<p>Welcome everyone to Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast for February 21, 2025. In this week’s episode: Rainbow Six Siege X has been revealed but <em>don’t </em>call it Rainbow Six Siege 2; Ubisoft is confident in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but should they be?</p>



<p>Mike, Grant, and Albert also discuss a common question within the gaming industry: Do people put too much emphasis on a game’s graphics and visuals over actual gameplay and substance? And Tom is back from his trip to DICE to talk about what’s coming up, drop a tease on a new game in a long-running franchise, and hint at some future plans for Insider Gaming.</p>
