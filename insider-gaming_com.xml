<p>The release date of the upcoming Intel Battlemage graphics cards has seemingly been leaked. According to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/exclusive-intel-arc-battlemage-to-launch-december-12th" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, the first set of next-gen GPUs from Intel are set to release on December 12.</p>



<p>The date would back up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors of a reveal</a> coming before the end of the year.</p>



<p>Videocardz’s report claims that the announcement of Intel Battlemage will happen on December 3. The first launch of the Limited Edition GPU along with first reviews will happen on December 12. That will be quickly followed by board partner reviews on December  13.</p>



<p>As far as what graphics cards are releasing, it’s expected to first be the Intel Arc B580 and B570. Over the last few weeks, specs for the Intel Arc B580 have regularly leaked out through various means. The GPU is expected to feature 20 Xe2 cores with a 2.8 GHz clock speed and 12GB GDDR6 VRAM. The Arc B570, on the other hand, has been relatively unknown aside from an expected core count of roughly 18 Xe2 cores. </p>



<p>While the Arc B580 and B570 are expected to be the mid-range offerings from Intel this generation, there’s been no mention of a lower-end or higher-end model from the company. Should those exist, they could either be revealed during the December 3rd announcement, or during a separate reveal altogether.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Intel for comment on the Battlemage release date claims. As of publishing, no response has been received. </p>

<p>Calling fellow trainers, the Venusaur Drop Event has landed in Pokémon TCG Pocket. We knew it was coming, and the content drop has graciously brought unreleased Promo-A cards, the chance to open more Packs, and a whole lot more—and this detailed guide covers everything you need to know.</p>



<p>The Lapras EX Drop Event in early November was a big success in Pokémon TCG Pocket. New battles were added, and we all had the chance to earn special Promo Cards—including a very viable Lapras card. As we head to the Christmas season, Pokémon TCG Pocket has dropped an early present with the Venusaur Drop Event, and we knew it was coming thanks to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future expansion leaks</a>.</p>



<p>It has lots in common with the Lapras Drop Event but offers entirely new rewards and opportunities in Pokémon TCG Pocket. </p>

<figure><figcaption>Let’s get these cards. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Venusaur Drop Event is a limited-time promotion in Pokémon TCG Pocket offering new <strong>Solo Battles</strong>, <strong>rewards</strong>, and <strong>Promo-A cards</strong>, that haven’t been available until now, <strong>starting on Nov. 29</strong> and finishing on <strong>Dec. 12</strong>.</p>



<p>With the Venusaur Drop Event lasting two weeks, there’s plenty of time to get involved. FOMO shouldn’t apply here, but in any case, make sure you complete the battles and try to earn all possible rewards.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on your Event Stamina, because if you run out, <strong>you have to wait to try another battle!</strong></p>







<p>Five new Promo A cards can be gotten in Pokémon TCG Pocket: <strong>Venusaur, Greninja, Haunter, Onix, </strong>and <strong>Jigglypuff</strong>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-promo-10-mewtwo-card-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewtwo 10 Promo Card</a> still isn’t ready; however, you can grab these new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-promo-a-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promo A cards</a> for your collection.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-101-patch-durability-difficulty-dead-zones/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>STALKER 2’s massive 1.0.1 patch is here and it’s set to address 650 issues in the post-apocalyptic epic from GSC Game World. The update is live now on Xbox and PC and it effectively eradicates some of the biggest issues from the game, including controller dead zone problems, mutant difficulty, and weapon durability.</p>



<p>This is the second update of this size since STALKER 2 was released, and it stands as a testament to GSC’s desire to finesse the game as much as possible to appease the community.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-s-1-0-1-patch-is-insane">STALKER 2’s 1.0.1 Patch is Insane</h2>



<p>The full patch notes can be found on Steam, but I’ll sum up some of the most exciting changes coming with the STALKER 2 1.0.1 patch.</p>



<p>First, weapon and armour durability has been tweaked, which means that things won’t break as quickly and when they do, it won’t cost so much to fix things. That means you won’t be paying 20,000 Coupons to fix a single assault rifle anymore.</p>



<p>Also, GSC has addressed the monetary rewards you get from ‘most’ missions, giving you a few more Coupons in your pocket to play with.</p>



<p>Mutants have been tweaked – especially on lower difficulty levels – to make them much more bearable, including the Burer and Bloodsucker, which have been giving players headaches since day one.</p>



<p>This will please Xbox players: GSC has fixed the issue with gamepad dead zones. This has been a niggling problem since the game was released on November 20, and it can finally be put to bed.</p>



<p>Amongst the 650 bug fixes sits changes to almost every aspect of the game, from combat sequences to cutscenes, and from audio elements to quests. GSC has been hard at work to fix problems with AI interactions, UI problems, and blockers that prevent players from progressing through certain missions.</p>



<p>If you were concerned that STALKER 2 launched in a terrible condition, updates like the 1.0.1 patch should be starting to change your mind. </p>



<p>I still maintain this is my Game of the Year.</p>
