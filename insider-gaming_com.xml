<p>The latest Xbox Wire has announced updates to cloud screening quality for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members. They’ve also announced updates to ROG Xbox Ally and more.</p>



<p>The latest Xbox Wire has tied together a major change to Xbox platforms. The top change spotlighted an upgrade to Xbox Cloud Gaming. They have begun to allow up to 1440p, higher bitrate streaming for Game Pass Ultimate members. This update is specifically for current and last-gen consoles, joining the PC app, handhelds, and other tech that can run Game Pass.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-rog-xbox-ally-updates">New ROG Xbox Ally Updates</h2>



<p>They have also announced upgrades to the ROG Xbox Ally family of handhelds, including the ability to easily format removable storage. This update also works with officially licensed SanDisk microSD cards made exclusively for the handhelds. Now, when you’re installing a game on your Ally, you can select your removable storage Drive and format them directly.</p>



<p>They’ve also announced an update to graphic shaders on the Ally handhelds. When playing certain games, Ally and Ally X players will now see a pop-up indicating whether shaders were pre-compiled. Advanced Shader Delivery preloads game shaders during download to ensure a smoother experience when opening a game for the first time.</p>







<p>Other updates include adding Reanimal, High on Life 2, and Dragon Quest VII Reimagined to the handheld compatibility program. Reanimal is listed as “mostly compatible,” while the other two games are optimized for handheld play. Check out the full Wire here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The state of New York is suing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/valve/" id="172462">Valve</a>, claiming its loot box system constitutes gambling.</p>



<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James’ complaint asserts that loot boxes in Steam games, such as Counter-Strike 2 and DOTA 2, facilitate gambling by encouraging players to pay for a chance to win rare items, similar to how a slot machine operates. Gambling is illegal in New York, outside of certain exceptions.</p>



<p>“Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people,” said Attorney General James. “Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers.”</p>







<h2 id="h-valve-is-new-york-s-attorney-general-latest-gambling-target">Valve is New York’s Attorney General Latest Gambling Target</h2>



<p>Ahead of the Super Bowl in early February, AG James took aim at the recent rise of prediction markets such as Kalshi, warning that they lack the same protections as regulated gambling venues.</p>



<p>Now, this lawsuit warns of the slippery slope from something like loot boxes to problematic behaviors in young individuals. The lawsuit cites a “well-known gaming publication” and claims that there are countless cases of kids using their parents’ credit cards to be sucked into the world of microtransactions and loot boxes, some as young as 11.</p>



<p>It stated that this lawsuit aims to permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, to require Valve to disgorgue all ill-gotten gains, and to impose fines for violating New York’s laws.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" id="52204">Electronic Arts </a>has unfortunately announced layoffs for the makers of Skate.</p>



<p>On February 25, 2026, <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Electronic Arts issued a statement </a>announcing that it is reshaping the studio behind Skate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/full-circle/" id="96165">Full Circle</a>. In their statement, they announced that they are changing the team structure and “some roles will be impacted.” The company’s statement does not specify how widespread the restructuring will be or how many roles will be affected.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/skate/" id="352">Skate </a>launched in Early Access in September 2025.</p>



<p>The Full Circle statement, however, states that the decision is not a reflection on those affected and that they will support them through their transition.</p>



<p>“Our work on skate. continues. We look forward to working with you as we move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently for all of you. Our commitment to skate., and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, several studios have been making similar statements about layoffs and major restructurings lately. Riot Games recently severely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">downsized to restructure the team around 2XKO</a>. Highguard’s development team was also<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Why-Highguard-Failed-Highguard-Layoffs-Explained-guide.jpg" id="176090"> heavily restructured</a> less than a month after the game’s release.</p>



<p>Ubisoft continues to make major changes and is restructuring its teams moving forward. Several game projects were canceled, including the much-anticipated remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Learn more about those canceled projects <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">here</a>.</p>







<p>Microsoft Gaming and Xbox are also in the midst of a massive restructuring, following Phil Spencer’s retirement and Sarah Bond’s resignation. However, while there have been major changes to the Xbox executive team, no major in-house studio shakeups are planned. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-says-no-layoffs-coming-after-executive-shakeup/" id="178362">here</a>.</p>
