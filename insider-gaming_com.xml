<p>Every year, the best VALORANT team at the world is crowned at VALORANT Champions, which serves as the world championship for Riot Games’ agent-filled tactical shooter. Over time, the event <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-was-the-most-watched-esports-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has drawn larger audiences as the game expands its global reach</a>, and that reach is exemplified in all the different regions that have claimed the trophy at VALORANT Champions.</p>



<p>VALORANT may have a shorter history than several other esports titles, but that just makes the hall of Champions winners that much more exclusive.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-valorant-champions-winners-in-order">All VALORANT Champions Winners, In Order</h2>



<p>There have been four VALORANT Champions winners so far, beginning with the inaugural tournament in 2021.</p>



<h3 id="h-acend-2021">Acend – 2021</h3>

<p>Acend’s story has somewhat of a sad ending, as the organization didn’t acquire partnership in the VCT international leagues, and was <a href="https://x.com/AcendClub/status/1835685812031365594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to close its doors</a> in 2024 due to unsustainability. But the organization and its players still hold the distinction of being the first ever VALORANT Champions winners, defeating a Gambit team that had dominated the scene for virtually the entire year in a thrilling five-map series in the grand finals.</p>



<ul>
<li>Santeri “BONECOLD” Sassi</li>



<li>Mehmet “cNed” İpek</li>



<li>Vladyslav “Kiles” Shvets</li>



<li>Patryk “starxo” Kopczyński</li>



<li>Aleksander “zeek” Zygmunt</li>



<li>Laurynas “Nbs” Kisielius (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-loud-2022">LOUD – 2022</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Brazilian organization LOUD entered VALORANT at the start of 2022, and finished the year with a world championship. LOUD pulled the best talent from Brazil together under one electric green banner, and found a rival wearing green themselves in OpTic Gaming. The two teams faced each other six times during the 2022 season, but LOUD got the last laugh in the upper bracket final and the grand final of Champions 2023.</p>



<ul>
<li>Bryan “pANcada” Luna</li>



<li>Gustavo “Sacy” Rossi</li>



<li>Matias “Saadhak” Delipetro</li>



<li>Erick “aspas” Santos</li>



<li>Felipe “Less” Basso</li>



<li>Matheus “bzkA” Tarasconi (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-evil-geniuses-2023">Evil Geniuses – 2023</h3>

<p>Evil Geniuses’ championship run in 2023 is considered one of the miraculous runs in the history of esports. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eg-coach-potter-says-yay-has-to-prove-hes-not-a-chamber-main/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coach Christine “potter” Chi</a> started with a roster of lowly regarded players and added a completely unknown player from an open tryout mid-season. The North American team stunned the international audience with a grand finals run at Masters Tokyo, then knocked off Champions contenders like DRX, LOUD, and finally Paper Rex to win the world championship in front of a Los Angeles home crowd.</p>



<ul>
<li>Kelden “Boostio” Pupello</li>



<li>Ethan “Ethan” Arnold</li>



<li>Alexander “jawgemo” Mor</li>



<li>Corbin “C0M” Lee</li>



<li>Max “Demon1” Mazanov</li>



<li>Christine “potter” Chi (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-edward-gaming-2024">EDward Gaming – 2024</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Colin Young-Wolff for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Riot Games’ expansion of the international VALORANT esports ecosystem into China couldn’t have gone any better for the region. EDward Gaming, after dominating the Chinese scene again but falling short on the international stage, finally had their moment at Champions 2024. In Seoul, EDG went undefeated in playoffs, defeating Team Heretics in an amazing grand final, cementing Zheng “ZmjjKK” Yongkang as the top star of Chinese VALORANT.</p>



<ul>
<li>Wan “CHICHOO” Shunzhi</li>



<li>Wang “nobody” Senxu</li>



<li>Zheng “ZmjjKK” Yongkang</li>



<li>Zhang “Smoggy” Zhao</li>



<li>Hsieh “S1Mon” Meng-hsun</li>



<li>Tang “Muggle” Shijun (coach)</li>
</ul>



<p>Across these four years of VALORANT, no team has accomplished the feat of winning both a Masters event and Champions. Only one player has accomplished this: Sacy, who won Champions 2022 with LOUD and Masters Madrid 2024 with Sentinels.</p>



<p>Who do you think will lift the Champions trophy in 2025? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Bungie announced today that Destiny 2 will receive Star Wars skins and cosmetics on February 4, 2025, along with the game’s third and final Episode, Heresy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have only <a href="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1884318035000938780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teased</a> the upcoming Destiny 2 Star Wars skins and cosmetics, and we have yet to learn what exactly will be released. Players should expect new armour ornaments, accessories, emotes, and finishers inspired by Star Wars. Additionally, at the launch of Heresy, three new armour ornaments (one per Guardian class) will become available. And the inspiration for these ornaments will be “the soldiers of the Galactic Empire”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-destiny-2-s-heresy-act-1">Destiny 2’s Heresy Act 1</h2>



<p>Apart from the Destiny 2 x Star Wars collaboration, the developers have released <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/inside-destiny-2-heresy-launching-february-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">details</a> about their third episode and final epilogue, Heresy. Guardians should expect the return of a familiar foe: the Dreadnaught. However, this time, the players will take the fight to the Dreadnaught through a new exploration and combat-based activity: The Nether.&nbsp;The Heresy Episode will consist of three Acts. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers will experiment with player modifiers in the upcoming Destiny 2 update. Once the Heresy update arrives, players will observe new modifiers “with increased health pools, no regenerating of health, low ammo drops and revive tokens, and a modification on healing in the sandbox over the course of play.” Bungie wants players to strategically build their loadouts for survivability as health pools increase and regen is stopped in the upcoming update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, according to claims, Bungie’s upcoming MOBA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-upcoming-gummy-bears-moba-is-inspired-by-smash-bros-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is inspired by Smash Bros</a>. The development studio allegedly hired fans because they would “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-hired-fans-as-they-would-work-for-less-former-exec-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work for less.</a>” What are your thoughts on Destiny 2’s Star Wars collaboration?

<p>In the aftermath of the bombs dropping in and around Appalachia, much of the wasteland is barren and rife with danger. But some settlements and tows prove relatively sane and peaceful. Helvetia is neither. It’s a strange haven. But it’s where you’ll find the annual <strong>Fasnacht Event</strong>! Here is where to find Helvetia in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-helvetia-in-fallout-76"><strong>How to Find Helvetia in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<p>You can find Helvetia in Fallout 76 by venturing into <strong>The Forest region</strong>, an early-game portion of the world map, and then head south of <strong>Morgantown</strong>, along the river, and just east of <strong>Sutton</strong>. It’s a small town with a main road, a three-way intersection, and a handful of buildings, including a church and several residential abodes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, the area is relatively quiet for the post-apocalypse. It’s home to a handful of Scorched on any given day, except during Fasnacht when all hell breaks loose, and people flock to the town in droves to celebrate in strange masks and with music aplenty!</p>



<h2 id="h-quests-in-helvetia"><strong>Quests in Helvetia</strong></h2>



<p>You won’t find typical quests in Helvetia, though you will partake in various events, such as <strong>Fasnacht Day</strong>. It’s an annual event that brings players together to help the Protectrons of Helvetia celebrate the iconic albeit strange holiday commonly found in West Virginia. It’s characterized by strange masks, cheerful music, and plenty of brews to wash down the radiation.</p>







<h2 id="h-creatures-in-helvetia"><strong>Creatures in Helvetia</strong></h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>On an average day, Helvetia is quiet. It’s home to a handful of <strong>Scorched</strong>, none of which pose much of a threat to a terrifying Vault Dweller such as yourself, right? But during Fasnacht, the town starts to experience the hustle and bustle of the wasteland. During the annual event, you’ll stumble upon:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bee Swarms</strong></li>



<li><strong>Honey Beast</strong></li>



<li><strong>Megasloth</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rabbit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Radtoad</strong></li>



<li><strong>Squirrel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Super Mutant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Super Mutant Suicider</strong></li>



<li><strong>Wolf</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Plus, there’s always the occasional Protectron to assist!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cities-vr-developer-fast-travel-games-hit-with-layoffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Another virtual reality (VR) studio has been bitten by the layoff bug. Fast Travel Games, the developers behind titles such as  Cities: VR and Into The Radius, announced on Tuesday that it is laying off 30 people because of low game sales.</p>



<p>The announcement was made via a statement on social media.</p>



<p>“Due to lower sales than expected from our six game launches in 2024, in combination with a more uncertain year ahead for VR Games as a whole, we’ve taken the difficult decision to make 30 employees redundant at FTG,” Fast Travel Games’ statement reads. “These changes will affect mainly our Publishing, Marketing, and Admin departments, although the Studio will also be impacted as we consolidate down to one development team.”</p>



<p>They continued: “This is an exceptionally difficult decision, but we believe it’s necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company.</p>



<p>“Our focus now is on supporting all Fast Travellers through this challenging time. We’re grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to continue launching incredible games for our players.”</p>



<p>With the layoffs at Fast Travel Games, January has seen 21 studios either hold layoffs or shut down. The <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">total estimated jobs lost</a> as of writing sits around 700. The only bright spot at the moment is that, at this time last year, the games industry had already seen nearly 6,000 lose their jobs.</p>



<p>What do you think of the latest layoffs to hit the gaming industry, and the current state of VR games? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
