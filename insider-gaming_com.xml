<p>Amir Satvat has received a brand-new award at The Game Awards – the ‘Game Changer’ award.</p>



<p>In a segment covering Amir Satvat’s work in supporting those impacted by layoffs across the wider gaming industry, the world learned about one man’s mission to offer salvation to thousands upon thousands of industry professionals.</p>



<p>Satvat took to the stage in Los Angeles to give an emotional acceptance speech and received a standing ovation from the substantial crowd in attendance.</p>

<h2 id="h-drawing-attention">Drawing Attention</h2>



<p>Amir Satvat is a force to be reckoned with in the games industry. He has worked tirelessly over the years to carve out a profile that’s personified by his reluctance to do anything but the best for the people around him.</p>



<p>In the past, people have criticised The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley for refusing to draw attention to or even acknowledge the vast waves of layoffs that hit our industry over the last two years. This time around, on the show’s tenth anniversary, Geoff and his team rolled out a sizeable segment addressing just that.</p>



<p>When accepting the award, Satvat said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You can’t make great games without great people.</p>



<p>What more can we each do to make our industry better?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the last two years, tens of thousands of people have been laid off, and entire studios have closed their doors as the gaming industry navigates one of the most turbulent periods ever.</p>



<p>Do you think Geoff Keighley and his team did enough to acknowledge the struggles of the industry this year? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<p>The first official look at Borderlands 4 is here as Gearbox released its new trailer for the game during The Game Awards 2024. The new trailer not only gives a look at the game’s cinematics, but fans also got to see Borderlands 4 gameplay for the first time.</p>



<p>You can watch the full trailer below.</p>

<iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official First Look | The Game Awards 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZhKilJFhI3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As seen in the trailer, Borderlands 4 takes place in a completely new location and features brand-new characters. There are also returning characters such as Claptrap, 9 Toes, and more.</p>



<p>“Borderlands 4 is a mayhem-fueled looter shooter, jam-packed with billions of weapons, outrageous enemies, and intense co-op action,” the game’s description reads. “Break free from a dangerous hidden planet as one of four new badass Vault Hunters.”</p>



<p>Days before the gameplay reveal, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-borderlands-4-trailer-coming-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on social media</a> that he was excited about showing players the progress of the game. Borderlands 4 was first revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024, and is currently scheduled for a 2025. As far as when in 2025 it releases, that seems to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depend on when Rockstar</a> — another Take-Two Interactive studio — decides to launch Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>

<p>The Witcher 4 takes a franchise already steeped in blood and rich history and propels the saga to its next juicy chapter. CD Projekt Red is set to deliver an all-new story with everyone’s favorite characters, so here’s the latest on The Witcher 4, the latest release window details, and much more.</p>



<p>If you haven’t invested hundreds of hours into The Witcher 3, I’m unsure if we can be friends. It’s harsh, but fair, and should encourage you to go and get started. The Witcher 3 is an all-time great video game from start to finish: Its quests, story, characters, rich world, intricate combat, and effervescent world. This is why The Witcher 4 needs to hurry up and get into my possession.</p>



<p>As much as I loved Cyberpunk 2077, I think we’re all ready for The Witcher 4 to see what the Continent conjures next.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-witcher-4-release-window">Do we Know The Witcher 4 Release Window?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Meaner than ever. Credit to CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, we do not know when The Witcher 4 is set to release—nor do we have an approximate timeframe.</strong></p>



<p>We knew The Witcher 4 was likely to appear at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-witcher-4-trailer-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024, and it happened</a>. The footage finally showed off the RPG sequel and gave a glimpse into its future. For now, we’ll have to wait for updates from CD Projekt Red, so keep checking back for the latest updates.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-witcher-4-platforms">Do we Know The Witcher 4 Platforms?</h2>



<p>Once again, we don’t have The Witcher 4’s platforms yet. But, given the presumed size and scope of the sequel, we fully expect it to receive simultaneous launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>A last-gen release is likely too ambitious for the outdated PS4 and Xbox One, and even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-leaks-satisfye-accessory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> might struggle. It all remains to be seen.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-the-witcher-4-characters">All The Witcher 4 Characters</h2>



<p>So far, <strong>Ciri </strong>is the only recognizable character in The Witcher 4 we’ve noticed from the iconic franchise.</p>



<p>The Witcher 3 ends quite declaratively hinting Geralt of Rivia’s time as the main protagonist is up—for now at least. Geralt is reportedly set to feature in The Witcher 4, but Ciri is our main character.</p>



<p>Here’s the first trailer courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thewitcher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Witcher</a> YouTube channel.</p>

<p>The Witcher 4 details are very scarce right now. Understandably, CD Projekt Red is keeping its card close to its chest, and development is likely going to take a while. Please do keep checking back as we are going to keep this hub up to date with the latest details, leaks, and anything in between.</p>

<p>Let us know how excited you are for The Witcher 4. We hope to bring you as much information as we can, and no doubt the RPG is going to be another Game of the Year contender.</p>
