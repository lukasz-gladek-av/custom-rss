            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon fans are set to be spoiled in 2026 as the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary, and Pokopia is a major release that is right around the corner. However, questions continue to be asked about platforms.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> will be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" id="157069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 5</a>, a week after the expected flood of news emerges on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-2026-pokemon-presents/" id="172098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Day</a>, providing players with a new way to explore the world of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a>, taking the form of a humanoid ditto.</p>



<p>If you’re unsure whether Pokopia is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-pokemon-pokopia-a-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive">Is Pokémon Pokopia a Nintendo Switch 2 Exclusive?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Next gen. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia will only be available to purchase on Nintendo Switch 2, and is the first platform exclusive for the newest system for the franchise.</strong></p>



<p>While Pokémon Legends: Z-A was available on both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> consoles, Pokopia is being released solely for Switch 2. Additionally, it’s expected that any future releases for Pokémon moving forward will be Switch 2 exclusives, excluding mobile titles.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will not be a physical copy of Pokopia, and those who purchase a boxed version of the game will be provided with a Game-Key Card, which prompts a download. Unlike codes, however, they can be resold or shared with others, like a regular game cartridge.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pokemon-pokopia-on-the-original-nintendo-switch">Can You Play Pokémon Pokopia on The Original Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, while Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia won’t be released on the original Nintendo Switch, the game can still be played on the original console, though there are significant limitations.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia’s Gamershare feature allows users to invite another player to their game to create a 2-player co-op session, including the ability to send invitations to players with an original Switch console.</p>



<p>Shared games are only playable during the active session, however, and cannot be played independently by a player on the original Switch console later.</p>



<p>While this opens the door for players to enjoy Pokopia without splashing out on a Nintendo Switch 2 console, you will require someone with the game. If you want to enjoy everything Pokopia has to offer and work through the story at your own pace, you’ll need access to a Switch 2 yourself.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Marathon On Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-on-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>1438078</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The console barriers seem to be falling down, as Sony-developed Marathon will be playable on Xbox Series X|S. It’s not the first time this has happened, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/helldivers-2/" id="850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helldivers 2</a> being one of the first to break the stigma, and it looks like Marathon will keep the streak alive.</p>







<p>However, whilst it’ll be playable on Xbox devices, does that mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> will be available on Xbox Game Pass too? Insider Gaming has all the details down below.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Marathon On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Xbox green. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Marathon will not be available on Xbox Game Pass when it releases on March 5, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Just because it’s on the platform doesn’t mean it’ll break into the Xbox game’s service, as sad as that may be. If anything, it’s a coupe that Marathon will even be playable on both Xbox Series X|S, so it might be a case of taking your wins and moving on. </p>



<p>However, whilst it’s not on Xbox Game Pass at launch, that doesn’t mean it can’t feature in the future, does it?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-added-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Marathon Be Added To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no news suggesting that Marathon will ever release on Xbox Game Pass, and considering it’s developed by Sony-owned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, it’d be incredibly unlikely.</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft tend to release almost all of its first-party titles day and date on Xbox Game Pass, with many third-party titles very much on the cards in the future. However, it’s currently rare enough to find a PlayStation title on Xbox, let alone on Game Pass.</p>







<p>That being said, stranger things have happened, so until it’s officially ruled out, don’t write it off. Who knows, in a year or two, Marathon may well be on Game Pass—just don’t hold your breath.</p>

<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 have stated that they will take many steps to avoid further delays after Season 2. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Battlefield 6’s Season 2 goes live today; however, the launch was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> by almost a month. The developers had to extend season 1 to take more time to “polish and refine Season 2”. Now, the developers have outlined how they will address future delays and deadlines. </p>











<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/battlefield-6-seasons-shouldnt-face-any-more-delays-like-season-2-1675733/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameReactor</a>, the Battlefield 6 producer Phil Girette addressed the delay and spoke about the steps they are taking to avoid further Season update delays. Girette first spoke about the launch, stating that they don’t have the best track record, but Battlefield 6’s release went “pretty smooth this time around”. The producer then addressed the Season 2 delay, stating they just needed to give that a “little bit more time in the oven to polish things” and meet expectations. </p>



<p>Girette then spoke about how there are “a lot of things” when planning a season, such as marketing work and ensuring that the “timings affect not only the game itself but many, many other things.” However, they need to make sure that future seasons “hit as expected.” For that, they have “taken quite a lot of different steps in different departments to make sure that the players get the seasons immediately once the season is planned to end.”</p>







<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s roadmap has developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-roadmap-has-devs-biting-their-nails/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biting their nails</a>. Additionally, the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-update-1-2-1-adds-limited-time-modes-and-new-map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update 1.2.1.0</a> adds limited-time modes and a new map.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Extraction shooters are all the craze right now, with fans across all systems wanting to get in on the action. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> is lined up to be the next big title to hit the genre, but where can you play it?</p>







<p>From PlayStation to Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch to PC, there are a myriad of ways to game on these days, but if you’re looking to play Marathon, you’ll need access to certain platforms, and Insider Gaming has them all listed below.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Marathon On PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Friend or foe? Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Perhaps the most obvious of answers: yes, Marathon will be available on PlayStation 5 when it launches on March 5, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Marathon is developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, the masterminds behind the Destiny franchise, and the company is owned by Sony after a $3.6 billion acquisition back in July 2022. That all but guarantees that any game developed by Bungie will release day and date across PlayStation devices. </p>



<p>However, Sony has been less stringent with its exclusivity deals, especially for multiplayer titles, and Marathon won’t just be exclusive to PlayStation 5. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Marathon On Xbox Series X|S? </h2>



<p><strong>In what appears to be a breaking down of the console barriers, Marathon will be playable on both Xbox Series X|S platforms at launch. </strong></p>



<p>Typically, PlayStation titles would never appear on an Xbox device, but those days seem to be fading into a distant memory. Instead, Xbox fans can rejoice, as they’ll be able to play Marathon unrestricted alongside their PlayStation compatriots. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-on-pc">Can You Play Marathon On PC?</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation continue their growing partnership with Steam, with Marathon being playable day and date on PC. </strong></p>



<p>Numerous PlayStation titles have been heading to Steam over the past few years, typically a year or two after they’ve released on PlayStation 5. However, multiplayer titles have proven to be an exception, with titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/helldivers-2/" id="850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helldivers 2</a> arriving on Steam alongside the console version. </p>







<p>Luckily for Marathon fans, it seems like Bungie’s extraction shooter is being given a similar treatment, as it will be available on Steam on March 5, 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Marathon On Nintendo Switch Or Switch 2? </h2>



<p><strong>Sorry, Nintendo fans, but Marathon will not be playable on the Nintendo Switch, nor the Switch 2. </strong></p>



<p>It probably won’t come as much of a surprise, but it’s worth clarifying, especially for those hoping that the Nintendo Switch 2 might open more doors to multiplayer titles. Unfortunately, if you want to dive into Marathon, it won’t be on anything Nintendo.</p>

<p>Extraction shooters are where it’s at right now, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> is looking to come in and steal a slice of the pie. Developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, the Destiny veterans, it’s looking to be a fast-paced, PvPvE FPS, and it’s on a lot of people’s radar.</p>







<p>Whether it launches to success similar to that of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> remains to be seen, but if you’re thinking of giving it a go, here’s when Marathon is set to go live.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-marathon-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Marathon Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beautiful scenery. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Bungie has announced that</strong> <strong>Marathon is set to officially launch across all platforms on March 5, 2026. </strong></p>



<p>Originally, Marathon was slated for a September 2025 release, but after receiving negative feedback from alpha tests, it was delayed indefinitely back in June 2025. It wound up only being a six-month postponement, with early March 2026 now settled as the concrete release date.</p>



<p>However, if you’re hoping to jump into the game early, you can join the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam Playtest</a>, which begins a few days earlier on February 26, 2026. It won’t be content complete, but it serves as an introduction to what players can expect from Marathon going forward. </p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-release-times">Marathon Release Times</h2>



<p><strong>As things stand, no official release time has been confirmed for Marathon, but judging by the Server Slam Playtest, it’s reasonable to assume that Marathon will launch at 9 AM PT on Thursday, March 5.</strong></p>



<p>That release window also aligns with Destiny 2’s daily reset time, Bungie’s other popular multiplayer title, so it wouldn’t be outlandish to think they’ll stick to that schedule for Marathon, too. </p>

<p>2026 is a huge year for the Pokémon franchise, and the first of what could be many new titles arriving in the year ahead is right around the corner with the launch of Pokopia.</p>



<p>First revealed last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> certainly captured our attention during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" id="176556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview with the game</a>, and thrusts players into a world where humans have mysteriously vanished, leaving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> to fend for themselves.</p>



<p>If you can’t wait for the release of Pokopia, Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date for Pokopia and exactly when you can get your hands on the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-pokemon-pokopia-release">When Does Pokémon Pokopia Release?</h2>

<p><strong>Pokémon Pokopia</strong> <strong>has an official release date of March 5, 2026, and the countdown to the release of the Pokémon</strong> <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-sim</a> game is rapidly ticking toward completion.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia gives fans a new way to explore the world of Pokémon and interact with their favourite characters, in a style that is similar to the Animal Crossing franchise and the Xbox 360 classic Viva Piñata.</p>



<p>The March 5 release has been set in stone since November, and further details about the game are expected to be shared in a Pokémon Presents showcase on February 27. However, a showcase on Pokémon Day is yet to be officially confirmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-pokemon-pokopia-start-times">What Are The Pokémon Pokopia Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia’s official release time is at 12 AM local time, but due to time zone differences, you may be able to play significantly earlier than that release.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia has a staggered release time, which theoretically means those in Oceania will be the first to play, but Nintendo Switch 2 settings can be tweaked to play when the doors open. However, it is a more complicated process than with Xbox Series X|S, for example.</p>



<p>The start times for Pokémon Pokopia are listed in the table below, along with the corresponding start time in Australia and its equivalents in major time zones worldwide. </p>



<p>If Pokopia isn’t accessible on the dot at these times, it shouldn’t be too much later, so keep an eye on social media for details.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Pokopia Start Time</th><th data-align="center">Australia Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">5 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwhich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. Today’s February 17, 2026, Quordle is the #1485 edition, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 18.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>
