<p>The Sonic Series Producer has stated that Mario Kart World did not influence Sonic Racing CrossWorlds in any way. </p>



<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds launches this month on September 25, 2025. Ahead of the release, players will be able to try the game through an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-getting-free-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open network test</a> scheduled for mid-September. Ahead of that, the developers have revealed how Mario Kart World had no impact on their upcoming title‚Äôs development plans.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-did-not-influence-sonic-racing-crossworlds-development-plans">Mario Kart World Did Not Influence Sonic Racing CrossWorlds Development Plans</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://traxion.gg/sonic-series-producer-was-surprised-by-mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Traxion</a> (via <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/09/02/sonic-team-boss-mario-kart-world-wont-have-any-influence-on-sonic-racing-crossworlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyNintendoNews</a>), Sonic Series Producer Takashi Iizuka spoke about Mario Kart World‚Äôs impact on Sonic Racing CrossWorlds. Izuka first stated that, like everyone, they are also unaware of the ‚Äúroad map of Mario Kart titles‚Äù and were ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù when it was released. At the same time, the developers were expecting one to be released soon, as Nintendo ‚Äútypically‚Äù releases a new karting title with new hardware.</p>



<p>However, Iizuka added, ‚ÄúWhether or not Mario Kart was going to be released, our goal was to develop the best kind of Sonic racing title. That hasn‚Äôt changed ‚Äì Mario Kart World won‚Äôt have any influence.‚Äù Izuka also spoke about the differences between the two games, which include cross-play, a customizable gadget system, characters from other IPs, Travel Rings, and more. </p>



<p>He stated that these features add ‚Äúdepth to the racing and are something other kart racers aren‚Äôt doing.‚Äù Izuka concluded, saying, ‚ÄúEven though Mario Kart World was announced, it didn‚Äôt influence our development plans.‚Äù</p>
