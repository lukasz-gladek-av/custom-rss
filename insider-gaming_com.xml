<p>2025 has seen AI dominate various forms of media, leading to a significant impact across the entire spectrum of the world, including the gaming industry. However, this is merely the tip of the iceberg, and the impact is likely to intensify in 2026.</p>



<p>The past 12 months have seen AI become increasingly prominent in gaming, ranging from additions like an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-faces-unfair-labor-practice-charge-for-use-of-ai-darth-vader-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-voiced Darth Vader in For</a>tnite to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully AI-generated game</a>, with a smattering of other controversies in between.</p>



<p>While these incidents have sparked discussions at various points of the year, 2025 is set to be only a drop in the ocean for AI in video games, and a huge crossroads lurks ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-major-turning-point">A Major Turning Point</h2>

<p>It’s important to remember that AI in video games isn’t anything new, and the fact of the matter is, games would simply not be able to run without some AI. All of the enemy soldiers you defeat in a Call of Duty campaign, the opponents you come up against in single-player in EA FC 26, and the NPCs you meet across the vast worlds require AI, in some capacity, to work.</p>



<p>The turning point, however, has been how AI is being used. Rather than using AI to support human-created elements, that step is being skipped in many cases to reduce the workload and have AI do the creation, where it’s artwork to coding. While it’s a crucial tool that can help prevent crunch at studios, controversy remains about its use and whether it will ultimately cost people their jobs.</p>



<p>Using AI as a replacement for human work has been problematic, and gamers have a keen eye to spot where AI has been used, particularly in artwork, with accusations cast towards a slew of major games for certain aspects of work published in 2025.</p>



<p>The discovery of AI use in 2025 has led to backlash, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game Awards disqualifying Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> for generative AI usage and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/">Battlefield 6 coming und</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">er</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/"> fire</a> for suspected use of AI in cosmetic items, and the big question now is how long that furore will last.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-backlash-ease">Will The Backlash Ease?</h2>



<p>Heading into 2026, using AI, particularly generative AI, is somewhat of a death note, as it’s certain to cause backlash among gamers, and there’s no hiding any usage, as players don their detective gear to uncover the truth of whether AI has been used in assets. Essentially, it’s a PR nightmare.</p>



<p>What’s unclear is whether that backlash will remain, as the growing use of AI may eventually be the norm, rightly or wrongly. When used in the right way to support developers and ease tasks, AI is a handy tool, but it’s hard to look across the wealth of layoffs in the industry in recent years and see higher-ups not viewing AI as a handy cost-cutting measure.</p>



<p>This isn’t restricted to gaming, as the use of AI has attracted huge criticism in all forms of media, while it also has both environmental and political impacts. For now, the general view of AI is a negative one, but don’t be surprised if millions upon millions is splashed to try and alter public opinion.</p>



<p>AI use is not a problem unique to gaming, but the future does look bleak, particularly for those employed in a creative industry. Unfortunately, there are no signs of the problem going away, and 2026 could be the stage for a major shift.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft’s CEO Wants People to Stop Calling AI ‘Slop’]]></title>

<p>Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella has taken up a spot of blogging to share his thoughts on advances in technology, specifically around AI.</p>







<p>In a new blogpost posted to his new website named ‘<a href="https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/?v=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snscratchpad</a>‘, Nadella remarks that 2026 will be a “pivotal year for AI,” noting, “Yes, another one [year]. But this moment feels different in a few notable ways.”</p>



<p>According to Nadella, “We have moved past the initial phase of discovery and are entering a phase of widespread diffusion. We are beginning to distinguish between “spectacle” and “substance”. We now have a clearer sense of where the tech is headed, but also the harder and more important question of how to shape its impact on the world.”</p>



<p>“We are still in the opening miles of a marathon. Much remains unpredictable. Amidst this “model overhang,” where capability is outpacing our current ability to use it to have real world impact, this is some of what we still need to get right,” he continued.</p>



<p>In point one, Nadella states that “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our “theory of the mind” that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.”</p>



<p>He later continues to say that “we need to make deliberate choices on how we diffuse this technology in the world as a solution to the challenges of people and planet. For AI to have societal permission it must have real world eval impact. The choices we make about where we apply our scarce energy, compute, and talent resources will matter. This is the socio-technical issue we need to build consensus around.”</p>



<p>While true, it isn’t at all surprising to see Nadella fully in support of AI, after all, Microsoft has seen tens of thousands of layoffs in the past 36 months as the company continues to invest in AI.</p>







<p>Even now, it’s almost impossible to use any of Microsoft’s ecosystem without having some form of AI use, with Microsoft Copilot being at the forefront of the company’s drive.</p>



<p>It’s certainly looking like 2026 will be another year focused on AI, but with new issues coming to the forefront, including an unprecedented rise in RAM prices and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-prices-to-5000-in-2026/">hardware including GPUs</a>, it poses the question to what extent will AI be pushed and the price that we’ll, quiter literally, have to pay.</p>
