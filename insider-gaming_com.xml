<p>The time of New World: Aeternum is coming to an end. </p>



<p>After it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-development-cancelled-amazon-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no new content was coming</a> to the game and that it would be taken offline after 2026, Amazon Games has given an update as to when New World: Aeternum will go dark.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-new-world-come-down">When Will New World Come Down?</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Thursday, Amazon Games announced that New World: Aeternum will be taken offline on January 31, 2027. From that point on, no one will be able to continue playing the game.</p>



<p>With this announcement also comes the news that as of today, January 15, the game will be delisted and no longer available for purchase. If you already own the game, you can still play it and reinstall it as much as you want until the January 31, 2027 date arrives. </p>



<p><strong>“We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion,” </strong>they said. <strong>“We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community.”</strong></p>



<p>The end of New World comes after its development team was hit with layoffs back in October. At the time, the layoffs spanned across all of Amazon, including its game studios and Twitch.</p>







<p>It has been our pleasure to work on&nbsp;<em>New World: Aeternum</em>&nbsp;and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us.</p>
