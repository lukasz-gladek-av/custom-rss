<p>LEGO Fortnite, the original survival crafting game launched in December 2023, has changed its name to LEGO Fortnite Odyssey. A new Storm Chasers update for this game mode will arrive tomorrow, December 10, along with the name change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite‚Äôs Discover section now has a unique LEGO Fortnite Category, where players can find Odyssey and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-fortnites-brick-life-game-mode-arrives-this-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brick Life</a> as the new game modes. In Odyssey, players will find that the Storm King has invaded the world, and it‚Äôs up to them and their friends to take care of him and his storm-wild legion, which Raven leads.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-fortnite-storm-chasers-update-nbsp">LEGO Fortnite Storm Chasers Update&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Your new LEGO Fortnite Odyssey journey will begin at Storm Chaser village, where you meet characters like Carl Ruckus and Dr. Borrasca. Then, you will head out into the storms, where Storm Dungeons are located. Within these dungeons, you will find fragments of Storm King‚Äôs power that must be destroyed to loosen his control over the world. The enemies you are up against include the Acolytes, Raven and The Storm King himself.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-gameplay-mechanics">New Gameplay Mechanics</h2>



<p>LEGO Fortnite Odyssey‚Äôs Storm Chasers Update also introduces a set of new gameplay mechanics. Enemy health has been balanced, along with their health and damage points. Component-based crafting has been introduced, bringing more flexibility when choosing which materials to use. The Legendary Forge is an upgrade station that you can use to take your tools to the next level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, other players and NPCs can now revive players to get them back into the action. There are new vehicle-guided builds, such as the ‚ÄòLil‚Äô Barge‚Äô and ‚ÄòStorm Chaser‚Äô. Lastly, LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is fully compatible with split-screen on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters%E2%80%94every-leaked-upcoming-hero.1055868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The topic of Marvel Rivals and leaked characters is unlikely to ever go away. While the community rightly lauds the current crop of heroes, everyone is keeping an eye on the next superhero to grace our screens. So, we‚Äôve taken a trip to the rumor mill, and unearthed every bit of gossip pertaining to new Marvel Rivals heroes.</p>



<p>Heroes were the big selling point of the Marvel Rivals launch. While Marvel is blessed with a cornucopia of iconic characters, the initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-character-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hero list</a> could have impacted Marvel Rivals in different ways. Thankfully, players seem to be enjoying the content, and this is evident with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million players in Rivals‚Äô first three days</a>.</p>



<p>You can‚Äôt sit around and bask in your success in the live-service market though. Times move quickly, attention spans shrink, and you need new content in the pipeline. This is where Marvel Rivals leaked characters are a big selling point of the shooters‚Äô future, and any info is helpful.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-leaked-character">Every Marvel Rivals Leaked Character</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don‚Äôt get used to the status quo. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>So far, <strong>12 new Marvel Rivals characters have leaked</strong>, and the speculated names span various Marvel franchises: <strong>Fantastic Four, The Avengers, Captain Marvel, and X-Men</strong>.</p>



<p>We‚Äôve already discovered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultron and The Thing</a> are destined for Marvel Rivals, but this is a small mackerel of what‚Äôs allegedly to come. The leaks come courtesy of various X social media sources including <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals ‚Äî Leaks</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Facio_Leaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Matfacio | Leaker of games</a>, <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miller Ross</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/FumoLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fumo Leaks</a>.</p>



<p>Here is every leaked Marvel Rivals character so far, and their attached Marvel franchise.</p>



<ul>
<li>Angela</li>



<li>Blade</li>



<li>Captain Marvel</li>



<li>Emma Frost</li>



<li>Hit-Monkey</li>



<li>Jean Grey AKA Phoenix</li>



<li>Johnny Storm  AKA Human Torch</li>



<li>Knull</li>



<li>Mister Fantastic</li>



<li>Susan Storm AKA Invisible Woman</li>



<li>The Thing</li>



<li>Ultron</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Knull</strong> was seen in the Season 0: Dooms‚Äô Rise Official Trailer, so his debut is very likely. The rest of the rumored characters are all datamines and speculation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarvelRivals"></a>In addition to these potential heroes, I‚Äôve also seen Daredevil discussed, but only in memes showing his gameplay to be nothing but a blank screen‚Äîif you know, you know. Otherwise, these 12 names are the common heroes outed by leakers, and datamines have revealed info about each including movesets and Team-Up abilities.</p>



<p>Interestingly, there‚Äôs still no mention of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Doom</a>‚Äîa hero we‚Äôve discussed before in great detail. The villainous Victor was the heartbeat of the No One Rivals Doom trailer on Jul. 26, and also the Dooms‚Äô Rise video. There‚Äôs still no confirmation of his arrival yet though, so we‚Äôll keep our eyes peeled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-game-director-reveals-new-details-about-companions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Avowed‚Äôs Game Director, Carrie Patel, has disclosed details on how companions interact with the player in the upcoming game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-more-interactivity-and-reactivity">‚ÄúMore Interactivity and Reactivity‚Äù</h2>



<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/after-starfields-strict-companions-im-glad-avoweds-crew-wont-be-backseat-driving-and-second-guessing-all-your-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Carrie Patel discussed how they wanted to provide ‚Äúa little more interactivity and reactivity‚Äù to companions ‚Äúbased on the events and conversations and quests that you‚Äôre encountering in the game.‚Äù Patel added that they wanted companions ‚Äúto have a little bit more to say‚Äù about their journey together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patel then goes on to talk about how engaging with companions is a significant part of RPGs, but finding the ‚Äòbalance‚Äô is also crucial. They didn‚Äôt want Avowed‚Äôs companions to ‚Äúfeel like someone is backseat driving and second-guessing all your choices.‚Äù Patel also compared Avowed‚Äôs companions to Starfield‚Äôs, stating that they won‚Äôt have as extreme reactions when you do something ‚Äòevil‚Äô but will provide some form of pushback.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-s-companions-will-have-opt-in-engagement">Avowed‚Äôs Companions Will Have Opt-In Engagement</h2>



<p>Patel then talks about the opt-in engagement players can experience with companions in Avowed. The developers have ‚Äúwritten a lot of content for these characters for their engagement in the story with one another, with the player.‚Äù However, it‚Äôs up to the players whether they want to explore this content. For example, when they return to the party camp, players ‚Äúmight hear their companion say a thing or two‚Äù, but they decide whether to have the conversation and ‚Äúget to know their companion a bit better.‚Äù</p>
