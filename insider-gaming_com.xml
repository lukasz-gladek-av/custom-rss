<p>Krafton has announced that inZOI has passed 1 million units sold in its first week of launch in early access on Steam.</p>



<p>In a press release, it was also said that “Canvas,”&nbsp;inZOI’s in-game UGC (User-generated Content) sharing platform, showed strong levels of community engagement as it garnered more than 1.2 million players on the day of launch with over 470,000 pieces of uploaded content.</p>



<p>CEO CH Kim stated, “We are grateful and excited to present&nbsp;inZOI&nbsp;to players around the world through Early Access,” adding, “We will continue to actively communicate with players and foster&nbsp;inZOI&nbsp;as KRAFTON’s long-term franchise IP.”</p>



<p>The press release concluded by reiterating that the game’s future updates will introduce new content, including mod support and new cities, with all updates and DLC provided for free until full release.</p>

<p>inZOI’s success hasn’t been without controversy, though. On launch, clips started going viral showing players being able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run over children within the game</a>, an issue that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krafton quickly addressed and called a bug</a>.</p>



<p>inZOI currently sits at around 25,000 concurrent players in the past 24 hours, with 87,000 being the peak concurrent player count.</p>

<p>Team Cherry has had the world waiting with bated breath for a long time. It seemed like Hollow Knight Silksong didn’t exist at one point, but new developments mean we have a release period—and we might finally get to hear Silksong’s voice.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong has become somewhat of a myth in recent times. The Metroidvania sequel might be the most sought-after sequel after GTA 6. If you think I’m being hyperbolic, you only need to look at Steam’s wishlist page at any point in the last few months (maybe years) to see it’s been a constant number one.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event</a> was massive for Nintendo fans, but inadvertently got the Silksong hopefuls up in arms.</p>

<p><strong>We know Hollow Knight Silksong is set to release at some point in 2025, but there’s no official release date yet.</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, we’ll take it at this point. Six years after the game’s official announcement, a Silksong release date continues to elude us. But at least the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct confirmed it’s arriving this year.</p>



<p>The presentation had a “Partner Sizzle Reel” showing off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several games coming to Switch 2</a>. Hollow Knight Silksong was thrown in early on with a few seconds of gameplay. But crucially, it showed off the “2025” release period. The sequel is finally starting to look like it’s arriving in 2025.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming will duly (and excitedly) update you once <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> has an official release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-hollow-knight-silksong-taking-so-long">Why is Hollow Knight Silksong Taking so Long?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The world is ready. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Cherry hasn’t given an official reason as to why Hollow Knight Silksong is taking so long, but it’s more than likely due to the studio wanting to improve and perfect the experience to ensure it’s complete for release.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Silksong was supposed to release in 2023. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silksong-delayed-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay was announced</a> with the developer explaining on <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1656106351184199680%7Ctwgr%5E0123a947c87bc1d12a132d80aea81715e67f8dc6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fsilksong-delayed-2023%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>: “We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing. We’re excited by how the game is shaping up, and it’s gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-rating-suggests-release-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong was officially rated in April 2024</a>, leading everyone to believe a release was imminent. Unfortunately, 2024 came and went with no sign of the game. In January 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-gives-small-update-on-hollow-knight-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Cherry explained</a>: “Yes, the game is real, progressing, and will release.” This addressed concerns that Silksong’s development was troubled or canceled.</p>



<p>Fast forward to April 2025, and we finally have a Silksong release period. After six years, it feels the waiting is nearly done!</p>
