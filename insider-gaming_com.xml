<p>Electronic Arts has announced that The Sims Mobile will be shut down after more than seven years of operations and updates. The all-mobile product will be closed down from Janaury 20, 2026, and as it’s an online title, it’ll no longer be accessible to any users.</p>



<p>The team revealed a stack of limited-time events coming in the next few weeks to usher in the closure of the game, but today, October 21, The Sims Mobile will be delisted from app stores.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts has busied itself closing down servers and shutting down games across a range of genres in the last couple of years. The Sims Mobile is the latest title to be hit by that action.</p>



<p>In March 2018, The Sims Mobile was released by Electronic Arts, and by September, it had pulled in almost 50 million users and racked up more than $20 million in revenue.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent blog post</a>, the team at Electronic Arts confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(On October 20) the final update for The Sims Mobile will be available to download from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. From this date forward, players will no longer be able to purchase packs or spend real money within TSM. Any existing SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets can still be used until January 20, 2026.</p>



<p>In the final update, releasing on October 20th, 2025, everyone will receive unlimited energy to help them make the most of this time. This should make it easier to complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s now a list of special events that will unravel leading up to when the game is taken offline:</p>

<p>In the FAQs section on the above blog post, it was noted that any remaining in-game currencies, purchased or otherwise, will not be made refundable. If you’ve invested any money in The Sims Mobile and have a wallet with any cash in it, now’s the time to spend it.</p>
