<p>Nvidia’s upcoming GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards were recently spotted on Zotac’s website.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/zotac-confirms-geforce-rtx-5090-with-32gb-gddr7-memory-5080-and-5070-series-listed-as-well" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, Zotac’s website featured listings for the upcoming, next-gen Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs. These listings have been removed; however, there are still some hints that point towards an upcoming announcement. If you head to Zotac’s <a href="https://www.zotac.com/us/product/graphics_card/all?field_filter_g_memory_type_tid%5B%5D=2954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will observe new additions to its filters section. Players can filter the GPUs on the website by GDDR7 memory type and 32 GB capacity; these features are not available for the current RTX 40 series GPUs.</p>



<p>Five new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs surfaced on Zotac’s website, including RTX 5090, RTX 5090D (China Exclusive), RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070. The website didn’t feature the RTX 5060 and RTX 5080D GPUs. The listing also confirms 32 GB GDDR7 memory for the upcoming GPUs. With the graphics cards already surfacing on hardware manufacturer’s websites, it seems like Nvidia might be gearing up for an announcement soon. </p>
