<p>It was announced just yesterday the the next Xbox Games Showcase is set for June 8, and there’s one game that I’m keeping an eager eye open for. I’ve been waiting to hear something about the State of Decay 3 release date for the longest time, and this could finally be when we find out what’s going on.</p>



<p>Presently, the game doesn’t even have a <strong>release year</strong>. The running rumour is that State of Decay 3 will be released in 2026, but Undead Labs and Xbox Game Studios haven’t confirmed a thing.</p>

<p>State of Decay 3 is long overdue, in my book. I’m a huge fan of the franchise and adore the sandbox elements of picking a home and building it up while fighting with a band of permadeath survivors to outlive a zombie apocalypse. It’s everything I want in an end-of-the-world, undead epic.</p>



<p>In September 2024, Undead Labs revealed it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-2-end-support-undead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending support on State of Decay 2</a> to focus entirely on the sequel, which means the team will have had almost a year to get the game in shape by the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2025.</p>



<p><strong>Last year</strong>, the Xbox Games Showcase played host to a phenomenal new State of Decay 3 trailer, which I and many other fans lapped up.</p>



<p>We don’t know much at all about State of Decay 3, bar the fact that it’s coming. The new trailer that was released almost a year ago revealed a few tidbits, but it’s nothing that we didn’t already expect from the game, such as fearsome undead enemies, vehicular combat, and multiplayer mechanics.</p>



<p>I’d do malicious things to get my hands on the State of Decay 3 release date – hopefully, something is shown at the upcoming Xbox Games Showcase. It has been almost seven years since the last State of Decay game was released.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a new State of Decay game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
