<p>Several builds of unreleased games have been uploaded to an undisclosed datamining discord server, including Riot Games’ 2XKO.</p>



<p>So far, Insider Gaming has been able to verify that early builds of the following games have been uploaded to the server:</p>



<ul>
<li>Killing Floor 3 </li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/riot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games</a>‘ 2XKO</li>



<li>PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback</li>



<li>Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders </li>



<li>An early build of Delta Force Hawk Ops</li>
</ul>



<p>According to one source that’s in the server, uploads of the games builds are primarily used for datamining purposes, but some games with less protection will likely get leaked online. Either way, it looks like all of these games will have new bits of information leaked about them in the near future.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on where all of the builds originated, but according to other sources, 2XKO, PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback, and ARC Raiders have all recently been in a wider pool of playtesting.</p>



<p>Should any of the games leak, we will keep you updated.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has pushed out a limited-time event in Escape from Tarkov, setting bosses to a 100% spawn rate for a single day. One of the biggest talking points coming out of this spontaneous change is that PvE players have once again missed out on the event, for reasons unknown.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov stressed that as a wipe progresses in Tarkov, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/">around 50% of players</a> are locked in on the PvE platform. It comes as a surprise to learn that all those players are missing out on this latest Tarkov event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pushed-aside">Pushed Aside</h2>



<p>The newest <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1903734472383590723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Escape from Tarkov event</a> is a simple thing that allows boss characters to spawn on their respective maps with a rate of 100%. Every raid you enter is guaranteed to have a boss in it – unless you’re too late to reach them, of course.</p>



<p>However, fans are up in arms on social platforms because once again, Battlestate Games has neglected to loop in the PvE-based players for this event. This is far from being the first time this has happened, but this time around, it makes <strong>no sense</strong>.</p>



<p>Typically, PvE players miss out on pre-wipe events <strong>because their games won’t automatically reset</strong>, but this is a limited-time, one-off event that’s disconnected from any major update.</p>



<p>Fans are yet to determine <strong>why </strong>this Escape from Tarkov event has been pushed live, as it’s out of the blue and serves no purpose other than giving players a tighter challenge and helping them out with some ‘boss kill’ tasks.</p>



<p>Are you one of the many people playing PvE in Escape from Tarkov? Are you annoyed at missing this event? Let me know in the comments how you feel about it all.</p>

<p>Recently, Mojang revealed the Vibrant Visuals update for Minecraft. It’s an evolution of the game’s 15-year-old visual palette, and it’s set to change how reflections, sunlight, water, draw distances, and more all behave in Minecraft. It’s set to alter the game’s overall appearance without changing too much, but when is Vibrant Visuals coming to Minecraft?</p>



<p>The Vibrant Visuals update is already exciting fans worldwide. It’s one of the most major updates to hit Minecraft for a while, and it’ll be added alongside various changes – such as the introduction of a <strong>happy ghast</strong>. Amazing.</p>



<p>Read on to learn when Vibrant Visuals is coming to Minecraft.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-vibrant-visuals-release-date-status">Minecraft Vibrant Visuals Release Date Status</h2>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, the release date for Vibrant Visuals in Minecraft was pending, with Mojang having mentioned that it’s coming ‘in the future’.</strong> However, players on select Minecraft: Bedrock Edition devices using a beta or preview system will be able to test Vibrant Visuals sooner than that.</p>



<p>Minecraft Live 2025 had some solid reveals, but the Vibrant Visuals announcement was by far the best received. It’ll follow the Minecraft Spring to Life update, which is set to drop soon. Later this year, players will also get their first look at the dried ghast, which can be claimed and turned into a ghastling, and then into a <strong>happy ghast</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-vibrant-visuals">What is Vibrant Visuals?</h2>



<p>The Vibrant Visuals update was perfectly broken down in the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-vibrant-visuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Minecraft Live recap</a>, but I’ll paste the most important details about the update here.</p>



<p>Vibrant Visuals will change and introduce various key features in Minecraft:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shadows interacting with sunlight more accurately</li>



<li>Volumetric fog</li>



<li>Directional lighting upgrades</li>



<li>Infinite clouds across the draw</li>



<li>‘Thousands of individually crafted elements’</li>



<li>Accurate light rays through trees, windows, water, etc</li>



<li>Glow upgrades and evolved reflections</li>



<li>More accurate water visuals</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at Mojang was quick to point out that the Vibrant Visuals update in Minecraft won’t destroy the ‘creative principles’ of the game – it’s almost entirely a visual update.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to know, ‘When is Vibrant Visuals coming to Minecraft,’ you’ve got a little longer to wait, I’m afraid. It won’t be long, though – Mojang has announced it will be speeding up these ‘Game Drops’ in future, so you’ll know more very soon.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-major-ii-sweep-city-central-four-teams/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cdl-major-ii-has-been-sweep-city-central-so-far-and-only-four-teams-remain.1142400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-major-ii-sweep-city-central-four-teams/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League Major II tournament in Texas is unfolding as we speak, and it has been one of the fastest-paced events we’ve seen in years. Out of every match played, only <strong>four fixtures </strong>have gone beyond a 3-0 scoreline as the most dominant teams in the business steamroll the competition.</p>



<p>Only four teams are left in the running – Surge, FaZe, Ultra, and LAT. Fans are expecting a repeat of Major I with an LAT v. FaZe grand final, but Toronto Ultra is in the midst of a phenomenal lower-bracket run that could subvert those expectations. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-everything">Take Everything</h2>



<p>Toronto Ultra was thrown into the lower bracket by Cloud9 at the earliest opportunity before kickstarting an epic run that has seen the squad eliminate three teams back to back. In those three series, not a single map was given up by Toronto Ultra, the squad that hosted Major I and that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-championship-2025-kitchener-june/">will host COD Champs in June</a>.</p>



<p>LAT is in a similar spot, having eliminated Heretics, Royal Ravens, and Cloud9 after being forced into the loser’s bracket by Boston Breach in a shock loss early in the tournament. </p>



<p>Recently, LAT won the CDL Minor II event – the team is now looking to make it big in Major II to redeem a close loss against Atlanta FaZe in Madrid in February.</p>



<p>In an interview after the win against Cloud9, LAT’s Scrappy said about that series and this one:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I feel like we’re a complete team, I feel like at Major I our SnD wasn’t great, our map pool wasn’t great, but I think coming into this Major we put a lot of grind into it and we’re looking good.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The other dark horse in the bracket is Vancouver Surge. The squad has been on point since picking up Neptune, and the upper bracket has been their’s to control, with the team already decimating the Royal Ravens and Boston Breach. They’ll need to push past FaZe to get into the GF, but that might be light work for the Surge.</p>



<p>At Minor II, Surge eliminated Atlanta FaZe, and before that, the team scored a 3-1 win over the tournament favourites in the Major II qualifiers. FaZe hasn’t beaten Surge since June 2024, but they haven’t had many opportunities until recently. </p>



<p>It’s anyone’s game right now, and I can easily see any of the four teams left taking everything, but I love an underdog story, so I’d hope that Surge has a fair crack at picking up the trophy.</p>
