            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Now that Dying Light: The Beast has been on the market for several weeks, Techland has reorganized its developers and intends to get back on the Dying Light 2: Stay Human train. In a post on social media, franchise director Tymon Smektala asked the community what it would like to see prioritized in the coming months, suggesting that at least half a year of content is planned.</p>



<p>This was always on the cards, as Techland stressed that Dying Light: The Beast represented an important stopgap in the ongoing support of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, the live-service title that debuted in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-dying-light-2-stay-human">What’s Next for Dying Light 2: Stay Human?</h2>



<p>The post on social media published by Techland’s franchise director of Dying Light has exciting implications for Dying Light 2: Stay Human, the live-service, open-world zombie apocalypse title that dropped in 2022.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As The Beast was released we can now move more people to support DL2:SH as promised. What are the most important things we should handle? What kind of content/updates/fixes you’d expect right<br>now or in 3-6 months?</p>— Tymon Smektała (@smektalaTM) <a href="https://twitter.com/smektalaTM/status/1987249247402578122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In a community-led decision, Techland has opted to have fans decide what comes next, with Smektala reaching out to the players to see what they’d like prioritized. Techland has always been focused on the community with Dying Light, and hosts a submissions function on the game’s themed website that users can lean on to make their requests and wishes heard.</p>



<p>The Dying Light series has plenty left in the tank. Following the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/">a new era of sorts was established</a>, and the game’s ending directly links to future projects that can easily be predicted. With a universe that still has plenty to give, there’s no telling where the road will eventually take Dying Light.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-9-882/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-882-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-sunday-november-9.1348039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another week comes to a close, and I’m hopeful that your NYT Connections streak has kept up for the duration. I’m also optimistic that I’ve <strong>helped you </strong>maintain that streak by providing you with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions all week long. If you want more of that today, read on.</p>



<p>Today’s NYT Connections tips and solutions are waiting just below.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #882:</p>



<ul>
<li>NOODLE</li>



<li>BRUSH</li>



<li>CRANIUM</li>



<li>MIRROR</li>



<li>PUFNSTUF</li>



<li>REFLECT</li>



<li>TIGHT</li>



<li>MUSE</li>



<li>COMPACT</li>



<li>LUNAR</li>



<li>NAIL FILE</li>



<li>THICK</li>



<li>DENSE</li>



<li>DELIBERATE</li>



<li>CRONUT</li>



<li>TWEEZERS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think beauty tools or grooming essentials you might stash in a makeup bag or bathroom drawer.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These words all describe things that are tightly arranged, thickly clustered, or densely filled</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each of these verbs evokes contemplation, pondering, or mental wandering—perfect for a philosophical mood.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>This group blends real and invented terms that share a playful, oddball vibe—some are names, some are snacks, some are just fun to say.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 9.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-9-882">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 9 (#882)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BRUSH, MIRROR, NAIL FILE, TWEEZERS</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COMPACT, DENSE, THICK, TIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – DELIBERATE, MUSE, NOODLE, REFLECT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CRANIUM, CRONUT, LUNAR, PUFNSTUF</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Refuses to Slow Down and Secures Another Peak Player Record]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-peak-player-count-secured/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-refuses-to-slow-down-and-secures-another-peak-player-record.1348036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to take the world by storm, this time generating a new all-time high peak player count record on Steam more than a week after release. It’s proving to be the most sensational title to hit the market in years, and everyone from casual gamers to hardcore extraction shooter fans is getting involved.</p>



<p>On Steam, ARC Raiders just hit 416,517 concurrent players, up from the recent high of 354,000. It’s indicative of something remarkable, as ten days into the game’s lifecycle, it’s bucking trends and continuing to soar.</p>







<p>In the numbers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/">the reviews</a>, and the ratings, ARC Raiders is the most popular extraction shooter ever made. The sentiment surrounding this game is enough to throw the likes of Escape from Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown, Arena Breakout: Infinite, and Delta Force out the window entirely.</p>



<p>People are soaking up every element of ARC Raiders, from the aesthetic that’s dripping in retro-futurism to the social mechanics that are making ARC Raiders a joy to explore.</p>



<p>On Steam, ARC Raiders just hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-hit-new-peak-player-count-broke-servers/">another all-time high</a> peak concurrent user count, which is rare considering the game has been out for <strong>ten days</strong>. In most cases, games start to inevitably ebb in terms of player count at this point, but ARC Raiders is <strong>evolving</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What’s more impressive is that it’s only getting better. Embark Studios has lined up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">a roadmap of content</a> and upgrades that it’ll drip feed into ARC Raiders, and the team wants to support the ambitious extraction shooter for a whopping <strong>ten years</strong>.</p>



<p>Things could take a bit of a dip this coming week, as Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most prolific spearhead extraction shooter ever made, finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">hits a 1.0 release</a> and emerges on new platforms, namely Steam. If anything can poach players from ARC Raiders, it’ll be that, so it’ll be interesting to see what loyalty ARC players have stumped up in the short term.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 may be coming to Xbox Game Pass. While not confirmed, a fan found an official advertisement showing the game off.</p>



<p>There’s a lot to be excited about if you’re a Call of Duty fan right now. The biggest, of course, is the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-release-date-remains-unchanged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>, the next big game in the franchise. With constant updates to Black Ops 6 and Warzone, it’s a good time to be a fan. Fortunately, many titles in the series are available on Game Pass, both Xbox and PC. Well, a new Xbox advertisement may have spoiled one of the next entries to come to the service.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-game-pass-possibly-getting-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-soon">Xbox Game Pass Possibly Getting Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Soon</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rumor comes from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1ory64g/mw2_coming_to_game_pass/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TypicalNarr</a>, who discovered a simple Xbox Game Pass Premium ad on their console. In it, it shows many of the games on the service like Sea of Thieves and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-adds-over-90-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. However, one game caught the user’s eye that isn’t on there: the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 from 2009.&nbsp;As of writing, the game has never been on Game Pass, so the usage of the game’s cover art is a bit suspicious.</p>



<p>While it does appear official, take it with a grain of salt. One user on Reddit mentioned that 2022’s Modern Warfare 2, part of the reboot trilogy, is on the service, so perhaps it was a mix-up. Still, fans have been hoping for classic Call of Duty titles to come to Game Pass. It’s long been rumored that titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-world-at-war-and-infinite-warfare-appear-with-included-with-game-pass-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World at War</a> would drop on the subscription service with Activision’s purchase by Xbox. Hopefully, if true, more games like Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3 can come out for newer fans to try out.</p>



<p>What do you think of Modern Warfare 2 going to Game Pass? Which older Call of Duty games do you want to see on the service? World at War? Black Ops? More Modern Warfare? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[OpTic Comes Under Fire for Roobet Gambling Streams]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/optic-under-fire-roobet-gambling-streams/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-comes-under-fire-for-roobet-gambling-streams.1347820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent weeks, OpTic’s most prolific creators, alongside the likes of Nadeshot, have come under intense scrutiny after jumping on board with Roobet, a crypto-based online casino. In streams featuring Scump and H3CZ, followers have been subjected to the OpTic team playing slots and games on Roobet, also taking their gambling activities to Kick.com.</p>



<p>It was just days ago that H3CZ and Scump revealed they’d secured a bag in an all-new Roobert partnership that predicated them setting up and hosting gambling livestream events, but fans are <strong>not happy</strong> and are venting on social media.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-scump-gambling-on-stream">Why is Scump Gambling on Stream?</h2>



<p>It wouldn’t be <strong>as bad</strong> for some, but many viewers have commented on how Scump, in particular, doesn’t appear to be genuine during his gambling streams and is not playing his part properly. He and H3CZ have started streaming certain slots on Roobet, hosting broadcasts that many assume are worth tens of thousands of dollars.</p>



<p>Roobet has previously partnered with other celebrities, so this isn’t new, but many are on the side of this being irresponsible by Scump, whose audience is mostly impressionable youngsters.</p>



<p>Nadeshot has also spent a few weeks dabbling in the gambling game, flying out to Mexico to circumvent laws in the United States that prohibit some gambling activity and broadcasting from there instead. He faced backlash after jetting out to Mexico to host gambling streams while 100 Thieves, the organization he founded, held layoffs.</p>



<p>It has been argued that OpTic’s endorsement of a gambling platform like Roobet sends a troubling message to reviews, especially considering the brand’s legacy and influence in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-amazon-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> esports space. It’s a well-known fact that <strong>betting </strong>makes up a huge portion of esports revenue, but slots are a different thing entirely.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Birdman was quick to address a spot of irony, suggesting that Pred was once removed from OpTic’s roster for having a prolific gambling problem:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">why did optic kick pred off the team just for them to get sponsored by roobet they tarnished that guys pr for nothing 😭😭😭</p>— Anthony (@omgitsbirdman) <a href="https://twitter.com/omgitsbirdman/status/1986972390522286156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a clip uploaded to Reddit, Scump and H3CZ were seen standing before a virtual slot machine and ‘feigning excitement’, running around the room, and screaming as the slot machine hit multipliers and bonuses.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The comments under the video were representative of the community sentiment around this situation. One wrote, ‘I don’t know how anyone can look at these two the same again. This is beyond cringe.’ Another said, ‘Been a fan for over a decade. I’m truly disappointed.’</p>



<p>Bag or no bag, this is an alienation step that doesn’t look good and will not be forgotten quickly by fans.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-prediction-grand-final-t1-vs-kt-rolster/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/t1-vs-kt-rolster-league-of-legends-worlds-2025-grand-final-preview-prediction.1347808/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Once again, it all comes down to this. The 2025 League of Legends World Championship tournament is about to culminate in a dream final: T1 vs. KT Rolster, two titans of the LCK. It’s a battle between the ultimate underdog and the reigning champions, and it’ll be a fight to determine <strong>a first Worlds win </strong>or <strong>another trophy in the expansive cabinet.</strong></p>



<p>We’re here to look at the match being dubbed a ‘Telecom War’ in Chengdu, the Grand Final of the League of Legends World Championship 2025. Read on to learn about the gravity of this match, what it means for League esports, and most importantly, which team is predicted to win.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-will-win-lol-worlds-2025">Who Will Win LoL Worlds 2025?</h2>



<p>T1 enters the battle on November 9 (depending on where you are) as the defending champion, chasing <strong>a third consecutive </strong>League Worlds championship and a record sixth win overall. Led by the iconic Faker, the team has weathered a pretty turbulent journey through the earlier stages, managing to peak when desperately required.</p>



<p>KT Rolster, meanwhile, is the hungry challenger and has made history just getting to the Grand Final. It’s the first time the organization has made it this far in League of Legends, and along the way, it required the squad to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/">take down one of the frontrunners</a> in Gen.G.</p>



<p>Will KT Rolster make history?</p>



<p>Faker (T1) vs Bdd (KT) presents an opportunity for a generational clash to take place. It’s experience versus aggression, and it’s a coin flip to decide which way it’ll go.</p>



<p>There’s a huge prize pool on the line, and the winning team will grab a $1 million portion of the pot. This series is more about legacy than it is about the financials, though.</p>



<p>While T1 certainly holds the edge in experience and championship pedigree, it’s KT that has the momentum and hunger that could carry a roster all the way. They’re dangerous, and that might put T1 on the defensive going into the match best-of-five.</p>



<p>I’m ultimately predicting that this will be a relatively close series, with T1 closing it out 3-2 and walking away with yet another LoL Worlds trophy, pushing Faker even deeper into the history books.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> which team you think will win LoL Worlds.</p>
