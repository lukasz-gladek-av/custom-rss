            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98there-is-no-place-on-twitch-for-hatred%E2%80%99-says-ceo.1025364/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-place-on-twitch-hatred-ceo-says/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Twitch, a platform known for high levels of toxicity and scandal, is not a place for hatred of any kind, CEO Dan Clancy has insisted. In a recent blog post discussing updates to the platform’s community guidelines, the somewhat eccentric CEO stated that ‘Twitch is, and always will be, about belonging.’</p>



<p>In the last few months, Twitch has made several community-led changes to the platform’s guidelines, many of which have been well received by the wider audience. However, it’s a drop in the ocean when lined up against years of issues, struggles with hate raids and bot behaviour, and questionable content making it to the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-work-hard">‘We Work Hard’</h2>



<p>Dan Clancy was fiercely outspoken against hatred in all forms in <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/11/01/hate-and-harassment-have-no-place-on-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post on Twitch</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen members of the community voice concerns about how we handle potentially harmful content. There is no place on Twitch for racism, hatred, or harassment of any kind, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.</p>



<p>Twitch is, and will always be, about belonging. Each day, people come together on our service to build communities around shared interests, and to express themselves authentically. For this to be possible, we work hard to ensure that our community is a safe place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to say that <strong>some content </strong>might seem objectable to members of that worldwide community, but regardless, it’s allowed on the platform. In recent weeks, Twitch landed in hot water for ‘permitting’ Frogan, an inflammatory streamer, to wish death and suffering on soldiers in the US military.</p>



<p>This partnered Twitch streamer eventually landed a 30-day ban, but for some, that wasn’t even close to being enough. </p>



<p>For years, Twitch has been in a to-and-fro battle with what’s permitted on the site and what’s considered ‘bannable’. From hot tub streamers to those glorifying bullying and hateful behaviour, the site has edged into the realms of being a toxic cesspool at times.</p>



<p>Clancy is adamant that things are still changing for the better:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re grateful for the feedback and input from our community. Our safety approach continues to build and evolve, as our service grows. We want to ensure that anyone can find their place on Twitch, and remain committed to ensuring that hate and harassment have no place here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remedy Entertainment has given fans and investors an update on all of its current games. The updates come via the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest earnings report</a> on November 1.</p>



<p>Starting with Alan Wake 2, it was reveal that it has made most of its development and marketing cost back since its release.</p>



<p>According to company CEO Tero Virtala, Alan Wake 2 has yet to “generate royalties”. The studio released The Lake House expansion on October 22, wrapping up post-launch plans for the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-the-other-remedy-entertainment-games">What About The Other Remedy Entertainment Games?</h2>



<p>With Alan Wake 2 in the rear view mirror, Remedy is continuing its focus on a number of projects internally. FBC: Firebreak, which was codenamed Condor at the studio, “continues in full production with a focus on iterating on the core loop and implementing more of the UI for more player clarity based on playtesting feedback.”</p>



<p>FBC: Firebreak is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass as well as the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium subscribers. It will be self-published by Remedy and be a “mid-priced” title.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Control 2 remains in the production readiness stage with plans to enter full production in 2025.</p>



<p>“Many of the critical features of the game have been implemented to mitigate production risk, and workflows and pipelines are being  tested in preparation for full production,” Virtala said.</p>



<p>Lastly, the Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake continues in full production. No update on a potential release for that game was revealed.</p>

<p>First announced in 2010, Stalker 2 was originally scheduled to release in 2012. Unfortunately, due to studio closure, an eventual reformation, a restart of development, and numerous delays, fans have had to wait 15 years for the follow up to Stalker: Call of Pripyat.</p>



<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl finally launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Xbox Game Pass. That exclusivity to the Xbox Series consoles is expected to be for at least three months.</p>
