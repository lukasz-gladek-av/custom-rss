<p>In a new interview, Hideki Kamiya has explained in more detail on his decision to leave PlatinumGames in 2023.</p>



<p>Speaking with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/09/150183.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Spark</a> and picked up on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-on-leaving-platinumgames-i-couldnt-allow-myself-to-kill-my-soul" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Hideki Kamiya went into depth about his reason on leaving PlatinumGames in 2023.</p>



<p>“The reason I left PlatinumGames was because the company’s way of thinking was gradually shifting towards a modern model of game development that doesn’t place importance on the creators’ individuality,” he said.</p>



<p>He continued, “Even if it meant the end of my career as a creator, I couldn’t allow myself to kill my soul in order to work in an environment that I didn’t agree with.”</p>



<p>Hideki Kamiya was one of four founders of PlatinumGames, which was founded in October 2007. After leaving the studio, Kamiya went on to found CLOVERS inc. </p>



<p>Earlier this month, Kamiya <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed interest in wanting to return to developing Scalebound</a>, a game that was in development in partnership with Xbox and announced in 2014. The game was cancelled by Microsoft in 2017 for apparent issues with Unreal Engine and a lack of experience at the studio creating some of the games core elements. In addition, it was also said that the game couldn’t live up to the players high expectations.</p>



<p>As for if Scalebound will happen again remains to be seen, but for now, we’ll have to wait for CLOVERS or Kamiya to announce their first project.</p>



<p>What do you think of Kamiya leaving PlatinumGames? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Pokemon Go developer Niantic has confirmed that Monopoly Go maker Scopely has acquired its games business for $3.5 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Confirming <span>last month’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-niantic-close-to-selling-games-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, Scopely has acquired Niant</span>ic’s game business, which includes titles like Pokemon GO, Pikmin Bloom and Monster Hunter Now. Their companion apps and services, including Niantic Campfire and Wayfarer, will also fall under Scopely’s umbrella after the $3.5 billion deal. Scopely has confirmed that “All Niantic game-making team members, along with tenured leaders Kei Kawai and Ed Wu”, will continue to develop and operate their beloved experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ed Wu, the Pokemon GO lead, has <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/moving-to-a-new-home-2025?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> the acquisition and believes it “will be a positive step” for the community and the game’s future.

<p>You and a squad can channel your inner repo man in 2025’s hit horror spectacle. REPO encourages groups of players to form, forage, and flee, and if it’s free and costs nothing, it would be all the more sweet. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> started strongly, instantly gaining a few thousand players daily thanks to its advertised brand of silliness and scares. Within days, its community had exploded, achieving over a hundred thousand players and counting. You can’t help but laugh at REPO—before you inevitably shriek—and the addictive gameplay loop means replayability and longevity aren’t an issue.</p>



<p>More and more players are keen to get involved, and a low-cost entry point (potentially free) could be massive for its long-term success.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-repo-on-steam">How Much is REPO on Steam?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One more piece of loot. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>REPO costs $9.99 or £8.50 on Steam—the horror title isn’t free to play.</strong></p>



<p>Low-budget indie titles from growing studios are unlikely to make a project free-to-play. The company needs to make money, especially if it isn’t reliant on a microtransaction-driven economy. A $9.99 or £8.50 price tag is great value for what you get with REPO.</p>



<p>We’ve highlighted Steam as REPO is only available on PC for now. A future port can’t be ruled out, but there’s currently no talk of it coming to consoles. Never say never, and if it blows up enough, a future port can’t be ruled out.</p>



<p>There’s already a stellar amount of content in the game. What’s more is developer semiwork is blown away by the game’s success and is not content to sit around and leave players to grow tired of the existing features.</p>



<h2 id="h-future-repo-content-roadmap">Future REPO Content Roadmap</h2>



<p><strong>New enemies, levels, general content, and bug fixes are on the way in REPO.</strong></p>



<p>“Hey everyone, thank you so much for playing R.E.P.O. we are completely shocked and overjoyed with the response! Here’s a video with an update on what we are up to! We plan to release a video every week to make sure you guys are all up to date with our plans!” said the developer on a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3241660/view/515203741912138911?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">March 7 Steam post</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you have paid for REPO, or you’re planning on it, this is a great time to invest in the hit indie title.</p>



<hr>



<p>Many indie titles enjoy a hot start, and the hype and excitement dip. But Among Us shows that a squirrel finds a nut (or a gun) from time to time. It’ll be fascinating to see if REPO can stand the test of time in 2025—do you hope it can sustain its success?</p>
