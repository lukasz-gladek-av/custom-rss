<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved is the name of the long-awaited Combat Evolved remake. It brings Halo to PlayStation for the first time ever. However, one of the game’s original developers has noticed some discrepancies in the game’s early footage and questioned the changes, as they alter the game.</p>



<p>Time stood still when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-halo-dev-criticizes-lame-remake-changes/Combat%20Evolved%20Remake%20Officially%20Announced%20-%20Insider%20Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Combat Evolved Remake was officially announced</a>. Bungie’s original creation was about to become celebrated once more. This time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> owners would get to experience history with Halo making its blue-brand debut. Not everyone is as thrilled with the game’s first footage, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-combat-evolved-remake-makes-key-changes-from-original">Halo: Combat Evolved Remake Makes Key Changes From Original </h2>

<p>Alongside the remake announcement, we also got to witness a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-13-minute-gameplay-demo-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13-minute gameplay demo</a>. It showed off the game’s glorious opening minutes. The graphics look stunning, and it’s the Halo you know, but better.</p>



<p>Well, most people seem to think so. One person who’s not as impressed is former Bungie game designer Jaime Griesemer. The now-creative director at Highwire Games was responsible for numerous roles at Bungie, including designing, developing, tuning, and scripting gameplay objects, missions, core combat principles, and the tutorial and demo.</p>



<p>After seeing the new gameplay, here’s what Griesemer had to say on X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters. I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot. When you can just smash the crates out of the way it wrecks the encounters. But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame. @game_fabricator What have they done to beloved B30?!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>@game_fabricator being Marcus Lehto: Former co-creator of Halo, who was recently ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-battlefield-6-director-marcus-lehto-disappointed-with-devs-being-omitted-from-credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disappointed’ that he and various team members were omitted from the Battlefield 6 credits.</a></p>



<p>Griesemer replied to many commenters on the post. He understood that “You can FORCE the Warthog through the gap in a variety of ways. I literally spent most of a day making it discouraging and difficult but not impossible. You’re welcome!” and that “On further analysis I’m sure it’s because the vehicles take damage and so you’re just as likely to destroy the hog as get it over the rocks. If anything that makes it -worse- because -none- of the vehicle tricks are going to work anymore.”</p>

<p>The talking point here isn’t necessarily the changes made to Halo: Campaign Evolved (as it’s being called) and its first few minutes, but what other tweaks Halo Studios AKA 343 Industries, have made throughout the game.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a big deal? Are you worried about other sections of the game being changed?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-to-lower-requirements-for-exclusive-mega-evolutions-in-ranked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-to-lower-requirements-for-exclusive-mega-evolutions-in-ranked.1338991/</guid>

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is tweaking the reward process in Ranked for Season 2, reducing the requirements to earn exclusive Mega Evolutions in the game.</p>



<p>The latest Pokémon title earned criticism for locking a trio of Mega Evolutions behind Ranked performances, with a minimum rank of K required to claim Greninjite and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mega-greninja-greninjite-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlock Mega Greninja</a> in Season 1.</p>



<p>However, that approach is being shifted for Season 2, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-season-2-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kicks off next week</a>, with significantly lower requirements to claim the latest batch of rewards.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Waiting game. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post published by The Pokémon Company, which has since been deleted but can still be read on social media platforms like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ojaaqn/comment/nm1hax1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, the requirements to earn Delphoxite and unlock Mega Delphox were shared.</p>



<p>Initially, the post stated the requirements would be the same, with Rank K required to be reached, but a later update reduced the level of unlocking Delphoxite to Rank S—a whopping eight levels lower than the initially stated reward.</p>



<p>Additionally, those who missed out on Greninjite and Mega Greninja in Season 1 would immediately have the opportunity to claim the required item for the Mega Evolution, with Rank Y required.</p>



<p>The post also outlined the duration of Season 2, stating it will kick off at 10 PM PT on November 5 and last for 20 days until November 25. </p>



<p>The deletion of the posts from The Pokémon Company raises questions about whether any additional changes will be made and why the posts were deleted, though it seems the information was published earlier than was planned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>Update: ARC Raiders is out now!</strong></p>



<p>ARC Raiders is out today, October 30, bringing the most highly anticipated extraction shooter ever made to the global market. It has been pieced together by Embark Studios, of The Finals fame, and it offers a unique perspective and take on a typically gruelling and super-challenging genre.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’ll break down the official launch times for ARC Raiders, letting you know when in your region ARC Raiders will be released. It’s being opened up to the world on a simultaneous basis, so that means it goes live for everyone at the same time.</p>



<p>What time does ARC Raiders go live? Find out below.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-arc-raiders-live">When is ARC Raiders Live?</h2>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders will go live at 02:30 AM PDT on October 30, which is today. </strong>It’s available for preload on all platforms, but there’s not that long to wait before it kicks off.</p>



<p>Here are all the time zones for the ARC Raiders launch:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Timezone</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Launch Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">PDT</td><td data-align="center">02:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">MDT</td><td data-align="center">03:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CDT</td><td data-align="center">04:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">EDT</td><td data-align="center">05:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">UTC</td><td data-align="center">09:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GMT</td><td data-align="center">09:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CET</td><td data-align="center">10:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">IST</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CST</td><td data-align="center">5:30 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">JST</td><td data-align="center">6:30 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AEST</td><td data-align="center">7:30 PM</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>It’s safe to expect some kind of technical or network issues, which are typical when a game has a global launch like this. With the launch not being staggered by local time, it means that everyone who wants to play this game will be jumping online at the same time, which inevitably causes some issues, and there might be some kind of server queue system arranged.</p>



<p>However, that’s what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/">recent server slam</a> was supposed to iron out.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-arc-raiders">How to Preload ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you want to get ready for the launch of ARC Raiders, you can preload the game on your platform of choice after purchasing it.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is available on PS5, Xbox Series, Epic Games, and Steam, and every storefront has mostly the same process for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preload-arc-raiders-file-sizes/">preloading the game</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Head to the storefront you want to use</li>



<li>Complete your purchase</li>



<li>Find the game in your library and hit the option to preload or pre-install</li>



<li>Wait for the download to finish</li>



<li>Sit back and wait for the ARC Raiders launch time to come around</li>
</ul>



<p>You won’t need to soak up much storage space with ARC Raiders either, as the game has a relatively small install size:</p>



<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 – 16.19 GB</li>



<li>Xbox Series – 27 GB – 32 GB</li>



<li>PC – 29.05 GB</li>
</ul>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord</a> which ARC Raiders launch time you’re preparing for, and we’ll see you in Speranza!</p>
