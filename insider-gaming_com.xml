<p>In a new statement, the former Rockstar North president, Leslie Benzies, has said the allegations in the ‘Epstein Files’ are false. </p>



<p>For those unaware, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-accused-sexual-assault-in-epstein-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revelation</a> from a few days ago revealed that Leslie Benzies has been accused of sexual assault, and the current Rockstar president, Sam Houser, was at least aware of the situation. However, Benzies has denied all of the allegations, revealing a different story. </p>







<h2 id="h-ex-rockstar-north-president-states-he-never-visited-epstein-island">Ex-Rockstar North President States He Never Visited Epstein Island</h2>



<p>In a recent statement shared with <a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> through a spokesperson, the former President of Rockstar North, Leslie Benzies, has denied all allegations related to the ‘Epstein Files.’ Benzies described the claims as false and stated that he had a “three-month consensual relationship” with the individual making the accusations. He further asserted that he has never met Jeffrey Epstein, nor has he visited Epstein’s infamous island, properties, or plane. Interested readers can find the complete statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“These allegations are false, I had a 3 months consensual relationship with this person, and I have never met Jeffrey Epstein, nor have I ever visited his island, his properties or travelled on his plane. Any suggestion otherwise is misleading,” the statement reads.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Leslie Benzies left Rockstar in 2016 and founded Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the recent flop, Mindseye. It’s important to note that mentions of Benzies and Houser come from Rom Ransome’s personal perspective and do&nbsp;not directly&nbsp;connect either of them to Epstein or the crimes he and Maxwell committed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During a new interview, the head of Obsidian Entertainment has seemingly mentioned Microsoft’s 30% profit target. </p>



<p>For those unaware, back in October 2025, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> revealed that Microsoft had set a target to achieve 30% “accountability margins” across the company, including Xbox. Microsoft had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-30-percent-debunk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debunked</a> the report, stating that the 30% profit margin target was incorrect. Now, the profit margin has popped up again in conversation with Obsidian. </p>







<h2 id="h-obsidian-talks-about-xbox-accepting-not-being-at-30-in-terms-of-profitability-standpoint">Obsidian Talks About Xbox Accepting Not Being at 30% in Terms of “Profitability Standpoint”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Obsidian Entertainment’s head, Feargus Urquhart, appears to have mentioned Microsoft’s 30% profit target. While discussing Justin Britch and Marcus Morgan, Urquhart’s lieutenants at Obsidian, the profit target was mentioned as something the duo will have to handle if they take the head’s place. The aforementioned 30% target is stated, along with the fact that this has pressured Xbox into publishing games on PlayStation. </p>



<p>The target appears to be achievable for Obsidian, provided they are allowed to keep experimenting. Urquhart mentioned that Xbox is still open to investing in riskier projects, prioritizing creative achievements over strong sales. Xbox does that even if it means to accept that where Obsidian is “going to be from a profitability standpoint isn’t going to be 30%,” added Urquhart.</p>



<p>The report also highlights other important details from the studio, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/obsidian-have-no-plans-for-the-outer-worlds-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no current plans to make a third Outer Worlds game</a>, what Avowed’s original pitch was, Obsidian’s plan forward, and much more. </p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tim-cain-returns-to-obsidian-for-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Cain returned</a> to Obsidian last year to work on an unannounced project.

            <title><![CDATA[Nearly Half of Nintendo Switch Games Sales Are Physical]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nearly-half-of-nintendo-switch-games-sales-are-phyiscal/</link>
            <guid>1424041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo’s recent FY26 report had a lot of eye-opening statistics, but an interesting one shows that, despite the push to digital media, nearly 50% of game sales were still physical, giving hope to purveyors of tangible media.</p>



<p>The death of physical media has been prophesied for years. Fingers crossed it never happens, as it means saying goodbye to steelbooks, Collector’s Editions, and all other forms of gaming physical media. New <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> sales data suggests all is not lost, and your shelves won’t accumulate dust from a lack of game cases.</p>







<h2 id="h-physical-nintendo-switch-game-sales-going-strong">Physical Nintendo Switch Game Sales Going Strong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Physical media?! Image via Nintendo </figcaption></figure>



<p>The February 3 <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_3e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial earnings report</a> had a big headline: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-crosses-17-million-units-sold-to-remain-fastest-selling-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 remains the company’s fastest-selling platform</a>.</p>







<p>It’s a fairly emphatic statement about the console’s success, but if you dig a little deeper, you’ll see a note during the presentation about digital sales for the Switch and Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Digital sales through the third quarter increased by 14.7% year-on-year to 282.0 billion yen and accounted for <strong>50.4% of total software sales</strong> for our dedicated video game platform, down 0.6 percentage points.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On one hand, this indicates a strong digital presence; however, there’s a clear message here that pretty much half of Nintendo Switch media sold is still physical.</p>



<p>It’s also pointed out that “Digital sales increased year-on-year mainly due to an increase in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software and add-on content.”</p>



<p>Meaning, without somewhat inflated numbers as a direct result of digital-only downloads in DLC and expansions, the digital percentage might be lower, and physical sales might be above 50%.</p>



<p>Physical media isn’t going away anytime soon. We learned this last year with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sold-more-physical-copies-on-nintendo-switch-2-than-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 selling more physical copies on Nintendo Switch 2 than digital</a>.</p>



<p>Let IG know if you continue to buy physical game media, and if you’ll ever switch, through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<p>Modders have revealed something players would never expect: the arrival of Pokémon in Red Dead Redemption 2, and it looks really interesting. </p>



<p>In the case of Rockstar’s hit title Red Dead Redemption 2, players have just one question on their minds: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-enhanced-version-is-still-coming-insider-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when will the rumoured enhanced version release</a>? However, given how Rockstar operates, the enhanced edition has yet to be officially announced, let alone released. So what players can do right now is wait, but while they wait, PC players have an exciting mod to look forward to. </p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-pokemon-mod-will-allow-players-to-catch-amp-train-animals-along-with-battles-and-gym-leaders">Red Dead Redemption 2 Pokémon Mod Will Allow Players to Catch &amp; Train Animals, Along with Battles and Gym Leaders</h2>



<p>Blurbstv has revealed the Red Dead Redemption 2 Pokémon mod on <a href="https://x.com/Blurbstv/status/2018387967937544390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), and the teaser is a thing of beauty. We see glimpses of all the features available in this mod, starting with how capturing works. Just like in Pokémon, Arthur is able to throw Poké Balls at various animals from RDR 2, including bears, dogs, snakes, turtles, lions, horses, and so many more. </p>



<p>Then comes the next bit, where players will be able to battle NPCs with unique types of moves. In these battles, you will also have to face gym leaders, who are members of Arthur’s gang. The teaser also shows a battle play out, with very Pokémon-esque elements attached to this game feature. Attack moves such as ‘Confusion’, ‘Body Slam’, ‘Venom’, ‘Molt’, and more were seen in the video. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I turned RDR2 into a Pokemon RPG</p><p>– Catch &amp; name wild animals<br>– Battle NPCs with unique types/moves<br>– Arthur's gang as Gym Leaders</p><p>Release: Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/37AHSZPQaJ">pic.twitter.com/37AHSZPQaJ</a></p></div>— Blurbs (@Blurbstv) <a href="https://twitter.com/Blurbstv/status/2018387967937544390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>There’s also a full-fledged YouTube video showcasing how Blurbs is developing and how to play through the mod. Things like replacing the throwing knife with a makeshift Poke Ball, adding UI to add nicknames, and so on. Towards the end, Blurbs revealed they plan to release this mod even though it is a troublesome process; however, no timeline was provided. </p>
