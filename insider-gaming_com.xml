            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone is in eager anticipation of the impending release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. It will arguably be the biggest single-game release in history, shifting millions of copies in the first few hours alone, and it’s set to break the internet, render countless gamers incapable of working, and dominate social and streaming feeds for weeks to come.</p>



<p>In case you had concerns about <strong>buying </strong>Grand Theft Auto 6 later this year, there is a method you can use to get GTA 6 <strong>for free</strong>, but it involves one hell of a requirement.</p>



<p>You need to have a baby on November 19, 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-not-a-joke-says-norwegian-firm">It’s Not a Joke, Says Norwegian Firm</h2>



<p>In Norway, an electronics firm named Komplett has kick-started a marketing campaign built around rewarding budding parents with a free copy of GTA 6.</p>



<p>If you conceive<strong> around now</strong>, you’ll likely be celebrating the birth of your child around the release date of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is set (at the moment) for November 19, 2026. If your baby is born <strong>on that day</strong>, Komplett will help you usher in your bouncing bundle of joy by giving you a free copy of GTA 6, arguably the most anticipated game ever made.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1r20w92/a_norwegian_electronic_store_is_giving_away_gta_6/">‘Gaming’ subreddit</a>, one user posted an image of an advertisement spotted at a railway station in Norway. It was a shot of rose petals on a ruffled bed, with the caption:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>GTA 6 dropping in 9 months 😉</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUngTvzDXsD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Instagram post</a> surfaced from the company, bearing the caption:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>this is actually not a joke, GTA 6 will be released in 9 months (🤞) and if you have a baby on the release date, you’ll get the game for free from us</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a marketing stunt that could pay off in dividends for the firm, as every man and their dog wants to secure a copy of Grand Theft Auto 6, and what better way to do that than to get it <strong>for free</strong>? Coincidentally, GTA 6 will be released almost nine months to the day after Valentine’s Day.</p>



<p>What’s ironic is that you’ll most likely be knee-deep in diapers and formula, and will have much bigger concerns than scoping out the jiggle physics or the deepest secrets of Leonida in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>

<p>Team Vitality has stepped up ahead of the Esports World Cup and secured a crack squad in the Call of Duty: Warzone space. It’s yet another roster the organization is fielding, all with the intention of having the best chances possible of snatching the lion’s share of the Club Championship prize.</p>



<p>The trio signed by Team Vitality features Sage, blazt, and skullface, all of whom have secured accolades aplenty in the Call of Duty: Warzone space and are ready for their next challenge under the Vitality banner.</p>







<h2 id="h-vitality-picks-up-killer-warzone-team-for-ewc">Vitality Picks Up Killer Warzone Team for EWC</h2>



<p>Leading the Team Vitality squad into the fray at the Esports World Cup this summer will be Ethan ‘Ebatez’ Bates, a former 100 Thieves coach with skin in the game. The championship-grade roster should have no issues competing on the grandest stage in esports in Riyadh this summer.</p>



<p>Sage was previously signed with Virtus and finished in <strong>third place </strong>at last year’s Esports World Cup. He also had a close finish at the 2024 Global Finals of the World Series of Warzone, but <strong>won </strong>the 2023 Global Finals, alongside Shifty and Biffle.</p>



<p>Blazt, one of the most recognizable names in Call of Duty, has been around the houses over the last decade. His path has taken him under the banners of compLexity, G2 Esports, the Los Angeles Guerrillas, 100 Thieves, and now, Team Vitality. He’ll be looking to redeem a fourth-place finish at last year’s Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>Skullface is arguably entering the pack with something major to prove. It has been a while since his last big win, but he came <strong>second </strong>at the 2024 World Series of Warzone after clutching up and securing the top spot in 2022’s tournament.</p>



<p>On paper, it’s a pretty good squad, and every player there has <strong>years </strong>of Warzone experience to pull from.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s enough for Team Vitality to land a big win at the Esports World Cup this summer? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-about-gothic-1-remake">About Gothic 1 Remake</h2>



<p>In an effort to find magic ore to strengthen their defenses, the king of the Kingdom of Myrtana ordered prisoners to work in the Khorinis mines. To ensure that no one could escape, he erected a magical barrier around the mines. However, something went wrong, trapping everyone inside and turning the mines into a lawless land.</p>



<p>The Gothic 1 Remake is an open-world RPG set in a distinct colony. The developers have rebuilt the game from the ground up while maintaining the original experience’s unique sense of unrestricted exploration and rewarding progression. The remake enhances the original by introducing more detailed questlines, improved NPC routines and interactions, new traversal abilities, and a fully modernized combat system.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. The February 12, 2026, Quordle has four new words for you to find, and this guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone and region, meaning the next game will start on February 13.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kojima and Zampella Almost Created a First-Person Metal Gear Solid Game]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-person-metal-gear-solid-game-kojima-zampella/</link>
            <guid>1433359</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima recently took to the stage at DICE in Las Vegas to reveal something long-forgotten. Shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots in 2008, he ‘had many discussions’ with the late Vince Zampella about creating a first-person MGS game.</p>



<p>The title, which has understandably never seen the light of day, would have represented a major pivot for the Metal Gear franchise. While it has featured snippets of a first-person perspective in some sequences, we’ve never had a <strong>dedicated </strong>first-person title in the series.</p>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/metal-gear-solid/" id="162">Metal Gear Solid</a> 4: Guns of the Patriots launched to a positive reception way back in 2008, emerging as a core PlayStation 3 title with immense cinematic potential. It represented a penultimate point for Kojima, as the next title, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, would be his final major release in the series before leaving Konami.</p>



<p>In 2008, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/vince-zampella/" id="3380">Vince Zampella</a> was busying himself with the development of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, the sequel to 2007’s Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. This would have been when he was the CEO at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/infinity-ward/" id="1999">Infinity Ward</a>, and up to a year and a half before he was unexpectedly let go from the company.</p>



<p>In April 2010, Zampella founded <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/respawn-entertainment/" id="2483">Respawn Entertainment</a> and went to work developing Titanfall.</p>



<p>But in a new segment at DICE, Hideo Kojima spoke fondly of the late Zampella, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-head-vince-zampella-killed-in-crash/" id="167252">who died just before Christmas</a> in a car wreck in California. In a post on social media from Geoff Keighley, it was confirmed that Kojima and Zampella had ‘many discussions’ about creating a first-person Metal Gear Solid game, building on the success of MGS4.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At DICE, Hideo Kojima revealed that he had many discussions with Vince Zampella about creating a first person Metal Gear Solid game together after the release of Metal Gear Solid 4. <a href="https://t.co/hhjbCqG7T2">pic.twitter.com/hhjbCqG7T2</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2021671381382181056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Nothing more was said on the matter, but it’s safe to assume that a first-person Metal Gear Solid game would have drastically shifted the game’s perspective in more ways than one. In the comments under Keighley’s post, die-hard MGS fans stressed that the franchise ‘only works’ as a third-person shooter.</p>



<p>Kojima also confirmed that Zampella helped him to establish Kojima Productions after parting ways with Konami around 2015.</p>
