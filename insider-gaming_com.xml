<p>Hideo Kojima has revealed that if it weren’t for Super Mario Bros, he might not be in the gaming industry. </p>



<p>Hideo Kojima is one of the most prolific game directors in the industry, with popular game series like Metal Gear, Death Stranding, and more under his belt. But even he has gone through numerous traditional job interviews before reaching his current position. <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-revealed-who-inspired-him-to-start-making-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An HR director</a> sparked his entry into the games industry</span>, and now, Kojima has revealed the game that inspired him to pursue a career in game development and delve deeper into this medium.</p>







<h2 id="h-super-mario-bros-is-the-game-hideo-kojima-has-played-the-most">Super Mario Bros is the Game Hideo Kojima has Played the Most</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WIRED</a> on YouTube (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/without-super-mario-bros-hideo-kojima-probably-wouldnt-have-become-a-game-dev-when-i-saw-that-i-felt-this-medium-would-one-day-surpass-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima discussed his relationship with Super Mario Bros. and how it was instrumental in getting him interested in gaming. Kojima revealed that Super Mario Bros. is ‘definitely’ the game he has played the most. He played the game for a year while in college, and he skipped school to stay home and play it. </p>



<p>Kojima added that ‘without Super Mario,’ he probably wouldn’t be part of the gaming industry. The game director added that he wouldn’t really play the game today, noting that it is a side-scrolling action game that basically just involves jumping. But when you add the dash button, it brings subtle changes to jumping, changing its trajectory while attacking or dodging. </p>



<p>He spoke about how Super Mario Bros. has almost no story, yet it still feels like the player is on an adventure. After seeing that the game was “pixel art with no story,” Kojima felt that the gaming medium “would one day surpass movies,” and this conviction brought him to the gaming industry. </p>

<p>Helldivers 2 recently discussed their ‘plans’ to extend vehicle gameplay and bring back some vehicles from the previous game. </p>



<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has been hard at work addressing Helldivers 2’s performance woes, recently reducing the game’s PC file size <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-pc-file-size-reduced-by-85-slim-version-now-available-in-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 85%</a>. They are simultaneously working on new content as well, such as a prototype of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-are-working-on-a-rogue-lite-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rogue-lite mode</a>, along with ways to improve gameplay. The game’s design director recently spoke about vehicle gameplay. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-may-get-some-vehicles-from-the-original-game">Helldivers 2 May Get Some Vehicles from the Original Game</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-exosuit-mech-vehicle-gameplay-expansion-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, during the latest episode of ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n4kiFv_gyg&amp;t=1110s&amp;pp=0gcJCU0KAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Democratic Conversation</a>‘ on the Helldivers 2’s YouTube channel, the game’s design director, Niklas Malmborg, spoke about vehicle gameplay when asked about extending the duration of exosuit mechs. Malmborg stated, “We have plans, we are looking at extending vehicle gameplay.” </p>



<p>The design director added that players might remember that the previous Helldivers game had “loads more vehicles”, and maybe not all of them, but “it would be fun to bring back some of them”. He also spoke about looking into “how much you can do with vehicles, and all the nooks and crannies of it.” Malmborg stated, “not guaranteeing” players will be able to, as it works like a temporary buff, but it could include reloading and repairing. </p>



<p>The developer didn’t go into too much detail, but did state that “we are definitely experimenting” and that many other devs in the studio want this kind of stuff. “So if we can make good gameplay with it, we will definitely look into it,” said Malmborg. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new job listing suggests that developers could be working on a proper online multiplayer infrastructure for Hogwarts Legacy 2. </p>



<p>Details about Hogwarts Legacy’s highly anticipated sequel have been scarce, with the only thing we know is that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-in-production-at-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game is in production</a>. With the amount of success Hogwarts Legacy has witnessed, it would be foolish not to provide it with a sequel. Additionally, with a new game, developers can add features the original game didn’t have, and it seems exactly what they are doing with the online multiplayer. </p>







<h2 id="h-hogwarts-legacy-2-could-be-an-online-multiplayer-rpg">Hogwarts Legacy 2 Could be an ‘Online Multiplayer RPG’</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-competitive-online-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, the suggestion that Hogwarts Legacy 2 could feature online multiplayer comes from a new <a href="https://careers.wbd.com/global/en/job/R000101535/Senior-Software-Engineer-Backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job listing</a> for a Senior Software Engineer at Avalanche Studios. The listing states that they will be welcoming the employee to the team “behind the blockbuster open world, action RPG Hogwarts Legacy.” Additionally, the job description section states that the developer will be working on an “online multiplayer RPG.”</p>



<p>Coming to the requirements section, the listing states that the Senior Software Engineer will be responsible for “Design, implement, and maintain scalable and secure backend services, including player data persistence, matchmaking, lobbies, and server infrastructure.” </p>



<p>Some questions remain unanswered, such as whether this is indeed a listing for Hogwarts Legacy’s sequel or a different online multiplayer RPG project entirely, as Avalanche is working on other games as well. Also, if it is Hogwarts Legacy 2, will the whole game feature online multiplayer from start to finish, or only in some game modes, such as a possible Quidditch mode?</p>







<p>In other news, Hogwarts Legacy has now sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-40-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 40 million copies</a> across all platforms. Additionally, the game received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-mods-support-arrives-with-new-pc-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official mod support</a> earlier this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>KRAFTON has officially closed the first alpha test for PUBG Black Budget, the upcoming extraction shooter with some mystical, ethereal elements. It’s a perfect combination between a typical extraction title and the battle royale mechanics that the universe is so often associated with, but if you want to play it again, you’ll need to wait a while.</p>



<p>It was said in a recent blog post that the alpha test ‘saw more interest and participation than anticipated’, which is good news for KRAFTON and great news for anyone seeking a new extraction shooter in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-budget-s-alpha-was-a-success">Black Budget’s Alpha Was a Success</h2>



<p>In the post on Steam, the KRAFTON team wrote about the shutdown of the recent closed alpha:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This Closed Alpha Test saw more interest and participation than anticipated, allowing us to gather a wide range of feedback from players.</p>



<p>Through the feedback shared by those who took part, we were able to assess the potential of the game’s atmosphere, visuals, and overall system design.</p>



<p>At the same time, feedback consistently highlighted issues related to combat perception, situational clarity, and fatigue during repeated runs.</p>



<p>In addition, concerns and reports related to unauthorized programs continued to surface during the test period, leading us to progressively strengthen security measures and anti-cheat responses throughout the test.</p>



<p>Some players also experienced technical issues such as game stability problems and crashes. These factors had a noticeable impact on the overall testing experience.</p>



<p>All feedback submitted by players is currently under internal review and analysis.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In our preview piece, penned during the alpha, we predicted that ‘Black Budget will at least enjoy a solid launch, if not a lengthy lifecycle in the extraction shooter space.’</p>



<p>It’s a great extraction title, but it’s very similar to what already exists and might not innovate enough to be a real contender in the genre. That said, it played well, looked good, and presented itself as a more accessible alternative to a game like Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>At the end of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4077740/allnews?snr=1_620_4_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, the team announced a return to Coli Island and Black Budget when the game is ‘in a more refined state’.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Listen up, extraction fans. Battlestate Games has just announced the commencement of a new Escape from Tarkov Twitch Drops event, set to run from today, December 22, to January 4. The action kicks off today at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST, and it’s set to award viewers with all kinds of in-game items.</p>



<p>In a blog post, the team at Battlestate Games confirmed that in-game items and unlockable containers are <strong>guaranteed </strong>to be secured by <strong>all </strong>viewers watching <strong>any </strong>Tarkov streamer.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-the-tarkov-drops-event-end">When Does The Tarkov Drops Event End?</h2>



<p>You’ll have plenty of time over the festive window and into the new year to unlock the latest round of rewards in Escape from Tarkov. The <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">all-new blog post</a> confirmed that the event <strong>ends </strong>at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST on January 4.</p>



<p>Here’s the need-to-know:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Drops will be activated on the channels of ALL Twitch streamers without exception who will be broadcasting in the Escape from Tarkov category.</p>



<p>Drops – in-game items</p>



<p>During the campaign, at certain intervals, you will be guaranteed to receive an unlockable container, which are categorized by the rarity of the contents – Common, Rare and Epic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s more important is that this Drops event is accessible to <strong>all players</strong>, even those on the PvE platform. This has been a point of contention in recent months, with users exclusive to the PvE mode feeling ‘cheated’ by PvP players getting more bang for their buck.</p>



<p>But the developers at Battlestate Games have stressed that they’ll be ‘doing more’ for PvE players moving forward, especially as they make up a fair portion of the game’s player base.</p>



<p>Here are the rules for the Twitch Drops campaign:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Drops can be earned by users who have an active copy of the game</li>



<li>To receive or enable Drops, both the viewer and the streamer need to attach their Twitch account to their game profile on the project’s website. You can do this&nbsp;<a href="https://profile.tarkov.com/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></li>



<li>You can watch one or more broadcasts, but viewing time for rewards will only count if those broadcasts are participating in the event</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
