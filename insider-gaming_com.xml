<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has a release date for the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>On Thursday, it was announced that the latest game in the long-running Ubisoft series will come to Nintendo’s latest console on December 2. Its launch marks the first time a current Assassin’s Creed game will release on Nintendo Hardware. </p>



<p>“Experience Feudal Japan as shinobi Naoe or samurai Yasuke while enjoying cross-progression and touchscreen support on all menus,” the announcement reads.</p>



<p>The game will cost $59.99 and will come with all post-launch updates included. The recently released Claws of Awaji DLC, which adds roughly 10 hours of content for players, will come to the platform early next year. </p>

<p>Earlier rumors suggested a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-release-date-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 5 release</a> date for the game. That would’ve seen the game release on Friday of the same week as opposed to Tuesday. Turns out, however, Ubisoft wanted the game out a few days earlier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Counter-Strike 2 fans worldwide are ruing a recent change made by Valve that has drastically impacted the CS skins market. In an update to how players can obtain and trade Counter-Strike skins, Valve has made it so that players can offer up five Covert-quality skins for a <strong>guaranteed knife </strong>or <strong>pair of gloves</strong>. Before the update, these were some of the most valuable items on the market.</p>



<p>This tweak to the pre-existing trade-up system has meant that items once considered rare and expensive have crashed in value, slicing some players’ inventories a considerable amount.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-did-valve-destroy-the-skins-market">Why Did Valve Destroy The Skins Market?</h2>



<p>Valve has long had a tentative relationship with the wider skins market. The nature of the market has lent itself to some dubious practices rising in recent years, especially around the concepts of skin gambling and off-platform trading.</p>



<p>The most valuable Counter-Strike skins can run up price tags in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and private collectors have parted ways with that much without thinking about it. That might be about to change, thanks to an update made by Valve that caused the skins market value to shatter, dropping by $2 billion overnight.</p>



<p>Valve has made these changes to shift market dynamics, rebalance the economy, make high-tier items much more attainable, and potentially even <strong>democratize </strong>rare cosmetics. Covert skins will now have their prices skyrocket as knife and glove prices, some of the highest in the game, will deflate.</p>



<p>Overnight, some of the most valuable knife and glove prices in Counter-Strike 2 dropped by as much as 40%. The hit caused the overall market cap for Counter-Strike skins to collapse in on itself. Before the change, the skins market was estimated to be worth as much as <strong>$5 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>For some, it’s a critical change that has drastic financial implications, especially for those who were HODLing their skins and weathering the market. For others, it’s a healthy correction that could make the cosmetic market in Counter-Strike 2 a little more accessible.</p>



<p>From a competitive perspective, this could have a knock-on impact on sponsorships, special events, and streamers opening cases and such to keep their community engaged.</p>



<p>Do you think this change was worth the hit, or should Valve rethink this action? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
