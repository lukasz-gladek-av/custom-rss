<p>Use these Roblox Catch A Monster monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Coins, Potions, XP and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the ultra-popular Japanese anime series Pokémon? If so, you need to stop what you’re doing and check out Catch A Monster on Roblox immediately. Catch A Monster can be considered the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-crash-bots-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> version of the various Pokémon games that have been released over the years. Players have to catch a variety of creatures and train them by fighting both trainers as well as other creatures. Each player will have a limited party of monsters they can have at any time, so picking the right ones is of crucial importance.&nbsp;</p>







<p>By training these creatures, players can increase their level and make them stronger, thereby allowing them to defeat harder and more powerful enemies. Players start the game on a basic island and have to work their way up the ladder, while also hatching eggs to gain pets. Bosses spawn at predetermined locations every 15 minutes in Catch A Monster, offering guaranteed drops and rewards. With plenty of things to do and a large open world to explore, fans of the popular Japanese series will surely enjoy their time in Catch A Monster.</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Catch A Monster is a simple process that doesn’t require players to complete any steps in advance. Input any of the active codes into the correct text box after navigating through the game’s menus to claim your rewards. If you’re new to the Roblox environment, however, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide that will make redeeming codes a walk in the park:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Catch A Monster.</li>



<li>Click on the Gift icon on the right side of the screen.</li>

</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-catch-a-monster-codes">How To Get More Catch A Monster Codes</h2>



<p>Catch A Monster codes are usually released either through the game’s official channels or on the developers’ socials. Keeping track of all of these though, can be a hassle, especially because players are not notified when any of the existing codes expire. This is why we encourage all players to keep this page bookmarked, as we update it with new codes as soon as they release, while expired codes are also moved to their corresponding section.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release date for Phantom Blade Zero will be revealed during The Game Awards 2025. It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-release-date-reveal-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in August</a> that the Wuxia-inspired title will have its launch date shown before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Announced in 2023, Phantom Blade Zero follows an elite assassin finding the killer of The Order’s patriarch. With a mix of Soulslike gameplay and RPG staples, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zeros-boss-ai-uses-popular-fighting-game-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its intricate combat system</a> has been a highlight for fans. Earlier this year at the Future Games Show @ Gamescom, director Soulframe Liang stated that the game’s release date would be announced before 2025 ends. While many expected it to be at The Game Awards, it’s now been confirmed to be shown during the event.</p>







<h2 id="h-world-premiere-of-phantom-blade-zero-release-date-to-come-at-the-game-awards-2025">World Premiere of Phantom Blade Zero Release Date to Come at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1997456018897297841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> by The Game Awards, a short video reveals that Phantom Blade Zero’s release date will be unveiled at the event.  The video shows the protagonist painting a Chinese dragon, which goes berserk at the end of the clip. While no gameplay is shown in the short clip, it’s likely fans will see more at the world premiere.</p>



<p>Dated for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 11th</a>, The Game Awards are already stacked with reveals. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-look-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and Devil May Cry, there’s much to look forward to. Plus, with the mysterious statue that many are still figuring out, it’s sure to be one to watch. Now, Phantom Blade Zero joins the roster, with at least something certain being shown: the release date. 2026 is already a packed year with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and 007 First Light, but S-GAME’s action title is definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Delays Upcoming Expedition Project]]></title>

<p>Embark Studios has delayed the upcoming next part of the ARC Raiders’ Expedition Project. The Expedition, which now opens a few days later, will give you new items but practically wipe out your progress.</p>



<p>One of 2025’s hottest games has been the extraction shooter ARC Raiders. Made by Embark Studios (The Finals), the shooter has been quite popular with players and streamers. From peace pacts to all-out war, the title has already topped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-searched-game-2025-drop-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most-searched games</a> on Google and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-map-visit-25-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consistently broken player records</a> on Steam. On the roadmap, it was teased that the next expedition departure would be announced. Now, Embark Studios has revealed more info on the next Expedition, including a two-day delay.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-expedition-project-now-starts-december-17th-launching-december-22nd">ARC Raiders Expedition Project Now Starts December 17th, Launching December 22nd.</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>After a minor delay in the tunnels, the Expedition departure window will open on Dec 17; this is your Raider’s chance to roll out in the Caravan you’ve built and leave the Rust Belt behind.<br>Prepare to start a fresh new adventure with a brand new Raider, and…</p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1997350326311989689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog</a> on the ARC Raiders site, Embark Studios revealed that <strong>the next Expedition won’t start its window on December 15th</strong> as planned. Instead, <strong>the Expedition window will last from December 17th to the 22nd</strong>. Now, instead of players leaving on December 20th, the 22nd is now when those who signed up will depart The Rust Belt on their Caravan.</p>



<p>While the details of the Expedition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-have-optional-progression-wipes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are known</a>, the blog mentions some information regarding it. For one, player progress will be wiped, which includes blueprints, skill tree, level, stash, workshop, and crafting abilities. However, permanent upgrades like more inventory slots, XP boosts, and skill points will be included. It is a big choice to go on the Expedition, but seeing how ARC Raiders has shaped up to be since release, it does seem like a risk worth taking.</p>
