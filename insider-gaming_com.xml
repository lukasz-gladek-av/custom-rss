<p>Prime Video’s Tomb Raider series has finally confirmed it’s Lara Croft: Game of Thrones’ Sophie Turner. Even more so, the show now has a new co-showrunner and a shooting date of 2026.</p>



<p>The live-action adaptation of the iconic Tomb Raider series has been in the works at Prime Video since last year. Bringing on Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge as creator, writer, and executive producer, the show would continue on Fallout’s smashing success. Still, you can’t have Tomb Raider without Lara Croft and, luckily, we’ve got a good one.</p>

<p>First <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported by Variety</a>, Sophie Turner, famous for her portrayal of Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones, will spearhead Tomb Raider as protagonist Lara Croft. The 29-year-old English actress was rumored to be in the running last year, but had yet to be confirmed by Amazon MGM Studios until now. In a quote <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Variety</a>, Turner stated,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I am thrilled beyond measure, to be playing Lara Croft,” Turner said to Variety. “She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina [Jolie] and Alicia [Vikander] with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to Turner’s casting, Shogun’s Jonathan Van Tulleken, who’s also working with Prime Video on Blade Runner 2099, is set to direct and executive produce. Joining Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the writer’s room is The Darkest Minds’ Chad Hodge, who’ll showrun and executive produce. Fortunately, we won’t have to wait long for more news, as Prime Video’s Tomb Raider starts filming on January 19th, 2026. </p>



<p>Tomb Raider has had a long line of adaptations since 1997. Academy-winning Angelina Jolie took on the British adventurer in the 2000s, making her a household name. In 2016, another Academy-winning actress, Alicia Vikander, played Lara Croft in an adaptation of the 2013 reboot. While we don’t know what version Sophie Turner’s Lara Croft will be, it’s sure to be one to treasure.</p>
