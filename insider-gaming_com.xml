<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> introduces players to a brand-new 6v6 game mode known as Ransack. It’s an objective-based mode with a unique goal that sees players collecting and protecting loot, and it can be played on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every 6v6 map in the game</a>, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-maps-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new ones arriving</a> with the first season.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in the full details about Ransack in Black Ops 6, here’s how the mode works.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-ransack-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ransack work in Black Ops 6? </h2>



<p><strong>Ransack sees two teams of 6 fighting to collect gold bars from crates dotted around the map</strong>. Once players have the gold bars, they must transport them back to their team’s stash, which must be protected at all costs. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Wildcards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, the enemy team can find and raid your stash, so you’ll need to make sure it’s well-guarded. The team that reaches the score limit or has the most gold bars when the time limit has been reached will win the match.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s important to maintain a balance of attack and defense, as you don’t want to fully focus on one or the other. So, Perks and Scorestreaks that aid your speed and knowledge of the enemy team’s location will be essential, as they’ll allow you to move quickly in either attack or defense and see if the enemies are trying to raid your stash.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-ransack-in-black-ops-6">How to play Ransack in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Ransack will be <strong>available to play just like any other game mode in Black Ops 6 Multiplayer</strong>, and it’s not a limited-time mode. You will be able to select it when you filter the game modes you wish to play when finding a match. When Season 1 drops, it’s also likely that the new mode will have its own playlist too so you can easily find and play it.</p>



<p>This is a completely new game mode for Call of Duty, making its debut in Black Ops 6 Season 1. It seems like a mix between Capture the Flag and Grind, where you had to collect tags and bank them before dropping them upon death.</p>



<p>The new Ransack mode arrives alongside Prophunt and limited-time modes in Season 1. Players are also getting some new maps to sink their teeth into, as well as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge update for Warzone</a>. </p>

<p>Genshin Impact’s update version 5.2, dubbed “Tapestry of Spirit and Flame,” will be released on November 20.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact’s update 5.2 introduces two new Natlan tribes, the Flower-Feather Clan and Masters of the Night-Wind. The elite warriors of this tribe are Chasca and Ororon, and they can be transformed into Saurian companions for players to move and fight mid-air. At the same time, you get to explore the ancient, ruined city of Ochkanatlan while investigating a mysterious incident in the region as a part of the leading seasonal event of the update.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-take-to-the-skies-in-genshin-impact-update-5-2-nbsp">Take to the Skies in Genshin Impact Update 5.2&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Two new species of Saurians will arrive with this update, Qucusaurs and Iktomisaurs. The Qucusaurs are known to be the best rides in the Flower-Feather Clan. They have an accelerated guiding mode that allows you to cover a lot of distance. You can also use Phlogiston to gain altitude or perform horizontal rolls in mid-flight.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Iktomisaurs, on the other hand, are known for reaching vertical heights rather than travelling horizontally. At the same time, they have a unique ability to see, which helps them discover hidden objects. The Iktomisaurs are known as the guides of the Master of the Night Wind. They can also draw energy from Phlogiston-infused objects or craft special items from graffiti patterns.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-new-characters-in-genshin-impact-update-5-2-nbsp">New Characters in Genshin Impact Update 5.2&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Genshin Impact introduces Chasca and Ororon in update 5.2. Chasca is known as the great warrior and peacemaker in the Flower-Feather clan and is a 5-star Anemo bow wielder. The characters use a Soulsniper as their firearm and can float in the air while firing different elemental bullets at enemies. Chasca can also use homing bullets for a lethal strike and restore Phlogiston by eliminating enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ororon, on the other hand, is the four-star Electro bow wielder from Masters of the Night Wind. Brought up by Iktomisaurs, this character also can rise in the air and have a keen sense of perception. Ororon can also enter Spiritspeaker state while charging an aimed shot, which allows the character to extract power from the graffiti and runes in Natlan. Lastly, having him on your team increases your gliding speed, too.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-other-features-and-content">Other Features and Content</h2>



<p>Genshin Impact’s update 5.2 will continue the story with Archon Quest Chapter V: Interlude, “All Fires Fuel the Flame, with Captain and Kansan assisting the tribe to recover from the damage caused by the Abyss. New threats and a boss called “Tenebrous Papilla” can be found in Natlan, and this monster has been powered by absorbing memories from the corrupted Ley Lines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have added the Imaginarium Theater, Serenitea Pot, Artifacts, and other key gadgets with this update.&nbsp;Check out the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/10/20241111-genshinimpact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> for complete details.</p>

<p>FromSoftware’s parent company, Kadokawa Corporation, recently confirmed that they have 26 games actively in development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1637630.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameWatch</a> (via <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1637630.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Kadokawa Corporation confirmed these games during their latest earnings report. Out of the 26 titles, 20 are being developed for consoles, and the other six are being created for mobile. FromSoftware, Spike Chunsoft, Gotcha Gotcha Games, Acquire, VIC GAME STUDIOS, and more will develop these games. Acquire from the Tenchu series was acquired by Kadokawa in December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FromSoftware has several anticipated games on the horizon. Popular franchises like Armored Core and Dark Souls already have multiple instalments, so fans can expect new entries in these series. Additionally, FromSoftware may develop new sequels for titles like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Elden Ring. Moreover, there is a possibility of receiving remasters or remakes of some of their classic games.</p>



<p>In other news, FromSoftware recently increased their base salaries <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-increasing-salaries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 11.8% and offered more to new graduates</a>. Also, I learned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-final-boss-nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC saved the Kadokawa corporation</a> from cyberattack losses.

<p>A <a href="https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> via CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) suggests that a new Pokemon TCG Pocket Booster pack will potentially arrive on December 16, 2024.

The new expansion, A2, will be released on January 29, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the Pokemon TCG Pocket leaks also reveal new card types, event dates, and other information. A new card rarity may arrive soon; the dates haven’t yet been revealed. A Rare Picks event will also be taking place in the Wonder Pick section of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coming to Pokemon TCG Pocket leaked event dates, the first one is seemingly scheduled for November 21 and could potentially be a Black Friday event. Another event, Mass Outbreak, will run between November 21 and 28. Then, between November 28 and December 12, a Drop Event will take place. There’s also a store update scheduled for November 30.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From December 5-19, the Bulbasaur &amp; Magnemite Event Part 1 will be hosted along with Bulbasaur &amp; Magnemite in the store. The event’s second part will occur between December 12 and 19. Then, on December 16, the rumoured A1a pack will be released. Lastly, the potential A2 expansion will arrive on December 29. The <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855422922384351518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> explicitly states that these dates are subject to change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new service sent by EA suggests that the publisher is considering a monthly subscription service for Apex Legends.</p>



<p>The new survey, which was sent to several Apex Legends players and then to Insider Gaming, asks participants whether they’d be interested in a “monthly subscription” that would reward subscribers with a monthly in-game currency amount, monthly rewards, and Battle Pass tiers. The subscription service could be similar to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/fortnite-crew-subscription?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite Crew</a>, which, at £9.99 a month, gives members exclusive skins, V-bucks, and Battle Pass tiers. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, EA has yet to officially announce any form of Apex Legends monthly subscription service; however, the survey does suggest that they are at least considering it. Past surveys from EA have not so subtly revealed that the questions evolve around future content and ideas that generally are released at one point or another. </p>



<p>To some, the news that EA is exploring more monetization options for Apex Legends is probably unsurprising, as it was announced earlier this year that the company had failed to hit its monetization goals. Last month, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said during their investors call that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-season-23-reveals-return-to-original-map-with-classic-weapons-and-abilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s goal with Apex Legends</a> is to “innovate in the core experience.”</p>



<p>One such “innovation” was bringing back Apex Legends’ original map and experience from the game’s launch, relying on nostalgia to attract players.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, whether EA can maintain its player base with Apex Legends remains to be seen. For those still sticking around, the strategy could be to milk more money from them before the player numbers dwindle further.</p>



<p>What do you think of an Apex Legends subscription service? Would you buy it? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that there is rampant growth for the Indian gaming sector on the horizon. Per a recent report published by Lumikai, it was predicted that the region would see a CAGR of 20% leading to 2029, causing the market’s valuation to grow from around $3.8 billion today to $9.2 billion by 2029.</p>



<p>It was noted that gaming is India’s ‘fastest-growing new media segment’ behind video and OTT media.</p>

<p>India boasts an audience of 591 million gamers, with a split of around 44% – 66% in favour of male players. Mobile games are king in the country, and Lumikai estimated that India is the second-largest consumer of mobile games in the world. That’s why games like BGMI, Call of Duty Mobile, and Free Fire do so well in the country.</p>



<p><em>As a side note, if you’re a Free Fire fan and are looking to score some free Diamonds, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-diamonds-in-free-fire-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out our guide</a>.</em></p>



<p>In recent years, the numbers have shown that Indian gamers (particularly those in the 18 to 30-year-old age group) have boosted their average weekly gaming time by around 30%. We’re also seeing a rapid expansion of the region’s esports industry, with more competitive gamers than ever appearing across the country.</p>



<p>Lumikai, a data aggregation firm, revealed that when it started collecting data in 2020, there were just 25 notable gaming companies in India. In the most recent pass, more than 2,300 companies (‘leads’) were recorded in the country. One senior associate at Lumikai, Aditya Deshpande, suggested that the growth of gaming will <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/indias-game-market-could-grow-from-3-8b-to-9-2b-by-2029-lumikai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">surpass the value of Bollywood</a> in the coming years.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that <a href="https://www.lumikai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lumikai</a> is an Indian venture capital firm <strong>focused </strong>on the Indian market, but external firms have predicted similar growth.</p>

<p>The 2025 iteration of the Grammy Awards is fast approaching, and once again, the nominees for ‘Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media’ have been revealed. Put simply, it’s the award that crowns the best soundtrack from a video game that has emerged in recent months, but the line-up is slim and PlayStation has dominated this time around.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-games-nominated-for-a-grammy">Games Nominated for a Grammy</h2>



<p>Ubisoft and PlayStation are dominating the nominee roster this year for the ‘Best Video Game Soundtrack’ category at the Grammy Awards:</p>



<ul>
<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li>



<li>God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla</li>



<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>



<li>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</li>
</ul>



<p>Bear McCreary (God of War) is a regular nominee at this point—he’s had his name thrown into the pot during every Grammy Awards ceremony where this category has existed. The category was only opened up in 2023, and previously, it was won by Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla in 2023 and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in 2024.</p>



<p>Could Ubisoft go for the triple header and win again this time with Star Wars Outlaws or Avatar?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, fans have had issues with this category at the Grammy Awards since it debuted in 2023. Back then, the likes of <strong>Call of Duty </strong>made it into the running, which rankled with gamers worldwide. It seemed then – and it still seems now – that indie titles with better soundtracks are being snubbed for the big, mainstream names.</p>



<p>It reached a point where one of the voting board members <a href="https://x.com/masonlieberman/status/1592916480160473088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to social media</a> to explain how things work behind the scenes. He explained that low participation led to few nominations and that the vast majority of the voters on the board were film composers who rarely – if ever – interacted with the video game world.</p>



<p>This year, the only game that isn’t one of the ‘bigger hitters’ is a remake of a game that was released in 1980, which feels almost shoehorned in to hit a diversity requirement.</p>



<p>Do you want to see more diversity in this category at the Grammy Awards? Let us know in the comments.</p>
