<p>Rebel Wolves revealed Blood of Dawnwalker in January 2025, unveiling an intense vampire-themed game with dark and gritty undertones. It’s set to be an expansive open-world title that offers players the complete freedom to go where they want and kill whoever they desire.</p>



<p>The studio is being captained by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, a former director at CDPR who led the development of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. In a recent interview, Tomaszkiewicz’s brother, Mateusz, sat down to talk about the creative vision for Blood of Dawnwalker, revealing the focus on <strong>quality over quantity</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="h-our-games-are-not-as-huge">‘Our Games Are Not as Huge’</h2>



<p>Rebels Wolves’ representative, Mateusz Tomaskiewicz, explained that Blood of Dawnwalker is not a ‘huge game’ in terms of content and gameplay hours, but it is sizeable. This is Rebel Wolves’ debut project, and as such, it’s a little less ambitious than you might be expecting.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/ex-cdpr-devs-new-open-world-vampire-rpg-is-aiming-for-the-quality-level-of-the-witcher-3-but-since-its-a-smaller-studio-only-about-a-30-40-hour-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, it was revealed by Mateusz that Blood of Dawnwalker will have a story spanning around 30 – 40 hours, which is nowhere near the 100-hour average playthrough of 2015’s The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p>



<p>But that’s fine because Rebel Wolves is focused on creating something that shines rather than something that overwhelms the player with content and options:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In terms of quality, we definitely look at AAA, because this is where we are coming from, the quality level of The Witcher 3.</p>



<p>Definitely, our games are not as huge in terms of amount of content and gameplay hours – we are a smaller studio, this is our first project, so we definitely are building something smaller. But we want to build something as robust in terms of quality, maybe a bit shorter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This dark fantasy title will have players exploring a dark campaign littered with vampire interactions. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-first-trailer-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening trailer</a> released by Rebel Wolves stunned prospective players worldwide, painting the picture of a game that’s oozing with potential. It’ll hopefully be a gem of a title when it’s eventually released, we just don’t know when that will be at present.</p>
