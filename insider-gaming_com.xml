<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Season 1</a> is about to get a fresh mid-season update filled with new content. As with every major update for the free-to-play battle royale, the update will not only bring new weapons and events, but players can also expect huge buffs and nerfs to shuffle the meta.</p>



<p>The update comes during the Holiday season, so if you’re looking to dive into Warzone over the Christmas period, here’s when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1-reloaded-release-date-new-guns-codmas-event-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 Reloaded update</a> is expected to drop.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-release-date">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded release date</h2>



<p>The Warzone Season 1 Reloaded update will arrive on <strong>December 5, 2024</strong>, at around <strong>10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT</strong>.</p>



<p>Although it has not yet been confirmed, we are confident in this date as Treyarch announced that the new Zombies map for Black Ops 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts</a>, would arrive on December 5. In the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, this new map was confirmed to be released with the mid-season update, so we expect it to coincide with the official Season 1 Reloaded patch.</p>

<h2 id="h-new-weapons-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">New weapons in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</h2>



<ul>
<li>Maelstrom</li>



<li>AMR Mod 4</li>



<li>Cleaver</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-maelstorm-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maelstrom</a> is a new Shotgun arriving in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded, while the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-amr-mod-4-sniper-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMR Mod 4</a> is a semi-automatic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Rifle</a> that packs a mean punch. Players will also be able to get the Cleaver, a new Melee Weapon. </p>



<p>All three of these weapons will be available via an event, similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-power-drill-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Power Drill</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-sirin-9mm-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirin 9mm</a>. We don’t yet know what this event is, but considering the update is arriving in the Holiday season, perhaps it will be Christmas-themed. </p>



<p>We’ll have to wait and see exactly how players unlock these new weapons when the event rolls around in Season 1 Reloaded.</p>

<h2 id="h-ranked-play-arrives-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">Ranked Play arrives in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</h2>



<p>As promised by the devs, <strong>Ranked Play will return in Warzone with the Season 1 Reloaded update</strong>. It was removed after the Black Ops 6 integration in Season 1, but the devs are reintroducing it at the halfway point of the season.</p>



<p>The Ranked Play format will likely be very similar to what it was prior to the BO6 integration. Just like in multiplayer, players will earn Ranked Points by playing well and placing high. You will climb up Skill Divisions and earn exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-ranked-play-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Play rewards</a> depending on the level you reach – Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent, and Top 250.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 players have been enjoying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Play in multiplayer</a>, but it’s time for battle royale players to have their own competitive fun.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-expected-content">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded expected content</h2>



<ul>
<li>New guns</li>



<li>New events</li>



<li>Ranked Play</li>



<li>Buffs and nerfs</li>
</ul>



<p>On top of new guns, events, and Ranked Play, we also expect Warzone Season 1 Reloaded to bring some hefty buffs and nerfs for the game’s weapons and equipment. Major updates often bring meta-shifting balance changes, but we won’t receive the official patch notes detailing these tweaks until closer to the update.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 30th Anniversary celebration is continuing with a fun little feature that will certainly scratch the nostalgia itch. For a limited time, PlayStation 5 users can change various parts of the system’s startup.</p>



<p>Options include the console’s bootup options, sound effects, background colors, and general theme. There is a theme for the first four PlayStation consoles to choose from.</p>



<p>You can check out the examples below of the looks below:</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-classic-themes-for-ps5">How To Get The Classic Themes For PS5</h2>



<p>If you want to check them out for yourself, simple follow these steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Go to your PlayStation 5 Settings</li>



<li>Choose <strong>“PlayStation 30th Anniversary”</strong></li>



<li>Under <strong>“Appearance and Sound”</strong> choose which option you’d like: 30th Anniversary, PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, or PlayStation 4.</li>
</ul>



<p>And that’s it. There’s no mention of how long this feature will be available for players, so take advantage of it now if you want to enjoy some of PlayStation’s past in a different way.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that, no matter which you pick, the base bootup sequence animation will be the original PlayStation’s. You can check that out below.</p>

<p>On December 3, it’ll be 30 years since the original PlayStation first launched in Japan. A system that changed the course of the industry, PlayStation has been at the top of the console market for three decades now. To start the celebration, not only is Sony holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-sale-500-games-celebration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty massive sale</a> on the PlayStation Store, but the company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkmonzpHVRg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has released</a> a new “Thank You” video for its fans.</p>



<p>“For the past three decades, we’ve shared an incredible journey, building stories and shaping experiences together,” Sony says in the video description. “Along the way, we’ve found adventure, laughter, and lasting memories that go far beyond any one moment. We’ve forged new friendships and redefined what gaming is all about. Thank you for being part of this journey — we couldn’t have done it without you.”</p>



<p>The two-minute video shows some of the biggest franchises in the console’s history with various messages about what PlayStation “is about”. You can check it out for yourself below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="30th Anniversary | Thank You" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KkmonzpHVRg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While December 3 marks the official 30th anniversary of the PlayStation, the console didn’t release in North America and Europe until September 1995. That means there’s still another nine months of celebration to happen, and plenty of more time for PlayStation to say “Thank You”.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 is coming for the crown of ARPG king. It’s no secret the original PoE has co-op and multiplayer, so I’m here to clear up any questions and confusions relating to Path of Exile 2’s potential co-op and multiplayer—it would be nice to have someone to clear the path with.</p>



<p>Multiplayer takes many forms in 2024: Online multiplayer shooters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, couch co-op tag teams in It Takes Two, and outrageous tests of patience such as Chained Together. I personally love single-player games as much as anyone, but you can’t beat getting together for some harmonious co-op or multiplayer action.</p>



<p>The nature of Path of Exile 2 makes it perfect for either form of gameplay. 2013’s PoE incorporated co-op multiplayer into its action, but this doesn’t mean Path of Exile 2 continues on the multiplayer co-op theme. Let’s see what the developer is cooking up.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-path-of-exile-2-multiplayer-co-op">Is Path of Exile 2 Multiplayer Co-op?</h2>

<p>Good news! <strong>Path of Exile 2 features both online multiplayer and local couch co-op</strong> for you to enjoy the game with other people, either via wi-fi, or sitting next to someone.</p>



<p><strong>The confirmation comes from Grinding Gear Games itself</strong> via an official YouTube announcement trailer and the official FAQ.</p>

<p>If you consult the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Path of Exile 2 frequently asked questions post</a>, under the query asking, “Is couch co-op available in Early Access?,” the answer says, “<strong>Yes, you can play Path of Exile 2 in couch co-op mode on a single account right from the start.</strong> The second player will be able to create a character on that account.”</p>



<p>No waiting around and no kerfuffle here—it’s immediate access to local <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-path-of-exile-2-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">couch co-op</a> with a player of your choosing. Furthermore, the “Path of Exile 2 – Console Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games” trailer also confirmed couch co-op was slated for Path of Exile 2.</p>

<p>Hammering home the notion of online multiplayer and co-op for Path of Exile 2 is the announcement trailer I referenced above. The trailer says “<strong>Online multiplayer play requires PlayStation Plus membership</strong>.” It also mentions crossplay for Path of Exile 2 too—so you and your friends don’t need to play PoE 2 on the same format.</p>

<p>Tencent has acquired another new game studio, Chinese studio Kuro Games. </p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Youxi Putao</a> — then found by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-kuro-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> — , Tencent has purchased 37% of the Wuthering Waves developer’s shares. When adding it to the 24.4% it already owned, the new acquisition gives the company 51.4% of the shares, and a controlling stake in the company.</p>



<p>The purchase also makes Tencent the only external shareholder of the company.</p>



<p>According to Kuro Games’ internal memo to staff, the studio will continue to work independently. It was iterated that “operational strategy will remain unchanged”. An example used in the memo was Tencent’s ownership in Riot Games and Supercell.</p>



<p>“Based on our past collaborative experiences with Tencent, we firmly believe that this external shareholder change will provide Kuro with a more stable external environment, further benefiting our future independent operational strategies and long-term development,” the internal memo reads via machine translation.</p>



<p>“Over the past decade, our original intention of creating games has never changed, and it will remain unchanged in the next decade. We will continue to love our players, our games, and our team.”</p>



<p>Kuro Games is set to release Version 2.0 of Wuthering Waves on January 2.</p>
