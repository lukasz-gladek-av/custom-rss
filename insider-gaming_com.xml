<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been out of nearly three months, and it’s been one of the fasted-selling consoles ever since it’s June 5 release. And while Nintendo has released games for it and some third party ports are coming, there is still an issue with other developers not being able to get their games onto the new platform due to a lack of dev kits.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of Digital Foundry’s Direct Weekly show, John Linneman&nbsp;and Oliver Mackenzie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=504s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke about what talks were like</a> at Gamescom in Cologne. Part of those talks were about Nintendo not sending Switch 2 dev kits to a number of developers, including some AAA studios.</p>



<p><strong>“Nintendo seems to be almost discouraging Switch 2 development to some degree, where I’ve spoken with plenty of developers where they were either told that their game, they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility,” </strong>Linneman said. <strong>“There’s a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits. We talked to&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of devs at Gamescom this year and so many of them said the same things. They want to ship on Switch 2. They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware. It’s really difficult right now.”</strong></p>



<p>From there, Mackenzie added that he had heard “through the grapevine” and from talking to others that there were “some weird exclusions with some big developers struggling to get kits for games.”</p>



<p><strong>“And there were some weird inclusions as well, like some indies were included which is nice to see,”</strong> Mackenzie said. <strong>“But like there’s that campfire game you know the kind of camera campfire game and they’re getting kits and some big developers on the other hand who developed like AAA stuff aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits.”</strong></p>



<p>None of the studios who haven’t been able to get Switch 2 dev kits were mentioned, but they might be able to be guessed, especially if you want to dig into some larger studios without newer games announced for the platform. That said, fans will have to wait and see how third-party support grows on the console in the coming months and years.</p>



<p>What do you think of studios not being able to get Nintendo Switch 2 dev kits? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite Festival has revealed the featured artist for Season 10: Gorillaz. The rhythmic game mode, part of Fortnite’s game launcher, has been going strong since December 2023. Every season brings a new artist, like Billie Eilish, Sabrina Carpenter, and last season’s Bruno Mars. Now, we have confirmation on who is headlining it next with Gorillaz.</p>



<p>The London-based pop band has been going strong since 1998. With 12 Grammy nominations, including one win for Best Pop Collaboration, Gorillaz is no stranger to the limelight. It also helps that the band is fictional, having fake animated bandmates, adding notoriety to their name. They are a natural fit for Fortnite, but that’s not all that’s being added, come it’s rather soon release.</p>



<h2 id="h-gorillaz-headlines-season-10-of-fortnite-festival-starting-august-26th">Gorillaz Headlines Season 10 of Fortnite Festival Starting August 26th</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/gorillaz-enter-a-new-universe-as-fortnite-festival-season-10-icons?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> from Fortnite/Epic Games, Season 10 of Fortnite Festival will launch tomorrow, August 26th. All four band members, Noodle, 2D, Russell, and Murdoc, will be available as Outfits. Noodle and 2D both come with their own Back Blings and weapons and are available until the end of Season 10. In addition, the iconic track “Clint Eastwood” will release onto the shop as a Jam Track. Of course, a new Main Stage has been added, now made to look straight out of a Gorillaz music video.</p>



<p>Patch notes for Fortnite Festival were also revealed in the post. The updates fix some UI issues, as well as sorting in the Main Stage Music Library. The full patch notes can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adding “Good” notes so that it’s clearer in the UI when you’re just short of “Perfect.” (Hitting a note slightly too early or slightly too late.)
<ul>
<li>You’ll have the option to disable the “Good” visual feedback in the settings.&nbsp;<strong>(Settings &gt; Game &gt; Festival)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Adjusting the design of lift notes so that it’s easier to tell when to press and when to let go.
<ul>
<li>You’ll have the option to disable this new design (“Lift Notes Connectors”) in the settings.&nbsp;<strong>(Settings &gt; Game &gt; Festival)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>In the Main Stage Music Library, you’ll be able to sort by&nbsp;<strong>Song Duration</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Song Intensity</strong>.</li>



<li>You’ll be able to&nbsp;<strong>strum</strong>&nbsp;during the tune-up process, making it easier to test and calibrate your guitar controller.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-resurgence-black-ops-7-launch-rumor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warzone-getting-new-resurgence-map-following-black-ops-7-launch-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1279968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resurgence may be getting a new map after Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s release, one rumor claims. The eagerly anticipated next entry in the Call of Duty franchise has many excited, both for the campaign and multiplayer. However, it looks like Warzone fans may have something to look forward to come its November 14th, 2025 launch. </p>



<p>The Resurgence mode in Warzone has been around since Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War back in 2020. It’s been present in both Warzone 1.0 and Warzone 2.0, as well as at launch for Warzone Mobile. The mode is a different take on the typical Battle Royale mode, with more players and heightened intensity plays. So, the rumored new map is sure to get some back into the Resurgence game.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-to-add-extended-liberty-falls-map-during-season-1-of-black-ops-7-says-credible-leaker">Warzone To Add Extended Liberty Falls Map During Season 1 of Black Ops 7, Says Credible Leaker</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from credible Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1960001313422659979">TheGhostofHope</a>, they state that they have learned a new Resurgence map is in the works. Furthermore, it appears to be an extended version of Liberty Falls. The map, which debuted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 as a Zombies level, is a rather interesting choice. Still, given TheGhostofHope’s track record, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/">Black Ops 7’s release date</a>, there’s a strong chance we may hear about it soon. </p>



<p>Currently, the Multiplayer reveal for Black Ops 7 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/">slated to happen</a> on September 30th, 2025. As the rumor ties to Season 1 of the upcoming shooter, it’s more than likely we’ll get confirmation there. Until then, fans can get into Resurgence in Warzone and practice before the new map comes along.</p>



<p>What do you think about Liberty Falls being the next Resurgence map in Warzone? Was there one you think deserved it more? Let us know in the comments and on the forums. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Toxic Commando HANDS-ON PREVIEW – The Co-Op Shooter That I Wanted]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/toxic-commando-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toxic-commando-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-the-co-op-shooter-that-i-wanted.1279905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At Gamescom 2025, we were invited by Focus Entertainment to try out John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando, a cooperative shooter developed by Saber Interactive.</p>



<p>And if you’ve somehow never heard of John Carpenter—maybe you’ve been living under a rock—he’s one of the most legendary names in horror cinema, responsible for classics like Halloween, The Fog, and The Thing. His influence is all over Toxic Commando, especially in the group banter and cinematic cutscenes throughout the missions.</p>



<p>The story pays homage to 1980s horror films, which should resonate strongly with fans of titles like Left 4 Dead and Killing Floor. In the game, a scientific experiment goes horribly wrong, unleashing the Sludge God upon Earth. This monstrous entity begins a process of terraforming, threatening all life on the planet.</p>



<p>To clean up the mess, the scientist enlists the help of the Toxic Commandos—battle-hardened mercenaries tasked with stopping the apocalypse.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="John Carpenter's Toxic Commando - Official Gameplay Trailer | gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eknbu0SKGzI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-toxic-commando-is-surprisingly-satisfying">Toxic Commando Is Surprisingly Satisfying</h2>



<p>During my play session, I teamed up with three other members of the press, and we communicated entirely through the in-game voice chat. To my surprise, the chat worked flawlessly—clear audio, no dropouts, and smooth coordination.</p>



<p>In games like this, communication is everything, and having a reliable voice system is a huge win. Our mission dropped us into an open map with the objective of clearing out specific zones. Each Commando has a unique class, and while we couldn’t choose our roles during the demo, one teammate deployed a protective dome, while my character generated a healing aura—each ability felt distinct and useful.</p>



<p>Saber Interactive’s experience with Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is immediately noticeable. At several points, we were swarmed by massive waves of zombies, all powered by Saber’s impressive Swarm Engine. In Toxic Commando, you’ll even be able to use vehicles for traversal and crowd control, adding a layer of mobility and chaos to the action.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gunplay is another highlight. Weapons feel punchy and responsive, and enemies aren’t bullet sponges—a common pitfall in co-op shooters. The open map design also encourages optional exploration, which becomes essential for survival. With ammo running low and hordes closing in, scavenging becomes a strategic necessity.</p>



<p>Speaking of hordes, enemy variety is solid, mixing standard grunts with elite threats that require more coordination to take down.</p>



<p>The climax of our mission involved defending a structure from three massive waves of zombies. With over 200 enemies on screen and multiple points under attack, tension ran high. Thankfully, we managed to coordinate our class abilities and pull through.</p>



<h2 id="h-progression-amp-monetization">Progression &amp; Monetization</h2>



<p>Since the demo focused solely on gameplay, I didn’t get to explore the progression systems. However, a Focus Entertainment representative told me that players will be able to upgrade both their classes and weapons. More details on that will be revealed later.</p>



<p>As for monetization, information was limited. The current plan isn’t to push players into spending real money on cosmetics or similar items. It’s likely Saber Interactive will follow a model similar to Space Marine 2, with a battle pass offering cosmetic rewards.</p>



<p>John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando is set to launch in early 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series, with full crossplay support across all platforms. Based on my experience, it checks all the boxes I look for in a co-op shooter—and I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on it.</p>



<p>If you’ve been missing the chaotic fun of <em>Left 4 Dead</em> or <em>Killing Floor 2</em>, this one should be on your radar too.</p>
