<p>Rocksteady is officially ending support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. In a post on the <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s official website</a>, it was announced that Season 4 will see the final updates for Suicide Squad moving forward. </p>



<p>Those updates include the addition of Deathstroke along with a new medieval-themed Elseworld, new gear, and an offline mode. The offline mode will be available on December 10 alongside the rest of Season 4 episode 7.</p>



<p>“Offline mode will allow you to experience content released for the game, including the main story campaign and all seasonal story mission content, without an internet connection,” Rocksteady said. “To access Offline mode, you can either create a new profile by starting from the beginning of the game or create a copy of your existing Online profile, allowing you to jump in with all of your progress.”</p>



<p>The final Suicide Squad update will come with Episode 8 in January 2025. That wraps up the promised full year of updates for the game from Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Games.</p>



<p>Despite the updates ending, Rocksteady says that all online features will remain available, including online co-op and all previous seasonal/episodic content. It’s unclear if critical support updates will still come after regular updates are over.</p>



<p>The ending of updates for Suicide Squad brings to a close a controversial era for Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Games. After being delayed into 2024, the game launched with issues that causes it to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-pulls-suicide-squad-just-one-hour-into-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily pulled in early access</a>. From there, Warner Bros. Games revealed that not only did the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-reportedly-says-suicide-squad-fell-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perform below expectations</a>, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost them $200 million</a> in revenue.</p>



<p>Rocksteady even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a round of layoffs</a> after the launch of the game.</p>

<p>It could be a matter of days until we’re treated to the second Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer from Rockstar Games, and the community is<strong> </strong>writhing in anticipation. We’ve heard nothing for more than a year, since the launch of the game’s initial trailer, and fans are <strong>starving </strong>for more GTA 6 content from the famed developer.</p>



<p>Recently, ‘GTA VI’ was spotted on the PlayStation store available to add to wishlists, but it’s not the game you’re hoping for.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-art-of-creative-excuses">‘The Art of Creative Excuses’</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grand Taking Ages VI</a> is a satirical title from Violarte that’s set to launch in May 2025, per a listing on the PlayStation store. The game’s presence was spotted recently by eagle-eyed users, and while it seems unlikely it’s <strong>real</strong>, it’s accompanied by a product description that’s worth a read.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The most anticipated game about making the most anticipated game!</p>



<div><p>You’re now in charge of the biggest gaming disaster… Or masterpiece?</p><p>Run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>At first blush, Grand Taking Ages VI (GTA VI) reads like a game dev simulator – which already exists in a few forms. The bio stresses that Grand Taking Ages VI is inspired ‘by real gaming industry events’.</p>



<p>It’ll feature a rags-to-riches story that sees players start in a ‘tiny apartment’ before expanding and growing as their creations succeed on the open market. </p>



<p>It’s impossible to tell if the game is real to any extent – and it probably isn’t – but it’s a funny jab at the wait we’re all struggling with where GTA 6 is concerned.</p>



<p>It’s also far from being the first copycat or parody game to surface on the PlayStation Store. Most recently, a rip-off title mimicking Gray Zone Warfare appeared on the PS Store.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to go up against Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>The upcoming open-world epic from Rockstar Games is poised to be the biggest single-title launch of all time, and that’s enough to strike fear into the hearts of competing publishers, per a recent report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier. It was claimed by Schreier that some competing publishers are preparing to set their own launch dates based on GTA 6’s ultimate release window.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-t-compete">Can’t Compete</h2>



<p>Presently, Grand Theft Auto 6 is set to be released in the fall of 2025, which gives it around a three-month window in which it can drop. Typically, GTA games are released in or around October, so it’s a safe bet that GTA 6<strong>, if the schedule is adhered to, </strong>will be released globally in October 2025.</p>



<p>However, some folks in the industry are anticipating a delay.</p>



<p>In a report published in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar?embedded-checkout=true&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Jason Schreier explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Anticipation is so high that some competing game publishers are waiting as long as possible to commit to their release dates for the fall, according to people familiar with their deliberations who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.</p>



<p>The publishers want to see whether&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>&nbsp;will make its deadline or slip into 2026, these people say, and they’re determined to <strong>keep their own games far, far away.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nobody wants to set a release date for that three-month window between September and November because there’s the chance it could clash with GTA 6. It’ll take a monumental powerhouse of a game to compete with Rockstar Games’ newest iteration in the legendary franchise, and most publishers likely think it’s not worth attempting.</p>



<p>If Rockstar Games or Take-Two were to reveal a delay for GTA 6 tomorrow, then it’s fair game for these publishers to announce their games for fall 2025 – happy days.</p>

<p>New leaks suggest that Epic Games and Fortnite are working on a new extraction shooter gamemode.</p>



<p><span>The news comes from Fortnite leaker and data miner&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loolo_WRLD</a>&nbsp;on X (formerly Twitter), who revealed that despite some rumors suggesting that the gam</span>e mode is canceled, it is, in fact, still in development.</p>



<p>While it’s unclear what the game would entail in the Fortnite universe, it will likely follow almost every other extraction shooter in the market with its game loop. Drop into a map, gather resources, extract, and repeat.<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD"></a></p>



<p>Loolo_WRLD was careful to point out that “things might change,” as is the case with all leaks, so we’ll have to wait and see if the gamemode comes to fruition.</p>



<p>According to leakers, the game mode is currently under development under the codename “Arnold.” </p>



<p>Last week, new rumors surfaced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-has-up-to-90-bots-per-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite OG Has Up to 90% Bots Per Game</a> for lower-skilled players. Epic Games has yet to comment officially on the addition of bots and skill-based matchmaking in Fortnite, but if there is an official announcement, we’ll be sure to update this article.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike is one of the most iconic PC titles in the history of gaming. The definitive first-person tactical shooter is synonymous with PC gaming, and has been since the first game released in 2000. Even now, following the release of Counter-Strike 2 in 2023, the series is still a dominant force on computers.</p>



<p>Many multiplayer shooters find success appealing to player bases outside of PC though. Has Counter-Strike finally done the same?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-only-on-pc">Is Counter-Strike Only on PC?</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 has only been officially released on PC. The lack of an official version for players on Mac is surprising, given that the game’s predecessor Counter-Strike: Global Offensive did in fact have official Mac support. CS2 is “playable” on Mac, but not in an official capacity.</p>



<p>CS2 is not available on any console either, though CS:GO still appears to be playable on the older generation. CS:GO released for Xbox 360 and PS3 when it came out in 2013. CS:GO was replaced by CS2 on PC when the current game launched last year, but the Xbox 360 version <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/csgo-xbox-360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains online</a>, at least as recently as September 2023.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game is also playable on Steam Deck, but it is not optimized for Valve’s handheld device. The CS2 Steam Deck compatibility rating states that it shows mouse and keyboard icons, as well as small in-game text that may be difficult to read on a smaller screen.</p>



<p>CS2’s launch without a console version indicates that it is probably not a huge priority for Valve at this time. However, Valve’s competitor Riot eventually <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-consoles-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a console version of VALORANT</a> years after its launch, so it wouldn’t be unheard of if Valve did the same.</p>



<p>Do you wish CS2 would come out on something else than PC? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2, Grinding Games’ latest action RPG, was going to be a free-to-play title. However, you need to pay $30 to play the game in early access right now. So when does Path of Exile 2 actually become free-to-play? The short answer is when the developers decide to remove it from early access.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-end-nbsp">When Does Path of Exile 2 Early Access End?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Currently, there is no concrete end date for Path of Exile 2’s early access. However, the developers have provided an estimated period in the game’s <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ section</a>. The answer to how long the early access will run is “As long as needed, we expect at least 6 months.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the developers’ estimated window, Path of Exile 2 will seemingly become free to play by June 2025. However, this is not a confirmed window, and as the developers have stated, “as long as needed,” they could take longer or even finish earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the moment, you must pay a minimum of $30 to play Path of Exile 2’s early access on Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where to play the game in early access</a> here.&nbsp;</p>
