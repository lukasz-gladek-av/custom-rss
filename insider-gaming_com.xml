<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 goes live on Tuesday, meaning that there’s a large update for all players to download in order to get back in the game.</p>



<p>While many have been able to download the large update with no issue, there have been many others reporting issues with getting the latest content.</p>



<p>First mentioned by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1996629708621148440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, users are reporting that they are stuck in an “update available” loop. It’s not all platforms, but one that’s known to have an issue is Battle.net</p>



<p><strong>“The game is updated, but I can’t get in [because] this is the [message] I keep getting, Battlenet,”</strong> one user <a href="https://x.com/NightwolfLotus/status/1996629997608665298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/BzrKIzumi/status/1996629331385422272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Said another</a>, “<strong>Already downloaded the update yet I cannot get passed this [Black Ops 7 start screen. I’ve restarted [Battle.net] and nothing.”</strong><a href="https://x.com/BzrKIzumi/status/1996629331385422272"></a></p>



<p>As of writing, Activision nor developers Treyarch and Raven Software have made any sort of public comment on the issue. Should one come, it will be added to this story. </p>

<p>Total War: Medieval 3 has been confirmed by the developers through a new announcement; the title is currently in its early pre-production stage. </p>



<p>The last instalment of Total War: Medieval was launched back in 2006, and the players have been aching for a new iteration of the series. Fortunately for them, Medieval 3 has been announced, and the developers have shared a wealth of details about the project through a new blog post and trailer. </p>







<h2 id="h-total-war-medieval-3-will-be-the-ultimate-what-if-game">Total War: Medieval 3 Will Be the Ultimate “What If” Game</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> featured Total War: Medieval 3’s game director, Pawel Wojs, providing players with all the details about the upcoming title. Wojs has worked on the previous instalment for almost 20 years and is now going to lead the latest project. The developer’s vision is to make Medieval 3 “the Total War sandbox set within the Medieval world and to be the ultimate “What if?” game where you can alter the course of history.” Interested readers can learn more about their <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vision</a> here.</p>

<p>The developers plan to achieve this by immersing players in historical accuracy and having the world respond “in ways that feel genuinely plausible.” The game is currently in early pre-production, with release years away, and they are just past the opening stages. The developers also have Warxore now, which is the next evolution of their game engine, which provides them “a bespoke set of new and improved tools across our animation system, to the renderer and campaign building blocks – all designed to bring the medieval era to life in ways we’ve previously never been able to achieve.”</p>
