<p>Marvel Rivals Season 2: Hellfire Gala has been revealed, confirming the arrival of two new characters, Emma Frost and Ultron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rival Season 2: Hellfire Gala begins on April 11, 2025, and the new trailer provides players with details on what to expect. Emma Frost has invited all Marvel Rivals characters to the island of Krakoa, so mutant rivals and friends can work together to share a better future. However, Ultron has different plans and invades the peaceful time Marvel Rivals characters are having during Emma Frostâ€™s party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Marvel Rival Season 2: Hellfire Gala <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thyG51IdChc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> begins with characters like Magneto, Wolverine, Star Lord, Black Panther and more pulling up on a red carpet with their flashiest outfits (some new skin teases), clicking pictures, interacting with each other and having a great time. However, as soon as Emma Frost starts delivering a toast, she is interrupted by an invasion from Ultronâ€™s army, and the Marvel Rivals roster has to join hands to take down a common enemy.&nbsp;More details about the upcoming season should be revealed closer to release, including new characters, maps, cosmetics and more.</p>



<p>Emma Frost and Ultron were leaked for Marvel Rivals a few months ago. Emma Frost was expected to arrive with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole set of X-Men characters</a>, including Professor X, Gambit, Nightcrawler, and more. Ultron, on the other hand, was leaked along with the Thing. He is expected to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a support character</a> with different healing abilities for the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Call of Duty League, rostermania has been kicked into final gear in the <strong>day before </strong>the Major III qualifying stage. Moments ago, Vegas Falcons revealed that Arcitys and Priestahh will join Pred and Exnid to complete the four-man roster. </p>



<p>Weâ€™ll likely never know the size of the bag these players have been offered to represent the Vegas Falcons. Presently, the team has the worst record in COD esports history, having failed to win a single series since the season kicked off in December 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-it-enough">Is It Enough?</h2>



<p>The Vegas Falcons have had a woeful run, failing to win a single match since entering the Call of Duty League last year. Theyâ€™re flat bottom in the standings, and unless something remarkable happens, the team is already out of this yearâ€™s Call of Duty League Championship, which is taking place in Canada in June.</p>



<p>On social media, the Falcons team revealed the recent signing of Arcitys and Priestahh. The latter was recently dropped from LAG M8, which has also been on a monumentally miserable run of late, while the former comes up from a solid run in Challengers.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Two more World Champions have arrived to complete our roster. Weâ€™re ready to make some noise as we head into Major III Qualifiers.

Welcome, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Arcitys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Arcitys</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Priestahh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Priestahh</a><span> ðŸ¦…ðŸ’š </span></p></article></div>







<p>Both of these players are former world champions, Priestahh much more recently than Arcitys. He was a part of the incredible New York Subliners roster that went on a dramatic run through the CDL 2023 season, winning Champs in record time with a 5-0 scoreline.</p>



<p>Arctiys has been out of the League since being dropped by Surge just over a year ago, but he has been in phenomenal shape in the Challengers circuit. Just days ago, he won the Dallas Open while flying the OMiT flag, and in July last year, he won the COD Challengers Final with Lore.</p>



<p>Do you think the Vegas Falcons can finally win a series? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.</p>
