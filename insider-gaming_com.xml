<p>Counter-Strike 2 reached its highest ever concurrent player peak this past Sunday, confirming to all that the iconic first-person shooter from Valve is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very much not dead</a>. This peak came less than 24 hours after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the trophy was lifted at the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a>.</p>



<p>While this latest peak isn’t the highest in the history of Counter-Strike itself, it’s an incredible accomplishment for CS2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-upward-trajectory">Upward trajectory</h2>



<p>The Counter-Strike 2 player peak reached 1,740,261 concurrent players this past Sunday, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/#48h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>. This is the highest number of concurrent players on CS2 ever, roughly 180,000 more than the peak that was set when the sequel officially launched in September 2023. With the exception of June and July, the concurrent player peak has gone up every single month of 2024. Both monthly concurrent player peaks and player averages are up now compared to where they were when the year began.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new CS2 player peak did fall a few hundred thousand players short of the all-time peak set in May 2023. The all-time CS2 player peak of 1,818,773 concurrent players was brought on by both the release of the BLAST Paris Major viewer pass and the ongoing CS2 limited test. CS:GO player numbers jumped following the CS2 limited test announcement as players tried to increase their hours in hopes of getting access.</p>



<p>The Major typically brings in more players throughout its duration, as players make Pick ‘Ems selections, redeem souvenir packages, and open sticker capsules. Following Team Spirit’s victory, the players’ championship autographs will become available for purchase soon.</p>



<p>Despite widespread player concerns about the amount of content and the state of anti-cheat, among other issues, CS2 is showing no signs of slowing down or a diminished player count. It still remains the most actively played game on all of Valve by a considerable margin, and that likely isn’t changing anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Ubisoft Wants to Change the ‘Far Cry Formula’ with Far Cry 7 and Maverick]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft-wants-to-change-the-%E2%80%98far-cry-formula%E2%80%99-with-far-cry-7-and-maverick.1062879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2023, Insider Gaming had several reports on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry series throughout the year.</a> Notably, the Far Cry series currently has two games in development, which were both originally under the same game and codenamed Talisker. Its next mainline title is now under the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">codename Blackbird</a>, and an extraction-based shooter is under the codename Maverick. Both games are still in development at the time of writing, but their release dates have been pushed back internally from 2025 to 2026 due to complexities in development.</p>



<p>Moving from Dunia to Snowdrop and under development at Ubisoft Montreal, both games are set to move away from the ‘Far Cry formula’. Maverick, which takes place in the Alaskan wilderness, will see players fight one another, animals, and the harsh weather to survive. On the flip side, Blackbird will now see the player have to rescue his family (NOT played by Cillian Murphy), who have been kidnapped by a conspiracy cult who have been performing hallucinogenic experiments on animals and children. It’s said that the player has 24 real-life hours (72 hours in-game) to rescue their family, and the timer is reflected in-game by the player wearing a watch on his wrist.</p>



<p>But it isn’t just the gameplay loop of both games changing. It’s understood that both games have had a significant overhaul to their movement systems, too, including the addition of tactical spriting, sliding, vaulting, and more. Seemingly, this is due to both projects originating from the same game and sharing similar movement mechanics, with the similarities of both games bleeding into one another. Other aspects, including the inventory system and looting, also appear to bleed from the extraction-based shooter into Blackbird, too, with sources outlining that it doesn’t affect the mainline entry. “I’d argue it makes a lot of sense given your desperation to rescue your family,” said one source when asked.</p>



<p>Internally, Ubisoft Montreal and its supporting studios on Blackbird are optimistic, but some concerns over Maverick and its future loom given recent events at the publisher. Ubisoft has been attempting to do a Far Cry multiplayer for the best part of a decade, and while an extraction shooter could make a lot of sense for the Far Cry universe, it was ultimately greenlit to chase trends, and the genre doesn’t seem to have attracted the player’s numbers that the industry thought it would. </p>



<p>Defiant’s recent cancellation and subsequent layoffs felt like the beginning of a downward spiral, said some staff, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=yves" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yves’ internal memo</a> following the announcement of its cancellation not inspiring much confidence in those already unsure about their project’s future.</p>



<p>For now, though, Ubisoft is seemingly trying to break its own trend of chasing trends, and Far Cry 7 (or whatever it’s called) and Maverick seems to be a step in the right direction, albeit a considerable risk. </p>

<p>Throughout the entirety of 2024, it was a three-horse race to see who would be the best of the best Counter-Strike 2 players in the world. Three superstars, two of which are still in their teens, put up dominant performances during the most prestigious CS2 events all year.</p>



<p>By the end of the Perfect World Shanghai Major, and thus the 2024 CS2 calendar, one name stood the tallest amongst the best CS2 players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-of-2024">Best CS2 Players of 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-danil-donk-kryshkovets">Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</h3>



<p>Thanks to a historic performance at the Shanghai Major <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/">culminating in his first Major trophy</a>, Team Spirit’s 17-year-old donk is the unquestionable best CS2 player of 2024. In Shanghai, donk <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/">posted the highest ever player rating at a Major ever</a> while becoming the youngest MVP ever. Donk’s mastery of crosshair placement, crouching, and the “donk slide” combined with his utmost confidence has been nearly unbeatable all year. And he’s just getting started.</p>



<h3 id="h-ilya-m0nesy-osipov">Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another special young talent that dominated 2024 is G2’s star AWPer Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov. After a breakout 2023, m0NESY showed no signs of slowing down, and is still the most lethal player in the world with the AWP in his hands. He has amazing aim and reaction speeds, but also the game sense of a veteran. Even though the AWP is the most dangerous tool in his arsenal, he can also produce highlights or clutches with a rifle if pressed to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-mathieu-zywoo-herbaut">Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>ZywOo feels like the elder statesman when comparing him to actual teenagers like donk and m0NESY. But the prodigy and multi-time HLTV Player of the Year winner is still one of the best Counter-Strike players of the year. He put up nearly identical numbers as his younger adversaries <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/players?startDate=2024-01-01&amp;endDate=2024-12-31&amp;matchType=BigEvents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at big events</a> all year, and has grown more dangerous with the rifles after dominating with the AWP earlier in his career. He always delivers in big moments for Team Vitality, and the guy who’s been dominating Counter-Strike for half a decade is still only 24 years old.</p>



<p>Which of these three deserves to be called the very best CS2 player of 2024? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>I grew up playing Ghost Recon alongside one of my older brothers, and it was my go-to tactical shooter for the longest time. As such, when the franchise began to modernize, I certainly couldn’t stay away. After all, realistic tactics, weapon customization, and full co-op were too good to pass up. But something was missing from the Steam release. It’s no longer a problem, as you can now unlock all of the Steam Achievements in Ghost Recon Breakpoint as of December 16!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-steam-achievements-in-ghost-recon-breakpoint">All Steam Achievements in Ghost Recon Breakpoint</h2>



<p>Don’t expect too many for the third-person tactical shooter from Ubisoft. Ghost Recon Breakpoint features 50 Steam Achievements, the majority of which stem from single-player objectives and story beats, such as completing specific acts or tackling unique challenges, such as slaying a particular number of Wolves.</p>
