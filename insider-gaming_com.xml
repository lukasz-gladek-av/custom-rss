<p>Marvel Rivals has announced a new, limited-time game mode, Clone Rumble, which will launch on March 7, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble is a new game mode where players must rely on strategy, teamwork and ‘controlled chaos’. Each team will be allowed to select one Hero, and the remaining players must choose between these two. The battlefield will become an “ultimate mirror showdown”, where players will find clones of the same Hero battling each other across the map.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble, players will have to adapt to survive. They need to coordinate with team members using the same Hero to bolster their strength and figure out how to exploit the weaknesses of the opposing Hero. Everyone on the map will use the same Hero and abilities, so efficiency and tactical movements will be key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1896953790915391788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> for Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble provides us with a glimpse of all the chaos that awaits us on March 7. The video starts with a row of 6 Mr. Fantastics marching around the map before they clash with a group of another 6 Reed Richards. We also see a swarm of Punishers wreaking absolute destruction across the map, with turrets popping up in every nook and corner.&nbsp;A new Black Widow skin will also be introduced, called Widow of Timely. It can be claimed through Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure. </p>
