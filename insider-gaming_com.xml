<p>Sledgehammer Games once had plans to have a massive Halo collaboration in Modern Warfare 3, where some Halo maps would come to Call of Duty.</p>



<p>That’s according to leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1884053078682566742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@TheGhostOfHope</a> on X (formerly Twitter), who has seemingly returned back to form and started to leak details in regards to Call of Duty again after taking a break.</p>



<p>In a new post, Hope revealed that “Sledgehammer Games had plans to do a huge collaboration with Halo with Modern Warfare III which would have added various maps from the Halo franchise.”</p>



<p>Another leaker and dataminer by the name of Alaix seemingly confirmed the details by saying, “maybe one day i’ll feel generous enough to share some of the screenshots I have from this collab.”</p>



<p>While it’s currently not known on what maps, weapons, or outfits would have made it into Modern Warfare 3, it’s intriguing to know that there where at least plans at one stage, with Alaix’s comments implying that there was even assets made.</p>



<p>It means that Microsoft could visit such collaborations again in the future, depending on how the Call of Duty franchise performs and how much interest such collaborations would bring in.</p>



<p>But this isn’t the first time we’ve heard that Microsoft have been considered Call of Duty and other Microsoft IP crossovers. In November 2024, it was claimed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-doom-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soon feature collaborations between Halo, DOOM, and Gears of War</a>. While those leaks are yet to come to fruition, where there’s some, there’s fire.</p>



<p>Would you like to see a massive Halo x Call of Duty crossover in a future CoD title? What do you think of Halo once being planned to be in Modern Warfare 3? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Dead Drop’s Workbenches in Sniper Elite Resistance Mission 2 represents a big step up. The hand-holding is gone, and you need to go on a serious expedition to find all the Collectibles if you don’t know where to look.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-workbenches-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-1-behind-enemy-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mission 1’s Workbench Collectible</a> is child’s play compared to the rest of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>. Dead Drop is the first big, open map to explore. It has 19 Collectibles to find—including three Workbenches. Finding these is imperative to give Harry the best chance of surviving the never-ending onslaught of German troops.</p>



<p>I’ve provided a simple and easy-to-use map showing you the locations of every Workbench, but if you need a few extra details with more specifics, we have that too.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-workbench-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-2-dead-drop">Every Workbench Location in Sniper Elite Resistance Mission 2 Dead Drop</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Force your path. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The little Cog symbol represents a Workbench</strong>—and I’ve circled them for you anyway. Each one is equidistant from the other and they’re spread fairly well around the map. There’s no necessary route to take to find all of <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a> Resistance’s Mission 2 Workbench locations, but I’ll provide my experience and how I found them.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-1-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 1 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s just behind this door. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Start Dead Drop and head to the broken stone bridge. Go left, and climb up the vines to get into a broken tower. Climb the tower, kill the guard, and head through the castle doorway. Pick up the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-propaganda-posters-locations-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Propaganda Poster</a> on the stairs to your left if you haven’t already, carry on up, and go into the house. </p>



<p>Charge down both sets of stairs and exit the house left. Head West through the streets—doing your best to avoid becoming a human bullet sponge. <strong>Using the screenshot “Every Workbench Location” screenshot earlier</strong>, you can see the Workbench is found in a big building in the very Southwest quadrant of the level. Reach the building, and the Workbench is up the stairs and behind a locked door—after you pass through a mini-courtyard area.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-2-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 2 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Go up to the courtyard and look left. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s time to head North from this building. Head left past the “<strong>Find Vertigo’s Dead Drop at the Balisca” Main Objective</strong> building. Pass through the gardens and keep running in a straight line—<strong>watch out for the Sniper ahead up high</strong> who can easily spot you. You should eventually reach a small flight of stairs to go down, situated next to a barbed-wire fence and locked door. </p>



<p>Go between the houses and run around to the entrance of <strong>the “Locate Vertigo’s Office” building</strong>. Head up to the main gate and into the courtyard. Immediately on your left is a locked door. Either open it manually or use Bolt Cutters. Inside is the second Workbench.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-3-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 3 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Go through to the other side, and down the stairs. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>I find the easiest way to reach Workbench three is to follow the natural road around the top of the map, sticking to the outside parts of the map and using walls for cover. <strong>Go past the “Find Stolen Resistance Files”</strong> area, and opposite it is a building with open doors.</p>



<p>Go through this doorway and the other open doors round the back. Turn right, and go down the stairs. Go right again, and you should see a locked door. Once more, either pick the lock, or use Bolt Cutters, go inside, and the Workbench is right there!</p>



<hr>



<p>I hope this guide was useful and you have all three Workbenches ticked off and added to your collection. I’ve put together other handy guides to help your Sniper Elite Resistance experience too: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All mission names</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy list</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-sniper-elite-resistance-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how long Resistance is</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-arrives-early-on-ps5-by-accident/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Larian Studios recently informed players that the Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 stress test began on PS5 earlier than intended by accident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, Larian Studio released a <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1883903199687631144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet</a> confirming that some PS5 users accidentally received early access to Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 8 before the stress test’s intended date. If you see version 01.800.000 or 4.1.1.6583053 on your main menu, you are also one of the users who received the automatic update. Moreover, the unintentional update on your PS5 doesn’t guarantee access to Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 Stress Test when it officially arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Larian <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1883957300123349467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that some regions in Europe and Asia mistakenly received the new patch early “as an update to their live game version in preparation for the Patch 8 stress test.” Players should know that this version of Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 8 is unsupported, and the developers have suggested revert to patch 7. Players will face compatibility issues with save games, mods, and multiplayer if they continue to play Patch 8. If you have already updated Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8, here’s how to return to Patch 7.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-return-to-baldur-s-gate-patch-7-after-unintentional-ps5-update">How to Return to Baldur’s Gate Patch 7 After Unintentional PS5 Update</h2>



<p>To know if your PS5 has received the unintentional Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 updates, head to the Main Menu and read your version number. If it is 01.800.000 or 4.1.1.6583053, you have fallen victim to the unintentional update. However, there is a straightforward way to get rid of the issue. Just uninstall the Baldur’s Gate 3 application from your console and then reinstall it to be reverted to patch 7.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-workbenches-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-1-behind-enemy-lines/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sniper Elite Resistance’s Behind Enemy Lines is Mission 1 and has the first Workbench in the game. The level lacks the depth and complexity of later maps, but it serves as an adequate introductory mission, and you can still miss the first Workbench if you’re not thorough.</p>



<p>Behind Enemy Lines ticks all the right boxes to start a Campaign: Introduces us to Harry Hawker, has tutorials showing us the ropes of the gameplay, and its fairly linear structure prepares us for the more open levels. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> Mission 1 features the Workbench Collectible.</p>



<p>So let’s get the first mission done as easily as possible and get you on the board.</p>



<h2 id="h-behind-enemy-lines-mission-1-workbench-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Behind Enemy Lines Mission 1 Workbench Location in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Pick your poison. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>The Cog symbol is the Workbench. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p><strong>The Behind Enemy Lines Workbench is hidden behind a boarded-up door in Sniper Elite Resistance’s Mission 1.</strong></p>



<p>Using the two screenshots I’ve provided above, you can see how to get to the Workbench. Thankfully, unlike later levels, there’s <strong>only one to find</strong> this time around. However, due to <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a>‘s gameplay and openness, you can easily finish the level and miss it.</p>



<p>From the start of the level, you can only follow one linear path to reach the Workbench area. It requires you to go under the bridge, shoot the Dam, and climb up. Once you get to the top, <strong>the Workbench is in the house in front of you</strong>.</p>



<p>Inside, on the left, you find a boarded-up door. There are three ways to deal with boarded-up doorways in Sniper Elite Resistance: </p>



<ul>
<li>Use a found Crowbar.</li>



<li>Dismantle them using your hands.</li>



<li>Shoot the boards.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each solution depends on the situation. Here, a Crowbar is found next to the door, making this the easiest and quietest solution. </p>



<p>Pull the boards off the door, head inside, and the Workbench is here. Walk up to it and interact with it to register the Collectible, putting the Collectible’s location on the map for any subsequent playthroughs of the mission. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-workbenches-do-in-sniper-elite-resistance">What Do Workbenches Do in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<p><strong>Workbenches are used to acquire new weapons and part upgrades and have been featured in Sniper Elite before.</strong></p>



<p>To unlock new Suppressors, recoil-reducing parts, and much more, you need to find Workbenches and use them. It makes the game easier for you and makes the daunting task of completing missions on Authentic Difficulty more palatable—making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resistance’s Trophies and Achievements list</a> easier as well.</p>
