<p>In a recent financial update, Starbreeze’s leadership team revealed that it will shrink the team working on Payday 3 going into the game’s second year of content, and invest ‘significantly less’ overall. However, the company has assured players and shareholders that this won’t impact the value delivered to gamers worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-less-is-more">Less is More</h2>



<p>Starbreeze revealed in a recent financial report that Payday 2’s sales contributions were still a whopping 50% of the value of Payday 3’s contributions. That’s a representative example of the staying power of the second game, while the third game has long struggled with player retention.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a>, the interim CEO of Starbreeze, Mats Juhl, said that the company is ‘leveraging the strength of its franchises’ to continue succeeding going into 2025:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This time last year we had just launched PAYDAY 3 – a milestone for us as a studio, and a commercial success, but also a launch marred by a series of technical issues. Since then, we have worked tirelessly to improve the game and expand the amount of content and features. </p>



<p>By the end of the quarter, we had launched four major DLCs as well as a large amount of updates to both functionality and content for all of our players. At the end of October, one of our biggest updates since launch was launched, with a brand new user interface, server browser, VoIP and much more.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He mentioned midway through his statement that…</p>



<blockquote>
<p>… ahead of year two, we are confident in being able to continue delivering amounts of value to our players with a significantly lower level of investment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was highlighted that the sentiment around Payday 3 is improving across all channels, which is true. The game has recovered somewhat from the terrible launch it underwent, even if the player base has dwindled considerably since release.</p>



<p>Starbeeze will continue to deliver content for Payday 3 going into 2025, but perhaps at a slower cadence. The team is hard at work on Project Baxter, and Juhl revealed that the company is on an expansion initiative, fleshing out roles to support the development of the new game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-suggests-more-league-shows-will-follow-in-arcane%E2%80%99s-footsteps.1038015/</guid>

<p>It was recently revealed that Arcane set a record as the most expensive animated television series ever, coming in at a whopping $250 million for just two seasons. It has been a roaring success, though – and fans are lapping up the content, especially now that the League of Legends World Championship has wrapped up.</p>



<p>Admittedly, Arcane is a masterclass in animation, and it’s picking up some seriously high praise from fans worldwide. In a recent post on Twitter, one of Riot Games’ co-founders, Marc Merrill, revealed that Riot Games isn’t done with these animated shows, despite the third season of Arcane being cancelled.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-want-more">We Want More</h2>



<p>In a simple post on Twitter, Marc Merrill revealed that ‘there are lots of other stories to tell’. He was responding to a question asking why there won’t be more seasons of Arcane.</p>



<p>Mere weeks ago, Merrill was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arcane-most-expensive-animated-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defending the budget</a> that Riot Games blew through in the production of Arcane’s first and second seasons:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players’ time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>League of Legends has been running for more than a decade and remains one of the most storied and lore-heavy games in existence. It has a thriving community backing it up, and millions of people are more than willing to soak up whatever multimedia offerings Riot Games can produce.</p>



<p>Perhaps a budget adjustment will take place, though. With Riot Games spending $250 million to produce 18 episodes of a show, many have questioned the sustainability of the company’s coffers. If that’s trimmed up, maybe we’ll get something with more meat on the bones – who knows?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-level-is-prestige-1-in-black-ops-6.1037904/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-level-is-prestige-1-in-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty player base wanted the Prestige back to how it used to be, and Treyarch and Activision have delivered. The old-school setup is back, but you need to reach a certain level to hit Prestige 1 in Black Ops 6—and we know which one. </p>



<p>I fall into the boomer category when it comes to CoD. I miss having fewer attachments, need an abundance of intricately woven three-lane maps, and yearn for the classic Prestige system. Leveling up and earning a new Prestige icon was a joy, and the challenge of unlocking all weapons and equipment again was special. </p>



<p>Activision heard our cries, and the Prestige system many of us grew up with is back with a triumphant bang. For many of you, this way of Prestiging is probably foreign. So, I’m going to run through the level you need to reach to hit Prestige 1—and beyond—and give you a quick run-through of what happens.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-prestige-in-black-ops-6">How to Prestige in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The first of many Prestige screens. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You must complete Level 55 to unlock the ability to Prestige in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a clear set of instructions in case you missed the in-game prompts:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the Black Ops 6 main multiplayer menu.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>Barracks</strong>.</li>



<li>Press on <strong>Progression</strong>.</li>



<li>Now choose <strong>Prestige</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Hold the Triangle on PlayStation, Y on Xbox</strong>, or the applicable button on other formats to see Prestige Details.</li>



<li>When it gives you the option, press <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>



<li>Press <strong>Continue </strong>again.</li>



<li>Finally, <strong>hold the required button for several seconds to officially Prestige</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>To be clear, if you reach Level 55, <strong>this isn’t enough</strong>—you need to get to the <em>end </em>of Level 55 to gain access to the Prestige option. Once you do this, BLOPS 6 informs you, and you’re left with a difficult decision, do you stay, or do you go on?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-when-you-prestige-in-black-ops-6">What Happens When You Prestige in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>If you choose to Prestige,<strong> your player level resets to one</strong>, <strong>your player icon changes to a universal symbol that remains through your Prestige 1 run</strong>, and you can <strong>unlock a heap of goodies for hitting certain milestones</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-player-level">Player Level</h3>



<p>Yes, even though you’ve spent hours increasing your player rank, enabling the Prestige function resets the number straight back to one. Effectively, you start again, and it means you need to re-unlock everything—save for one weapon, piece of equipment, or Perk of your choosing.</p>



<h3 id="h-icon-change">Icon Change</h3>



<p>Your first run through Black Ops 6’s online multiplayer gives you a fresh icon for hitting new levels, However, with Prestige, each time you do it, you’re given a fixed icon from levels 1-55. Per <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-progression-leveling-prestiging-challenges-intel#master" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a>, Black Ops 6 Prestige icons are special though as they are “themed around a title in Black Ops history.”</p>



<h3 id="h-rewards">Rewards</h3>



<p>Prestiging gives you instant <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-prestige-rewards-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige rewards</a> but also offers incentives throughout the entire Prestige journey. For example, you can earn Calling Cards, Emblems, Charms, and even Blueprints. Think of Prestige less like a daunting endeavor, and more challenging and replayable journey to carry you to the ultimate glory—the final Prestige icon!</p>
