            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new teaser that has surfaced online, it appears that Genshin Impact developer miHoYo has begun work on a fantasy MMO game with AI-based elements, called Genesis, utilizing Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>miHoYo is known for its work on anime-style games, with Genshin Impact being the developer’s crown jewel. Their roster includes several other games with the same art style, such as Zenless Zone Zero and Honkai Impact 3rd, among others. Now, it seems the developer will be venturing into a new world with Unreal Engine 5 and MMO elements.</p>



<h2 id="h-genesis-is-a-fantasy-mmo-with-ai-elements">Genesis is a Fantasy MMO With AI Elements</h2>



<p>Users on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-releases-first-tease-for-new-unreal-engine-5-fantasy-mmo-and-yes-it-uses-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) have spotted a video featuring a tease for Genshin Impact devs’ upcoming Unreal Engine 5 MMO title. The video was posted by miHoYo’s hiring department on the Chinese social media platform, Xiaohongshu. Through translations, it has been revealed that the game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5 and will be a fantasy MMO title featuring an Open World and PvP. miHoYo’s was previously using Unity Engine for games like Genshin Impact, Zenless Zone Zero, Honkai Star Rail and more. </p>



<p>Coming to the AI-based elements of the title, the translations have revealed that the title will feature “Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System, All-Terrain Battle AI, and Intellectual NPC. It is difficult to determine the extent to which AI will play a role in the upcoming title, but it appears that it will be utilized in some capacity. However, as these are translations, players should treat this information with caution. </p>



<p>In other news, Genshin Impact has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-shut-down-playstation-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed from PlayStation 4</a>, and support will end next year. Additionally, earlier this year, Congnosphere (HoYoverse) was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-publisher-fined-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fined $20 million</a> for selling lootboxes to children and teenagers.

<p>Activision accidentally posted a blog early that revealed details about Black Ops 7’s Endgame</p>



<p>As we inch closer to the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on November 14, 2025, the developers continue to drop various tidbits of information for players ahead of the full launch. We recently learned all launch details for the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombies-mode-complete-launch-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies mode</a>. It seems the next intel drop was going to be about BO7’s campaign, revealing the title’s Endgame details.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-endgame-dev-talk-coming-on-november-10">Black Ops 7 Endgame Dev Talk Coming on November 10</h2>



<p>Spotted by CharlieIntel on <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1986877838310400201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Activision accidentally posted and promptly deleted a blog post early, which revealed details about the game’s campaign. Towards the end of the blog post, it was revealed that after completing the first 11 co-op missions, players will be able to unlock the Endgame for Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>The Endgame will task “JSOC with exploring the vast landscapes of Avalon, dismantling The Guild’s remaining Command Centers while battling exposure zones leaking a mysterious toxin into the city.” It seems that this blog post was intended to release on November 9, as towards the very end it was mentioned, “Expect a Dev Talk, and a Deep Dive Blog with a detailed overview of the Campaign Endgame, coming tomorrow, Monday, November 10.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The blog post itself was intended to get players up to speed with Black Ops narrative so they are fully prepared once the co-op campaign goes live on the release date. Players can get “more insight on the major plots and players in motion at the start of the adventure” through the upcoming intel drop. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/insomniac-games-doubles-down-on-fall-2026-release-date-for-wolverine.1347427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With a busy late 2026, Insomniac confirms that Marvel’s Wolverine will still release in Fall 2026, despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6’s massive delay</a>.</p>



<p>Continuing on from Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man series, Marvel’s Wolverine is going to be a more mature take on the superhero. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Gameplay Trailer</a> showing off some intense gore and violence, it’s clear the game won’t hold any punches. Seeing as it’s a PlayStation exclusive, there’s already a lot of backing behind it to be a huge title for 2026. The trailer announced that the game would release in Fall 2026, but, seeing as delays are common, weren’t sure if it’d hold. Well, Insomniac stood its case with a new tweet, possibly hinting at some heated rivalry with Rockstar’s highly anticipated sixth GTA entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine-still-coming-out-in-fall-2026-despite-grand-theft-auto-6-s-delay">Marvel’s Wolverine Still Coming Out in Fall 2026, Despite Grand Theft Auto 6’s Delay</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1986894458835910839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from Insomniac Games</a>, the company states that Marvel’s Wolverine is still coming out in Fall 2026. Wishlists for the game on the PlayStation Store are also open, letting fans get all the latest info on the game prior to release. The timing of the message does seem convenient, as Grand Theft Auto 6 was pushed from May 26th, 2026 to November 19th, 2026. </p>



<p>Seeing as many games would want to avoid releasing when GTA 6 comes out, it’s neat to see Insomniac stick to its date. Still, it wouldn’t be too surprising to see Marvel’s Wolverine come out in August or September. That way, it would get a few months of sales and time in before Rockstar’s big new title gets in on the action. Either way, we’ll hear more about both projects next year, seeing as they’ll debut then. In Wolverine’s case, we’ll learn more in Spring 2026, as announced during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last State of Play</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think about Marvel’s Wolverine keeping its Fall 2026 date? Think it’ll come out before Grand Theft Auto 6? Could it stand up against it if it releases near or on November 19th? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The full list of nominees for the 2026 Grammys was announced on Friday, and that includes the category dedicated to video games and interactive media. This will be the fourth year that the award for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media will be given after it was introduced for the 2023 awards.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/2026-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">year’s nominees include</a> games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Star Wars Outlaws, and even Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>You may be asking, “How is Helldivers 2 nominated?” Well, that’s because of the timing of nominations and when soundtracks were actually released. The soundtrack for Helldivers 2 <a href="https://milanrecords.com/out-now-helldivers-2-original-game-soundtrack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was officially released</a> on September 20, 2024. To be eligible for the 2026 Grammys, the soundtrack had to be released between August 31, 2024, and August 30, 2025. </p>



<p>The 68th annual Grammy Awards takes place on February 1, 2026. You can check out the five games up for the award below.</p>







<p>Of this year’s nominees, only two were from games that originally released during the nomination window. Helldivers 2’s eligibility was already covered above, but what about Avatar and Star Wars Outlaws? That’s pretty simple, as well, because they were for story expansions that released within the required timeframe.</p>



<p>The full nomination list is:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – Secrets of the Spire</strong>: Pinar Toprak, composer</li>



<li><strong>Helldivers 2</strong>: Wilbert Roget, II, composer</li>



<li><strong>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</strong>: Gordy Haab, composer</li>



<li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card &amp; A Pirate’s Fortune</strong>: Cody Matthew Johnson &amp; Wilbert Roget, II, composers</li>



<li><strong>Sword of the Sea</strong>: Austin Wintory, composer</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-past-soundtrack-winners">Past Soundtrack Winners</h2>



<p>As mentioned, this will be the fourth year in a row for the Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media. In 2023, <strong>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok by Stephanie Economou</strong> took home the first award after beating out Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Call of Duty Vanguard, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and Old World.</p>



<p>In 2024, it was <strong>Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab winning for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong>. Other nominees that year included Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, and Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical. </p>



<p>Last year, <strong>Winifred Phillips won for Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</strong>. Wizardry beat out Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
