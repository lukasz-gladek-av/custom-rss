<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is in the midst of its one-year anniversary celebrations, and a new set is right around the corner in Mega Rising, for which we have all the release date and start time details.</p>



<p>New sets in Pokémon TCG Pocket have been a regular occurrence since the title first released, but Mega Rising is a big moment for the title as it introduces the mechanic of Mega Evolution, adding further complexity to deck building to consider.</p>



<p>For all the release details of the Mega Rising set, check out our guide below.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>TCG Pocket’s B1 Mega Rising set will be released on Thursday, October 30, as confirmed by the trailer for the new set.</strong></p>



<p>The launch of the set marks the start of the second year of Pokémon TCG Pocket with the start of ‘B’ sets, though it’s not clear at this stage exactly how that will shake up the meta and what restrictions, if any, will be in place for cards.</p>



<p>There’s still time to get your hands on Pack Hourglasses ahead of the release of the set, and it’s worth taking every opportunity you can ahead of the release.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1-mega-rising-start-times">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The B1 Mega Rising set will be available in the game from 11 PM PT on October 29, with a release on October 30 for the majority of the world.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows the exact release time and date for major time zones across the world.</p>

<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1-mega-rising-confirmed-cards-list">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising Confirmed Cards List</h2>



<p><strong>The Mega Rising set in Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong> <strong>is headlined by the introduction of Mega Evolutions, following the release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Mega Evolutions returning in the physical TCG.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of release, the full set list has been <a href="https://www.serebii.net/tcgpocket/megarising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed by Serebii</a>, featuring Mega Pinsir, Mega Blaziken, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Altaria amongst the cards. In total, there are 331 cards in the set—broken down into 226 normal cards and 105 Secret Rares.</p>



<p>The set will be split into three booster packs, like Genetic Apex was in the initial release of the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 ‘Connection Lost’ Steam Error Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-connection-lost-steam-error-fix/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-%E2%80%98connection-lost%E2%80%99-steam-error-explained.1337842/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following the deployment of the 1.1.1.0 update in Battlefield 6, Steam players worldwide have been met with a ‘Connection Lost’ error message when trying to access the Battlefield 6 campaign. This has been addressed by Electronic Arts as a known issue, but the team has yet to provide further updates regarding a resolution.</p>



<p>In this snapshot guide, we’ll help you understand the Steam ‘Connection Lost’ error in Battlefield 6, and provide information on how to get around it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-fix-connection-lost-error">How to Fix Connection Lost Error</h2>



<p>If you’re booting Battlefield 6 through Steam and getting a ‘Connection Lost’ error in the campaign, there are a few things you can try to workaround the issue.</p>



<p>First, <strong>restart the game and quit the Steam launcher entirely, rebooting both after a few seconds</strong>. This will clear your sessions and refresh your login to both Steam and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Second, you can try to <strong>power cycle your router and modem</strong>, refreshing your networking connection and resetting your WAN IP to hopefully fix routing issues, if that’s the problem.</p>



<p>If you can, <strong>switch from Wi-Fi to Ethernet </strong>to eliminate any residual issues with internet speed or capabilities. As a rule, gaming is best done with an Ethernet connection, as this offers uninterrupted, unbroken links.</p>



<p>Finally, <strong>disable any VPN or proxy services </strong>that you might be using, as this can cause a direct conflict with EA’s systems and servers.</p>



<p>If you want to go <strong>even deeper </strong>with network-related fixes, you can try to change your DNS settings, flush your DNS cache, or even fully reinstall Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re aware some Steam players are encountering a “Connection Lost” message when launching the Battlefield 6 campaign. Stay tuned for further updates as the team investigates this issue.</p><p>Thank you for your patience.</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1983405982584844292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h3 id="h-steam-specific-fixes">Steam-Specific Fixes</h3>



<p>Some users have had luck fixing the Connection Lost Battlefield 6 error by enabling Steam’s Beta Client.</p>



<p>Here’s how you do this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Open Steam</li>



<li>Click Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Interface</li>



<li>Under ‘Client Beta Participation’, select ‘Steam Beta Update’</li>



<li>Then restart Steam</li>
</ul>



<p>In the meantime, it’s worth staying connected to the <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA server status page</a> and following the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Comms page</a> on social media to stay up to date with all the issues ongoing in Battlefield 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield REDSEC Review—A Solid BR But Very Warzone Coded]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-review-br-warzone-coded/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-redsec-review%E2%80%94a-solid-br-but-very-warzone-coded.1337836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s REDSEC platform is now open for all to access, and as a free-to-play Battle Royale game, it’s doing exactly what you’d expect. There’s a large, open map, a couple of battle passes to choose from, a bunch of missions to resolve in-game, and an ever-shrinking circle of death that eventually strangles the entire lobby.</p>



<p>It’s Warzone-coded, and in many ways, that makes sense, because the leadership team piecing REDSEC together has that in their blood. Ultimately, REDSEC doesn’t offer anything in the way of any huge innovations on the Battle Royale genre, but it <strong>is </strong>a decent entry into the space that should at least be tried.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-redsec-any-good">Is Battlefield REDSEC Any Good?</h2>



<p>As a Battle Royale title, Battlefield REDSEC is everything you could hope for. Players parachute into a map from helicopters, picking their landing zone from a series of POIs, looting crates, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-battle-royale-missions/">kick-starting missions</a>, and fighting other players. As the game clock ticks over, the playable zone shrinks, surrounded by a ring of deadly fire.</p>



<p>It’s the same concept as Firestorm, the Battlefield 5 BR mode introduced almost seven years ago, which more or less fell flat on its face.</p>



<p>REDSEC offers all the trappings of Battlefield 6. The weapons, characters, equipment, vehicles, and movement mechanics are all pulled from the central experience, which is itself a fantastic offering. On the surface, REDSEC feels great to play; the movement is smooth and fluid, and the core elements of a Battlefield game, such as intense destruction, are&nbsp;present.</p>



<p>As you explore Fort Lyndon, the map in REDSEC, you’ll find ‘killstreaks’, challenges <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-tanks-in-battlefield-redsec-battle-royale/">to unlock tanks</a> and other powerful vehicles, custom weapon drops, and kits that you can use to upgrade weapons on the fly.</p>



<p>This is where the innovations that <strong>do exist </strong>start to leech into the game, and it’s also where we see some cross-collaborative innovations coming over from games like Apex Legends, also published by Electronic Arts.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Even the Double XP token system is pulled clean from Call of Duty</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s good, but I couldn’t help but feel I was playing Warzone at times, which isn’t what you want from <strong>a direct competitor</strong>. Everything from the double XP token structure to the battle pass mechanics, and from the nature of side missions to the loadout features, REDSEC simply smacks of Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>







<h2 id="h-redsec-proves-battle-royale-is-still-going-strong">REDSEC Proves Battle Royale is Still Going Strong</h2>



<p>The Battle Royale genre is an ebb-and-flow kind of thing that never seems consistent. It has been populated over the years with multiple games, and once upon a time, developers in fringe titles threw their hat in the ring to see what they could do.</p>



<p>With that, I mean that even games like Forza Horizon and Fallout 76 once had Battle Royale modes.</p>



<p>The hype surrounding REDSEC was palpable, and going into the game at launch, players were met with sizeable queues. There was a spike in traffic on streaming and content platforms, and player counts had a nice injection of energy, with Battlefield and Call of Duty fans alike eager to explore this free-to-play BR platform.</p>



<p>Even after more than a decade, the concept of the Battle Royale remains a winning one, and REDSEC takes the ball and runs with it, producing something laden with potential that might just be stable enough to challenge the likes of Warzone. </p>



<p>There’s a learning curve for sure, especially concerning the destruction capabilities of the game and some of the movement and weapon handling mechanics, but I feel that this is as accessible a Battle Royale as you could hope for.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The Battlefield REDSEC map is deeply Californian</figcaption></figure>







<p>The map is great, too. It’s the kind of environment I love, fusing urban biomes with natural regions and a touch of mountainous, desert areas. It’s diverse, large enough to accommodate the player count without feeling enormous, and has plenty of nooks to explore.</p>



<h6><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/">Full Battlefield 6 Review</a></strong></h6>



<h2 id="h-but-it-s-not-perfect">But It’s Not Perfect</h2>



<p>REDSEC has had issues at launch. When I played, I experienced more than my fair share of bugs and glitches:</p>



<ul>
<li>Network instability causing packet loss and rubber banding</li>



<li>Dynamic elements like custom weapon drops floating in midair</li>



<li>Weapon crates duplicating on interaction and falling into each other</li>



<li>Players falling under the map (and staying there)</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-battle-royale-redeploy-teammates/">Redeploy towers</a> throwing teammates into the fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Teething issues are commonplace these days, and it’s hardly fair to take points away from the game, but you’d imagine that REDSEC would launch in a better state given the consistency of the multiplayer platform and how much stock Electronic Arts (and associated studios) have poured into the Battle Royale platform.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Being so close to Warzone, can REDSEC ultimately escape the competition?</figcaption></figure>







<p>If you’re going to give REDSEC a try, I’d recommend picking up a battle pass (ideally the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-bf-pro-battle-pass-worth-it-battlefield-6-rewards/">BF Pro battle pass</a>) if you think you’re going to sink a few hours into it. It adds another layer of meat to the bones of the game, and you’ll have a bit more to aim for. The core gameplay loop is fulfilling enough, but BRs have a tendency to get dull quite quickly under the strain of repetition.</p>



<p>Time will tell how Electronic Arts treats Battlefield REDSEC. For now, it’s a great Battle Royale title that has everything you’d expect from a Battlefield bolt-on, and I’m certainly going to invest more than a few hours into it.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-great">Verdict: 4/5 – ‘Great’</h2>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-developing-two-more-games-edgy/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is about to hit the market, introducing to the world one of the most popular extraction shooters around. For Embark Studios, it follows the earlier launch of The Finals, an arena-based, destructive first-person shooter that served as the studio’s debut title.</p>



<p>Embark Studios isn’t done when ARC Raiders is out, though. In a recent interview, the studio’s CEO, Patrick Soderlund, confirmed that the team is working on <strong>two new games</strong>, one of which has ‘a lot more edge to it’ than ARC Raiders or The Finals.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-the-other-is-more-conventional">But The Other is More Conventional</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with The Game Business, Embark’s CEO sat down to talk about the studio, its evolution, the release of ARC Raiders, and where things go from here. In one segment, the CEO, Patrick Soderlund, was asked about what other games are in development at the studio.</p>



<p>These projects are in the earlier, more conceptual stages, but there are <strong>two </strong>being pieced together. When asked if they’re all online games, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONLWtl85bjU&amp;t=2141s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Soderlund explained</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That I think is just ingrained in our DNA. That doesn’t mean that they’re online games the same way as The Finals or ARC Raiders. One of the concepts we have, I would say, has a lot more <strong>edge </strong>to it than The Finals or ARC Raiders does.</p>



<p>The other one maybe is a little bit more conventional.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Embark Studios has gone from strength to strength in the last few years, and the imminent arrival of ARC Raiders is a testament to the work the studio has put in. This is arguably going to be the most exciting and anticipated extraction shooter ever made, if the numbers are anything to go by.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, the extraction genre has skyrocketed, particularly with the arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-sells-1-million-copies/">Escape from Duckov</a>, a parody title that has sold millions of copies in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>What kind of game do you think Embark Studios should make next? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-29-871/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-871-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-wednesday-october-29.1337824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the middle of the week, and regardless of what your plans are for the day ahead, I’ve got the latest NYT Connections hints that you need to dominate today’s puzzle. It’s a tricky one today, and there are some very clever answers, but if you’re stumped, just read on to get the answers you need.</p>



<p>The top NYT Connections hints await.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-29">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 29)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #871:</p>



<ul>
<li>BACKBONE</li>



<li>MEDIUM</li>



<li>VENUE</li>



<li>SCRABBLE</li>



<li>SPIRIT</li>



<li>COMPUTER KEYBOARD</li>



<li>SACRUM</li>



<li>COURAGE</li>



<li>PLATFORM</li>



<li>SEYCHELLES</li>



<li>HEART</li>



<li>OUIJA BOARD</li>



<li>SEITAN</li>



<li>OUTLET</li>



<li>SÉANCE</li>



<li>ABECEDARIUM</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all relate to qualities that represent someone’s core or emotional resilience</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each term is a way to deliver content or host experiences</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each word is fun to ‘say’</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each term covers the full A to Z</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 29.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-29-871">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 29 (#871)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BACKBONE, COURAGE, HEART, SPIRIT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – MEDIUM, OUTLET, PLATFORM, VENUE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – SACRUM, SEITAN, SEYCHELLES, SÉANCE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ABECEDARIUM, COMPUTER KEYBOARD, OUIJA BOARD, SCRABBLE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
