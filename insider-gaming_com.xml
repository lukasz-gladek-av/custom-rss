<p>As SAG-AFTRA’s strike against video game companies continues, the guild has just signed a new deal with Ethovox to protect performers in the AI age. Ethovox is currently working on a consensual, foundational A.I. voice model to ensure performers will be “protected and compensated fairly” while their model reflects their “commitment to diversity and inclusion”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/new-sag-aftra-and-ethovox-agreement-empowers-actors-and-secures-essential-ai-guardrails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deal</a> between SAG-AFTRA and Ethovox ensures that the artist will receive “both session fees and ongoing revenue sharing for the life of the foundational model.” The guild’s National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, stated that during the A.I. age, the performers required “more contractual protection, not less” to safeguard their livelihoods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Duncan Crabtree-Ireland stated, “SAG-AFTRA will continue to recognize AI companies, like Ethovox, that agree with our union’s AI guidelines.” Duncan acknowledged that not every performer would want to work with an AI company; however, those who intend to do so will have an agreement that secures “informed consent” and provides “fair compensation.”</p>



<p>Ethovox CEO Cissy Jones stated, “Ethovox is the only voice A.I. company owned and managed by voice actors, and we are pleased to be partnering with SAG-AFTRA on building a foundational voice A.I. model that prioritizes the interests of voice actors.”</p>



<p>Jones adds that “A.I. should be a choice”. Hence, Ethovox has been reaching out to the voice actor community during the entire process and will demonstrate fair compensation and ethical A.I. development in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Call of Duty’s Double XP Weekends are the best. For a limited time, you can earn twice as much XP in CoD, and if you’re looking to quickly level up in Black Ops 6, the next Double XP Weekend is the dream ticket—so let’s look at all the information we have so far.</p>



<p>I love a Double XP Weekend in CoD. If you’ve not been able to play as much Call of Duty as you’d like, or you’ve had some time off, a Double XP Weekend allows you to catch up, make up lost ground, and get back into the leveling-up fray. It applies to all game modes too, so you don’t need to feel restricted in your methods or change your gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is likely to continue the trend of the last few CoD games by having regular Double XP Weekends. With talk of Black Ops 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season One</a>, and even its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a>, let’s address another key topic right now.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-the-next-double-xp-weekend-event-date-is-in-black-ops-6">Do we Know When the Next Double XP Weekend Event Date is in Black Ops 6?</h2>

<p>Right now, we don’t currently know when the first Black Ops 6 Double XP Weekend is expected to be. If we use 2023’s Modern Warfare 3 as a marker though, we should expect to see the first 2XP Weekend in the <strong>third or fourth week of November</strong>.</p>



<p>Modern Warfare 3’s first all-Double XP Weekend debuted on Nov. 22, last year, and the first instance of these special occasions usually drop around the end of November / start of December—expect Black Ops 6 to be the same.</p>



<p>For now, this is pure conjecture on our part, so take this speculation with a grain of salt. However, keep checking back to this guide as we are going to update it as we learn more about the first Double XP Weekend.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-double-xp-weekend-in-black-ops-6">What is Double XP Weekend in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Double XP Weekend is a period—usually <strong>lasting from Friday until Monday</strong>—in which players can <strong>earn twice as much XP for one or more of CoD’s leveling-up systems</strong>—and this is expected to be the same for Black Ops 6 too.</p>



<p>There are many ways to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-double-xp-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earn Double XP in Black Ops 6</a>, but this is one of the best. It depends on Treyarch, but Double Weekends can include one of the following: <strong>Double Player Level XP, Double Weapon Level XP, or Double Battle Pass XP</strong>. If you’re lucky, the developer may decide to be generous and allow you to have Double XP for all three!</p>
