<p>Both teams chose to forfeit in the middle of a professional Counter-Strike 2 match, letting the final map and the series itself be determined by a simple coin flip. Why? Because another qualifier scheduled for today has much higher stakes in the Valve Regional Standings.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ez-win">‘ez win’</h2>



<p>Earlier today, Ninjas in Pyjamas and Aurora faced off in a best-of-three as part of the CCT Season 2 Europe Series 18 Closed Qualifier. However, both CS2 teams wanted to compete in the BLAST Rising Europe open qualifiers later on, meaning the match would have to end after two maps for both teams to have time. Unfortunately for both NiP and Aurora, they split the first two maps, and with their BLAST Rising qualifier matches starting soon, both teams chose to forfeit.</p>



<p>Following the third map, caster Charlie “Cmd64” Drudge explained that <a href="https://www.hltv.org/matches/2378992/aurora-vs-ninjas-in-pyjamas-cct-season-2-europe-series-18-closed-qualifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aurora had forfeited</a> the map due to scheduling. However, the official NiP account on X stated that both teams had actually forfeited, but NiP had won the coin toss.</p>







<p>The decision to skip the rest of the CCT match in favor of the BLAST Rising qualifier actually panned out for NiP. The Ninjas won the Nordic Open Qualifier, earning a guaranteed spot in the closed qualifier that begins tomorrow. Unfortunately for Aurora, they didn’t just lose the coin toss, as they were eliminated in the semifinal of their BLAST Rising open qualifier.</p>



<p>Both teams consider the risk worth the reward. The closed qualifiers for BLAST Rising are events ranked by the Valve Regional Standings, and making it past qualifiers would be very rewarding to a team’s ranking. Format is the big difference maker. The CCT closed qualifier is also ranked, but it uses a group stage format, so one loss won’t immediately eliminate a team like Aurora. However the BLAST Rising open qualifier is a single-elimination bracket, so missing your match would result in instant elimination.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is an enormous game in both scope and scale and from the maps you explore to the missions you complete, you’ll need to invest <strong>many hours </strong>in the game to conquer everything. That’s all well and good saying that, but what do the numbers look like? How long is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll introduce you to the size of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, breaking down just how long KCD2 is and how many hours it’ll take you to finish it.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How Many Hours is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</h2>



<p><strong>It took me 65.5 hours to complete the main story and a lot of side content in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</strong>.</p>



<p>That includes many restarts and reloads following deaths and failed objectives. In those 65.5 hours, I managed to get to level 22, acquired some of the best weapons and armour in the game, and unlocked 50% of all the game’s achievements.</p>



<p>I <strong>didn’t </strong>unlock the achievement to ‘finish most of the game’s content’. </p>



<p>I also know that in those 65.5 hours, I left a lot of side missions untouched in my eagerness to get the game finished for a full review. However, you can go back and finish up skipped content once you’ve completed the game, so that’s my goal.</p>



<p>I believe that I left behind (or didn’t discover) enough content to push Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 to around<strong> 100 hours</strong>.</p>



<p>From mastering skills to uncovering secrets and from taking part in side activities to conquering secondary and tertiary quests, there is still so much for me to finish. I haven’t unfogged the entire map, I’ve not knocked all the nests out of the trees, and I haven’t visited every point of interest marked on my map.</p>



<p>If I speak frankly, I’d say that <strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is around 100 hours long </strong>for the average player. If you’re just rushing the story and not participating in side missions, you can probably complete the whole thing in around <strong>20 – 30 hours</strong> without making any mistakes.</p>
