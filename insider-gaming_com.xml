            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-assembles-halo-%E2%80%98super-squad%E2%80%99-for-2025-season.1078572/</guid>

<p>OpTic Gaming has come out on social media with a revelation regarding its 2025 Halo Championship Series roster. In a massive shakeup, it was revealed that going into the new season, FormaL, Bound, Renegade, and Lqgend will be flying the banner of Team Green.</p>



<p>Last season was tough for OpTic, with the team failing to secure a single major win but landing in second place no fewer than five times. The team fell short of the trophy at every HCS Major and Halo World Champs.</p>



<p>Every loss except for one came at the hands of Spacestation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-year-new-optic">New Year, New OpTic</h2>



<p>OpTic’s social media post announcing the team was met with jubilation from fans:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Some have already branded the team a ‘God Squad’, being as it is made up of some of the sharpest competitors in Halo esports today.</p>



<p>FormaL is an instantly recognisable force of nature, being one of just two esports pro players on Earth with world championship titles in <strong>two </strong>games. He has long been considered one of the best (if not <strong>the best</strong>) controller-based esports players ever seen.</p>



<p>Bound and Lqgend join OpTic Gaming from Spacestation – the very roster that wiped the floor with OpTic on so many occasions last year, which is ironic at best. Will the duo be able to start winning trophies for OpTic this season, rather than preventing victory at the last minute possible?</p>



<p>Finally, there’s Renegade, who joins OpTic Gaming from FaZe Clan, the only other team to pip OpTic to the post last season during an HCS Major.</p>



<p>These are some of the most storied, seasoned, and successful competitors in Halo esports. Could this be the year that OpTic Gaming lifts multiple trophies <strong>again</strong>? We’ll find out when the season starts.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-flea-market-lockdown-extended/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestate-games-has-extended-the-flea-market-lockdown-in-tarkov.1078566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-flea-market-lockdown-extended/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has revealed on social media that it has been ‘actively monitoring community feedback’ in Escape from Tarkov, and as a result, it’ll be keeping the Flea Market locked down for a further five days. It was due to be unlocked <strong>now</strong> following December’s wipe, but it’ll now open up to all users on January 14.</p>



<p>This was seen by some as one of the most bizarre changes the developer has made in Escape from Tarkov. By locking down the Flea Market, BSG effectively put a stranglehold on the game’s peer-to-peer economy for a couple of weeks. Also, the studio made it impossible to use non-FIR items to upgrade the hideout, which was seen as another huge mistake.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-little-while-longer">A Little While Longer</h2>



<p>On social media, Battlestate Games wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are actively monitoring community feedback on Flea Market being locked and decided to extend the lock for 5 more days until January 14 3PM GMT / 10AM EST. </p>



<p>We would like to thank you on actively sharing the feedback and reporting the issues. We will continue working on technical fixes and balancing changes in the upcoming days.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to criticise the announcement, with many questioning which community the team was listening to, as ‘nobody wants this’. Even Pestily, the game’s biggest content creator, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t mind either way but where exactly where was this community feedback taken from? This would of been a perfect opportunity to use the in game survey to get active players polled for thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For the more skilful, talented players, having no Flea Market has added a deeper challenge to the game, but for casual players, it’s a bit more of a nightmare. Those who don’t have hours to while away on the game are left feeling choked. Many tend to rely on the Flea Market when they hit level 15 to build up their hideout, but that’s now impossible for two reasons.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good change, or has Battlestate Games missed the mark here? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has just released a game for the Switch called Overdungeon while their patent infringement battle with Nintendo continues.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-releases-overdungeon-on-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Pocketpair released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7SXW2eXG2E&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> today announcing the arrival of Overdungeon on Nintendo Switch. The roguelike tower defence card game was first released in early access for PC via Steam in 2018, and the full release arrived in 2019. It is the first game ever developed by the Palworld Creator.</p>



<p>To celebrate its launch on the Switch, Overdungeon is available on Nintendo eShop at a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/overdungeon-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">50% discount</a>, costing $7.49 instead of $14.99. The offer is only available until January 24, 2025.&nbsp;Check out the official description for the title below.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Overdungeon is a real-time action card game that combines roguelike, tower defense, and card games! It’s easy to play with simple controls, is very replayable and a high degree of freedom! Conquer dungeons by combining cards selected from hundreds of cards! Is your trump card an alpaca? Or a dog or a cat? Or maybe a chicken? Build the strongest deck and challenge the dungeon!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On the topic of Pocketpair and Nintendo, the latter, along with The Pokémon Company, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is actively seeking 10 Million Yen</a> (around USD $66,000) in damages over alleged patent infringement. Pocketpair responded, stating they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings”.

<p>Here’s the official description for the Darkhold battle pass:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Darkhold contains two powerful spells that have aroused interest in opposing forces: The Vampiric Verses can create creatures of the night, while the Montesi Formula can eliminate them.

Join us in the battle in Marvel Rivals and help recover the lost pages!</p>
