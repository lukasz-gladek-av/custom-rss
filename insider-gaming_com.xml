<p>The signs pointing to the next Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game continue to find their way out, this time via a tease in a different Activision game.  </p>



<p>Spotted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s Grind map, there is a skateboard area with a logo similar to that of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skate 1 + 2. Within that logo reads a date: March 4, 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Coincidently, if you go by month-date-year formatting, the month and day equates to 3-4, the expected next remaster from the classic skateboarding series. </p>



<p>The latest tease comes just days after pro skater&nbsp;Tyshawn Jones said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remaster-is-coming-skater-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during an interview</a> that a new game was “about to come out”. It was then followed up with claims from eXtas1s that the game will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/">be shadow dropped</a> when it launches.</p>



<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2—a remaster of the first two games—launched in 2020. That game was developed by Vicarious Visions, which has since been rebranded as Blizzard Albany after becoming fully merged into Blizzard Entertainment in 2022. There were talks that the follow up remaster was in development, but that it had been cancelled sometime in 2021-2022. In September 2024, however, Hawk himself said that there would be a future for the franchise as it celebrated its 25th Anniversary and that it was something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he was excited about</a>.</p>



<p>“I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future,” Hawk said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via an Instagram post</a>.</p>

<p>IRacing is deep in development of its first NASCAR console game, NASCAR  25, and it has released a new developer diary going over some of the features of the game’s career mode.</p>



<p>The diary first talks about the previous announcement that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-25-to-feature-four-official-series-including-arca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arca series is coming</a> to a console game for the first time. The series will  be available in career and other modes throughout NASCAR 25.</p>



<p>“So, why having Arca, Trucks, Xfinity and Cup is so important, especially from a design perspective, is we finally get to do what is a realistic career mode that somebody would actually follow in real life,” Director of Development and Production John Schneider said. </p>



<p>Elsewhere in the NASCAR 25 career mode, there will be opportunities to grow your driver’s brand off the track and spend your time. Players will be able to build their reputation by helping clean up a park, helping around the shop, or even have a part in a movie. Your sponsors might also have tasks for you that will help keep you in their good graces. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>“You’ll have to balance between building your reputation and your brand, and being successful on the race track,” Dale Earnhardt Jr. said.</p>



<p>There will even be decisions on how you spend your money to improve your team and become a top contender in every series you enter. According to Mike Devault, the game’s UX lead, designing the career mode was a “herculean effort”.</p>



<p>“You want to make sure that you have all the right details in there about what makes a NASCAR career really authentic,” he said. “At the same time, you don’t want to make everybody have to go through all the minutia of managing a race team and the finances and the employees.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“It’s a nice balance, and I think we’ve pulled this off really well in NASCAR 25 where if you want to just concentrate as being a driver, you can do that while mildly being involved in some of the decision making. But, if you want to go in there and manage every last little detail, you’re going to be able to do that as well.”</p>



<p>Devault added that throughout the career, interactions between driver, crew chief, and team will feel more authentic as opposed to being too much “like a UI screen.”</p>



<p>NASCAR 25 launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
