<p>How’s 2026 going for you? I’m hoping you’ve at least kept up your NYT Connections streak – I know I have! If you’re looking for a quick way to solve today’s NYT Connections puzzle, look no further than this snapshot guide. I’ve got your NYT Connections hints and answers right here, ready to digest.</p>



<p>Read on to wrap today’s NYT Connections challenge and move on with your day!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-15">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 15)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #949:</p>



<ul>
<li>CEREAL</li>



<li>STATIC</li>



<li>MELTED</li>



<li>SNOW</li>



<li>LEVITATE</li>



<li>SALT</li>



<li>PATRON</li>



<li>SHOVEL</li>



<li>HOSE</li>



<li>STATIONARY</li>



<li>SPADE</li>



<li>JACKAL</li>



<li>FROZEN</li>



<li>RAKE</li>



<li>DANDRUFF</li>



<li>STILL</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all things you’d grab from a shed when working in the yard.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe something that isn’t changing position or activity.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each of these can appear as tiny, thin pieces that fall, sprinkle, or scatter.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word hides two common male first names back-to-back (sometimes overlapping slightly in sound or letters).</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 15:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>

<p>Prime Video’s God of War series has its Kratos.</p>



<p>The company announced on Wednesday that Ryan Hurst has been cast to play the lead protagonist Kratos in the upcoming series. The show is currently in pre-production with casting continuing.</p>







<p>Hurst is known for his roles as Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy and Gerry Bertier in Remember the Titans. In the video game world, Hurst’s only role was as Thor in God of War Ragnarok. He was nominated for a BAFTA in 2022 for Performer in a Supporting Role for his depiction of the God of Thunder.</p>



<p>Speaking of Thor, according <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-series-thor-baldur-cast-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to recent reports</a>, Olafur Darri Olafsson is in talks to play the role in the series. The series will focus on the Norse saga from the 2018 God of War and the aforementioned Ragnarok. </p>



<p><strong>“God of War&nbsp;follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye,” </strong>the show’s synopsis reads. <strong>“Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.”&nbsp;</strong></p>
