<p>Hasbro has partnered with Legendary Entertainment to create a Magic: The Gathering live-action film and TV universe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/magic-the-gathering-legendary-hasbro-film-tv-universe-1236280886/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-announces-magic-the-gathering-film-and-tv-series-wants-it-to-be-the-next-cinematic-universe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Hasbro and Legendary Entertainment will first work on a Magic: The Gathering film, followed by a TV series and other content. Legendary Entertainment has extensive experience in adaptations, with movies like Dune, Detective Pikachu, and more under its belt. It is also currently working on several video game adaptations, such as the Minecraft movie and Street Fighter film.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zev Foreman, Hasbro Entertainment’s Head of Film, has called the partnership with Legendary Entertainment “exciting and complementary”. As the franchise has “inspired decades of epic world-building and creative storytelling”, Foreman believes that Magic the Gathering’s film and TV universe will be “a perfect match for Legendary’s diversified approach to marquee IP”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mary Parent, Legendary’s Chairman of Worldwide Production, stated that the company prides itself “on being thoughtful caretakers of singular, beloved IP”, and Hasbro’s highly popular trading card game matches that description. Hasbro and Legendary Entertainment wish to create a Magic: The Gathering “multimedia universe that thrills longstanding fans and creates a broad wave of new ones.”</p>



<p>Magic: The Gathering is the <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/magic-gathering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">world’s first trading card game</a>, released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast. By February 2023, it had gathered a staggering 50 million players and generated more than $1 billion annually since 2022. Magic: The Gathering is known for being highly strategic and customisable in gameplay, which suits all types of players. The game has received decades of expansions and collaborations with franchises like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Lord of the Rings, and more. A partnership with Final Fantasy is coming this year, too.&nbsp;</p>
