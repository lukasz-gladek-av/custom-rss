<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Fails to be Revived by New Season Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-fails-revive-new-season/</link>
            <guid>1438966</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently revealed that Battlefield 6’s development team was ‘biting their nails’ in anxiety at the Battlefield 6 roadmap. In a bid to push for a bold resurgence, Battlefield Studios tried to roll out a hefty update for the game’s second season, as well as evolving REDSEC somewhat, but it hasn’t proven to be as much of an adrenaline hit as they wanted.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> season two update was released <strong>yesterday</strong>, and it failed to bring back a considerable enough amount of players to call it a successful content drop. Similarly, viewership failed to increase, suggesting that nobody is interested in <strong>watching </strong>the game, just as much as they are losing interest in playing it.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-continues-to-backslide">Battlefield 6 Continues to Backslide</h2>



<p>When Battlefield 6 dropped in October, it was to a stellar reception that praised the game’s multiplayer platform to no end. The single-player portion was a take-it-or-leave-it delivery, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/redsec/" id="3151">REDSEC</a> turned out to be a fledgling battle royale that failed to make waves, but the multiplayer element of the game felt solid.</p>



<p>Since the game launched, interest has waned as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-studios/" id="2832">Battlefield Studios</a> has watched its player count slowly collapse. There was hope that players would either <strong>return to </strong>Battlefield 6 or <strong>discover </strong>the game with the deployment of the season two update, but that hasn’t been the case.</p>



<p>If we use Steam as a representative example, we can see that the player count hit 92,281 as the second season was released. But on a random Sunday afternoon on January 25th, <strong>with no new content drops</strong>, the game hit 97,959 players on the same platform. The game jumped somewhat in the last 24 hours, but not enough to dub the new season a <strong>resurgence</strong>.</p>



<p>For reference, the game reached 747,440 concurrent players upon release in October 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>To put this into further perspective, ARC Raiders was released just a couple of weeks <strong>after </strong>Battlefield 6 and had a peak player count of 481,966 users on Steam. In the last 24 hours, it hit a peak of 215,978 users.</p>



<p>We can then turn our attention to viewership, which hasn’t fared much better.</p>



<p>Last year, Battlefield 6 hit a whopping 868,520 concurrent viewers, a peak that few games have managed to achieve over the years. Once upon a time, more than 17,000 streamers were broadcasting Battlefield 6 at the same time.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the 24 hours that saw the arrival of season two, we saw the peak viewer count jump from about 3,000 users to 27,000, leaving Battlefield 6 as the 75th most-viewed game on Twitch. It’s possible we’d see more growth going into the weekend, which is when around 30% <strong>more people </strong>tend to consume Battlefield content, but it’s unlikely.</p>



<p>Using ARC Raiders as another comparison point, we see the peak of 372,816 viewers at launch holds much firmer with a 24-hour peak of 116,000, which is about typical for Embark Studios’ extraction adventure title.</p>



<p>It’s not Highguard levels of implosion, but Battlefield 6 players fear the counts will continue to slide as folks lose interest in the game that was designed to recapture the excitement of a floundering franchise.</p>

<p>As Highguard’s struggles continue amid collapsing player counts and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" id="175994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs at developer</a> Wildlight Entertainment, a new report has shed light on who was funding the game all these years.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a>, Chinese conglomerate Tencent was the “lead financial backer” of the studio. Specifically, it’s said that TiMi Studio Group is the main studio backing the game.</p>







<p>Up until now, the funders behind the game have been kept quiet. In past interviews, the studio has declined to comment on who was investing in the studio.</p>



<p>Totilo adds that neither Tencent nor Wildlight provided a comment on the matter by the time of publication. Insider Gaming has also reached out for comment, but has not received a response. </p>



<p>Highguard launched on January 26th to nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam. Since then the game has seen its playerbase fall to under 2,000 peak concurrents on the platform. It has also received mixed reviews. </p>
