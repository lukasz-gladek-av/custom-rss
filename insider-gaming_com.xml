<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will be receiving some new DLC in the near future.</p>



<p>The Dragon Ball team has announced that the latest console game in the Dragon Ball franchise, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, will receive a major DLC release this summer. The DLC was released as part of the franchise’s 40th anniversary celebration. As part of the celebration, a trailer revealed that Super Android 17 would be coming to the game. </p>



<p>As well as the ‘Great Demon King’ Piccolo, the villainous version of Piccolo from the original Dragon Ball series. Super Saiyan Bardock is also on his way to the franchise. More names are also planned to join the lineup.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will be new cosmetics and other skill customizations. The trailer also teases a new single-player game mode. More is expected to be announced in the coming months.</p>

<h2 id="h-there-s-also-a-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-in-2027">There’s Also A New Dragon Ball Game Coming in 2027</h2>



<p>Additionally, the celebration revealed that a new game project is in the works. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/">Known as “Age 1000,</a>” it was accompanied by a brief trailer. Work on Age 1000 began more than 5 years ago, and Akira Toriyama, the franchise’s creator, worked on the game’s world-building and even on some brand-new characters. Great news for longtime fans of the series who thought that Toriyama’s passing in 2024 might have meant that the last of his work had already been seen.</p>







<p>More information about the forthcoming game will be revealed during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in April.</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is currently available for purchase on all Xbox consoles, PlayStation 5, Steam, and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>

<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-voici-le-titre-phare-de-la-selection-de-fevrier-2026-60911" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/undisputed-review-redefining-the-boxing-game-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Undisputed </a>will be the flagship PlayStation Plus free game for February 2026.

<figure></figure>



<p>The game currently has a mixed reaction on Metacritic with a 70 Metascore. The user rating is a little more unforgiving, currently at 4.8. Some reviews knock the game for being buggy and urge others not to buy. Well, PlayStation Plus users won’t have to buy the game in February if they want to try it out. </p>



<p>Currently, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed and Need for Speed Unbound are available to download for free on PlayStation Plus.</p>

<p>The latest trailer for the Super Mario Galaxy movie reveals a couple of fan-favorite characters. Also, it shows that the upcoming film has taken more inspiration from recent Mario games than was once believed.</p>



<p>In a special Nintendo Direct specifically for the Super Mario Galaxy movie, Shigeru Miyamoto revealed the latest trailer for the upcoming film. The trailer begins with Mario and Luigi traveling through the Sand Kingdom from Super Mario Odyssey. They run into several Tostarenans who are excited to see the plumbers. </p>



<p>They point them toward the disturbances they’ve been experiencing. This leads to a dark cavern, requiring Mario and Luigi to use a fire flower, and when they reach the center warp pipe, Yoshi is revealed. At first, they are just as afraid of Yoshi as he is of them, but they quickly realize that they have found a new companion in everyone’s favorite green dinosaur.</p>



<p>Yoshi was previously teased in the end credits scene following the Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023.</p>

<h2 id="h-yoshi-is-not-the-only-character-revealed-in-this-new-trailer">Yoshi Is Not the Only Character Revealed in This New Trailer</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to Yoshi, there was a brief fight scene featuring Princess Peach and Birdo, paying homage to the fact that Birdo was a boss battle in the second Super Mario Bros game. In the trailer, Birdo was shooting eggs at Princess Peach with great ferocity. There was also a brief moment of Luigi wearing a frog suit. Lakitu was also briefly shown.</p>



<p>Keegan-Michael Key’s Toad also returns, and he is initially annoyed at the fact that Yoshi immediately joins the group. The whole gang is later seen running away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey. During the scene, it was revealed that Mario and Luigi were in their baby forms and were being carried by Toad.</p>







<p>Chris Meledandri from Illumination also appeared at the end of the presentation to say that the movie was currently in post-production and had finished animation. The movie will be released in theaters on April 1.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#959)—Clues and Answers for Sunday, January 25]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-25-959/</link>
            <guid>1415410</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another week has ended, but your NYT Connections streak doesn’t have to. In this guide, we’re breaking down the best NYT Connections hints and solutions to help you complete your puzzle and start your Sunday in the most efficient way possible.</p>



<p>If you’re stuck on today’s NYT Connections puzzle, scroll down, pick up the hints (or answers), and move on with your day! You’re welcome!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-25">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 25)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #959:</p>



<ul>
<li>WINDOWS</li>



<li>SHELL</li>



<li>ATE</li>



<li>FILL IN</li>



<li>RIBBON</li>



<li>SUB</li>



<li>HOOD</li>



<li>MENU</li>



<li>TUBE</li>



<li>COVER</li>



<li>DOM</li>



<li>ALT</li>



<li>SHIP</li>



<li>BOWTIE</li>



<li>TEMP</li>



<li>ENTER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words are related to replacing something.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Think of keyboard inputs that you might use every time you turn on a computer.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> More anglicized naming conventions for a popular Italian food</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Common suffixes.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 25:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-25-959">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 25 (#959)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– COVER, FILL IN, SUB, TEMP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – ALT, ENTER, MENU, WINDOWS</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOWTIE, RIBBON, SHELL, TUBE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ATE, DOM, HOOD, SHIP</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
