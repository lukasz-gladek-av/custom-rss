<p>Ubisoft has provided players with new stealth gameplay details for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The main focus of the new gameplay was Naoe, the agile shinobi. However, some skills are applicable to Yasuke the Samurai, too.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-new-stealth-features">Assassin’s Creed Shadows New Stealth Features</h2>



<h3 id="h-observe-and-eagle-vision">Observe and Eagle Vision</h3>



<p>With the removal of the eagle companion, players in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have to rely on two different scouting mechanics. The first is Observe, allowing players to identify targets, tag and monitor enemies, and highlight lootable stashes, collectables, and quest objectives. Players can also examine nearby locations through a Synch Point while using the Observe skill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next is Eagle Vision, and this Assassin’s Creed Stealth mechanic identifies enemy positions and lets you tag them behind walls and other objects. Eagle Vision will also isolate any relevant sounds the enemies make and let you find hiding spots. Naoe can use these skills separately and concurrently to survey the area better.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-hiding-crouching-and-going-prone">Hiding, Crouching and Going Prone</h3>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Features are movement mechanics, which include hiding in shadows, crouching, and going prone. During the nighttime, players will find different hiding pots covered in shadows—the best way to ambush their enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crouching is an effective movement mechanic for indoors. If players crouch, then the sound they make decreases drastically. Also, their visibility is much lower when compared to standing. Crouching will also reduce the chance of you walking into any noisy objects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows stealth mechanic is for both Yasuke and Naoe. Players can be prone to reducing their visibility further when on rooftops, on the ground, or even underwater. When using prone as Naoe, players will be able to roll side to side or front to back by pressing the dodge buttons. There are also certain locations that you can crawl under by using prone.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-stealth-tools">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Tools</h3>



<p>As a stealthy shinobi in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Naoe uses an array of tools to move around as sneakily as possible. Naoe has four primary tools: Smoke Bomb, Shinobi Bells, Kunai and Shuriken. The first two are great for escaping or distracting enemies, while the others are better for damaging or stunning them.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Smoke Bomb" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJ-AWZISiK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-return-of-double-assassinations-nbsp">Return of Double Assassinations&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players can go on the ultimate stealth runs, thanks to the return of Double Assassinations. All you need to do is have Tanto as your primary weapon and unlock the dedicated skill to perform the Double Assassination with the Hidden Blade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also a non-lethal stealth mechanic, which is grabbing. Players can silently assassinate their enemies by grabbing them and pulling them into the shadows or bushes to get rid of them. Moreover, Naoe is the “smallest Assassin to date”, so she will be able to squeeze through tiny wall cracks and hide inside small storage spaces and boxes to surprise her enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Grab Mechanic" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5y4HB6S_Mew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-enemy-reactions">Enemy Reactions</h3>



<p>While developing Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ stealth mechanics, the developers also focused on enemy tactics. Servants are a new non-lethal enemy that will be introduced in this game. They cannot harm you but can raise alarms to reveal your location to other enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enemies will be more suspicious in the game once you have been detected. If you hide after being spotted, they will start looking for you in pairs and be more on guard moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another unique enemy in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a Samurai. They cannot be tackled as you would with a regular enemy, as they are much more skilled. For example, players can’t assassinate them with a smoke bomb, and Samurai are likelier to deny their assassinations. Moreover, Samurais will also slice bushes when searching for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassination Denial is also a new system, where an enemy is denoted with a white colour if they are an instant kill, a yellow colour if you need to deal some damage, and a red colour if the enemy will completely deny your assassination attempt.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-yasuke-s-stealth-features">Yasuke’s Stealth Features</h3>



<p>Last but not least are Yasuke’s stealth mechanics in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Yasuke is a samurai, a character that players should pick for a more aggressive approach. However, players can be stealthy if they use their bow and start picking enemies off from a distance. Yasuke can get behind enemies and deal swift finishing blows with his melee weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cost to show your game at Opening Night Live is set to get even more expensive for studios. According to a new report from German outlet <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/gamescom/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-werbespots-preise-211124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesWirtschaft</a>, Geoff Keighley’s annual event at Gamescom is charging up to nearly $500,000 for an spot on Opening Night Live 2025.</p>



<p>The report claims that prices start at $146,800 (€140,000) for a 30-second ad and rises to roughly $487,506 (€465,000) for a 180-second (three-minute) ad, based on currency conversion rates as of writing. The three-minute ad is one of two new tiers offered for 2025 along with a 150-second ad for roughly $419,360 (€400,000). In total, there are six different tiers to choose from, all more expensive than the reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-costs-up-to-288000-to-show-your-game-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost for the same amount of time</a> in 2024. Across the board, the increases range from 17.4% up to 21.9%.</p>



<p>Opening Night Live 2025 is scheduled to air August 19, 2025, the day before Gamescom 2025 officially begins.</p>







<ul>
<li><strong>30 seconds</strong>: $146,776 or €140,000 ($125,000 or €115,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>60 seconds:&nbsp;</strong>$214,922 or €205,000 ($179,600 or €165,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>90 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$283,068 or €270,000 ($234,000 or €215,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>120 seconds:&nbsp;</strong>$351,214 or €335,000 ($288,000 or €265,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>150 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$419,360 or €400,000 </li>



<li><strong>180 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$487,506 or €465,000 </li>
</ul>



<p>It’s worth noting that neither Keighley himself nor the Gamescom promoters have confirmed these prices. Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out for comment, though no response has been received as of publishing.</p>

<p>Trophies and Achievements galore await you in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and the shooter has a ton of optional objectives for you to complete from killing a certain amount of enemies to being a collecting completionist.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> arrives 15 years after the last iteration in the first-person shooter saga. Aside from some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-fix-input-lag-in-stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">input lag issues</a> and other problems, the reception for Stalker 2 has generally been quite positive. </p>



<p>It offers another guided tour of Chornobyl’s metaphorical house of horrors, and you are rewarded for extracurricular activities in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone—courtesy of the extensive Stalker 2 Achievement and Trophy list.</p>
