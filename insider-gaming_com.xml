<p>Dota 2 is arguably the biggest esports in the world. With The International giving out millions of dollars every year, we have seen many new Dota players emerge into the scene. Dreaming of being one of those players? Well, you better start off playing ranked. </p>



<p>Here is a list of all the Dota 2 ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-dota-2-ranks">All Dota 2 Ranks</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Herald</strong></li>



<li><strong>Guardian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Crusader</strong></li>



<li><strong>Archon</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legend</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ancient</strong></li>



<li><strong>Divine</strong></li>



<li><strong>Immortal</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-dota-2-matchmaking-rating-mmr-explained">How to Rank Up in Dota 2 | Matchmaking Rating (MMR) Explained</h2>



<p>Hitting the rank of Immortal in Dota 2 is incredibly difficult for any competitor, even the best. The game’s ranking system follows a Matchmaking Rating (MMR) system, which grants players MMR as they progress through the ranks. </p>



<p>To rank up, players will have to participate in ranked matches, winning games and more. </p>



<h4 id="h-all-dota-2-ranks-and-their-mmr">All Dota 2 Ranks and Their MMR:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Herald:</strong> 1 – 769 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Guardian: </strong>770- 1539 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Crusader:</strong> 1540 – 2309 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Archon:</strong> 2310 – 3079 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Legend:</strong> 3080 – 3849 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Ancient:</strong> 3850 – 4619 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Divine:</strong> 4620 – 5620 MMR.</li>



<li><strong>Immortal:</strong> 5620+ MMR.</li>
</ul>



<p>When first beginning to play ranked, new accounts will have their MMR calculated after playing a series of matches. They will then be put into rank and awarded their first medal. </p>



<p>No one, however, will start in Immortal. With each loss, you will lose MMR, potentially dropping in rank. However, those playing core roles in matches (carry, mid-lane) will receive more MMR per win than those playing support roles (off-lane, soft support, hard support).</p>



<p>All Ranks, excluding Immortal, are split up into five parts. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-ranked">What is ranked?</h2>



<p>Ranked play is a special competitive mode in Dota 2 (and many other games) where players compete against one another, climbing a specialized ranked system. While the actual ranked system does not reward players outside of in-game rewards and bragging rights, many pro players still make sure to flex their high ranks amongst others.</p>



<p>With Dota 2 having such a large skill gap, it can be incredibly difficult and daunting for new players to attempt an Immortal run, but it is still entirely possible.</p>



<p>Will you be attempting to hit the Immortal rank in Dota 2?</p>

<p>By now, we’ve all heard or witnessed the atrocity that they’re calling the Borderlands movie. It receives staggeringly low reviews from critics and viewers alike, with low single-digit ratings for the most part. But apparently, it wasn’t all bad. According to Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, the live-action film didn’t hurt the video game franchise, but it actually helped significantly.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-was-disappointing-but-didnt-hurt-at-all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Zelnick said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Obviously that movie was disappointing. That said, it actually sold more catalog. So, I don’t think it hurt at all, if anything I think it may have helped a little bit. It does highlight something that I’ve spoken about many times which is the difficulty of bringing our intellectual property to another medium.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, by “catalog,” Zelnick refers to the collection of video games within the franchise, such as Borderlands 2, Tales From the Borderlands, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Essentially, the hype surrounding the film and people actually viewing it in theaters caused a significant rise in video game sales. People saw the movie, wanted more of the genuine article, and went to play the video games instead of re-watching the bomb film a second time. </p>



<p>If you saw the film and were one of the many who decided the video games were more your style, welcome! You should start by playing Borderlands 2, as it’s universally considered one of the best titles in the franchise. I didn’t mind the gameplay in Borderlands 3, but the writing and dialogue left me cringing more frequently than I’d typically like.</p>

<p>Take-Two Interactive held its earnings call for Q2 2025 on Wednesday, and with it came an update on the development of Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/9aa55113-4f45-4264-8ff6-822353eddcd8">press release</a> for the earnings, it was said, once again, that the game will release in fall 2025. </p>



<p>The small update, which many won’t view as much of an update at all, continues the regular messaging from the company on the state of GTA 6. Over the last few months, Take-Two has continued to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-reaffirms-fall-2025-release-date-for-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirm people</a> that GTA 6 is scheduled for a fall 2025 release date. </p>



<p>As far as when a new trailer could be revealed or a more concrete release date announcement, the release didn’t mention that. Comments from Take-Two CEO Straus Zelnick will be added during the call.</p>



<p>Do you still think GTA 6 will release in 2025? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Following the closure of Roll7 and Intercept Games, Take-Two also revealed they sold off indie game publisher Private Division, but didn’t specify the buyer. Along with the sale of the company itself, Take-Two also sold off the publisher’s entire catalog of live and unreleased titles. However, they stated they would continue supporting No Rest for the Wicked, the recent Private Division-published action RPG from developer Moon Studios.</p>



<p>The publisher’s sale comes as part of the Take-Two earnings results, in which they said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are grateful for the contributions that the Private Division team has made to our company and are confident that they will continue to achieve success in their new home.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Supposedly, while the buyer remains unknown, a private equity firm did show interest in Private Division beforehand.</p>



<p>Private Division, as a publishing company, was behind multiple hit releases and upcoming games we had on our radar, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tales of the Shire</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Outer Worlds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kerbal Space Program 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>OlliOlliWorld</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hades</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>After 11 years, Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 5 continues to do well with players. Not only is it the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-stream-most-popular-in-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most popular game on stream</a>, but GTA 5’s sales continue to reach milestones.</p>



<p>During its <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest earnings call</a> on November 6, Take-Two Interactive announced that GTA 5 sales have passed 205 million copies in its 11-year lifespan. That total is up by five million from the 200 million copies announced during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings.</p>







<p>As a whole, the GTA franchise has sold over 435 million copies.</p>



<p>In addition to the sales success of GTA 5 and elsewhere, Take-Two praised GTA Online, which continued to be a major point for the company despite its age. According to the company, GTA Online continues to be one of the “largest contributors” to their net bookings despite expectations of a decline.</p>

<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that GTA Online has continued to “outperform expectations” thanks to updates and “sustained engagement”.</p>

<p>Clay is an essential resource in Stardew Valley. While it isn’t used in the Community Center bundles or as gifts to the villagers, it is still used in construction and crafting. It is one of the most overlooked resources, as it isn’t prevalent like stone, wood, and fiber. Let us show you how to obtain clay quickly in your Stardew Valley playthrough!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-clay-in-stardew-valley">How to Get Clay in Stardew Valley</h2>



<p>Clay can be obtained in multiple ways. The tricky-to-find resource can be found by:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tilling dirt (on your farm, throughout Pelican Town, and within the mines)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tilling sand on the beach</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tilling Artifact spots</strong></li>



<li><strong>When opening Geodes at Clint’s shop</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mining clay nodes at the Ginger Island Dig Site</strong></li>



<li><strong>As a gift from Jas, Vincent, or Leo during the Feast of the Winter Star</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vincent sells clay at the Desert Festival shop for a single Calico Egg</strong></li>



<li><strong>Your pet dog may gift you clay once it reaches maximum friendship</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While some of these methods are purely chance, like characters or pets gifting the resource to you, others take more work. For example, tilling dirt, sand, and artifact spots will take you time, and it’s not guaranteed you’ll find clay with every use of your hoe. Of course, tilling the land for clay becomes easier as you upgrade your hoe to higher qualities and can till multiple spaces simultaneously. Out of all the places to dig and till for clay, it is recommended to do so in the mines, as tilling the dirt there can also yield cave carrots, and bombs can be placed to help unearth things faster in the mines.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-you-need-clay-in-stardew-valley">Why You Need Clay in Stardew Valley</h2>



<p>As mentioned, clay isn’t used in any Community Center bundles and isn’t a liked gift. So why bother with it? Well, it’s vital for crafting and construction, of course! To build a silo, an essential building on your farm, if you intend to keep animals, you’ll need ten clay, 100 stone, five copper bars, and 100 gold.</p>



<p>In addition to the construction of a silo, clay is also needed to craft: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Quality Retaining Soil</strong></li>



<li><strong>Garden Pots</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brick Floors</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fiber Seeds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Deluxe Retaining Soil</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bone Mills</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dehydrator</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Some of these items aren’t essential for a playthrough, but you’ll find they can make life on your farm much more manageable.</p>

<p>Listen, I know! You’re going to loudly proclaim in the comments that no one should ever pre-order any game. Well, I’m here to tell you that I already pre-ordered Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and I know that, based on the insurmountable hype surrounding the game, I’m not alone. Thankfully, if you do pre-purchase your copy, you’ll receive a handful of Stalker 2 pre-order bonus items that should give you an adequate headstart in the wasteland!</p>
