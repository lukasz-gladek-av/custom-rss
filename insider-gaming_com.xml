<p>Friday evening in Budapest has proven to be chaos incarnate, with two favorites falling out of the StarLadder Major. In two fell swoops, MOUZ and FURIA were eliminated from the running by FaZe Clan and NAVI, respectively. These upsets have blown the Major wide open, and the handful of teams remaining will now prepare for a weekend that will end with a trophy being lifted.</p>



<p>Find out how today’s action unfolded below.</p>

<h2 id="h-budapest-major-playoffs-are-electrifying">Budapest Major Playoffs Are Electrifying</h2>



<p>FURIA arrived in top form, but Natus Vincere managed to stay resilient, dismantling the top-tier pick in a three-map thriller. It was the only series thus far in the playoffs bracket to go beyond a two-map sweep, with FURIA at least doing <strong>something </strong>to try and stay in the running.</p>



<p>The fixture gave way to some stunning moments, such as a scenario that unfolded to allow w0nderful to secure a massive quad-kill accolade.</p>



<p>In the MOUZ vs. FaZe Clan space, a two-point sweep that wasn’t even close was all that was needed to eliminate MOUZ from the tournament. The second map, Inferno, was a whitewash, with FaZe producing a staggering 13-2 scoreline and drowning MOUZ out in a short series.</p>



<p>In the post-match coverage, FaZe Clan’s broky was praised for putting up some big numbers.</p>



<p>The bracket goes forward with two huge matches airing tomorrow:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit vs. Team Vitality</li>



<li>Natus Vincere vs. FaZe Clan</li>
</ul>

<p>As it does every year, The Game Awards made some huge announcements during the 2025 edition. Geoff Keighley stood there and rifled off some big trailers, game reveals, and Insider Gaming has picked out six headline moments.</p>



<p>The annual end-of-year celebration of all things gaming is in the books once more. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> presented nearly 30 awards and showcased many game reveals, new trailers, and much more. Throughout the course of the nearly four-hour show, some segments happened that are sure to live long in the memory.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-the-game-awards-2025-announcements-amp-game-reveals">Best The Game Awards 2025 Announcements &amp; Game Reveals</h2>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Fate Of The Old Republic</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Arcanaut Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Who saw this one coming? The Star Wars community has spent years waiting impatiently for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/old-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-images-appear-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>. Reports have gone back and forth on whether the remake is happening, but what everyone does know is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-shockingly-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in development</a>. It’s a spiritual successor to KOTOR and promises to capture the essence and magic of why KOTOR is so popular.</p>







<p>The bad news is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-years-away-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is likely years away from release</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-divinity">Divinity</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Larian Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Larian Studios was quite cunning in the lead-up to TGA 2025. The company proclaimed that there were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-divinity-original-sin-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no current plans for Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>. Evidently, this was the case. This didn’t stop the developer from solving the frustrating mystery of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards Statue</a> by announcing Divinity—a new entry in the franchise.</p>



<p>Despite Baldur’s Gate 3’s success, Larian is shifting gears back to the series that launched the company to success. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity announcement</a> certainly was a bombshell.</p>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Plenty of Resident Evil Requiem has been seen already. The game isn’t a secret, and its release date is getting ever closer. So why does it make this list? Confirmation was finally revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon Kennedy</a> is one of the two playable characters. Alyssa Ashcroft will handle the survival-horror and puzzle-based sections of gameplay, whereas Leon is an ass-kicking machine.</p>



<p>Over 20 years after we first saw Leon being chased by chainsaw-wielding freaks, it’s fitting that the former RPD officer now gets his own eviscerating machine.</p>



<h3 id="h-control-2-resonant">Control 2: Resonant</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Control 2 has been a constant rumor with even more constant buzz, and TGA 2025 finally revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-resonant-confirmed-the-game-awards-remedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control: Resonant</a>. Original protagonist Jesse Faden looks to be taking a backseat in Resonant as a new character gets to experience the usual mind-bending chaos associated with the FBC. It looks just as trippy and psychologically challenging as the first title, and Remedy has a certain penchant for infusing the weird with the wondrous.</p>



<h3 id="h-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Crystal Dynamics</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s always a shame when something leaks ahead of time (the irony is not lost here), and news came out before The Game Awards 2025 that two new Tomb Raider games were about to be unveiled. In a shock to no one, this is what happened. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Tomb Raider Remake</a> of the first TR game was shown, and we also got wind of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-catalyst-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>—a completely brand-new entry in the franchise. There has been nothing on the Lara gaming front since 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and now she’s pulling double-duty!</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Fuse Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Galactic Racer was revealed at The Game Awards</a>, and the world felt like a better place. Racing games aren’t as frequent and in abundance as they once were, and you’ll have to dust off the cobwebs to find the last Star Wars racing game. Galactic Racer is being made by Fuse Games—comprised of devs who’ve worked on Burnout and Need for Speed games—and this should give everyone…A New Hope.</p>
