<p>It has been revealed that Call of Duty is getting a crossover that wasn’t on many prediction slates for 2025. On December 11, a <strong>Street Fighter collaboration </strong>is landing in Call of Duty Mobile, bringing four legendary characters from the fighting franchise into the first-person shooter world.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty x Street Fighter crossover will yield new Operators, a host of themed weapons linked to the Street Fighter universe, and more exclusive rewards for those participating in the event through December.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-street-fighter-come-to-call-of-duty">When Does Street Fighter Come to Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>Call of Duty Mobile fans can take advantage of the Street Fighter crossover starting December 11, when the Hero’s Collection Operator Series Armory opens up, officially introducing the Street Fighter characters to COD Mobile.</p>



<p>The lineup includes some of the most recognizable characters from the fighting game’s roster:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ryu</li>



<li>Chun-Li</li>



<li>Akuma</li>



<li>Cammy</li>
</ul>



<p>On December 13, the crossover will be expanded via the Champion’s Collection Weapon Series Armory, which introduces the unique weapon skins to bolster the collaboration.</p>



<p>It’s a bold crossover that nobody really anticipated, but it’s a welcome one nonetheless. Call of Duty Mobile is, without a doubt, the most expansive and popular COD title ever made, and it’s doing the live-service model perfectly compared to the annual releases of the core multiplayer shooters.</p>



<p>This collaboration heralds the game’s sixth anniversary, and it’s the latest in a <strong>very </strong>long line of crossover events. In recent history, we’ve seen the likes of Gundam, Nier, Rambo, and even sporting icons like Lionel Messi make their way into the Call of Duty Mobile universe.</p>



<p>Will you be participating in Call of Duty Mobile’s Street Fighter crossover? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The all-new Gentle Mates CDL roster has stepped up and shocked the scene to secure a win in Kaysan’s $50,000 Black Ops 7 tournament. The Kaysan Showdown VIII was the perfect opener for the Black Ops 7 season, pulling together four teams with unparalleled prospects for the upcoming year of competitive play.</p>



<p>It was FaZe Vegas, LA Thieves, OpTic Texas, and Gentle Mates that took to the stage, but when the dust settled, it was a surprise for many to see Gentle Mates standing with the trophy (virtually, of course).</p>







<h2 id="h-an-unpredictable-season">An Unpredictable Season</h2>



<p>On paper, nobody would have thought that Gentle Mates would beat the other three teams. You’ve got the back-to-back-to-back world champions in OpTic Texas, the cash-backed ‘super team’ in LA Thieves, and FaZe Vegas, a new, rebranded roster with serious potential.</p>



<p>Gentle Mates <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gentlemates-cdl-roster-revealed-2026-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled its new roster</a> just days ago, revealing the squad that will carry the hopes of the French organization through the 2026 CDL season. If Kaysan’s tournament is anything to go by, those hopes are <strong>high</strong>.</p>



<p>The clips emerging from the tournament, which was an online event, were white-hot, showcasing a blistering Gentle Mates side that leaned heavily into the fast-flowing nature of Black Ops 7, which launched last month to a mixed reception at best.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gentle Mates is going all in with this Call of Duty League roster through the 2026 season. Last year was a poor showing for the organization, which only just surfaced in the COD space after acquiring the LAG spot and rebranding for the impending season.</p>



<p>The new roster signing, a jersey refresh, and promoting some new sponsorships, like a clean Scuf controller variety, are all indications of Gentle Mates’ investment in Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The <strong>VALORANT Game Changers Championship</strong>, a massive $500,000 tournament, has wrapped in South Korea, leaving Team Liquid Brazil the victor over all comers. Ten of the best women’s and marginalized-gender teams came together in Seoul to fight for a considerable prize, and in the closing moments of the tournament, it all came down to two rival teams.</p>



<p>The Grand Final was a dramatic showdown between Team Liquid Brazil and Shopify Rebellion Gold, two of the most capable squads in the Game Changers scene. What unravelled was one hell of a VALORANT series.</p>



<h2 id="h-team-liquid-secures-180-000-in-seoul">Team Liquid Secures $180,000 in Seoul</h2>



<p>Shopify Rebellion Gold broke into the Grand Final after a defiant lower-bracket run, meeting Team Liquid, the tournament’s dominant upper-bracket organisation sitting on a white-hot streak. The best-of-five final lived up to the expectations set by fans, with both sides trading maps as the series unravelled.</p>



<p>Shopify led the charge with an easy win on Haven, but the series was set to go the distance, and it went down to the wire on the final map.</p>



<p>Team Liquid’s win denied Shopify a third consecutive Game Changers Championship win, and it was a redemption of sorts for the former team, having collapsed against Shopify during the 2023 Championship Final.</p>



<p>Beyond the Grand Final, the Game Changers tournament in Seoul represented the power of the Americas in the VALORANT space. MIBR GC and KRU Blaze brought up the rear, securing a third- and fourth-place finish, respectively, both of which hail from South America.</p>



<p>Team Liquid walks away from Seoul with the trophy and $180,000 in earnings, which is a nice payday after a hard-fought tournament.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/turok-origins-release-in-2026-dev-claims/</link>
            <guid>1368892</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Turok Origins was given a short but sweet reveal trailer by Saber Interactive almost a year ago, and since then, things have run quiet. We’ve got a few details about the game, and fans of the title have busied themselves pulling every shred of information out of that trailer, but until now, Saber has remained mostly silent on the topic.</p>



<p>Recently, one developer’s profile was uncovered on LinkedIn, bearing a clear indication that Turok Origins, which doesn’t have a release window at present, will launch in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-turok-origins-coming-out">When is Turok Origins Coming Out?</h2>



<p>If you head over to the Turok Origins website, you’ll see that it can be wishlisted on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series XS, and Steam, but there’s no indication of a release window – <strong>not even a year</strong>.</p>



<p>It has been a fair while since Turok Origins was revealed, and fans are wondering when this all-new dinosaur-slaying epic could drop.</p>



<p>It was recently discovered on a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/javi-bermejo-969b1a181/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer’s LinkedIn profile</a> that Turok Origins is ‘forthcoming’ in 2026:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The developer, a sound designer, also worked on Saber’s Radikal Fighters and is supporting the development of an ‘unannounced project’ at the studio.</p>



<p>Turok Origins is said to take players across various worlds as they explore a multitude of biomes throughout an immersive, ‘epic story’ that can be experienced either alone or with friends. The game has a diverse array of weapons and abilities to uncover, and it can reportedly be digested from both a first- and third-person perspective.</p>



<p>Here’s the snapshot trailer, in case you’re interested:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Short In-Development Video of GTA 6 Has Surfaced Online]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-video-in-development-grand-theft-auto-rockstar/</link>
            <guid>1368811</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A small yet highly credible video clip of GTA 6 has surfaced online. While it is from an in-development build, it does give fans an interesting insight as to how the game will look, gameplay-wise.</p>



<p>As one of 2026’s biggest upcoming games, Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto 6 has a lot riding on it. Through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countless delays</a>, fans have been eagerly anticipating driving and robbing the state of Leonida for almost 10 years. Unfortunately, the trailers have seemingly only shown cutscenes, with raw gameplay yet to be put on display. That is, however, until now, as a former Rockstar employee’s demo reel has surfaced featuring a small video snippet of potential gameplay from GTA 6.</p>







<h2 id="h-former-rockstar-employee-s-video-portfolio-includes-gta-6-gameplay">Former Rockstar Employee’s Video Portfolio Includes GTA 6 Gameplay</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>An ACTUAL GTA 6 leak has surfaced:</p><p>A former Rockstar employee has included GTA 6 development footage in their demo reel, this shows off a few animations for exiting bicycles and Monster Trucks.</p><p>Ocean Drive is clearly visible in the second clip</p><p> <a href="https://t.co/tZNhtByYrC">pic.twitter.com/tZNhtByYrC</a></p></div>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SynthPotato</a> found the clip from a former Rockstar employee’s demo reel portfolio. The name of the employee was, of course, not disclosed. Still, the reel has several animations from other Rockstar games like Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, furthering its validity. From the looks of it, it seems the employee worked on a bit of GTA 6 prior to leaving.</p>



<p>As for what the clip is, it’s not a lot. The video, <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available above</a>, simply shows a character (unsure if NPC or player) dismounting from vehicles. While the first half shows a bike, the second has a render of Vice City, alongside what appears to be Lucia, one of GTA 6’s playable characters. It looks like it showcases how many ways the player character can dismount from a car, which is a rather neat detail.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the video is all fans have to go off of for GTA 6’s gameplay. With the recent November 19th, 2026, delay, it may be some time before more is shown. However, if the level of detail for even the simplest of vehicle dismounts is any indication, it might be the most realistic entry yet.</p>

<p>A new Chapter has arrived in Fortnite with the launch of Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings the customary refresh of weapons and equipment found in the loot pool alongside it.</p>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 7 kicked off on the back of the huge Zero Point live event, attended by over 10 million players, which saw stars from the likes of Star Wars, Marvel, DC Comics, The Simpsons, and K-Pop Demon Hunters unite to fend off the Dark Presence.</p>



<p>Spring Break has now arrived in Fortnite as a result, and Insider Gaming has all the details on the new and unvaulted weapons in Chapter 7 Season 1.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Glide time. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are eight new weapons and pieces of equipment added in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including a new mobility item—Wingsuits.</strong></p>



<p>The importance of Wingsuits early in the season is vital following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destruction of the Battle Bus</a>, as surfing the waves onto the island provide limited landing spots. If you get your hands on a Wingsuit early, traversing the map becomes much easier and you can head to further locations to hunt for loot, where there’s likely to be less competition.</p>



<p>A full list of the new weapons and equipment found in Fortnite this season are below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Iron Pump Shotgun</li>



<li>Twin Hammer Shotguns</li>



<li>Deadeye Assault Rifle</li>



<li>Holo Rush SMG</li>



<li>Vengeful Sniper Rifle</li>



<li>Arc-Lightning Gun</li>



<li>Forsaken Vow Blade</li>



<li>Wingsuit</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-unvaulted-weapons-amp-equipment-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Unvaulted Weapons &amp; Equipment in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>Five weapons have been unvaulted for Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, alongside the return of the All Terrain Kart and a host of healing items.</strong></p>



<p>The likes of Chug Jugs, Shield Kegs, Med Kits, Bandages, and Shield Potions remain available, while players in Zero Build can continue to find Shield Bubble Jr and Port-a-Fort items to utilize.</p>



<p>On the weapon scene, the return of the Enforcer AR provides options from mid-to-long range, while there’s plenty of options for short-range combat with the Dual Micro SMGs and Tactical Pistol.</p>



<p>All the unvaulted weapons and equipment in Fortnite this season are below.</p>



<ul>
<li>All Terrain Kart</li>



<li>Enforcer AR</li>
