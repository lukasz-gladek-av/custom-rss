<p>It’s been a while since a new chapter brought the nightmare-inducing Huggy Wuggy to the fore, which is why you should check out Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s release date and start times to let some new horrors fester.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a> is rumored to be the final part of the saga. Whether this ends up being the case remains to be seen, but one thing’s for sure: You shouldn’t miss out on Chapter 5. The Prototype is there to explore in its entirety, and it’s not long until you can do so.</p>

<p><strong>Mob Entertainment has issued a February 18 release date for Poppy Playtime Chapter 5.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been on this journey to this point, number one, you’re brave, and number two, this could be the culmination of a five-year journey that has seen hilariously evil-looking Poppy Playtime merch appear all over the world and capture the minds and haunt the dreams of everyone in that time.</p>

<p>Huggy Wuggy has been anything but cute and adorable in that time (maybe the most misleading name in history), and it’s back to chase you around The Prototype.</p>



<p>The new chapter is scheduled for February 18, so prepare yourself.</p>

<p>The director of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 has confirmed that the visuals will not be lowered for the multiplatform release. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade has already been released for Xbox and Switch 2, and the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-xbox-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth</a> has also been confirmed for both platforms. The developers have announced that FFVII Remake Part 3 will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-part-3-confirmed-for-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on additional platforms</a> as well. However, players have expressed concerns that optimizing for lower-spec systems might compromise the graphics quality. The director has now addressed these concerns and assured players.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-multiplatform-release-won-t-impact-the-visuals">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Multiplatform Release Won’t Impact the Visuals</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 director Naoki Hamaguchi said the multiplatform release would not affect the graphics. Hamaguchi stated, “our decision to go&nbsp;multiplatform&nbsp;with&nbsp;the FFVII Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment.&nbsp;Our development structure simply&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;work that way&nbsp;to begin with.&nbsp;…I suppose&nbsp;I’ll&nbsp;just have to keep saying&nbsp;it.” </p>



<p>The director split it into 4 aspects to explain how quality won’t be affected. First, he stated that, in terms of ROM, none of the platforms is a concern. Coming to RAM, the Switch 2 has “ample” memory, whereas the Xbox Series S has its limits, but they optimize&nbsp;for&nbsp;each&nbsp;platform individually. </p>



<p>Coming to CPUs, the studio doesn’t&nbsp;“design the game to fully saturate a high-end CPU at 30fps”; instead, they “scale density elements,&nbsp;like&nbsp;increasing the number of NPCs in towns”. Lastly, for the GPU, the director stated that assets are created for&nbsp;high-end environments first, then optimised for each platform’s constraints. The highest-end environment is PC, PS5, and PS5 Pro, which are considered mid-range platforms. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 is sticking to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-stick-to-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unreal Engine 4</a>.

<p>ArtPlay and Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement’s creative director, Shutaro Ida, has passed away at 52 from cancer. </p>



<p>Announced through the official <a href="https://x.com/ArtplayEN/status/2023213425707647237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) account of ArtPlay, their creative director, Shutaro Ida, passed away on February 10, 2026, after a one-and-a-half-year battle with cancer. Shutaro has been a significant figure in the gaming industry, not only in ArtPlay games but also in popular franchises such as Metal Gear Solid and Castlevania. </p>







<h2 id="h-bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-be-completed-to-shutaro-s-legacy-and-vision">Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement be Completed to Shutaro’s Legacy and Vision</h2>



<p>The last project on which ArtPlay’s creative director was working was Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement. Shutaro was leading this project, and it has now entered its final stages. The development studio has promised to “carry forward his legacy and strive with all our strength to complete this work worthy of his vision and name.”</p>



<p>For those unaware, Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is a 2.5D metroidvania title, set in 16th-century England. It features a gothic atmosphere with strategic battles, crafting, and exploration. The game features a new buddy system for the series, allowing players to play as both Leo and Alex to battle Demon Lord Elias’s reign of terror. </p>



<p>The title also features the series’s largest map yet, with a day-and-night cycle that includes dawn, day, dusk, and night. Players can learn new and powerful abilities as they progress, plus there is also a lot of crafting and cooking, along with customisation that can change the players’ attributes. </p>
