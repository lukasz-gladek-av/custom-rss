<p>Promo A is likely the first of many promotional sets in Pokémon TCG Pocket. I get you want to focus your efforts on collecting the main cards, but certain promo cards might not be around forever. The cards’ obtainability might get harder over time, meaning you should set your sights on unlocking Promo A Cards faster than a Rapidash.</p>



<p>You might find yourself overwhelmed by Pokémon TCG Pocket’s early release content. The card-collecting title is not content to rest on its laurels though—oh no. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-tcg-pocket-secret-missions-rewards-how-to-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secret Missions</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-tcg-pocket-level-up-rewards-xp-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level-up rewards</a> easily eat into your time, and even more is sure to be spent trying to collect all the Promo A Cards.</p>



<p>We’ve got information on every Pokémon TCG Pocket Promo A Card, how to get them, and much more.</p>







<figure><figcaption>There’s quite a few to catch. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s thought <strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket has 24 Promo A Cards to collect</strong>.</p>



<p>There’s a hint of trepidation about this figure because not every card has been released yet—the available information regarding Promo A is based on released cards, and datamined cards. With suggestions the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Pokémon Pocket expansion</a> is a while away yet, more Promo A Cards could be added later on.</p>







<p>Here’s a closer look at every Promo A Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket and the conditions required to unlock each one. Thanks to <a href="https://www.serebii.net/tcgpocket/promo-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Serebii</a> for clarification on a couple of the remaining cards.</p>

<p>A number of employees at Marvel Rivals and Destiny: Rising developer NetEase Games have been arrested, according to a new report.</p>



<p>According to Chinese outlet <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/category/industrynews/D1r2qIXu83HaLD5q.html">Leifeng</a> — with additional context via <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/netease-says-police-detained-executives-for-alleged-bribery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg Law</a> — nine employees, including two senior executives, were arrested for allegedly laundering money.  </p>



<p>Per the report, the contract value appears to be worth 2 billion yuan, which is just about $278.6 million. In actual money, it’s a  bit lower at 800 million to 1 billion yuan, or $111.4-$139.3 million.</p>



<p>The two executives implicated in the case are Xiang Lang and Jin Yuchen. Xiang served as the head of NetEase’s esports division while Jin was the head of the company’s publishing side.  Neither executive is still with the company.</p>



<p>Names of other employees at the company weren’t made available. At least one who was questioned by outlet <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/netease-responds-to-the-rumors-of-corruption-saying-things-are-under-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yicaiglobal</a> has denied any claims of money laundering. </p>



<p>The allegedly corruption took place within the segments of the company the two executives worked, the company said. They also confirmed that 27 different companies have been blacklisted due to links to fraud. </p>



<p>Other details of the incidents couldn’t be shared due to there still being an active investigation. More information will be provided at a later date.</p>
