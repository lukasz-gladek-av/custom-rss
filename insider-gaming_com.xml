<p>The lead on Final Fantasy 9 has revealed that the PlayStation 2’s CPU was so powerful that it raised military concerns. </p>



<p>Talks about the Final Fantasy 9 Remake have completely fizzled out since a reliable insider revealed that the project “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-on-ice-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be on ice</a>“. However, as players wait for official confirmation, the lead has shared an insight from the PlayStation 2 era, revealing that the CPU’s power was no joke back then. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-2-s-cpu-was-so-overpowered-that-it-led-to-export-restrictions">PlayStation 2’s CPU Was ‘So Overpowered’ That It Led to Export Restrictions </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-9-lead-says-the-ps2-was-so-so-overpowered-its-cpu-sparked-military-concerns-so-he-struggled-to-get-an-emergency-dev-kit-during-his-stay-in-hawaii-it-was-a-very-difficult-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Final Fantasy 9’s Kazuhiko Aoki revealed the difficulties he faced when trying to test the game on the PlayStation 2 due to its CPU. Aoki revealed that, towards the end of his stay in Hawaii, there were discussions about his receiving PlayStation 2 testing equipment to see whether Final Fantasy 9 could run on the console. However, the console’s CPU was “so overpowered” that there was a “possibility that it would be used for military purposes,” so there were restrictions on the console’s export. </p>



<p>But, after taking “quite some time” and the team facing a “very difficult situation,” the console was finally delivered to the Final Fantasy 9 dev team. </p>

<p>The Xbox Developer Direct is just weeks away, and Xbox has confirmed the first three games that will appear at the annual event.</p>



<p>Airing on January 22 at 1pm ET/10am/6pm UK, the Xbox Developer Direct gives players a look at upcoming first-party games from Xbox Game Studios as well as some third-party titles. Last year featured games liked Ninja Gaiden 4, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, among others. And with Xbox celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, Microsoft is promising fans a “incredible year”, starting with the Developer Direct.</p>



<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-2026/?ocid=Event_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_1.8.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox announced</a> that Fable, Forza Horizon 6, and Beast of Reincarnation would receive expended looks during the event.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-fans-will-see-at-xbox-s-developer-direct">What Fans Will See At Xbox’s Developer Direct</h2>



<p>For Fable, Playground Games is giving fans the first extended look at the game that’s scheduled to release this year. Forza Horizon 6, also from Playground Games, will receive its gameplay reveal after first being announced at Tokyo Game Show last year. </p>



<p>Lastly, Beast of Reincarnation comes from Pokémon developer Game Freak. The game is an Action RPG featuring “one person, one dog”. During the event, Game Freak will “reveal details of our protagonist Emma’s innovative plant manipulation actions and gameplay with her canine companion, Koo.”</p>



<p><strong>“Presented by the game creators themselves, Developer_Direct will once again give you an inside look at not just the games, but the studios working to bring them to life,”</strong> Joe Skrebels, Xbox Wire editor-in-chief, said. <strong>“Fittingly for Xbox’s 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary year, that includes the return of some of our most legendary franchises, which rub shoulders with a brand new title from one of Japan’s most beloved studios.</strong>“</p>







<p>It’s expected that at least one more game will be shown during the event, though what the game will be is still anyone’s guess. The Xbox Developer Direct takes place on Thursday, January 22. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the event as it airs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The director of Final Fantasy 7 Remake has stated that he would rather see someone else lead the Final Fantasy 6 Remake, with him taking the support role instead. </p>



<p>A lot of new details about Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 have been revealed recently, including that the game’s experience is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a> and that the devs consider it a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-devs-are-considering-a-full-title-after-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full title after this instalment</a>. However, a remake has now been mentioned, and it’s none other than 1994’s Final Fantasy 6. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-director-would-like-to-see-a-new-creator-come-in">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Director Would Like to See a New Creator Come In</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbrBjFZabUE&amp;t=3s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamerBraves</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/while-final-fantasy-6-remake-would-be-a-dream-project-final-fantasy-7-remake-director-thinks-hed-rather-someone-else-lead-it-should-i-be-the-one-to-undertake-remaking-another-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), FF7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke about someone else leading Final Fantasy 6 Remake. Hamaguchi first spoke about how Final Fantasy 6 has been influential in his journey as a gamer, and that influence often comes through in his work. However, FF7 Remake didn’t include any elements of FF6 as they were following a set script. </p>



<p>Hamaguchi then went on to talk about how many fans have requested a remake of Final Fantasy 6. But, he has been leading the FF7 Remake for close to 10 years and is “now finally seeing basically the end of the tunnel.” He wonders whether he should be the one responsible for taking up another remake series after pouring so much time into remaking this project. </p>



<p>Hamaguchi then states that, rather than him being the lead, he wants to see a “new creator” take the lead position, and he can take a more supportive role, “sort of cheer them on”. </p>
