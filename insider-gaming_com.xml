<p>The first full Super Mario Galaxy Movie trailer is reportedly coming later this month. In fact, it could be coming within the next few weeks.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1985029599063843018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyTimeToShine</a>, a movie outlet with accurate reports in the past, the next trailer for the upcoming movie is set to premiere in theaters ahead of Wicked For Good on November 21. Originally, plans seemed to call for it to debut in theaters before Zootopia 2, which launches on November 26.</p>



<p>In addition to its theatrical showing, the outlet adds that it should appear online beforehand.</p>



<p>“The trailer will drop online before November 21st, and then make its theatrical debut with Wicked For Good,” they said. “That releases a week before Zootopia 2. It could still play before Zootopia 2, but that won’t be its official cinema debut.”</p>
