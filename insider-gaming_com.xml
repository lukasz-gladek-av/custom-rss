<p>The Marvel Rivals GB file size question is upon us. With so many different platforms to house superhero battles of titanic proportions, you need to know how much storage to keep free. We’ve got the lowdown on Marvel Rivals’ file size on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>



<p>Before you can have fun, we first need to know if you’re <em>allowed </em>to have fun. To play Marvel Rivals and Punish-er people, you need to have the necessary allocation of space. Whether it’s a PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC, it’s all the same. In today’s age of gaming, it’s not uncommon for games to exceed 100GB, which can mean sacrifices have to be made.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is a mighty game, so let’s see how much stress it places on your hardware.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-marvel-rivals-on-playstation-5">How Many GB is Marvel Rivals on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not bad. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals requires 36.58 GB of free space on a PlayStation 5 to let you install it and play it—at the time of writing.</strong></p>



<p>Round this up and call it 40 GB, which allows for future updates to increase the size anyway. All in all, I think 36 GB is quite generous, and with Call of Duty suffocating my PS5’s storage, this is a blessing.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-marvel-rivals-on-xbox-series-x-s">How Many GB is Marvel Rivals on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>On Xbox, Marvel Rivals requires 44.56 GB of empty storage space, and, again, this is before any updates potentially increase this figure.</strong></p>



<p>The information comes courtesy of <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/12/04/marvel-rivals-pre-load-is-up-on-xbox-install-size-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Era</a>, and it does mean players associated with the green brand need a little more free space than those on PlayStation—I’m not here to flame or cause any wars! If you do take umbrage with Xbox’s slightly higher GB requirements, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-cross-platform-crossplay-cross-progression-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals has crossplay</a>, so settle your score on the battlefield.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-marvel-rivals-on-pc">How Many GB is Marvel Rivals on PC?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s manageable. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A quick check of Steam shows Marvel Rivals needs 47.5 GB on PC, and this makes it the highest GB total of any platform.</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, I couldn’t tell you why PC players get it worse, but this is the case. Again, it’s less than 50 GB, and for an intense online multiplayer title with deep visuals and a ton of on-screen action, you can’t complain. If you are struggling, either uninstall a game or two or consider upgrading your internal storage.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-ban-united-states-closer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tiktok-is-now-one-step-closer-to-being-banned-in-the-united-states.1054143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-ban-united-states-closer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the United States, a federal appeals court has stood firm in the face of TikTok’s attempts to avoid a blanket ban across the nation. The court upheld a law that has been tossed to and fro for years, with US legislators seeking to <strong>force </strong>ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, into a divestiture in the United States.</p>



<p>Despite the application being used by more than 150 million Americans, lawmakers in the US have been trying to ban it for several years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-tiktok-be-banned-in-the-us">Will TikTok Be Banned in the US?</h2>



<p>This all stems from the United States’ insistence that ByteDance and TikTok are linked to the Chinese state, which the tech titan has actively denied on several occasions. </p>



<p>On the decision, Judge Douglas Ginsburg said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>TikTok’s millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication. That burden is attributable to China’s hybrid commercial threat to&nbsp;US national security, not to the US government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stated by the appeals court that the law being lobbied in an attempt to ban the app <em>“was the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents. It was carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary, and it was part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by the PRC.”</em></p>



<p>TikTok has some US forces in its pocket, though. In a statement, the deputy director of ACLU’s National Security, Patrick Toomey, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Banning TikTok blatantly violates the First Amendment rights of millions of Americans who use this app to express themselves and communicate with people around the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Presently, ByteDance has until January 19 to sell or divest TikTok’s assets in the United States – or face a nationwide ban. There’s a chance that President Biden could grant an extension to that deadline, and ByteDance has moved to challenge the decision of the appeals court in the Supreme Court, but it’s all still up in the air.</p>



<p>In the run-up to his successful election campaign, Donald Trump said he’d block the ban – four years after trying to actively shut the application down in the United States. However, if no extension lands and the Supreme Court refuses to help, Donald Trump won’t be in office before the deadline arrives, which renders his support moot.</p>



<p>Would you suffer if TikTok was banned in the United States? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The next game from the developers of It Takes Two is set to be unveiled soon with a release date just a few months after. According to known data minter <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-de-split-fiction-le-nouveau-jeu-video-a-venir-des-studios-hazelight-59733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, Hazelight Studios is preparing to announce its new game called Split Fiction.</p>



<p>Split Fiction will release on March 6, 2025, and will be available on PC and consoles. The specific consoles are currently unknown.</p>



<p>As far as an announcement of the game, the report says that its expected to happen this month. The likely place would be during The Game Awards on December 12. Why The Game Awards for the reveal? As billbil-kun pointed out, studio founder Josef Fares has made a history of announcing his games at the annual show.</p>







<p>“Josef Fares is a regular at this ceremony since he has reserved the announcements of his previous titles, such as&nbsp;A Way Out&nbsp;or&nbsp;It Takes Two, in past editions,” they said.</p>



<p>No other details about what Split Faction is were revealed, but those questions should be answered when the game is official revealed this month. Based on the name and the studio’s history, however, it could be assumed that Split Faction will be another co-op game</p>



<p>What do you think Hazelight Studios’ Split Faction will be about? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, Sony faced a new competitor to its PlayStation business when Microsoft launched the original Xbox. With that new competition sparked a genuine concern from Sony that led to them getting exclusive release rights to the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games of the era for the PlayStation 2.</p>



<p>Chris Deering, the former president of PlayStation Europe, recently spoke to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz,</a> and shed some light as to why  PlayStation wanted an exclusive agreement for GTA 3, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas.</p>



<p>“We were worried when we saw Xbox coming,” Deering said. “We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, ‘How would you like a special deal if you keep your next generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?’ And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn’t clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game.”</p>



<p>Deering added that PlayStation was “lucky” with the deal because of how it paid off for the company. </p>



<p>“It was very lucky for us,” he said. “And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid.”</p>







<p>The games ultimately saw a release on Xbox, but not before they became the best-selling games in the history of PS2. San Andreas became the best-selling PS2 game ever while the other two games, Vice City and GTA 3, became the third- and fifth-best selling games.</p>



<p>GTA 3 and Vice City released on Xbox on November 4, 2003 while San Andreas came to Xbox in June 2005.</p>
