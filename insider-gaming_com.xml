<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are teaming up at least one more time to deliver Elden Ring Nightreign’s anticipated The Forsaken Hollows DLC. If you thought you were done beating the night, you can think again.</p>



<p>The Nightreign updates and content haven’t stopped since launch. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-even-harder-in-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got even harder</a>—which was brutal—and then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-expansion-dlc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first expansion was revealed.</a> The developer has no intention for you to go outside and see the light anytime soon.</p>



<p>If you want Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows DLC release information, Insider Gaming has the dates and details you seek.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The night never ends. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign’s The Forspoken Hollows DLC is currently scheduled to release on December 4.</strong></p>



<p>This would be quite apt as it would be nearly one year on from Nightreign’s announcement at The Game Awards 2024. With no word on how much content Nightreign is expected to get—especially with FromSoftware resources being diverted to The Duskbloods—this could end up being the only major DLC expansion for Nightreign.</p>



<p>This guide will be updated if any late announcements indicate a delay to The Forspoken Hollows.</p>







<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc">Everything Included In Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows DLC</h2>



<p><strong>Nightreign’s The Forspoken Hollows DLC includes new playable characters, new bosses, a new Shifting Earth, and much more on top of this.</strong></p>



<p>FromSoftware is a master of its craft. It doesn’t short-change gamers and constantly provides value for money. These are the full details that have been provided for The Forspoken Hollows DLC so far:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This product is an additional&nbsp;DLC&nbsp;for&nbsp;ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN. It includes&nbsp;2 additional Nightfarers,&nbsp;2 new Bosses, and&nbsp;1 new Shifting Earth, and more.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The two new Nightfarers are <strong>Scholar </strong>and <strong>Undertaker</strong>. Here’s a brief explainer provided for each new character:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scholar:</strong> “An&nbsp;academic&nbsp;who walks the&nbsp;Lands Between.&nbsp;Boasting impressive arcane levels, he gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation.”</li>



<li><strong>Undertaker:</strong> “An&nbsp;abbess&nbsp;who was mandated to slay the&nbsp;Nightlord.&nbsp;Boasting impressive strength and faith, she sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency.”</li>
</ul>



<p>Whereas the Shifting Earth brings about gorgeous crystals in an enchanting locale. The rest remains to be seen on December 4. As usual, the content is playable on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>You can see tidbits of new content and a snippet of what’s to come in the official gameplay reveal trailer for the DLC expansion.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2’s next Premium Warbond, Python Commandos, drops on December 2, 2025; introducing a minigun, new weapons, stratagems, and more. </p>



<p>Premium Warbonds is the paid battle pass system in Helldivers 2, which provides players with exclusive content, including cosmetics, weapons, and more. A few months ago, we received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST</a> Legendary Warbond, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dust Devils</a> followed it next. Now, the next Premium Warbond has been announced, adding a highly requested weapon to the game: a minigun. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-weapons-and-stratagems">Helldivers 2 Python Commandos Premium Warbond Weapons and Stratagems </h2>



<p>Revealed through the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Helldivers 2 is getting one new weapon and three new stratagems thanks to the Python Commandos Premium Warbond. First up is the M-1000 Maxigun, a new minigun that has an ultra-high ammo capacity. Next up is the AX/FLAM-75 “Guard Dog” Hot Dog, which is a drone equipped with a flamethrower. It follows the player and coats their enemies with the fires of freedom. </p>



<p>Next up is another stratagem: the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool, essentially a chainsaw that can cut through trees and enemies. Last, we have the AR/GL-21 One-Two, which is a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher. It is a heavy weapon, but it deals heavy damage too, and basically puts two weapons in your primary slot. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-armors-and-capes">New Armors and Capes</h2>



<p>Let’s look at Helldivers 2: Python Commandos’ armors and capes; there are two new items in each category. The first armour is the RS-20 Constrictor light armor set, “the official uniform for the League of Patriotic Arm Wrestlers.” Next is RS-40 Best of Prey: “a heavy armor set patterned after legendary Helldiver, Ronald Mambo and his famously powerful and burly physique.” Both armours come equipped with Rock Solid passive, which makes the player more resistant to staggering and ragdolling attacks. </p>



<p>There are two new capes and coordinating player cards: Foe Rent Asunder, which is pre-tattered to give a battle-worn appearance, and Mark of the Constrictor, for Helldivers who strangle out any anti-democratic behavior they encounter.</p>



<h2 id="h-emotes-and-patterns">Emotes and Patterns</h2>



<p>Helldivers 2 Python Commandos Premium Warbond will add the Front-Leaning Rest Position emote, allowing players to “drop and give ‘em 20 anytime.” A new Chameleon Camo Pattern will also be included for FRV, Exosuit, Hellpod, and Shuttle.</p>
