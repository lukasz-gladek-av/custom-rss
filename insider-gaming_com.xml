<p>A development build for Titan Quest 2 has been leaked online. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://en.gamegpu.com/game/v-set-utekla-sborka-titan-quest-2-beta-3-1-for-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameGPU</a>, the build is a beta version of the game from early November. This build, dupped Beta 3.1, doesn’t feature any multiplayer aspects. Rather, it’s deployment was for internal testing of various gameplay features. You can watch some of the leaked gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVIDMQ_DNYQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">if you’d like</a> should it not be taken offline.</p>



<p>Obviously, it’s not a final build of the game and players should expect changes between what they see and what they’ll get.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to THQ Nordic and developer Grimlore Games for comment on the reported leak. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>



<p>A sequel to 2006’s Titan Quest, fans have been waiting nearly 20 years for the next game in the series. The mythology-themed action RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t feature any</a> pay-to-win or loot boxes, according to its developers.</p>



<p>“We do despise this with a passion,” Grimlore Games said. “There will never ever be any monetization mechanic in the game, urging you to spend money on any gameplay-related item to give anybody an advantage.”</p>



<p>Regarding its planned early access release, they added that they want players involved from the start, and for the game to “stand its own ground”.</p>



<p>“We want Titan Quest 2 to stand its own ground within the ARPG genre and we are convinced that there is only one way to pull it off: swarm intelligence,” they said.</p>



<p>Titan Quest 2 is scheduled to launch in sometime in 2025, and will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. An exact release date has yet to be announced. </p>

<p>The latest trailer for Atomfall, Rebellion’s upcoming open-world survival shooter, has emerged online. It’s a seven-minute trailer that explores the game’s core mechanics, including interactions with NPCs, crafting and upgrading items, traversing quests, and dealing with factions.</p>



<p>It’s a fantastic glimpse into this upcoming title, which is set to be released in March and is coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one. I was fortunate to play Atomfall at Gamescom and speak to the developers – I can attest to how stellar this game is.</p>



<p>And yes, it’s kind of like Fallout in the UK.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-atomfall">Prepare for Atomfall</h2>



<p>Atomfall is <strong>kind of </strong>like Fallout, but it’s perfectly unique. It’s set in the UK’s Lake District, which means it’s an idyllic game with gorgeous vistas and sumptuous, lush environments. It’s an alternate history game, taking the real-world Windscale Nuclear Disaster of 1957 and making it something otherworldly and almost ethereal.</p>



<p>From tussling with brutal ‘raiders’ in above-ground post-apocalyptic settlements to diving into twisted, horrifying bunkers, Atomfall promises to offer a varied and diverse experience. It’s all about survival, and that means that the typical mechanics you’d expect are present:</p>



<ul>
<li>Scavenging, buying, and bartering for resources</li>



<li>Upgrading and repairing weapons and other items</li>



<li>Looting and trading across the open world</li>



<li>Building a character that suits your playstyle</li>



<li>Managing weight, health, and tools</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>I’m a huge Fallout fan, and I’m mourning the immense weight on our plates until Fallout 5 comes out. While Atomfall isn’t technically a <strong>fully </strong>post-apocalyptic game set in a nuclear wasteland, it’s damn close. Most importantly, it <strong>looks </strong>like a Fallout game, featuring robots, some bizarre weapons, kooky faction members, and a branching, winding story filled with side content.</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s a blend between Fallout and STALKER.</p>



<p>When I played Atomfall at Gamescom, I was immediately won over. Not only does it look stunning, but it plays well, and as it’s a survival game at heart, decision-making is key. Should you take a cricket bat and try to overpower a guard in a settlement to get a gun before using a few rounds to fight the others, or should you try and stealth-kill everyone in the camp? Or avoid it entirely? It’s up to you.</p>



<p>Atomfall will be released on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and PC on March 27.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/force-dei-in-gaming-ci-games-company/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ci-games-is-the-latest-company-to-rebel-against-%E2%80%98forced-dei%E2%80%99.1080219/</guid>

<p>Recently, Arrowhead Studios’ CCO, Johan Pilestedt, spoke out against forcing DEI into games. He explained that ‘if it doesn’t add to the game experience, it detracts’, suggesting that titles with forced DEI aren’t ‘good games’.</p>



<p>Now, CI Games, the publisher behind Lords of the Fallen, has taken a similar stance against DEI in gaming. In a recent investors chat, the company’s global marketing director, Ryan Hill, took an authoritative tone, clearly stating that the company won’t integrate ‘any social or political agencies into these experiences’ because it’s just too risky.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-many-players-do-not-appreciate-this">‘Many Players Do Not Appreciate This’</h2>



<p>In a statement secured by <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/czaty-inwestorskie/20250108/ci-games-marek-tyminski" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Strefa Inwestorów</a> during a recent CI Games investor call, Ryan Hill, who heads up marketing on a global scale for the firm, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While some videogames have recently taken the opportunity to embed social or political agendas within their experiences, it is clear that many players do not appreciate this, and as a result, we have seen a number of high profile releases underperforming commercially during the last year alone.</p>



<p>Our games will always be developed to maximise player enjoyment and commercial success, and as such, we will not be integrating any social or political agencies into these experiences going forward having observed the high risk this can present.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Arrowhead’s Johan Pilestedt, Hill recognised that ‘shoehorning’ DEI into games to tick a box or fulfil an agenda can do more harm than good, as we’ve seen in recent years. It’s one of the reasons why many games are labelled ‘woke’ and subsequently review-bombed.</p>



<p>In a follow-up post on social media, CI Games’ CEO, <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1877836661305819433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marek Tyminski</a>, reiterated that the company <strong>will not </strong>integrate DEI elements in their games just to fit a political or social agenda.</p>

<p>Snaking has been a huge issue in the Call of Duty League for a good year or two. It’s a mechanic that’s so easily abused, and for many of today’s competitors, it’s a muscle memory or reflex action that can leave them berated by their peers. During the CDL Minor I tournament that’s unfolding right now, C9’s ‘Sib’ blatantly snaked, and other pro players called that action out.</p>



<p>On social media, LAT’s Ghosty revealed he’d started a vote for Cloud 9 NY to be <strong>blacklisted </strong>from pro scrims for one week because of Sib’s snaking on Hacienda during a round of Hardpoint.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-uphold-the-law">Uphold the Law</h2>



<p>To give credit to Sib, he’s not trying to avoid the branding he’s received from Ghosty on social media. By way of a response to what Ghosty said, Sib held his hands up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nah yeah im hearing you. No justifying me on the lambo</p>



<p>But like Daniel how long is this “precedent” really lasting?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He’s referring to this moment:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Bizarrely, Sib requested that Ghosty keeps ‘the same energy all year’, explaining that players don’t care about GAs ‘come tournament time’, and that by COD Champs, ‘nobody says anything’. Ghosty came back with an authoritative tone:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Can’t disagree about champs with it being the last event but I just want to set precedent for this since we always let shit slide in prior seasons- We’re discussing it in chat but it WILL NOT be one week as that’s not similar to last years punishments</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Other pro players like Royal Ravens’ Gwinn came onto the thread. He asked jokingly if Ghosty is ‘officially GA commish’, which could be a spot that sorely needs filling.</p>



<p>TJHaly, who was a ‘victim’ of Sib’s snaking, said <a href="https://x.com/GGBreakingPoint/status/1878259655790760423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a post-match interview</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think I just needed to snake a bit more on that map to get some more kills or something. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think snaking is still a legitimate concern in Call of Duty esports, or should it be discredited as just another mechanic? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
