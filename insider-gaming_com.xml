<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will officially be released tomorrow, and Treyarch just released a set of preseason patch notes following the latest update. Here is everything you can find in the recent Black Ops 6 preseason patch notes.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-preseason-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Preseason Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has ensured players are prepared for the release of Black Ops 6, as many have been waiting for this game for months now. With so many cool new features, the hype around this game has been absolutely absurd.</p>



<p>So, what was everything included in the preseason patch notes?</p>



<h2 id="h-campaign">Campaign</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 campaign has already proven to be quite unique compared to past Call of Duty campaigns. The story takes place after the events of Black Ops Cold War and the 1980’s flashbacks from Black Ops II. </p>



<p>In their patch notes, Treyarch iterated that Black Ops 6 is meant to bring a mix of familiar AND fresh content to players, helping feed that nostalgia fix while also leading a path forward for the series. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game will also have a customizable safe house called “The Rook,” where players can prepare weapons and more before each mission. The campaign will also feature rewards players can utilize in Multiplayer, Warzone and Zombies.</p>



<h2 id="h-zombies">Zombies</h2>



<p>Zombies are back! Black Ops has been notorious in the past for having some of the best Zombies modes, and it seems like Black Ops 6 will be no different. </p>



<p>What’s better yet is the fact that Round-Based Zombies will officially be making its return. At launch there will be two Zombies maps:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Liberty Falls</strong></li>



<li><strong>Terminus</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Obviously, as the game progresses, more Zombie maps will be released.</p>



<p>The Main Quest and all Side Quests will also go live at 10 AM PST on October 25, 2024, so be prepared to start fighting. Looks like Der Wunderfizz will also be making an appearance in games after Round 25.</p>



<p>The patch notes also revealed that players can achieve some Whimsical GobblueGums in the game after these rounds:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Round 15-29:</strong>&nbsp;1 Whimsical GobbleGum&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Round 30-44:</strong>&nbsp;2 Whimsical GobbleGums&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Round 45+:</strong>&nbsp;3 Whimsical GobbleGums&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Zombies are SO back.</p>



<h2 id="h-multiplayer">Multiplayer</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has made some HEAVY adjustments to multiplayer in the preseason patch notes for Black Ops 6. Here is everything we know.</p>



<h4 id="h-weapons">Weapons</h4>



<p>On release, Call of Duty announced that Black Ops 6 will have 33 weapons at launch, all customizable. However, Call of Duty has made some changes to weapons ahead of the game’s release.</p>



<h4 id="h-weapon-balance">Weapon Balance </h4>



<ul>
<li>Aim Assist weaker at point-blank ranges</li>



<li>Improved Pistol and Dedicated Melee swap speeds</li>



<li>Adjustments to sway, bob and overall weapon motions to improve point of aim when entering ADS</li>



<li>Improved Depth of Field across all Weapons&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-movement">Movement</h4>



<ul>
<li>Added a toggle option for Corner Slicing&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added an option to set the hold time to perform a Dive to Prone or Slide depending on your Slide/Dive Behavior setting&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added an Intelligent Movement option to set Mantle Assist Angle from tight, medium, or wide&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-maps">Maps</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>When it comes to Multiplayer adjustments, Call of Duty has made quite a few adjustments to the maps, which were playable in the beta. Here are all the Multiplayer map adjustments posted on the game’s patch notes:</p>



<h4>Skyline&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Expanded the cover points around the hot tub at the center of the map.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added new planters as cover near the far spawn point.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added multiple cover options throughout the map.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4>Scud&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Adjusted bullet penetration values on the satellite dish panels to allow additional bullet penetration.
<ul>
<li>The concrete wall at the main overwatch is now broken out, which will allow more bullet penetration to make it slightly less powerful.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Panels are doubled up at the side overwatch to still amount a small amount of bullet penetration where there was previously none.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Made additional cover improvements throughout the map.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4>Rewind&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Made cover improvements across multiple sightlines.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-audio">Audio</h2>



<p>The game has also made some adjustments to the audio. The game announced they are officially introducing a brand-new feature called HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) via Universal Profile in Enhanced Headphone Mode, which is available to all players for free.</p>



<p>What is, HRTF, though? This new audio enhancement will truly give players the feel of being in the action, as it gives the game a much more purposeful and directional soundscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-anti-cheat">Anti-Cheat</h2>



<p>Luckily, Treyarch will be doubling down on cheaters with its Anti-Cheat system. The new RICOCHET Anti-Cheat system will include the following features (as posted via the company’s patch notes):</p>



<ul>
<li>Kernel-Level Driver (PC) detection and monitoring updates across all protected titles, including Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty®: Warzone™&nbsp;</li>



<li>#TeamRICOCHET mitigations live in Black Ops 6 multiplayer, including Damage Shield, Disarm, Splat, and more&nbsp;</li>



<li>Machine-learning behavioral systems deployed to increase speed of detection&nbsp;</li>



<li>Machine-learning detection models were added to analyze gameplay combating aim bots&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-weapon-damage">Weapon Damage</h2>



<p>The last bit of information included in the Black Ops 6 preseason patch notes was dedicated to weapon damage. The team at Treyarch is creating a new Weapon Damage Adjustment table for the game to help establish better definitions of weapon damage adjustments.</p>



<p>The table will highlight adjustments made to weapons as the game’s different seasons progress, hoping to not leave any players confused about changes revolving around their favorite guns.</p>



<p>With all these patch notes, are you excited for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-gigs-is-black-ops-6-file-size-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’re worried your platform’s hard drive will struggle to contend with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s file size—a logical assumption based on previous CoD titles—this guide has everything you need to know about BLOPS 6 file sizes on different platforms.</p>



<p>Like you, I’ve suffered the wrath of Call of Duty file sizes down the years. From Warzone to Black Ops Cold War, and the recent Modern Warfare reboot sequels, my PlayStation 5 has struggled to balance my library of games due to CoD’s exorbitant file sizes.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is the latest release to fall under the Call of Duty umbrella. This means CoD HQ is starting to get crowded—as is my PS5 storage. With the BLOPS 6 release finally upon us, let’s check out the FPS’ file sizes across the board.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-black-ops-6-on-playstation">How Big is Black Ops 6 on PlayStation?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No, you can’t have my storage space. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>You need to have <strong>84.40 GB free</strong> to install the entirety of Black Ops 6 on your PlayStation console. This figure is broken up into <strong>46.01 GB</strong> for the multiplayer component of the title, <strong>16.86 GB</strong> for Campaign Pack 1, and <strong>21.53 GB</strong> for Campaign Pack 2.</p>



<p>Even though it isn’t specified, presumably, this content also includes Zombies—but I can’t be certain which of three files it’s attached to. If you want to better manage your file sizes, you can chop and change content as you please. For example, if you have no interest in multiplayer for the time being, you can always manage Black Ops 6’s installed game content and pick and choose as you please.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-black-ops-6-on-xbox">How Big is Black Ops 6 on Xbox?</h2>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 weighs in at <strong>85.56 GB</strong> on Xbox—according to the official <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-standard-edition/9N58QRBG9WDG/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox BLOPS 6 store page</a>.</p>



<p>If you navigate to the game’s page on the storefront, click on “More” for further details, and scroll down, you can see a figure of “86.56GB” under the approximate size section of the “Additional info.” </p>



<p>It was reported a few months back you needed an eyewatering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-300-gb-install-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">300GB to play Black Ops 6 on Xbox</a>; however, this was later refuted, and it turned out this is the total number of GB required to have every CoD title installed for CoD HQ. Breathe a sigh of relief.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-black-ops-6-on-pc">How Big is Black Ops 6 on PC?</h2>



<p>Finally, you need to have at least <strong>102 GB of SSD space</strong> to run Black Ops 6 on PC, whether through Steam or Battle.net.</p>



<p>This information was revealed when Activision themselves confirmed the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-pc-specs-launch-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minimum and recommended PC spec requirements</a> for BLOPS 6. Although, I recommended you have more than this to incorporate extra CoD content—as well as a year’s worth of updates sure to follow, starting with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone loves being able to play their favorite video games from their phone and more with emulators, but is video game emulation legal?</p>



<h2 id="h-video-game-emulation-is-it-legal">Video Game Emulation: Is it Legal?</h2>



<p>Emulators have been around for quite some time. People have made them for phones, PCs and even devices like calculators (I am not kidding). But what is the legality of playing a game on an emulator?</p>



<p>I mean, no one wants to get in trouble for video game emulation, but quite a few people would love to play their favorite Pokemon game without having to buy an old game boy that costs $100 or more.</p>



<p>So, are game emulators legal?</p>



<h6 id="h-related-hyperx-quadcast-2-s-review-high-quality-streaming-and-gaming-microphone">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyperx-quadcast-2-s-review-high-quality-streaming-and-gaming-microphone/">HyperX Quadcast 2 S Review: High-Quality Streaming and Gaming Microphone</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-video-game-emulators">Video Game Emulators</h2>



<p>The legality of video game emulators depends on a few different factors. Actual emulators are not illegal. If you find one on the App Store, go ahead and download it. You won’t get reprimanded for it. </p>



<p>But what about the actual games?</p>



<p>Well, a video game emulation is technically not illegal IF you purchase the game and then rip it onto an emulator. It becomes illegal once you start sharing that emulator (or selling it) with other people. </p>



<p>This violates various copyright infringement laws, and there is really no way around it. Downloading ROMs from websites for free is technically illegal, too, but the main person who would get in trouble is the person distributing them</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-be-playing-video-game-emulators">Should You be Playing Video Game Emulators?</h2>



<p>It is really up to your own personal discretion on whether or not you should be playing video game emulators. More than likely, you will never get in trouble. However, if you plan on ripping games and distributing them to others, there is more of a chance you could get caught and fined.</p>



<p>If a company like Nintendo finds out, there may be a hefty lawsuit in your hands.</p>
