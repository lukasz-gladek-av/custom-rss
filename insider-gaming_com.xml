            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The HoYoverse team has announced that support for Genshin Impact on PS4 is being <strong>shut down</strong> and that the game will receive no further updates after April 8th, 2026. It was stressed that this decision was made due to hardware limitations and ‘platform application size’, and that PlayStation 5 support will continue as normal.</p>



<p>From September 10th, 2025, you won’t be able to search for or download Genshin Impact on PlayStation 4.</p>



<p>This decision garnered immediate backlash from the Genshin Impact fanbase still playing on the platform, which launched way back in 2013.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impactful-decision">Impactful Decision</h2>



<p>In a post on the HoYoLab page, the decision to shut down Genshin Impact on PlayStation 4 was unveiled:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your continued support and love for Genshin Impact on PS4! Due to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size, we will be discontinuing support and updates for Genshin Impact on PS4 in future versions.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact on PS5 will continue to operate normally and is not affected by the removal and update discontinuation on PS4. Traveler will still be able to enjoy the latest content updates on PS5 and other supported platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was then stressed that the removal of Genshin Impact will unravel across three phases on PS4:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game Removal (September 10th, 2025) – You will no longer be able to search for or download Genshin Impact on PS4</li>



<li>In-Game Purchases Delisting (February 25th, 2026) – Store purchases for Genshin Impact will be removed from the in-game shop and the PS Store</li>



<li>End of Update Support (April 8th, 2026) – No more updates will be rolled out across Genshin Impact’s PS4 version</li>
</ul>



<p>The article from the HoYoverse team <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained how users</a> can port their progress to other platforms.</p>



<p>In the comment section under the article, the backlash was fairly instant and aggressive, with users branding the decision ‘disgusting’, ‘the biggest middle finger’, and ‘gross and dumb’.</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments if this move will impact you as a Genshin Impact fan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-and-saints-row-delisted-adult-games-debate/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-and-saints-row-%E2%80%98at-risk%E2%80%99-of-being-delisted-in-adult-games-debate-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent weeks, few topics in the gaming space have earned as much attention as the ‘adult games debate’. It was recently revealed that payment processors for certain gaming outlets are cracking down on adult and NSFW games, targeting some of the smuttier titles that sit on storefronts like Steam.</p>



<p>It has brought about the rise of some activist actions from the likes of GOG, a storefront that made a bundle of NSFW games free to claim for a short time to protest the ‘financial censorship’ being pushed by some payment providers and processors.</p>



<p>However, it has now been claimed that games such as Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row, and Duke Nukem could be targeted by payment processors, potentially resulting in them being delisted.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-potentially-at-risk">‘Potentially at Risk’</h2>



<p>In an article penned by GamingOnLinux, it was highlighted that a digital retro storefront had been ‘targeted’ by payment processors looking to clamp down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/itch-io-latest-site-strike-down-adult-games-payment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on adult games</a>. The storefront, ZOOM Platform, <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/preserving-and-protecting-artistic-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained in a statement</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you are likely aware, there have been a number of adult title de-listings across the industry. One of our payment processors made us aware that a “fellow member of the industry” was concerned about our content.</p>



<p>We have no plans to remove any titles, and will do absolutely everything in our power to prevent such de-listings. We are fervent supporters of artistic freedom and always will be.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/zoom-platform-also-had-payment-processor-issues-say-they-have-no-plans-to-remove-any-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a> reportedly received an email from the ZOOM Platform team, explaining that ‘they expect the de-listing situation to expand further.’ It was specifically said that games like ‘Grand Theft Auto, Duke Nukem, and Saints Row were described as <strong>potentially at risk.</strong>‘</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto has long been one of the most controversial franchises in gaming, but the ‘NSFW elements’ of the game only make up a small part of what’s on offer. It’s not one of these smut titles that are hidden in the libraries of some questionable gamers on Steam, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>That being said, the violence, behaviors, and destructive potential of franchises like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row could be described as gratuitous and harmful to the wrong people, like minors.</p>



<p>Is the answer taking them off the shelves and preventing people from buying them? <strong>Absolutely not.</strong></p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that ZOOM Platform is a retro-focused site, and these claims could be angled towards more classic titles, especially where the likes of Duke Nukem are concerned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Whether you are on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, here is everything you need to know about whether Madden 26 is available on your preferred platform or console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/#:~:text=Madden%2026%20Release%20Date&amp;text=Madden%2026%20officially%20releases%20on,game%2C%20starting%20on%20August%207." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> pushes the series forward in new and exciting ways. For <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-showcasing-on-field-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay</a>, EA brought over the wear and tear system from College Football 25, and also introduced the Coach DNA system, which mimics real-life playstyle tendancies. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-franchise-deep-dive-shows-new-coaching-updates-gameplan-changes-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Franchise</a>, some of the big new changes include coach archetypes, weekly playsheet updates, a new weekly highlights show, and more. As for&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-presentation-updates-include-updated-gameday-experience-new-mascots-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">presentation</a>, Madden 26 features former NFL legends in stadium pre-game rituals, has licensed more than 40 songs for stadium music, and includes official team mascots. With that all in mind, let’s take a look at which platforms the upcoming game is coming to. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Madden 26 on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Madden 26 ends a 13 year drought for Nintendo fans. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Madden 26 is available on the Switch 2</strong>, making it the first game in the series available on a Nintendo console since Madden 13 on the Wii and Wii U in 2012. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/gridiron-notes-madden-26-pre-order-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA</a> confirmed that Madden 26 on Switch 2 will have all of the same features as other platforms, meaning this isn’t a “lite” version of the game, as we have seen from other stripped down versions of other sports games on the Switch. </p>



<p>That being said, there is a slight visual downgrade compared to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamespot</a> reported that the game feels smooth in handheld mode, however it is reported to perform at around 40 frames per-second on the Switch 2 and the menus load slowly. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-playstation-4-and-5">Can You Play Madden 26 on PlayStation 4 and 5?</h2>



<p><strong>Madden 26 is available on PlayStation 5, but is not on PlayStation 4</strong>. This is the first time that a Madden game won’t be on last-gen consoles. </p>



<p>It’s odd that Madden 26 won’t be available on PlayStation 4, because EA is still developing EA FC 26 for PS4. Regardless of the reason, it’s time for previous generation console owners to make the upgrade. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-xbox-one-and-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Madden 26 on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Like PlayStation, <strong>Madden 26 will be on Xbox Series X|S but not Xbox One</strong>. </p>



<p>On the Xbox Series X, Madden 26 supports 4k Ultra HD, HDR 10, ray tracing, spatial sound, and performs at 60 frames per second or better. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-madden-26-on-pc">Can You Play Madden 26 on PC?</h2>



<p>Yes, <strong>PC users can download Madden 26 on Steam or Epic Games</strong>. </p>



<p>EA recommends playing Madden 26 on PC with a controller, and Xbox and DualShock controllers are both supported. It’s unclear if the game will be able to run on a Steam Deck. </p>



<p>Which platform do you plan on playing on? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/is-madden-26-on-nintendo-switch-2-all-platforms-consoles-explained.3201/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>

<p>For more on Madden 26, there was a change to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/change-made-to-madden-26-broadcast-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broadcast team</a>, and all of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-rookie-ratings-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rookie ratings</a> were revealed. </p>

<p>Before pre-ordering Madden 26, it’s worth reviewing every edition and understanding the differences between them. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/#:~:text=Madden%2026%20Release%20Date&amp;text=Madden%2026%20officially%20releases%20on,game%2C%20starting%20on%20August%207." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> officially releases soon, meaning you don’t have much longer to take advantage of the pre-order bonuses. Madden is much different than other sports video game franchises because EA develops both Madden and the College Football franchise. </p>



<p>EA used that luxury to its advantage and offered a package that includes both games. Not only that, but you can take the player you created in College Football 26 and continue their journey in Madden 26, after spending four seasons in school. </p>



<h2 id="h-madden-26-pre-order-bonuses">Madden 26 Pre-Order Bonuses</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There are several different coach archetypes in Madden 26. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pre-ordering any edition of&nbsp;Madden 26 comes with a few bonuses, including Franchise Coach Ability Points, a MUT Cover Athlete Elite Player Item, and a Super Star Legendary XP Boost. </p>



<p>Coach Abilities are a new feature in Madden 26, and there are 22 offensive and 24 defensive abilities available at launch. For example, the&nbsp;Trimmed Edges&nbsp;ability gives your offensive tackles an increased chance to win against various pass rush moves, while Sure Hands increases the likelihood of receivers catching passes. Coach Ability Points are used to unlock new abilities. </p>



<p>As the name suggests, the Superstar Legendary XP boost significantly accelerates the amount of XP earned in Superstar mode for your created pro. If you bring over your created player from College Football 26 and combine it with this boost, you will have a massive head start. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-madden-26-editions-amp-prices">All Madden 26 Editions &amp; Prices</h2>



<p>The Standard Edition of College Football 26, priced at $69.99 and this edition includes all of the previously mentioned pre-order bonuses. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Deluxe Edition, priced at $99.99, comes with seven days of early access, Early Access Solo Challenges, and Madden Points to spend in Ultimate Team. </p>



<p>Finally, the MVP Edition costs $149.99. It includes all of the previously mentioned bonuses, as well as the College Football 26 Deluxe Edition, which contains 4600 CUT Points and a Names of the Game Player Item in Ultimate Team. </p>



<p>Each of the editions has a slight price reduction with an EA Play membership, which is included in an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-time-to-kill-system/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-devs-say-game%E2%80%99s-time-to-kill-system-%E2%80%9Cwill-evolve%E2%80%9D.1263015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is set to enter open beta in the coming days, and its developers have addressed on of the game’s primary multiplayer concerns: Time-To-Kill.</p>



<p>Time-To-Kill or TTK is exactly what you think it is. It’s the amount of time it takes for a player to kill an opponent. As part of a media event in Hong Kong, developers from DICE addressed how the team is handling the system in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve done in-depth research on TTK,”</strong> DICE’s Jac Carlsson said <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via GNN</a> courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1952869411125100656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>. <strong>“In fact, in Battlefield 6 we’ll be dealing with complex gunfights and environments. TKK is typically fastest in close combat (where it’s very fast), and the scenes we’ve shown in the trailers are mostly close combat.” </strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-battlefield-6-battlefield-6-servers-will-use-bots-if-not-enough-players">More Battlefield 6: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-bots-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Servers Will Use Bots If Not Enough Players</a></h6>



<p>Carlsson continued: <strong>“We’ve actually done a lot of testing on the game itself, as well as a lot of historical experience, and based on this experience, we’ve found the most enjoyable and comfortable combat situations for players. Based on our own experience, the TTK in the dynamic battlefields of Battlefield 6 needs to be fast enough to keep up with the changes on the battlefield. </strong></p>



<p>Carlsson said that they used “a lot of data analysis” in order to get the TTK results that currently exist. However, the studio will listen to feedback from the players during the betas and after the game launches in order to “evolve” and “adjust” the game.</p>



<p>What do you hope to see from the TTK system in Battlefield 6? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>EA and DICE plan on using AI bots to fill Battlefield 6 servers if there aren’t enough players for a game.</p>



<p>As part of a multiplayer event in Hong Kong (per <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Taiwanese outlet GNN</a> and spotted by <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1952869411125100656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Bulletin</a>), DICE said AI soldiers will “backfill” servers if they’re unpopulated.</p>



<p>It was said that Battlefield Studios’ philosophy is to “allow as many players as possible to play at the same time”. This would just be used on the off chance should a game need a few players in order to get started. DICE’s Jac Carlsson also gave an example use case of AI bots in Battlefield 6’s multiplayer, saying players could create a custom game mode in Portal that allows players to get more comfortable in the game.</p>



<p>While not confirmed, it should be expected that should more players join the servers, those bots will then be replaced. There was also no mention of the skill level of the bots.</p>



<p>Sticking with multiplayer, it was said that the game will also have a number of “seasonal events” that include new weapons, maps, and modes in order to keep things fresh. How often those seasons come, however, wasn’t revealed.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game is set to have two beta weekends starting August 7 for those who managed to get a code for a two-day early access (closed) period. The beta will open up on August 9-10 before returning from August 14-17.</p>

<p>Gears of War: Reloaded releases at the end of August and the game’s file sizes are becoming available. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NZ7KCLZ1SX1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Xbox app</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded will be <strong>68.7GB on the Xbox Series X|S</strong> and <strong>70.3GB on PC</strong>. The <strong>PlayStation version of the game</strong> has yet to be revealed, but, it based on the Xbox and PC numbers, it should fall somewhere into that 68-71GB range. When the official number is available, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>Gears of war: Reloaded is a remaster of the original Gears of War game that was first released in 2006. This new build of the game from The Coalition—along with Disbelief and Sumo Interactive—not only brings the series to PlayStation for the first time, but also includes a number of updates for players.</p>



<p>Features of the game include 4K resolution and up to 120 frames per second if you are multiplayer. The game will also support cross-play and cross-progression on all platforms. To get cross-progression, however, you’ll need to link a Microsoft account.</p>



<p>Other features for the game include zero loading screens during Campaign, Variable Refresh Rate, 4K assets and remastered textures, enhanced post-processing visual effects, improved shadows and reflections, and more.</p>



<p>Also you happen to have 2015’s Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, you can upgrade to Reloaded at no extra cost. The game will also be available via Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports was so committed to getting input delay and response time sorted out for online play in EA Sports FC 26 that it actually went to players’ houses to test the connections.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, senior producer Sam Rivera said that the developers worked with pro players and content creators to make sure they had everything they needed to solve the issue.</p>



<p><strong>“We really needed to understand the root of the problem,”</strong> Rivera <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fc-26-developer-ea-sports-actually-visited-content-creators-homes-to-test-their-internet-connections-and-uncover-the-real-reasons-for-input-delay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told IGN</a>. <strong>“We worked with pro players, we gathered data from players all around the world to try to understand the issues, but we didn’t want to only listen to the feedback. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“We wanted to experience input delay ourselves. So we also traveled to Europe to meet with pro players at their eSports studios. We actually met with content creators at their homes, and we learned a lot.”</strong></p>



<p>By taking these steps, Rivera said that the problem was caused by a variety of factors whether it be network connection, being wired or Wi-Fi, or even in-game animations.</p>



<p><strong>“Sometimes we request actions in the game that are very difficult to perform,”</strong> he said. <strong>“So if there’s a very fast incoming ball and I want to go for a long pass backwards, that is very difficult, and sometimes there are no animations for that. So it is like in real life, very difficult to perform. It’s difficult for us to capture those animations.”</strong></p>



<p>Rivera added, however, that the team added a number of new animations to the game to have “more coverage” for those instances. He also spoke on the EA Sports FC 26 animation system in general, calling it “one of the most complicated systems”. The system, he says, has <strong>“solve every request, every shot, every pass, considering what animations are available, where the opponents are, how the ball is moving, and all of that.”</strong></p>



<p>While there are a number of improvements, it’s unlikely that input delay will ever be completely solved. There are too many factors to go into the cause. But Rivera says that the potential is there to make it the best it’s ever been.</p>



<p><strong>“There’s a big opportunity there,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We have done a very good step in FC 26 to create a more responsive game.”</strong></p>



<p>EA Sports FC launches on September 19 for those with the Deluxe Edition of the game. Those without will have to wait until September 26.</p>
