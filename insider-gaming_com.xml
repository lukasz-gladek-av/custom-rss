<p>There will be no more remote work—or at least very limited opportunities—for Ubisoft employees moving forward. Instead, Ubisoft employees will be required to be in office on a full time basis.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the French-based publisher announced major restructuring plans that including a number of games, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>, being canceled. While the announcement also spoke about plans to focus more on<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Games-As-A-Service (GAAS) and open world experiences</a>, they also revealed a policy change that will impact all employees within the company. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-wants-all-employees-in-the-office">Ubisoft Wants All Employees In The Office</h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official press release</a>, Ubisoft will return to a full five days on site “for all teams”. Staff will then receive an “annual allowance of working-from-home days.”</p>



<p>“This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams,” they said “In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market.”</p>



<p>SVP of Studio Operations Marie Sophie de Waubert&nbsp;told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-reveals-new-creative-house-structure-cancels-games-and-announces-final-round-of-cost-cutting-and-studio-closures-to-drive-200m-savings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that the company is still working with “a hybrid model, but spread differently”.</p>







<p>After the news broke, one source reached out to Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw to say that they’d expect the eventual layoffs to be “in the hundreds”. During its conference call to discuss the moves, Ubisoft wouldn’t discuss how many more layoffs would be coming as part of this restructure within the company. </p>



<p>Recently, the company has held layoffs at its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-to-layoff-55-employees-across-the-division-developers-and-stockholm-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Massive Entertainment</a> as well as at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cut-nearly-30-jobs-abu-dhabi-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</a>, the closure of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Halifax</a>, and more. </p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced that its new operating model features 5 Creative Houses, supported by a Creative Network. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft has just announced a major restructure to the organization, with the new model focusing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences</a>. This has led to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of the Prince of Persia Remake</a> and several other titles. Moreover, several studios will be closed, and layoffs are expected across the company. Check out how the new model will function below. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-5-creative-houses-are-built-on-a-decentralized-model">Ubisoft’s 5 Creative Houses Are Built on a Decentralized Model </h2>



<p>As revealed in the latest <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, the new operating model for Ubisoft features 5 Creative Houses and will start from April 2026. It is supported by a Creative Network that will provide development resources, shared Core Services, and a reshaped HQ. The new decentralized model will lead to 3 significant changes: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, the game development and go-to-market functions will be combined for a gamer-centric approach, and they will be fully responsible for brand development, content strategy, and editorial direction. </li>



<li>The new Creative Houses have been shaped by distinctive genres, which are led by “high-profile, incentivized teams with a unique set of expertise in those genres.”</li>



<li>Lastly, the teams will have full financial ownership and account for economic performance.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-creative-houses-have-been-divided-by-genre">Ubisoft’s Creative Houses Have Been Divided by Genre</h2>



<ul>
<li>The first Creative House is the newly formed Vantage Studios, which will work on Ubisoft’s largest established franchises, aiming to turn them into “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual billionaire brands</a>“: Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. </li>



<li>Creative House 2 will focus on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences: The Division, Ghost Recon, and Splinter Cell. </li>



<li>The third Creative House will be centered around live experiences: For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, and Skull &amp; Bones. </li>



<li>Creative House 4 will feature immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes: Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil. </li>



<li>The last and final Creative House will be dedicated to casual and family-friendly titles: Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno, and Hasbro. </li>
</ul>



<p>On top of these, Ubisoft is working on 4 new IPs, including March of Giants. The division of these IPs across the Creative Houses will be revealed at a later stage. </p>
