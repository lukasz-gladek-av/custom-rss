<p>The most sensational indie game of 2025 is one that nobody saw coming. It’s called Schedule I, and as the blurb goes, it sees players go ‘from small-time dope pusher to kingpin’ by making and selling all kinds of drugs. It’s bizarre, and it was pieced together almost entirely by a single developer over three years, and it’s turning heads worldwide.</p>



<p>Schedule I’s fifth patch is here, and it adds a few key improvements and addresses some outstanding bugs. Despite it being a little bit of a work in progress in some ways, Schedule I is one of the most popular games in the world right now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-on-the-charts">High on the Charts</h2>



<p>Schedule I isn’t a game to be taken seriously, but many players are. It has picked up a rating of Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam from 38,778 reviews – and it was only released a week ago. It’s one of the boldest success stories we’ve seen from an indie game in a very long time.</p>



<p>It sits in the number one spot on Steam for sales, and it’s the fourth most-played game on the platform as I write this. There are 275,500 people playing it, and the game’s peak count has exceeded many AAA titles on the platform.</p>



<p>Here are the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546730838559032913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest patch notes</a> for Schedule I:</p>



<p><strong>Tweaks/Improvements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Added an active display setting to choose which monitor the game displays on.</li>



<li>Botanists will now automatically move product from their supplies to drying racks.</li>



<li>Owned vehicles are now visible on the map app.</li>



<li>Implemented a few validity checks/failsafes for NPC pathfinding and warping. I think this was one of the primary causes of crashing on certain chipsets (thanks to Chi Chi on Discord for bringing this to my attention).</li>



<li>Refactored employee item movement behaviour to be a bit smarter.</li>



<li>Implemented NPC effects culling at a certain distance to improve performance.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed non-host clients sometimes not being able to hit/stand in blackjack.</li>



<li>Fixed a quest UI bug that was sometimes causing infinite loading screens in multiplayer.</li>



<li>Fixed clipboard selections not reassigning without first manually clearing the existing selection (employee beds, botanist supplies, etc).</li>



<li>Fixed the dealer sometimes preemptively revealing its hand to non-host players in blackjack.</li>



<li>Fixed the first-person jacket looking janky.</li>



<li>Fixed the ‘Master Chef’ achievement being rewarded prematurely.</li>



<li>Fixed some property null references that were causing multiplayer loading/desync issues.</li>



<li>The drying rack ‘dry’ button is now non-interactable if the input slot is reserved by an employee.</li>



<li>Fixed NPC ‘stay in building’ behaviour sometimes causing errors for non-host players.</li>



<li>Fixed NPC voiceover emitters sometimes throwing a null reference.</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s creator and (almost) solo dev, Tyler, also revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve started work on the first content update and am planning to release it this weekend. I’ll be posting some sneak peeks soon – stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Schedule I is available exclusively on PC at the moment, and if you want to try before you buy, the game has a decent demo on Steam.</p>

<p>Rebellion is celebrating the successful launch of Atomfall, a pseudo-apocalyptic survival game set in rural England in the 1950s. It’s a history-bending title with plenty of mysterious meat on some well-built bones, and that’s partly why <strong>one million players </strong>found their way into the game over the launch weekend.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team revealed that Atomfall is Rebellion’s most successful launch <strong>ever</strong>, and the company has been making games for more than thirty years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-is-here">The End is Here</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-review-rebellion-curveball/">my Atomfall review</a>, I praised the game’s solid foundation, genuinely intriguing story, and sumptuous visuals, topics that have been mirrored by players worldwide. It’s a phenomenal concept for a game that has been delivered very nicely by Rebellion after years of development.</p>



<p>In a recent press release, Jason Kingsley CBE, the CEO of Rebellion, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall.</p>



<p>To have surpassed the one million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.</p>



<p>We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.</p>



<p>We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team released some statistics along with the news, revealing that 316,000 people brutally murdered the innocent scientist who helps the player at the very start of the game.</p>



<p>I was one of those 316,000 people.</p>



<p>Also, 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed, which is nothing if not indicative of how <strong>quintessentially British </strong>Atomfall is.</p>



<p>Atomfall is available now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC – it’s also on the Game Pass subscription service.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/priestahh-parts-ways-with-lag-m8-major-ii/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/priestahh-parts-ways-with-lag-m8-ahead-of-major-iii-qualifiers.1151325/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/priestahh-parts-ways-with-lag-m8-major-ii/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Preston ‘Priestahh’ Greiner has split from Los Angeles Guerrillas M8 in the Call of Duty League following a turbulent time for the team. Presently, LAG sits one from the bottom in the CDL standings, sitting on a match record of 4-15, which is fairly woeful. The only team behind LAG is the Vegas Falcons, which has yet to win a single match in the CDL.</p>



<p>Priestahh has been passed from pillar to post since his monumental season in 2023 that saw him secure two chips and a world championship, and it’s hard to tell where he’ll end up next.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-fall">The Fall</h2>



<p>During the 2023 CDL season, Priestahh saw immense success while playing an integral part in the New York Subliners roster. He was a member of the crew that landed one of the most historic grand finals in COD Champs history – a 5-0 wash over Toronto Ultra that ended in record time.</p>



<p>As a tenured veteran of Call of Duty esports, Priestahh has been around since Advanced Warfare (2014). He has flown the flag of some prestigious organisations, including 100 Thieves, FaZe, Cloud9, and now Gentlemates, represented in the Call of Duty League by the Los Angeles Guerrillas M8.</p>



<p>LAG has failed to gain any traction this season, though. The team has been hampered at every post, and it’s looking extremely likely that the squad won’t make it to this year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-championship-2025-kitchener-june/">COD Championship tournament</a>, set to take place in Canada in June.</p>



<p>On March 18, LAG M8 started breaking down the roster, bidding farewell to Skyz – who has since wound up starting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-skyz-new-official-roster/">with OpTic Texas</a> in place of Kenny. On March 27, Lynz was pushed to the sub spot, being benched by LAG M8 after a crushing defeat <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlanta-faze-lan-3peat-major-ii-finals/">at Major II</a>. Two days later, Priestahh was benched – and now he has departed the team entirely.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Nous disons au revoir à </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Priestahh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Priestahh</a><span> , qui quitte le club aujourd’hui

Merci Preston, nous te souhaitons le meilleur dans tes prochaines aventures 🩷 </span></p></article></div>







<p>Rostermania has been pretty wild so far during the gap between Major II and Major III. This coming Friday, matches will return, but will everyone be too distracted by the resurfacing of Verdansk in Warzone?</p>

<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct almost upon us, details about the upcoming console’s Pro Controller have surfaced online.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrades-nbsp">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Upgrades&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4192#post-1701204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famiboards</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/nintendo-switch-2-unofficial-name/227778/news/fcc-filing-could-indicate-a-possible-upgrade-for-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), FCC Filings for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller have been revealed, providing an idea about the new upgrades for this device. The filing has been listed for ‘BEE-008’, a controller with both Bluetooth and NFC. Interestingly, the filing suggests that Nintendo could finally add a headphone jack to their Pro Controller for Switch 2.&nbsp;Moreover, the controller should feature a new battery, too.</p>



<p>The community has long requested a headphone jack for the Pro Controllers. When the console is docked, wired audio is impossible unless you are glued to the TV. However, with the upcoming console finally introducing voice chat for the platform, a headphone jack for the Pro Controller seems more likely. We will have to wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event tomorrow to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct-last/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will last one hour</a> and explain everything we need to know about the upcoming console. It will be followed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-gameplay-showcase-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Treehouse: Live</a>, featuring hands-on gameplay for Switch 2 games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Compulsion Games is ready to bring the world South of Midnight. Its release date comes several years after its announcement, and the developer is preparing everyone for its debut by showcasing start times for its normal and Early Access launches.</p>



<p>If We Happy Few is anything to go by, then we already know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/south-of-midnight-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a> is a can’t-miss adventure. Xbox shares Compulsion Games’ affinity for the weird and wonderful, and this is the first project under the Xbox banner. South of Midnight looks like a mature and realized vision, and its release date can’t come soon enough for some. </p>



<p>If you’re after the earliest possible start time, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-release-date">South of Midnight Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Magical and mysterious. Credit to Compulsion Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>April 8 is the confirmed South of Midnight release date, and it’s one of the month’s biggest games.</strong></p>



<p>South of Midnight—at the time of writing—hasn’t been subjected to a delay. It’s had little-to-no controversy and got a lot of hype ahead of its launch. It’s available to Xbox Series X|S and PC users, so let’s see if being available on these platforms helps its sales.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight being on Xbox Game Pass</a> is sure to go in its favor.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-start-times">South of Midnight Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Expect South of Midnight to launch and get underway at 9 AM PDT / 11 AM CDT / 12 PM EDT / 5 PM BST.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is for the official launch date. South of Midnight’s release has several editions to consider, so depending on which one you opt for, there’s a chance you’re entitled to Early Access—giving you an earlier start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-early-access-start-times">South of Midnight Early Access Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The Premium and Premium Upgrade Editions come with five days of South of Midnight Early Access.</strong></p>
