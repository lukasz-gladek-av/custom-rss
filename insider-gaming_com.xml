            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has officially launched worldwide. Even though it has a shiny new campaign, everyone wants to play online multiplayer. Unfortunately, the EA servers are biting back, so let‚Äôs check why you can‚Äôt play Battlefield 6 right now, and what‚Äôs happening with the server queues.</p>



<p>It was claimed by a Battlefield 6 dev that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers ‚ÄòShould be‚Äô ready for launch day</a>. This was not the case as players were left queuing for the brand-new game. Messages don‚Äôt always spread very quickly or widely. Meaning, many of you Battlefield 6 owners have been left in the dark over the game‚Äôs servers and long queues.</p>



<p>This quick explainer should help you if you‚Äôre one of the many having trouble with BF 6 servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-can-t-i-get-into-battlefield-6-servers-right-now-are-they-down">Why Can‚Äôt I Get Into Battlefield 6 Servers Right Now? Are They Down?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It‚Äôs a war, in more ways than one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 launch day queues are excessive because so many people are trying to play the game at once. The player base is so big that it‚Äôs overloading the EA servers, meaning players have to wait for other players to quit the game before being able to play.</strong></p>



<p>If you‚Äôre being met with a ‚ÄúGame Servers Full‚Äù screen when trying to play <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, this is because the game‚Äôs maximum occupancy has been reached. The servers physically can‚Äôt handle any more players. It‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre down, they‚Äôre just full.</p>



<p>Again, EA was confident the servers would be ready, but it hasn‚Äôt worked out like that.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-the-battlefield-6-server-queue">How Long is The Battlefield 6 Server Queue?</h2>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 launch day queue is several hundred thousand players deep at times, meaning you could potentially be waiting a long time to play Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>Consider these queues like a random ballot: Some people got in right away, and some of you could potentially have to wait 10 minutes, all the way up to an hour or more, if you‚Äôre unlucky. The server queues will likely never be this bad again, and it‚Äôs up to EA to add more servers and allow more people into the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-6-right-now">How To Play Battlefield 6 Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>The only way to play Battlefield 6 online multiplayer right now is to wait in the queue until it‚Äôs your turn to get in.</strong></p>



<p>We absolutely understand this isn‚Äôt the answer you want‚Äî<em>believe us</em>. But it‚Äôs the simple reality of the situation. Battlefield 6 is one of the hottest game launches of 2025. The beta broke record numbers, and this launch was always going to be fierce.</p>



<p>Battlefield Studios did issue a warning ahead of launch, but it hasn‚Äôt spread as quickly as the company probably would‚Äôve liked.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new announcement by ARC Raiders reveals the Expedition Project, a new way to incorporate optional progression wipes. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders is all set to release on October 30, 2025, and the developers recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-delay-explained-embark-game-not-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> why things went silent at the studio: they had dipped into the PvP pot for the game‚Äôs future. Now, they have provided players with new details about the progression wipe system, and that it isn‚Äôt mandatory. </p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-expedition-project-makes-wipes-optional">ARC Raiders Expedition Project Makes Wipes Optional </h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy blog post</a> by ARC Raiders design director Virgil, it was revealed how the game will handle progression wipes. The developers had already stated that they do not intend to do mandatory wipes and have stuck to their words. They understand the benefits of global wipes, as they provide experienced players with a fresh game; however, it doesn‚Äôt cater to players who don‚Äôt have much time to play. </p>



<p>The game features a ‚ÄòProjects‚Äô feature that players can access at level 20. The first major project in this section is the Expedition Project, and once players complete it, they can reset their character. After completing a reset, players can do it again by completing another one of these projects. Expedition Project will operate on a roughly 8-week cycle, during which players can make progress towards their project. </p>



<p>Once the 8 weeks are complete, players will have the option to finalize the project for an additional week. If they have fulfilled all the project‚Äôs requirements, they can finalise it. If the player‚Äôs project isn‚Äôt ready during this window, their progress will be retained, and they can continue working on it until the next finalisation window. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-be-kept-and-removed-in-arc-raiders-progression-wipes">What Will Be Kept and Removed in ARC Raiders Progression Wipes</h2>



<p>Anything that is related to the character‚Äôs progress will be wiped, including levels, skills, items/inventory, workshop, crafting capabilities, etc. Any cosmetics earned or purchased, achievements, rankings, etc., will be retained. ‚ÄúAnything rooted solely in the metagame or involving real money will be preserved.‚Äù After completing their Expedition Project, players will be able to skip most of the onboarding and tutorial steps, which include unlocking certain features, maps, etc. </p>



<h2 id="h-benefits-of-completing-expedition-projects">Benefits of Completing Expedition Projects</h2>



<p>Players who complete Expedition Projects in ARC Raiders will receive some benefits and rewards; these are yet to be finalised, but these are the type of rewards players can expect: Permanent account unlocks for each completed Expedition, unique cosmetic rewards for completed Expeditions, account ‚Äúbuffs‚Äù that are applied for the duration of the following Expedition cycle, And sequential completions of the Expedition Project increase the magnitude of these buffs, up to a limit.</p>



<p>In other news, here‚Äôs why ARC Raiders was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">censored in Black Ops 7.</a> What are your thoughts on ARC Raiders featuring optional progression wipes?

<p>The next game in the nearly 30-year-old Age of Empires franchise is in development, and it will seemingly be using Unreal Engine. That would see the company leave the Essence Engine and Bang Engine, which had been used for Age of Empires 4 and Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition, respectively, behind. </p>



<p>According to multiple job postings on Microsoft‚Äôs website, Xbox Game Studios is ‚Äúhard at work continuing the great legacy of Age of Empires‚Äù. As the work continues on the franchise, World‚Äôs Edge, the studio behind Age of Empires 4 and the definitive editions of the second and third games, is looking for two positions that specifically call out using Unreal Engine. </p>



<p>The two roles‚ÄîPricing Unreal Engineer and Senior Unreal Engineer‚Äîrequire those with <strong>‚Äúa background in&nbsp;all aspects of&nbsp;Unreal Engine&nbsp;game&nbsp;development&nbsp;and experience&nbsp;leading external resources.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>No other details on what the future could look like for Age of Empires, but the direction it‚Äôs going in, at least when it comes to the tech stack, seems clear. </p>



<p>What do you hope for from the next installment in Age of Empires, seemingly Age of Empires 5?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nearly 100 past and present employees at Mindseye developer Build a Rocket Boy have signed an open letter against the studio for its ‚Äúlongstanding disrespect and mistreatment‚Äù of staff.</p>



<p>Published on <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">Friday by the IWGB Game Workers</a>, this letter directly calls out several issues employees claim to have faced from management, including founder Leslie Benzies. </p>



<p>After the poorly received launch of Mindseye, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-developerbegins-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Build a Rocket Boy laid off</a> what the union says was 250-300 people because of their refusal to <strong>‚Äúlisten to your workforce‚Äôs years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>The letter says that there was a ‚Äúlack of transparency and communication‚Äù. The employees believe that <strong>‚Äúinformation has been sparse and vague, with you (Benzies) often making radical changes to the way we worked with little or no input from those affected.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>The letter also mentions the studio implementing a mandatory eight hours of overtime per week for every employee in the four months leading up to the game‚Äôs launch. Time Off In Lieu was given to the staff at seven hours per every eight worked, but, they say that many employees have yet to be able to use any of the time off because of <strong>‚Äúcontinued requests for extra ‚Äúhigh-priority‚Äù work, even after launch.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>Regarding layoffs, the letter calls what has happened a ‚Äúdisastrous handling‚Äù. It‚Äôs alleged that employees were given wrong information, including being grouped with the wrong internal teams, and given wrong notice periods, which may have seen a number of employees wrongfully dismissed.</p>



<p>The employees, both current and former, are demanding a public apology for the mistreatment as well as <strong>‚Äúproper compensation‚Äù</strong> for those who were let go. They are also asking for a meaningful and documented effort to improve conditions within the company that includes acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union, a commitment to using external partners for future redundancies, and the option for remaining employees on redundancy notice to either work the rest of their time or take Payment in Lieu of Notice.</p>



<p>The letter closes with calling out Benzies and co-CEO Mark Gerhard, saying, ‚Äúyou often refer to your employees as ‚Äòfamily‚Äô. But we ask you to consider; is this really how you treat your own?‚Äù</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Build a Rocket Boy for comment on the letter. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that the open beta‚Äôs maps were intentionally smaller than the ones we get at launch. </p>



<p>With Battlefield 6 launching today, players will be going straight in to check out the maps that weren‚Äôt available during the game‚Äôs open beta weekends. Some players are so excited, they have already started recreating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a> in the game‚Äôs Portal mode. Now, the developers have revealed why they opted for smaller maps in BF6‚Äôs open beta. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-open-beta-s-smaller-maps-made-it-easier-to-test-different-aspects-of-the-game">Battlefield 6 Open Beta‚Äôs Smaller Maps Made it Easier to Test Different Aspects of the Game </h2>



<p>In a new interview in <a href="https://www.pcgamer-magazine.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer Magazine‚Äôs 415 issue</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-devs-say-the-plan-was-to-launch-with-bigger-maps-all-along-and-that-the-betas-notoriously-smaller-maps-were-intentionally-smaller-than-the-ones-we-know-are-coming-in-the-full-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>), the design director for Battlefield 6, Salim Fasahat, explained why the game‚Äôs open beta had smaller maps. Fasahat first stated, &nbsp;‚ÄúThey were intentionally smaller than the ones we know are coming.‚Äù He added that there were a few reasons behind this decision, including gaining a better understanding of different modes, the scale at which they can operate, which types of maps work, and more. </p>



<p>Fasahat added that the smaller BF6 maps made it ‚Äúeasier to test and focus on gun play.‚Äù The whole team is ‚Äúsuper excited to have people explore all of those maps.‚Äù For those wondering, Manhattan Bridge, Saints Quarter, New Sobek City, Mirak Valley, and Operation Firestorm were not available in the Open Beta. The maps that players have already tested include Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, Liberation Peak, and Empire State. </p>
