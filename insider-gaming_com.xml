<p>The next entry in the handheld PC market is coming from Lenovo, and it’s aiming to be a more affordable option for players looking to get their first device. And now, ahead of its reveal, the first look at the new Lenovo Legion Go S has appeared online.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/exclusive-first-renders-of-the-budget-friendly-legion-go-s-pc-gaming-handheld-are-here-most-likely-powered-by-the-new-amd-z2-platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> has been sent official renders for the new device that confirms past rumors of a white shell for the device. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As you can tell with the renders, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-best-available-handheld-gaming-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">device looks a lot like</a> the original Legion Go aside from a couple small button placement changes and touchpad removal. It also appears that, unlike the original Legion Go, there are no removable controllers.</p>



<p>According to past leaks, the Legion Go S will utilize AMD Ryzen Z2. This configuration — known as Rembrandt — features Zen3+ cores, which will likely put it less powerful than the Z1 Extreme system with Zen4 cores that the original Legion Go features. More specifically, the Ryzen Z2 series will have 8 CPU cores and could feature RDNA2 graphics.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that none of the specs have been officially confirmed by Lenovo. Until that happens, some of the aforementioned features of the device could change. Lenovo is expected to reveal its new handheld systems at, or around, CES 2025 in January. The new next-generation of handheld PCs should also be revealed around the same time. </p>



<p>What do you think of the look and details of the Lenovo Legion Go S? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
