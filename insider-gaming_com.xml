<p>Amazing Seasun Games has announced that the Mecha BREAK Beta is now available on the Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>The announcement comes following the Beta launch on Steam last week, which saw the game become the most played demo on the platform with over 317,000 concurrent players. </p>



<p>As tweeted on X (formerly Twitter), Amazing Seasun Games will be rewarding Xbox players for their patience with 2000 Corite credits. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Greetings Pilots! We’re happy to announce the Xbox build of our Open Beta Test is now LIVE!

To thank you for your patience, we will be giving each Xbox player 2000 Corite so you can jump right into the action.</span></p></article></div>



<p>What’s particularly interesting though, is despite the game being scheduled to release on PC, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5, a beta for the PS5 is yet to be announced.</p>



<p>When one user asked when will the PlayStation Beta come, the official account replied, “We look forward to bringing Mecha BREAK to PlayStation later this year.”</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on why the game has yet to announce a PlayStation 5 Beta, but Insider Gaming has asked Amazing Seasun Games for comment on when, or if, one will be release. However, it is known that Mecha BREAK does have console exclusivity with Xbox for a limited time.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the the Mecha BREAK Beta has yet to be given an end date either.</p>



<p>Will you be playing the Mecha BREAK Beta? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Whether you need to tune up your catch-as-catch-can holds or work on throwing meaner right hooks than Logan Paul, 2K offering WWE 2K25 Early Access would have many ready, willing, and Gable to buy.</p>



<p>2K’s multimedia sports game empire is a winner every year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> is the natural successor to WWE 2K24, and is looking to be the Apex Predator of the group. More and more games offer Early Access, and WWE 2K25 is a natural fit for the incentive.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> already has it, so I’m here to tell you if you can expect it from WWE 2K25.</p>

<p><strong>WWE 2K25 offers 7-Day Early Access as a bonus for those who pre-order the Deadman</strong> <strong>Edition and Bloodline Editions.</strong></p>



<p>WWE 2K25’s Early Access is a chance to get stuck into MyGM, Universe Mode, and explore The Island as an early adopter. You can learn the new mechanics, get an Edge (pun intended) on other newbies, and become the King or Queen of the Ring.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-wwe-2k25-early-access">How to Play WWE 2K25 Early Access</h2>



<p>Three editions await those who want to secure their copy before launch: The Standard Edition, Deadman Edition, and Bloodline Edition. The final two are the key for Early Access. Pre-order the Deadman or Bloodline Edition for a seven-day headstart over the competition.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick guide on how to secure this big bonus:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25’s website</a>.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>pre-order now</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll down <strong>and choose either the Deadman or Bloodline Edition</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose your platform.</li>



<li>Press <strong>pre-order now</strong>&nbsp;to go to the storefront you desire.</li>



<li>Again, choose the newer&nbsp;<strong>pre-order now</strong>&nbsp;button.</li>



<li>Purchase the edition and confirm it.</li>



<li>You can download and play Early Access when it begins.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-when-does-wwe-2k25-early-access-start">When Does WWE 2K25 Early Access Start?</h2>



<p><strong>Early Access for WWE 2K25 begins on March 7, giving you seven full days to enjoy WWE 2K25 before it launches worldwide on March 14.</strong></p>



<p>If you think I’m telling an Eddie Guerrero-sized lie, I promise I haven’t cheated you, and I’ll steal the official confirmation from 2K itself. On the official <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/37145831078163--WWE-2K25-Pre-Order-and-Edition-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25 FAQ</a>, it says: “Standard Editions can start their throw-down journey on March 14, and the early access for pre-orders of Deadman and The Bloodline Editions will get access starting March 7.”</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you prepared to pay a bit more and secure your ticket to the dance? Or will you turn down the offer and take the brunt of a John Cena heel turn?</p>



<p>It’s not exactly from the dirt sheets, but many other WWE 2K25 details are known. This year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-showcase-mode-matches-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Showcase Matches</a> are announced, and we know all about 2K25’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-wwe-2k25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> eligibility.</p>

<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, a remaster of the third and fourth games in the franchise, has been officially revealed. The reveal comes after weeks of rumors and teases about the game’s announcement.</p>



<p>Launching on July 11—confirming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-3-4-details-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier leak</a>—Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 will feature the game’s original parks with a “classic roster of skaters”. There will also be new parks, skaters, and tricks for all players to experience on all platforms.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“Skate through a robust Career mode taking on challenges across two tours, chase high scores in Single Sessions and Speedruns, or chill out and dig into the map in Free Skate,” Activision said via release. </p>



<p>The game is being developed by Iron Galaxy Studios, the team that handled the development of the Steam version of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2. Vicarious Visions, which initially developed the first remaster, was merged into Blizzard back in 2021 and rebranded as Blizzard Albany.</p>



<p>It was also announced that the game  will have cross-platform multiplayer supporting up to eight players at once. There will also be a New Game+ mode for players that want to play through the career multiple times without losing their stats.</p>



<p>When it launches, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It’ll also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC.</p>



<p>Those who pre-order the game will get access to the Foundry Demo in June. Lastly, players who buy the Digital Deluxe edition will get access to Doom Slayer and Revenant skaters along with extra in-game music, skate decks, and create-a-skater gear alongside three days early access on July 8.</p>
