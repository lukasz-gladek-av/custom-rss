<p>A new Ghost of Yotei trailer shows off one of Atsu’s newest weapons, the brash odachi, in combat gameplay. </p>



<p>The highly anticipated sequel to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, Yotei looks to live up to what came before and more. Following a vengeful mercenary on the hunt for her family’s killers, the game has been rolling out new content every week. Now, a month from the October 2nd release date, we’ve got new footage of a new weapon in Atsu’s arsenal: the odachi.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8ivos7Bnjs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the trailer above</a>, we see protagonist Atsu unleash another weapon in her collection, the odachi. A longer version of the katana, the weapon’s length can shorten the distance between your blade and an enemy. While not as fast, it can deliver devastating blows to foes and thin a crowd should you be overwhelmed. </p>



<p>Weeks prior, we’ve seen footage of the kusarigama, yari, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-firearms-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firearms in action</a> in Ghost of Yotei. With the odachi trailer out, it leaves the dual swords, katana, and bow left. It does fit quite nicely with the timeline, ending right near the upcoming release date. As one of PlayStation’s biggest titles of 2025, fans won’t have to wait long to get their hands on it, especially if they are at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tokyo-game-show-2025-lineup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tokyo Game Show</a>. Still, given the many accolades Ghost of Tsushima received at launch, Yotei may live up to the Ghost moniker in the Game of the Year discussion.</p>



<p>Are you going to use the odachi in Ghost of Yotei? Looking forward to its October 2nd release? Let us know in the comments below and on the forums!</p>

<p>The upcoming Street Fighter film now has an official release date: October 2026.</p>



<p>Originally being distributed by Legendary, the live-action adaptation of the iconic Capcom fighting series is coming to theaters soon. In the past few months, the cast has slowly been revealed. With Warrior’s Andrew Koji and The Recruit’s Noah Centineo as leads Ryu and Ken, the ensemble is quite fitting of the franchise. From rapper 50 Cent as Balrog to wrestler Cody Rhodes as Guile, fans are excited to see it come to life. Fortunately, as filming continues, the movie now has a new distributor, as well as an official theater date.</p>



<h2 id="h-street-fighter-film-now-distributed-by-paramount-synopsis-revealed">Street Fighter Film Now Distributed by Paramount, Synopsis Revealed</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Street Fighter film now releasing Oct 16, 2026 under Paramount </p><p>Logline: “Set in 1993, estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Andrew Koji) and Ken Masters (Noah Centineo) are thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior… <a href="https://t.co/7bK7UEnkCY">pic.twitter.com/7bK7UEnkCY</a></p></div>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1963680725808390578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In an article from <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-plot-cast-1236361494/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Paramount Pictures is now distributing Street Fighter. The studio inked a deal with its previous distributor, Legendary, for three years. With the news, the studio revealed the official release date: October 16th, 2026. The film had started filming earlier last month, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-noah-centineo-ken-tease/">teases of looks</a> from several actors.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the first synopsis of the Street Fighter film is now out. The logline, shared by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-plot-cast-1236361494/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, is available below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Set in 1993, estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Andrew Koji) and Ken Masters (Noah Centineo) are thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior Tournament: a brutal clash of fists, fate, and fury. But behind this battle royale lies a deadly conspiracy that forces them to face off against each other and the demons of their past. And if they don’t, it’s GAME OVER!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, new cast members have been announced, filling out the roster. This includes Reacher’s Olivier Richters as Zangief, Cobra Kai’s Rayna Vallandingham as Juri, SNL’s Kyle Mooney as Joe, and Mortal Kombat’s Mel Jarnson as Cammy. </p>



<p>There’s a lot riding on the new adaptation of Street Fighter, to say the least. Previous Hollywood adaptations have been decent, despite some great casting like Raul Julia as M. Bison and Ming Na Wen as Chun-Li. Still, there’s a lot of potential with the series and, with the recent Hollywood successes of Minecraft and Fallout, perhaps Street Fighter will join them.</p>
