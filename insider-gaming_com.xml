<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is getting the cross-generational treatment, releasing on both the Nintendo Switch 1 and the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Sure, most people are going to focus on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-starters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s starters</a> or the new mega evolutions, but, as with many other Switch games, the performance is going to matter.</p>



<p>Here is a breakdown of the Switch 1 and Switch 2 performance differences in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and which version you should consider buying.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-different-in-pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-and-switch-2">What’s Different in Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2?</h2>

<p><strong>The difference in the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions is purely based on performance. The Switch 2 version has a better framerate and resolution. Outside of that, both versions have the same content.</strong></p>



<p>On the original Switch, games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were criticized a lot for the performance issues both had. Luckily, the Switch 2 is more powerful, and that power allows Game Freak to get more out of their game with the new hardware.</p>







<p><strong>The version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A you should buy comes down to your situation</strong>.</p>



<p>Obviously, if you only own a Switch 1 and have not upgraded to a Switch 2, you should buy the Switch 1 version. However, it’s not a full guarantee that you should go with the upgraded version if you have the newer console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with many Switch 1 games, and this includes Pokémon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-pokemon-legends-z-a-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The cost of the game</a> is $10 more expensive on the Switch 2 for that bump in performance. If you need to save money, you are fully capable of buying the Switch 1 version and then <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upgrading later in the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 version does have the performance enhancements over the Switch 1, some people might not tell a drastic difference between the two. We are sure the difference is notable when shown side by side, but that isn’t as applicable when you only see one version.</p>



<p>To sum it up, if you are a Switch 2 owner, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-exclusive-platform-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 version</a> will give you the best performance. However, if you are in a spot where you need to save a little money, buying the Switch 1 version will still give you the full Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, with maybe a negligible performance difference when played on a Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision%E2%80%99s-ban-on-%E2%80%98arc-raiders%E2%80%99-in-black-ops-7-explained.1317964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eagle-eyed Call of Duty gamers have noticed that the term ‘ARC Raiders’ is censored in Black Ops 7’s text chat. This isn’t the first time this has happened in a game, as it was called out recently that Battlefield 6’s game chat had the same issue.</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to Activision to get to the truth of the question of why Black Ops 7 appears to be <strong>censoring </strong>mentions of ARC Raiders. In case you’re not in the know, ARC Raiders is a third-person extraction shooter set to drop on October 30, casting players into a harsh, ruined world to fight for survival.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-arc-raiders-censored-in-call-of-duty">Why is ARC Raiders Censored in Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>It’s not some nefarious thing, as it happens. We caught up with Activision’s PR team to get to the root of what seems like ARC Raiders censorship, which some have pegged as being some twisted corporate jealousy.</p>



<p>Here’s the message we received, which should set your mind at rest:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Glad you asked, it’s quite innocuous and I can provide you with the information on background. </p>



<p>Our text-based moderation system has ‘Arc’ set as an alt of an inappropriate word. </p>



<p>Paired with Raiders, the system flagged the phrase. Those filters have been adjusted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hilariously, Embark Studios made a tongue-in-cheek reference to this issue on social media:</p>

<p>While we didn’t hear what the situation was with Electronic Arts and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-censor-no-longer-present-ea-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s censorship</a> of ARC Raiders, we can safely assume it was a similar deal.</p>



<p>The Black Ops 7 beta kicked off late last week and is live until Wednesday, October 8. It has been met with a mostly positive reception thus far, despite some viewership and player numbers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-beta-fail-top-battlefield-6-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on certain platforms</a> taking a while to get flowing.</p>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming just a couple of days ago:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Black Ops 7 Beta Early Access is already off to a great start. The early response across all platforms has been tremendous, and we’ve only just begun. We look forward to the entire community, across all platforms, coming together to experience the Open Beta beginning Sunday.</p>
</blockquote>
