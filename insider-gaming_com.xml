<p>A new claim suggests that Hollow Knight: Silksong will not be featured during the Indie World Showcase this week, on August 7, 2025. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Nintendo recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-indie-world-showcase-for-august-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an Indie World Showcase for this week, and what surprised players was that the announcement came less than a week after their Nintendo Direct <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-july-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Showcase</a>. Many players got their hopes high, thinking they might get to see more of Hollow Knight: Silksong at this event, but new reports say otherwise. </p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-is-not-on-the-cards-for-indie-world-showcase">Hollow Knight: Silksong is ‚ÄòNot on the Cards‚Äô for Indie World Showcase</h2>



<p>The claim about Hollow Knight: Silksong comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tuvr5j3HvXQ&amp;t=203s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SwitchForce</a> (via <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/08/06/nintendo-indie-world-leaker-says-hollow-knight-silksong-wont-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyNintendoNews</a>), the person responsible for leaking a Nintendo showcase for this week. In his new YouTube video, SwitchForce states that, as far as he is aware, Hollow Knight: Silksong is ‚Äúnot on the cards‚Äù for the upcoming event, and he doesn‚Äôt expect it to get the ‚ÄúIndie World treatment‚Äù as it‚Äôs grown far bigger than that. </p>



<p>SwitchForce notes that players will be able to see Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom, as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> will also be available there. He added that ‚Äúa lot of the marketing has now shifted towards Xbox‚Äù for the upcoming title, and they will be ‚Äúhousing that demo for their upcoming portables at Gamescom. </p>

<p>The last update we received for Hollow Knight: Silksong was in June, when the game‚Äôs website <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-website-receives-big-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a major refresh</a>. Additionally, a leaker has claimed that the game is expected to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-before-end-of-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before the end of Summer 2025</a>.

<p>The original Fallout was created as a sequel to EA‚Äôs 1988 title, Wasteland, Interplay‚Äôs former co-founder has revealed. However, they did all they could to avoid being sued by EA. </p>



<p>The original Fallout title came almost a decade after (1997) the first Wasteland game (1988), and both games had the same developers, Interplay. However, Wasteland was published by EA, and Fallout was developed and published by Interplay. Now, Interplay‚Äôs co-founder has revealed that many people are unaware that Fallout was a sequel to Wasteland. </p>



<h2 id="h-interplay-did-everything-to-avoid-being-sued-by-ea">Interplay Did Everything to Avoid Being Sued by EA</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-was-a-sequel-to-wasteland-says-interplay-co-founder-and-we-did-everything-we-could-not-to-be-sued-by-electronic-arts-after-the-devs-had-to-pivot-out-of-the-follow-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Brian Fargo, the co-founder of Interplay, revealed new details about Fallout and Wasteland during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjeRn2eA3y4&amp;t=2766s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mr.MattyPlays</a>. Fargo explicitly stated that a lot of people don‚Äôt know that Fallout ‚Äúwas a sequel to Wasteland.‚Äù Fargo explained that players are unaware of the story behind it, but ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why it went from tunnels and trolls and then we needed a system ‚Äì mercenaries, spies, and private eyes ‚Äì and then that‚Äôs how we got the skill-based system with Wasteland, and then that went to Fallout.‚Äù</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The former co-founder explains that while developing Fallout, even though it took heavy inspiration from Wasteland, Interplay did everything they could ‚Äúnot to be sued by Electronic Arts‚Äù. Fallout even had ‚Äúyour life ends in the Wasteland‚Äù, Fargo stated. However, he loves that the game has an origin story that he is very proud of, and he learned a lot from his time on the original Wasteland. </p>



<p>Fargo eventually did make sequels for the Wasteland series as the studio head at inExile Entertainment, with Wasteland 2 releasing in 2014 and Wasteland 3 releasing in 2020. </p>



<p>In other news, the Fallout: Bakersfield trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-bakersfield-trailer-reveals-insane-take-1997/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveals an insane take</a> on the 1997 classic. Additionally, Fallout 5 has reportedly been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-bethesda-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully greenlit</a>, according to a recent claim.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded embraces unity and squad goals. With multiplayer available, implementing crossplay is a must, but it isn‚Äôt always easy. This handy guide has answers to all key crossplay and cross-progression questions.</p>



<p>The Coalition could have simply brought back Gears 1‚Äôs campaign, and that‚Äôs it. But no, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> has the campaign, co-op, and authentic multiplayer. It‚Äôs the complete package for one of the most beloved shooters of our time.</p>



<p>The second you mention multiplayer, the word ‚Äòcrossplay‚Äô usually follows. Many games utilize crossplay, so let‚Äôs see if Gears of War: Reloaded is the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-crossplay-in-gears-of-war-reloaded">Is There Crossplay in Gears of War: Reloaded?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My brother. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Gears of War: Reloaded boasts complete crossplay functionality at launch, meaning you can hop into online campaign sessions and multiplayer matches with players from other formats.</strong></p>



<p>It really is the total package, isn‚Äôt it? The Coalition has confirmed through the official <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reloaded</a> website that the game has: ‚ÄúCrossplay across platforms, allowing you and your friends to squad-up wherever you play.‚Äù</p>



<p>There‚Äôs nothing wrong with you flying solo. However, if you desperately need allies to help you complete the impossible Insane difficulty, crossplay allows you to team up and take down Locusts without restrictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-cross-progression">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p><strong>Cross-progression is available for Gears of War: Reloaded, which allows you to transfer your save data across compatible platforms.</strong></p>



<p>We‚Äôre two for two so far in this guide! We defer to Reloaded‚Äôs official site once more on this one: ‚ÄúJump from one platform to another and your campaign saves as well as multiplayer progression will come with you.‚Äù</p>



<p>This is two-fold:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can save your campaign progress on one format and resume where you left off elsewhere.</li>



<li>Your online multiplayer data you‚Äôve accrued is also transferable across Reloaded‚Äôs applicable platforms.</li>
</ul>



<p>You‚Äôre not hindered by one platform. Let me explain more about that below for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-platforms-is-gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-compatible-with">Which Platforms is Gears of War: Reloaded Crossplay Compatible With?</h2>



<p><strong>Gears of War: Reloaded‚Äôs crossplay and cross-progression functions apply to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>You can buy and own Reloaded on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. In short, any save data on one console can be loaded on another or a PC. I know many of you own multiple platforms in this day and age, so it‚Äôs nice to see The Coalition fully embrace this.</p>



<p>Sorry to Nintendo Switch 2 owners, it doesn‚Äôt look like there‚Äôs any love for you guys right now.</p>



<hr>



<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has everything and more. Is it an easy day-one purchase for you? What‚Äôs the first thing you‚Äôll do when you get it? Let me know through the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sniping looks incredible in Battlefield 6, but there has been a consistent complaint: Sniper Glint. A Battlefield 6 dev has addressed this via social media and promises big changes coming to the game mechanic.</p>



<p>Nearly everything about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-phantom-edition-contents-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has looked impressive. Battlefield Labs has been an eye-opening experience, with hundreds and thousands of matches taking place. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-peaks-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BF6 beta</a> opens up the player pool significantly, and we can see for ourselves what it looks and feels like.</p>



<p>But gameplay leaks and official footage have already shown how extreme Sniper Glint is.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-sniper-glint-will-be-toned-down">Battlefield 6 Sniper Glint Will be ‚ÄúToned Down‚Äù</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I‚Äôm blind. Image via Battlefield Studios </figcaption></figure>



<p>Being a sniper is all about stealth and secrecy. Ensuring your position isn‚Äôt compromised so the enemy can be neutralized without a fuss. A social media post from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a> shows how exposed snipers are when aiming down their scopes.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs so distinct that the page even asked: ‚ÄúDo you think that Battlefield 6 should have Sniper Glint?‚Äù</p>







<p>Well, it caught the attention of Florian Le Bihan AKA DRUNKKZ3‚Äîa former player turned Principal Game Designer for DICE. They replied: ‚ÄúYes. It‚Äôll get toned down in scale a bit but it‚Äôs here to stay.‚Äù</p>



<p>Sniper Glint isn‚Äôt going anywhere. This is a good thing, as no Sniper Glint would be unfair. With no killcams and expansive maps, while snipers could do what the role asks of them very well, it could be too OP.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Yes üôÇ It‚Äôll get toned down in scale a bit but it‚Äôs here to stay</span></p></article></div>



<p>We don‚Äôt know the scale of the Sniper Glint nerfs. It‚Äôs likely DICE will tweak the glint until the developer and player base are happy with the changes. How problematic do you think Sniper Glint is in its current state? How much is too much? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
