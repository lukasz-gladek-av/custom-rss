<p>CS:Legacy, a full standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6 built from the ground up on Valve’s official Source Engine SDK, is set to be released on Steam in 2025. The project is being worked on by several former developers of the classic CSPromod project, but could face obstacles in the form of Valve and competition from another classic remake.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-full-remake-of-cs-1-6-is-coming-in-2025">A Full Remake of CS 1.6 is Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>While many current Counter-Strike fans were playing CS2 or watching the ESL Pro League Season 21 finals, the CS: Legacy quietly released an official launch trailer. The standalone remake of CS 1.6 will be “built from the ground up with 100% custom code and game assets,” according to the trailer’s description. While it will use the official Source engine, it will feature the developers’ “own major rewrites to the renderer, shaders and various system.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer showcases many of the original aspects of Counter-Strike that players remember from 1.6, including the classic audio sounds, ragdoll animations, and a remake of the original Nuke map. To support development, the team behind CS: Legacy also created a Patreon which rewards Discord access and your name in the credits.</p>



<p>Some fans are worried if Valve will allow CS: Legacy to release on Steam, but examples like Black Mesa, the fan-made remake of the original Half-Life, indicate that Valve is willing to let it be listed. CS:Legacy isn’t the only classic Counter-Strike project in the works, as another team is working on Classic Offensive, a remake/mod of CS:GO. However, the Classic Offensive project has run into numerous setbacks. Classic Offensive was shutdown out of nowhere this past January, but even after getting reinstated, it was <a href="https://www.dust2.us/news/59005/classic-offensive-mod-blocked-by-valve-one-day-before-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked by Valve</a> a day before release just this past week. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ashly-burch-has-gone-on-record-expressing-concerns-about-%E2%80%98ai-aloy%E2%80%99.1135833/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ashly-burch-concerns-ai-aloy-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, a clip surfaced online showcasing an AI-driven version of Aloy from the Horizon series. The real-time AI bot was shown having a conversation with a human, responding to questions while standing in an in-game environment. The clip was subsequently taken down, but not before it reached Aloy’s actor, Ashly Burch, who raised key concerns.</p>



<p>She was advised by Guerrilla Games that the AI bot didn’t reflect anything in development, nor did it use her motion capture or vocal talents, but it’s still enough to set a worrying precedent about the character – and all other characters voiced by such iconic performers.</p>



<p>We’ve been here before – a while ago, I interviewed Doug Cockle (Geralt, <em>The Witcher</em>) about AI voice replication, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doug-cockle-ai-voice-replication/">he labelled it ‘theft’</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-feel-worried-about-this-art-form">‘I Feel Worried About This Art Form’</h2>



<p>In a clip <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734">uploaded to TikTok</a>, Ashly Burch addressed the current SAG-AFTRA strike, which is taking place <strong>because </strong>AI technology exists. She stressed that voice actors are asking for ‘protections’ against AI replication, which is arguably the biggest concern troubling actors – and it has been for the last year or two.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I feel worried, not because the technology exists, not even because game companies want to use it, because of course they do, they always want to use technological advancements, I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it.</p>



<p>That does have someone’s voice, or face, or movement, and the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back, and that possibility, it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart, it scares me.</p>



<p>I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ashly Burch has long fought for the betterment of the VA vertical. Almost a decade ago, she was unable to reprise her role as Chloe Price in <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</em> because she was striking with hundreds of other actors on the grounds of compensation rates and pay scales in the industry.</p>



<p>We’ve seen many actors fight back against AI replication. On social media, Roger Clark (Arthur Morgan, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>) and Ned Luke (Michael de Santa, <em>GTA 5</em>) have been outspoken against videos using AI versions of themselves – even if those videos are silly parodies or memes. </p>



<p>In September 2024, Jennifer Hale <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jennifer-hale-ai-voice-acting/">went on record as saying</a>, ‘AI is coming for all of us.’</p>



<p>Do you think voice actors are right to be concerned about the sharp rise of AI replication? Let me know your thoughts in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-files-defamation-suit-media-outlets/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard, has filed a suit in Delaware against G/O Media, naming Kotaku and Gizmodo specifically. The suit complains that both outlets attempted to smear Kotick by ‘going out of their way’ to besmirch his name by mentioning false, withdrawn allegations of discrimination and workplace harassment.</p>



<p>It was claimed by Kotick that articles were penned with the ‘malicious purposes of causing further harm’ to his name, which was at the time already considerably tarnished.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-seeking-damages">Seeking Damages</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://courtconnect.courts.delaware.gov/cc/cconnect/ck_public_qry_doct.cp_dktrpt_frames?backto=P&amp;case_id=N25C-03-157&amp;begin_date=&amp;end_date=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delaware suit</a> filed by Bobby Kotick is pretty basic on the surface, but details of the complaint were obtained and published <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/former-activision-blizzard-ceo-sues-over-news-articles-accusing-him-of-workplace-harassment-discriminatio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Courthouse News Service</a> on March 13.</p>



<p>The complaint from Kotick reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Neither article had anything to do with Activision. </p>



<p>Both were about rumors that Kotick was interested in buying TikTok. Yet, Kotaku and Gizmodo went out of their way to include withdrawn, false allegations relating to workplace issues which G/O Media knew had been conclusively disproven by numerous investigations … purely for the malicious purposes of causing further harm to Kotick.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The articles in question were reports published by Kotaku and Gizmodo about the claim that Bobby Kotick was part of a cabal looking to acquire TikTok in the United States. For reference, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">I also covered those claims</a>, but I neglected to insult the man or bring up his troubled past at Activision Blizzard, aside from mentioning what employees were saying about him on social media.</p>



<p>But that’s probably why I’m not being sued.</p>



<p>Courthouse News Service noted that Kotaku and Gizmodo updated their articles to remove more negative terminology, but Kotick insists that, as a general rule, they’re still ‘mischaracterising’ him, and he’s seeking damages. </p>



<p>Stay tuned to see how this unfolds.</p>
