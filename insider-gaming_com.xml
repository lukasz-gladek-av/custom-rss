<p>You expect well-known AAA franchises to land as they’ve established themselves for years. New games are always entering the limelight, and certain ones stand above the rest. 2025 has seen its fair share of newbies, and Insider Gaming has selected one surprise hit above all.</p>



<p>When a new year begins, while they might not necessarily be in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-vote-game-awards-2025-all-categories-nominees-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOTY</a> running, the annual Call of Duty, EA FC, etc, are going to sell like hotcakes and remain popular all year round. There will also be the games that are hyped up for an eternity, such as Hollow Knight: Silksong. So let’s honor the less-talked-about/hyped games and the impact they’ve had.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-surprise-hit-of-2025-winner-dispatch">Biggest Surprise Hit of 2025 Winner—Dispatch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>There have been workplace comedies about an office, a family, an American school, and many other things, but a superhero workplace comedy sounds like untapped potential. The Boys has been a breath of fresh air, changing the usual superhero narrative and perception. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-dispatch-adhoc-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a>, being a playable, customizable version of this, is terrific on paper.</p>



<p>When developer AdHoc Studio is comprised of various devs from Telltale Games, the chances of Dispatch’s success go up. Over 2 million copies sold in its first month and an 89/100 score on Metacritic later, and Dispatch has fought off all opposition to be one of 2025’s biggest breakout hits. The developer has said Dispatch will beat its estimated three-year sales target in three months—which is ridiculous.</p>



<p>Dispatch is replayable, fun, makes you think carefully about every decision you make, and it has more depth and things to do than even the best Telltale games. A subsequent AdHoc game won’t claim this award again, because people know the developer means business now, but it’s a worthy 2025 winner.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-surprise-hit-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Surprise Hit Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Many Insider Gaming 2025 lists feature Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in some capacity or another, to the point it’s almost boring! It would be wrong (borderline impossible) to ignore the game’s success, from breaking all-time The Game Awards records to selling 5 million units. Not many people really had Clair Obscur on their radar at the beginning of 2025, let alone knew who Sandfall Interactive was.</p>



<p>Now, at the end of 2025, even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/french-president-applauds-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">French President</a> knows about the game’s success. The uniqueness of Dispatch gives it the edge over Dispatch—and the fact that Sandfall features various former Ubisoft employees—but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is close.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Pauline has unique abilities to help DK. Image via Nintendo </figcaption></figure>



<p>Hear us out: The Donkey Kong franchise is legendary and loved. It’s been around for over 40 years, and the majority of its formula has been established. Nintendo decided to do something bold and make Bananza a fully 3D platformer with a destructible environment. Realistically, the game was never going to be bad, but you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who would confidently claim that Bananza would be a landslide knockout.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is the highest-rated DK game ever; it’s been nominated for umpteen awards and was even up for many Game of the Year accolades. The franchise name carries an exceptional amount of weight, but the release has surely given Nintendo some serious food for thought about the direction of the series moving forward.</p>



<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>A few have tried to crack the extraction shooter nut that Escape From Tarkov has selfishly clung to like Scrat in Ice Age. Call of Duty’s MWZ barely laid a scratch. Gray Zone Warfare is great, but its numbers nosedived off a cliff, and Escape From Duckov is hilariously quite close in terms of popularity, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-flickering-flames-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is something else. Wow.</p>



<p>The reception to ARC Raiders has been nothing but positive from testing to launch. It’s quite a rare feat, and Embark has caught lightning in a bottle with ARC Raiders. The developer is also achieving the difficult task of supporting the game well, adding the right content, and making changes befitting of the community. If you (the reader) say this is the biggest surprise hit of 2025, Insider Gaming would find it hard to argue.</p>



<p>Which leads nicely onto the conclusion of this article: What was your biggest surprise hit of 2025? Is there an easy winner or nomination left off of this list?

            <title><![CDATA[Will Hytale Be On Steam? How To Buy Hytale, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-steam-how-to-buy-hytale/</link>
            <guid>1394320</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale will be one of 2026’s most in-demand early access games, and buying it will be a priority for lovers of sandbox and casual games, with the odd deadly monster here and there. You’d think Hytale being on Steam would be a guarantee, but the only guarantee in life is that there are no guarantees.</p>



<p>A new year normally gets off to a slow start. January 2026 doesn’t have a plethora of huge titles, but there’s one that catches the eye—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a>. The resurrected and rejuvenated project is back on track, and Hypixel Studios is working hard to deliver the most complete game over the next few years.</p>



<p>If you want to buy it and support it, knowing if it’s on Steam will be a huge help.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-hytale-on-steam">Can You Buy Hytale On Steam?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Flamingo? Bingo. Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale will not be available to purchase from Steam once it launches into early access in January 2026.</strong></p>



<p>‘But this would help Hytale succeed and bring more attention, surely?’ If this is your sentiment, it’s correct. But if you’re wondering why Hypixel Studios has made the call to skip Steam, there’s a very clear and respectful reason:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“No, not initially. We want to spend our time in Early Access working with our existing community to improve the game, rather than chasing a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game’s direction. We don’t shy away from honest, negative criticism; we have been very critical of the state of the game ourselves on social media. We simply want the first steps of our journey to be influenced by informed players rather than large-scale first impressions from those unfamiliar with the game’s development background.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, Hytale will be on Steam at some point, but only once the developer feels comfortable that the game is in a good-enough state to be purchased and reviewed on the platform. Negative reviews or review bombing can be destructive for any game, so this move makes a lot of sense and should be respected.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-purchase-hytale">How To Purchase Hytale</h2>

<p><strong>The only way to buy Hytale right now is to make an account through the game’s website, verify your details, and complete the purchase.</strong></p>



<p>Check out these quick and handy instructions if you want to buy Hytale now:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://hytale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hytale</a> website.</li>



<li>Click one of the <strong>Pre-Purchase</strong> buttons.</li>



<li>Choose the edition you want, and click <strong>Pre-Purchase</strong> underneath it.</li>



<li>Create an account and verify it.</li>



<li>Accept the <strong>I Understand</strong> prompt for the Pre-Purchase notice.</li>



<li>Complete your Hytale order.</li>



<li>Once it’s done, you can download Hytale early access close to launch and start playing once it’s live.</li>
</ol>



<p>You’ll be met with this message before you continue with the purchase, just as a warning:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This version represents the core of the game while development continues. Features will grow, evolve, and sometimes change direction based on your feedback. You may encounter bugs, unfinished content, or occasional instability, and saved games may need to be reset as we update systems. If you’re looking for the full experience, we recommend waiting for a later release; but if you’d like to help shape Hytale’s future, we’d love to have you with us.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Has Hytale done enough to convince you to buy it? If you’re thinking about buying it or have already purchased it, you can say why and discuss all things Hytale through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
