<p>Episode 7 is the upcoming continuation of Amazon’s Fallout Season 2. The smash-hit adaptation is currently on pace to outshine and dethrone S1 as the superior series, so make sure you don’t miss Fallout Season 2 Episode 7, with this release date and start time hub.</p>



<p>Video game adaptations are hit or miss. The Last of Us Season 1 is a masterpiece, whereas Halo bombed. Arcane is sensational, but Return to Silent Hill is a dumpster fire of epic proportions. Fallout has been a revelation, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-score-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Season 2</a> continues to deliver for Amazon and fans.</p>



<p>If you’re looking forward to the follow-up to Episode 6’s ‘The Other Player,’ here’s the latest Episode 7 info.</p>

<p><strong>Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 will release on January 28, carrying on Season 2’s regular weekly release schedule.</strong></p>



<p>Episode 6 was released on January 21, so Episode 7 is coming on January 28. Shows on Amazon and Netflix are very consistent with episode release patterns, and Episode 7 should be no different.</p>



<p>However, Insider Gaming will be on the ball and the first to update you if any Radroaches or Deathclaws decide you need to take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apply-for-fallout-shelter-reality-show-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(Fallout) shelter</a> for another week.</p>

<p><strong>Pacific Time-based viewers can start watching Fallout Season 2 Episode 7 from midnight on January 21, and it will be available later for everyone else around the world.</strong></p>



<p>While it would be good if the sun could somehow light up the planet in the same way worldwide, we have to settle for time zones, regions, and scattered releases.</p>
