            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s no big secret that xQc is a big-bucks streamer with plenty of cash behind him, but when the numbers start getting revealed, things start to get a little mind-blowing. Recently, the somewhat eccentric content creator revealed that he was paid a whopping $1 million, more money than some people will see in their entire lives, for <strong>streaming Call of Duty: Warzone for 12 hours</strong>.</p>



<p>What’s more amazing is that the sum was paid for a single stream <strong>despite </strong>the original ‘deal’ being for several streams over two weeks.</p>







<h2 id="h-chump-change-for-a-streamer-like-xqc">Chump Change for a Streamer Like xQc</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with Dexerto, xQc revealed he was paid a mighty sum of $1 million for streaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/warzone/" id="54">Warzone</a>, Activision’s battle royale, for just half a day. That wasn’t even his best day, as he also unveiled an eye-watering $15 million payday for <strong>gambling content</strong>.</p>



<p>The streamer, who often confuses viewers with his hyperactive cadence, has made an immense name for himself over the years, ever since dropping out of competitive Overwatch. He’s now a multi-faceted streamer who is often regarded as one of the biggest earners in the industry, and it’s obvious why.</p>



<p>The recent interview <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/xqc-reveals-he-was-paid-1-million-to-play-call-of-duty-for-12-hours-3315972/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Dexerto</a> uncovered his insane payday for streaming a battle royale game for 12 hours:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When it comes down to a sponsor, I had a late sponsor kick in. It was Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>I hadn’t answered their request for their sponsors for like the whole season. At the end, they were like, ‘Yo, dude, we’ll give you like the rest of the budget or whatever.’</p>



<p>They’re like, ‘Well, you were supposed to play like once or like a couple times for 2 weeks, but you can do it all in one day if you want.’</p>



<p>I played for like 12 hours, I think. And it was like $1 mil flat. That was the biggest condensed sponsor I’ve ever taken.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It seems bizarre to think a streamer can make that much money for broadcasting a game for half a day, but that’s the world we live in. It’s a fact that content is king, and developers and publishers would rather stump up for a group of streamers to play their game than opt for traditional marketing approaches these days.</p>



<p>While that’s axiomatic, xQc is perhaps an exceptional circumstance, as not <strong>every </strong>big streamer out there will secure such a massive bag for a simple, single stream.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Delta Force is in the midst of a huge leap, spurred onwards by a massive update and a lucrative creator-backed content initiative. It has been such a roaring success that the game has <strong>breezed </strong>past similar shooters on Steam to land in the top five most-played games on the platform today.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, a whopping 138,120 people were playing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/delta-force/" id="878">Delta Force</a> on <strong>Steam alone</strong>, marking a huge overtaking of some of the biggest shooter franchises in the world.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-delta-force-soaring-on-steam">Why is Delta Force Soaring on Steam?</h2>



<p>Delta Force is revving up <strong>big time </strong>on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/steam/" id="173">Steam</a>, effortlessly overtaking games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" id="2795">Black Ops 7</a>, and it’s mostly because of the game’s eighth season – Morphosis. This supersized update has introduced incredible destruction, a new operator, and a fresh tweak on the game’s extraction mode, called Fiery Owl Hunt.</p>



<p>In the last few days, Delta Force viewers found themselves enjoying an enormous creator campaign backed by some of the biggest names in the business. The top-tier streaming community, represented by xQc, shroud, summit1g, TheBurntPeanut, NICKMERCS, and Nadeshot, all participated in the ‘Streamer Week’ initiative, backed by TiMi, the game’s developer.</p>



<p>This brought unreal eyes to the game, which was released in December 2024 but has recently seen a surge in players.</p>



<p>Going back a little, the new Fiery Owl Hunt mode introduced in Morphosis is a limited-time event that allows players to step into the shoes of an in-game <strong>boss character</strong>, Saeed. This was a hit with extraction fans, offering up a perspective <strong>never before seen </strong>in the space.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Delta Force occupied the fifth-place spot in Steam’s leaderboard, sitting above Rust and behind the likes of PUBG and Counter-Strike 2. By comparison, Battlefield 6 sat in 52nd place with 27,500 players, while Call of Duty was in the 45th spot, with 30,300 players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rainbow Six, Escape from Tarkov, Apex Legends, ARC Raiders… They all sat below Delta Force.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Helldivers 2’s Cyborg Legion is Back, New Trailer Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-cyborg-legion-return/</link>
            <guid>1429795</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Helldivers 2 countdown that was running recently has <strong>ended</strong>, resulting in the publishing of a super short trailer that has unveiled a revelation: the Cyborg Legion is <strong>back</strong>.</p>



<p>This means that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/helldivers-2/" id="850">Helldivers 2</a> players are about to come face to face with former citizens of Super Earth, once defeated and now rising back up with a threat. If Cyberstan is attacked, their retribution will be swiftly felt across the galaxy. This is a throwback to the original Helldivers game, and fans are here for every second of it.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-cyborg-legion-is-back-beware">The Cyborg Legion is Back – Beware!</h2>



<p>Cyberstan, for the uninitiated, is a hostile world in the Helldivers universe, populated by ‘former’ humans augmented with cybernetic abilities, used originally to withstand harsh working conditions. They foster a hatred for humans and have dubbed Cyberstan their homeworld, despite originally coming from Super Earth.</p>



<p>Here’s the short teaser trailer that dropped after the Helldivers 2 countdown ended recently:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="01001000 01000101 01001100 01001100 01001111 00100000 01010111 01001111 01010010 01001100 01000100" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJSxy5uc0aQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The video’s description was written entirely in binary, but a simple translation tool uncovers the meaning behind it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>DET HÄR ÄR ER SISTA CHANS. ÅTERGÅ GENAST.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s Swedish, in case you don’t recognize the characters. The game’s developer, Arrowhead, is, of course, located in Sweden. Here’s the English translation of the message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE. RETURN IMMEDIATELY.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Helldivers 2 fans are now pondering the implications of this message. Will residents of Super Earth launch an attack on Cyberstan, or will the Cyborg Legion launch the first initiative and attack en masse with renewed, unseen strength?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-anran-actor-bags-on-ozempic-chic-design/</link>
            <guid>1429723</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fareeha, a content creator and actor, recently announced on social media that <strong>she’s </strong>the voice of Anran in Overwatch. The newly-added character has been making impressions of late, but Fareeha wanted to take the profile of her addition and go a different way entirely with her feedback.</p>



<p>In a three-minute video uploaded on social media, Fareeha revealed that she’s disappointed with her character’s design and that her vision wasn’t anything close to what Blizzard ultimately produced. She insinuated it falls within the realms of ‘Ozempic Chic’, with developers adhering to unrealistic body standards and producing only slim, traditionally attractive female characters.</p>







<p>Fareeha’s three-minute video has been met with a mixed reception on social media, with some aligning with her values while others have accused the creator of spreading a rhetoric that doesn’t belong in gaming.</p>



<p>She explained her stance on Anran’s design, stating that she had to address the ‘elephant in the room’ but didn’t want to ‘step on the devs’ toes’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I got to mourn Anran between the design I had hoped for and the design we ended up with. Because I think in her comic and the cinematic element, there was a precedent set by it. There was an unspoken promise that said, ‘We’re going to challenge the beauty standards plaguing, ransacking media these days.’</p>



<p>The ‘Ozempic Chic’, the ‘contour your nose, you have no nose, the tiniest nose!’ And I think because of that precedent, people feel, understandably, let down.</p>



<p>Overwatch is a trailblazer at challenging that, right? Trying to break those moulds, trying to explore the bounds of what it means to be good, what it looks like to be heroic. And I think the result we got says something else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fareeha went on to suggest that Anran’s design ‘leaves a bad taste’ in the mouths of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch</a> fans. She suggests that the model’s design doesn’t match the character’s energy and personality because she’s ‘too docile’ and looks like ‘the younger sister’.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm the voice of Anran in Overwatch!!! 🧡</p><p>I held off on posting about this because I wanted to make sure I could do this discussion justice. Here's a shot at that! </p><p>Let's keep rooting for the version of her that could be. I hope you have so much fun playing her!! 🔥🪭 <a href="https://t.co/jbFbKHPVpb">pic.twitter.com/jbFbKHPVpb</a></p></div>— Fareeha (@AskFareeha) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskFareeha/status/2020291256279089431?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Admittedly, the difference between Anran’s design in the game’s cinematics and in <strong>the game </strong>is pretty obvious, which is a huge sticking point for fans. But some took her words to mean that she’s angry that her character is ‘attractive and thin’.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that the average gamer has taken a hugely judgmental approach to gauging the success of a game based on how its characters look. Just days ago, we saw similar comments surface regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-new-horizon-multiplayer-game/">reveal of Hunter’s Gathering</a>, a multiplayer game set in the Horizon world, which features a heavy-set female character that instantly became the subject of ridicule.</p>



<p>It was the same thing with Concord in 2024.</p>



<p>Do you think Fareeha is right to be concerned about her character’s design, or is it not that deep? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Our friends at XboxEra have today unveiled a rebrand that pivots the platform away from a focused identity to a wider, more general gaming perspective. Going forward, XboxEra will be known as ‘DayOne’, a rebrand that goes hand-in-hand with a new website, membership service, and a teaser for an upcoming video game backed by the team.</p>



<p>The team at DayOne explained that this monumental shift <em>‘refocuses (them) on what this is ultimately all about – playing great video games.’</em></p>



<h2 id="h-one-xbox-era-ends-another-begins">One (Xbox)Era Ends, Another Begins</h2>



<p>The team at XboxEra has performed a major rebrand, taking the popular news platform and turning it <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/02/08/xboxera-is-changing-welcome-to-dayone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">into DayOne</a>, a multi-faceted brand aimed at representing the wider gaming market. In a statement issued to Insider Gaming, DayOne’s Jon Clarke explained the need for the change after many years in the business:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When XboxEra launched, the name made a lot of sense. We wanted to build a website focused on Xbox, built by people that actually played there. It was just before the dawn of a new generation and it’s been a pretty crazy time – and it’s fair to say a lot has changed!</p>



<p>Ultimately as time went on, we found ourselves covering – and wanting to cover – more than just Xbox. PC, VR, Nintendo and PlayStation – and all of the industry turbulence, news and culture that came with it. </p>



<p>Beyond all of that though, DayOne refocuses us on what this is ultimately all about – playing great video games, and bringing our readers the best in news, reviews and previews – on day one. It’s a name that we feel ultimately honours our roots and where we came from, but gives us complete freedom to make our corner of the internet even more awesome. </p>



<p>We’re looking to have our new site and membership service live after testing with our community over the course of this month. <strong>It’s going to be a very busy year</strong>!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rebrand coincides with the team’s <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/02/08/the-xboxera-podcast-episode-300-celebration-brings-in-some-big-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">300th podcast episode</a>, furthering the cause for celebration. That same podcast will now also be rebranded, adopting the name ‘DayOne Podcast’.</p>



<p>Since 2019, XboxEra has existed in one form or another, starting as that podcast that evolved into a wider news platform. The team reported that 2025 was their biggest year yet for readership, growth, and milestones.</p>



<p>Also, in the most recent episode of the podcast, the team teased the upcoming launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/console-wars-the-card-game-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Console Wars: The Card Game</a> in <strong>video game </strong>form, expanding on the TCG that they developed and released last year.</p>
