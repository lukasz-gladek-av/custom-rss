<p>Nadia Amine, a streamer with a fairly bad reputation, was booted from a Delta Force ‘streamer showdown’ following an investigation into some allegations made against her. </p>



<p>On social media, Team Jade announced that Nadia would be one of many streamers invited to take part in a special event. When users started mentioning her ‘history’ with cheats – most notably in Call of Duty: Warzone – Team Jade said it would ‘investigate further’…</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-booted">Booted</h2>



<p>Team Jade ultimately removed Nadia from the Delta Force streamer event. The team scrubbed her from the line-up of content creators without so much as a single word on social media. This came after Team Jade posted a reply to the allegations of past cheating:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to our community for bringing this matter to our attnetion – we are now investigating further.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1865148372459647135/photo/2">Jake Lucky on Twitter</a> for the receipts</em></p>



<p>Team Jade has since deleted that post – but nothing can truly disappear from the internet, right?</p>



<p>By way of a response, Nadia launched into a rant against Team Jade, and she too came with her own receipts on the post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These guys are so unprofessional. They made a tweet about investigating me, their talent, becuase people believe everything they see and spread lies about me. They deleted their tweet, I asked for a public apology, they told me to wait and are checking with the publisher.</p>



<p>I told them I’m going to go public with me leaving, and then they told me again to wait so they can ‘coordinate with their team’. But then, they go public with me not being a talent anymore first, which then makes me look guilty.</p>



<p>After they are the ones who told me to hold off on going public. What kind of f***ing business is this?!!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nadia has admittedly flip-flopped on the cheating bit for the longest time. She rose to notoriety on Call of Duty: Warzone while riding that wave, and even went as far as to make tongue-in-cheek references to being a cheater on social media and streams.</p>



<p>Ultimately, nothing has been definitively proven, even if sleuth gamers have taken to TikTok and other video-sharing platforms to reveal frame-by-frame playbacks of Nadia’s clips.</p>

<p><strong>LATEST UPDATE 4:25pm EST:</strong> Path of Exile 2 still isn’t available for players hoping to enjoy the start of early access  as more issues have come up for the developers.  The game’s official social media account posted, “We’ve run into the same symptom again with a different problem. We are working on fixing it again but regrettably every time this happens we have to restart and wipe the databases to prevent them getting into bad or corrupted states. We’ll have a fix out as soon as we can!”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: The early access launch of Path of Exile 2 has been delayed due to database</p>



<p>The game was originally scheduled to launch at 2pm EST. Just before that time, and with a larger than expected number of players eager to jump into the game, developer Grinding Gear Games decided to do “last minute database upgrades” in order to allow the game’s servers to handle the influx of players. </p>



<p>The delay comes hours after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-ii-queue-warning-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers warned of long queue times</a> for players on launch day.</p>



<p>After the database configuration was deployed, the <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865098006934229066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">team said</a> that it would only take a “half hour” to get access restored to the game. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case after another issue was found within the game.</p>



<p>First, there was a crash that “would have affected a majority of users” that was fixed and being deployed before final checks. Following stating that the release was “relatively imminent”, yet another problem arose for the game.</p>



<p>“We’ve run into a configuration problem and need to restart the realm,” they said. “The problem we ran into was due to adding more database shards in the last minute to try to support the massive player numbers. Unfortunately there was an issue which caused multiple characters to have the same character id.”</p>



<p>As of publishing, not only is the early access launch delayed but the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3594080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a> has been going offline due to players looking for updates.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide an update when Path of Exile 2 is functioning and available.</p>
