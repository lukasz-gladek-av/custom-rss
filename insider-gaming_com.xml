            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of yet another week, and hopefully, you’re maintaining that NYT Connections streak. If you’re just starting out, I’m still here for you, providing the best NYT Connections hints you’ll find anywhere. Today’s puzzle is a trickier one in that respect, as very few of the words seem to relate to one another.</p>



<p>Regardless, I’ve got you covered with the NYT Connections solutions for today’s puzzle. Read on to learn what you need to know.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-16">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 16)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #889:</p>



<ul>
<li>RUGBY SHIRT</li>



<li>PEDESTRIAN</li>



<li>APPROACH</li>



<li>AVENUE</li>



<li>BARCODE</li>



<li>EVERYDAY</li>



<li>SCHOOL</li>



<li>TAX</li>



<li>IBM LOGO</li>



<li>BANAL</li>



<li>RAILROAD</li>



<li>PHILOSOPHY</li>



<li>HUMDRUM</li>



<li>ZEBRA</li>



<li>METHOD</li>



<li>PARKING</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about the way someone “goes about” something, not the thing itself.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>This set sits firmly in the realm of routine and low sparkle.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Don’t just look for animals—think design language and uniform aesthetics.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Zero in on square names, board events, and charges you might encounter while circling the track.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 16.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Fans Have Strong Opinions on Black Ops 7 Campaign]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-reddit-reactions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-fans-have-strong-opinions-on-black-ops-7-campaign.1354912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With Black Ops 7 now on the market, Call of Duty fans have expressed their opinions on the game’s campaign. However, the reactions are a bit underwhelming than what they expected.</p>







<p>In Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the campaign brings the series back to the Mason family, particularly David. The family, which was featured from Black Ops to Black Ops 2, has taken a back seat until now. With Black Ops 7, the campaign, fully multiplayer, takes players on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nightmare-induced fever dream</a> where the team, including David, confronts Menendez and The Guild. Compared to other titles, especially last year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-black-ops-6-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, it’s a bit of a crazy one. As you can expect, some have some strong opinions, good and bad, about how things were handled.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-campaign-garbage-lackluster-says-call-of-duty-fans">Black Ops 7 Campaign ‘Garbage’, ‘Lackluster’, Says Call of Duty Fans</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since Black Ops 7’s release, the Call of Duty Reddit has been going through the motions, in a way. The reactions towards the game have ranged from hot garbage to series-best. However, there is a common thread between them: the game’s co-op campaign is not great. In a Reddit post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/cod_the_warzonification_and_zombification_of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AdBudget5468</a>, the user argues that the success of other modes like Zombies and Warzone have ‘ruined’ campaigns, with Black Ops 7 being a prime example. </p>



<p>In the comments, many fans expressed the same reaction. For some, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/novr5x3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Solid_Snek120</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/noxcdq6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shadowdemon210</a>, it feels reminiscent of 2023’s Modern Warfare 3, which had a very controversial campaign. Others, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/novtolj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Top_Limit_</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1ox7epg/comment/nowr2da/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SetScary9216</a>, brought up how polished Black Ops 6’s campaign was and how Black Ops 7’s just doesn’t match up. </p>



<p>Currently, the game isn’t doing as hot as Activision may like. As it stands, Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t even reached 100k</a> while rival shooters ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 still get over 200k and even 300k on Steam. Despite this, the title will likely sell well, though it’s unknown just how well compared to other entries. Hopefully, as someone who enjoys the campaign, the next games can take from Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare and craft something all can enjoy without being a ploy to earn a battle royale mode.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[You Won’t Unlock The Full Tarkov Flea Market Until Level 40]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-flea-market-locked-level-40/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-won%E2%80%99t-unlock-the-full-tarkov-flea-market-until-level-40.1354804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update is here, and fans worldwide are enjoying it – or those who can <strong>access the game are</strong>, anyway. It’s the dawn of a new era for the stellar extraction shooter, which has grown over the last decade to become a staple of the industry and a leader of the genre.</p>



<p>The 1.0 update brings stacks of changes, and one that players are struggling to contend with concerns the game’s <strong>Flea Market </strong>mechanic. It has been discovered that ‘categories’ of the Flea Market are locked until you progress to a fairly high level.</p>







<h2 id="h-flea-market-locked-down-again">Flea Market Locked Down Again</h2>



<p>The latest changes to Escape from Tarkov have been a mixed bag. On one hand, the new map, faction, weapons, and 1,000 bug fixes are welcome, but the shattered servers that are having issues hosting the hundreds of thousands of players trying to get into the game, we can do without.</p>



<p>One change that’s proving to be divisive is the alteration made to the game’s Flea Market, the peer-to-peer trading solution that allows users to buy and sell gear they find, craft, or steal.</p>



<p>With 1.0, players are now being forced to hit minimum level requirements to open up sections of the Flea Market, with certain categories remaining under lock for quite some time.&nbsp;The base Flea Market unlocks at Level 15 as always, but there are higher restrictions now in terms of levels.</p>



<p>Here’s what we’ve seen so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bolt-action rifles – Level 20</li>



<li>Assault rifles – Level 25</li>



<li>Marksman rifles – Level 25</li>



<li>Backpacks – Level 25</li>



<li>Foregrips – Level 20</li>



<li>Light and laser devices – Level 25</li>



<li>Muzzle devices – Level 20</li>
</ul>



<p>It gets a bit more extreme in some places:</p>



<ul>
<li>Barter items – Level 30</li>



<li>Gear components – Level 30</li>



<li>Injectors – Level 30</li>



<li>Keycards – Level 30</li>
</ul>



<p>And some high-tier ammo will remain locked for a very long time:</p>



<ul>
<li>PS12B – Level 40</li>



<li>M80 – Level 35</li>



<li>Blackout CJB – Level 40</li>
</ul>

<p>This is believed to be an effort to counter cheaters trying to participate in RMT (real-money trading), but it has rubbed some fans the wrong way.</p>

The film has cast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link and Zelda</a>, but the rest of the cast has yet to be revealed. With filming underway, the process has been done and, with a new video leak, we may know who’s playing one of Zelda’s biggest supporters.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCALkNk0Nl/?igsh=MW40OGJvOXRqamx0Zw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the leaked video on Instagram</a>, a figure can be seen lecturing Zelda and granting her a sword. As we only know Link and Zelda’s actors, seeing a new person on set does indicate more has been added. With them lecturing Zelda, one could assume the character is Impa, Zelda’s Sheikan guardian. Given that some versions of the character can range in age, it seems the film could be taking notes from the younger version shown in Ocarina of Time and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-release-date-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1oxjpdt/movie_there_is_leaked_footage_of_the_zelda_movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fans on Reddit were quick</a> to point out that the actress in the Legend of Zelda movie video leak looked strikingly familiar to Severance’s Dichen Lachman, who played counselor Ms. Casey in the popular Apple TV+ series. The actress has grown into a household name with Severance, as well as big roles in Neighbors, Jurassic World Dominion, and in the upcoming second season of Netflix’ The Last Airbender.&nbsp;Interestingly enough, the actress did star in Wes Ball’s last film, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.&nbsp;Regardless, no official confirmation has been made on the casting, so take it and the leak with a grain of salt. However, if the fans’ reactions are proof enough, the actress would be perfect as Impa.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Concord has gone down in infamy as an all-time Sony and PlayStation blunder. It’s also understandable that the company wants to sweep the game’s existence under the rug, which is why Sony has presumably and swiftly issued DMCAs notices to gameplay videos of a fan-inspired Concord reboot, causing access to the game to be halted.</p>



<p>We don’t think much needs to be said about Concord at this point. The live-service shooter apparently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-cost-over-400-million-to-develop-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost over $400 million to develop</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team behind it was quickly shut down by Sony</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation took Concord offline within days of launch</a>.</p>



<p>Now, a community effort to resurrect the game has been met with strong action.</p>







<h2 id="h-sony-issues-dmcas-to-concord-pc-revival">Sony Issues DMCAs To Concord PC Revival</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Burn it down. Credit to Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>We reported on November 14 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-pc-fan-made-multiplayer-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord got a playable fan-made revival on PC</a>. Users cleverly managed to get custom Concord servers up and running—requiring special access to let you play.</p>



<p>What seemed like innocent fun has quickly turned into the gaze of Sony being cast upon them.</p>



<p>A dev post in the Concord Delta Discord updated everyone on a serious development:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>It transpires that gameplay videos of the Concord project had made their way to YouTube. DMCA action was immediately imposed by MarkScan—a name that works a lot on Sony’s behalf. If you add the facts up, it’s fairly obvious to see what’s happened.</p>



<p>As a result, the Concord PC project and servers are on hold, and unless something drastic changes, it probably means Sony is once again responsible for the death of Concord.</p>



<p>Is it better that we all move on from Concord at this point? Or is it a shame to see a handful of people who cared about the short-lived shooter have their hard work up in flmaes? The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is the perfect place to share your thoughts.</p>
