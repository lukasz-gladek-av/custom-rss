<p>Some new footage of DOOM: The Dark Ages has leaked online ahead of the Xbox Developer Direct on January 23.</p>



<p>The footage was uploaded by YouTube Gougaru, who seemingly has recorded some footage of DOOM: The Dark Ages at a behind-the-scenes presentation. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p><br>The gameplay footage gives a brief walkthrough of some of the locations in the game. Still, while the footage leaked before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox developer direct</a>, it’s understood that the gameplay originates from a tech demo of some kind, likely showcasing the latest series of graphics cards.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources who have seen a preview of DOOM at the Xbox Developer Direct, the in-depth look will show more gameplay instead of map overviews.</p>



<p>Yesterday, DOOM: The Dark Ages <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked to be released on May 15, 2025</a> for the Xbox Series S|X, PC, and PlayStation 5. SOOM: The Dark Ages marks the game as one of Microsoft’s first “exclusives” to release day and date on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As for what else to expect during the Xbox Developer Direct, Xbox has announced that South of Midnight and Expedition 33 will also be having in-depth showcases, while a fourth “unknown” game will also be revealed.</p>



<p>“You are the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior and the super weapon in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell,” the official DOOM: The Dark Ages description reads.</p>



<p>The game is narratively set as a prequel to the 2016 DOOM title, which sold 2 million copies by July 2017 (before Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda, where the game released multiplatform). </p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is currently scheduled to release on March 20. The game was originally scheduled to release on November 15, 2024 before being delayed to February 14, 2025. The game was delayed again earlier this month to it’s, hopeful, final release date.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1881793638923149513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson</a> has heard that there is “a lot of positive buzz” around the game after the delays allowed developers to polish the game in various areas.</p>



<p>Aside from Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft is working on a number of Assassin’s Creed projects such as Hexe, a Black Flag remake, it’s Fall Guys-like game, and more. Ubisoft is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still in talks with Tencent</a> about the future of the company. There have been discussions of taking the company private as its shares have continued to fall in recent years. Ubisoft also say the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end of its free-to-play Call of Duty competitor XDefiant</a> after it failed to make enough money for the company to keep it going.</p>

<p>Ted Price, founder and president of Insomniac Games, is retiring from the company he started in 1994. The news comes via an <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> on Sony’s website.</p>



<p>Price is set to leave his position in March after 31 years.</p>



<p>“I actually made this decision last year,” he said. “For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“During the past year, I had the opportunity to work with the senior leadership team at Insomniac to create a succession plan that I know will provide the continuity, stability and strong leadership necessary to deliver more of what our fans cherish over the next several decades.”</p>



<p>With Price leaving the company, Insomniac Games will be lead by three new Co-Studio heads: Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang.</p>



<p>“I believe strongly that for us to continue our success, we need leaders at the top who are intimately familiar with how we do things, leaders who have helped build our culture and our processes, and who have earned people’s trust,” Price said.</p>



<p>“There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights. Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team. For those who may not be familiar, please take a moment to get to know them here.”</p>



<p>In a statement on the official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, Dezern, Schneider, and Huang expressed gratitude for the opportunity to head the studio moving forward.</p>



<p>“Our shared intention is to preserve what has made Insomniac special for 30-plus years while exploring how we can strategically evolve to succeed for decades to come,” they said. “We’ll continue prioritizing our studio culture, built around transparency and collaboration. We strive for a workplace where employees can do the best work of their careers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>First started in 1994 as Xtreme Software, Insomniac Games is known for franchises such as Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and, more recently, the Marvel Spider-Man games. The studio is currently working on a number of projects, including Marvel’s Wolverine. Insomniac was acquired by Sony in 2019.</p>

<p>A new 3D Mario and A Legend of Zelda remake are coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025. At least, that’s according to one store listing online.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">popular e-tailer Newegg</a>, the product description for a $50 Nintendo eShop Gift Card mentions a number of games coming in 2025. According to that description, which you can see below, 2025 will feature “Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, A Legend of Zelda Remake/Remaster, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, Pokemon Legends: Z-A”.</p>







<p>A new Mario Kart was already confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-9-could-feature-new-24-player-races/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the reveal trailer</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2. A new 3D Mario and A Legend of Zelda Remake have been rumored and expected, but there’s been nothing in the form of a confirmation from Nintendo. While this can’t be viewed as a confirmation, either, it’s still something from a major storefront.</p>
