<p>A sequel to A Minecraft Movie is officially in the works, complete with a June 2027 release.</p>



<p>The worldwide sensation Minecraft has kept players occupied with its world-building fun since 2011. Millions of fans have purchased the game, and it has become a household name since. This year, Warner Bros. released a movie adaptation of the game, called A Minecraft Movie. Needless to say, it is currently the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-highest-grossing film of 2025</a>. Now, after months of speculation, it seems we’ll be returning to the mines real soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-sequel-releasing-on-june-27th-2027-director-returning">A Minecraft Movie Sequel Releasing on June 27th, 2027, Director Returning</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AMinecraftMovie/status/1976341544266498142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> post, it was announced that A Minecraft Movie sequel is officially in the works. It’s unknown what the sequel will be named. Furthermore, the original director, Jared Hess, will return to do the second one. With a poster showing two shiny pickaxes, we also have a release date: June 27th, 2027. The date does place it with to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-simpsons-movie-coming-after-almost-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons Movie 2</a>, so it’s sure to be a big day for the box office.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it’s unknown if any of the original cast will return for the sequel. Even more so, we don’t know about the plot, as it’s being kept under wraps for now. Despite that, the movie is sure to be just as popular, especially since it knows what worked. Countless memes like “Chicken Jockey” and “I am Steve” flooded the internet even before its release and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even caused uproars</a> in theaters. Warner Bros. is aware of it and honed in on it for marketing, which likely caused its box-office soar. It’ll be interesting to see how it fares out and if it’ll keep the charm many fans enjoyed.</p>

<p>One of VR’s biggest music games is launching an all-new entry, Synth Riders: Overdrive, on the Nintendo Switch later this year.</p>



<p>The music action genre is one not explored as much as it should be. Games like Rhythm Heaven, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-aaron-greenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and the upcoming Unbeatable bring the beats and fun, but the genre still unexplored. However, the VR space, led by Beat Saber, has been a beacon of groovy gameplay and entertainment. One such game was 2019’s Synth Riders, which has launched on multiple VR platforms like Oculus Rift and PSVR. The game mixes Tron-like cyberpunk visuals with music-based gameplay featuring today’s biggest songs. Its success with fans and critics left its mark on them and, now, the acclaimed series is returning, this time for the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Announced today with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfeXfq44AiM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new trailer</a>, developer Kluge Interactive revealed that Synth Riders: Overdrive, a new game in the series, is coming to the Nintendo Switch. Made from the ground up, the title brings the music-filled gameplay to newer audiences, along with the addition of multiplayer and story mode. With three difficulty modes, you can play through dozens of pop songs from artists like Charli XCX, Jack Harlow, Starcadian, and more. In a statement from Kluge, founder and CEO Arturo Perez said the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“As experts in music rhythm games who’ve created a successful VR immersive experience, we’re excited to bring our expertise and passion for music to Nintendo Switch gamers with Synth Riders: Overdrive,” states Perez. “The Switch’s portability and local multiplayer capabilities make it the perfect platform for friends and families to experience this fast-paced musical adventure together.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Synth Riders: Overdrive plans to release before the end of 2025, with DLC already in the works featuring Gorillaz and Monster Cat. More information can be found on <a href="http://synthriders.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s official website</a>, as well as on social media.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced that it’s adding two classic Heroes of Might &amp; Magic games to the Xbox Game Pass library. </p>



<p>Starting today, October 9, both Heroes of Might and Magic II: Gold and Heroes of Might and Magic III: Complete are available for all members on the platform. The games will be available on PC for PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p>



<p>“I can think of no better way to teach a new generation the meaning of key words like throng, necromancy, and logistics,” Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB2kNoEMd70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Watters said</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to the games being added to the service, it was also revealed that Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era’s Early Access release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-early-access-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was being pushed to 2026</a>. To fill in the gap between now and the launch, however, developers Unfrozen have released a demo on PC via Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After originally being scheduled for a release in Q2 2025, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era’s Early Access has been pushed to 2026. A specific window for the year wasn’t announced.</p>



<p>As part of Ubisoft’s celebration of the Might &amp; Magic franchise’s 30th anniversary, it was also revealed that the Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era demo is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241970/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam.</a></p>



<p>First announced during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-announced-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamescom 2024</a>, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is the eighth installment of the long-running turn-based strategy game. It’s the first title in the series since 2015’s Might &amp; Magic Heroes VII.</p>



<p>The game features six factions at launch—Temple, Necropolis, Sylvan, Dungeon, Hive, and Schism—as well as several modes, including campaign, random single maps, custom maps, local multiplayer, and online multiplayer with modes like classic, single-hero, and arena. </p>



<p>Online multiplayer, for the first time in series history, will even feature general matchmaking that allows you to quickly jump into a game with other players.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned, the game was first set to launch in Q2 2025, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed in June</a> to “later in 2025”. At the time, Unfrozen said it was done to “ensure we give Olden Era the care it deserves”.</p>



<p><strong>“From the beginning, our goal has been to create something truly special, and that takes time, care, and iteration,”</strong> they said. <strong>“However, as an indie studio, we need a bit more time to get everything ready for the big Early Access release.”</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox founder has recently discussed the Game Pass price hikes, describing them as a betrayal of fans and “greed over gaming”. </p>



<p>For those unaware, at the beginning of October 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Game Pass Ultimate’s price would be raised by 50% and that its tier features would change. The players have definitely not taken this move well, given that Xbox console prices <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-revenue-growth-microsoft-is-raising-xbox-console-prices-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were increased just last month</a>. Now, the Xbox founder has shared their views on the Game Pass price hikes. </p>



<h2 id="h-game-pass-price-hikes-are-shattering-the-brand-and-alienating-loyal-fans">Game Pass Price Hikes Are “Shattering the Brand and Alienating Loyal Fans”</h2>



<p>Xbox founder Laura Fryer recently released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGh1-W-nYQA&amp;t=282s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a> (via <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-game-pass-price-hike-laura-fryer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WCCFtech</a>) discussing the recent Game Pass price hikes. Fryer immediately called out the leadership, stating that she doesn’t know whether they understand “what makes Xbox great”. Fryer isn’t sure if the leadership is aware of what the community wants, as they keep “doubling down on decisions” that make it seem they are in a bubble where the “feedback doesn’t reach them anymore.”</p>



<p>Fryer adds, “That yes man culture that took over in 2008 has only gotten worse, and this is the result, a crazy price increase for their fans after announcing that Game Pass had made $5 billion.” She talks about how Xbox has failed to keep content costs stable and the leadership has forgotten “how to make games at scale”, which has led to many layoffs and cancellations. </p>



<p>The Xbox founder talks about how Xbox has thrown away one of its last advantages by increasing Game Pass prices, which had been “the best deal in gaming”. The price hike “feels like a betrayal, like greed over gaming”. </p>
