<p>In a recent post on Reddit, several RuneScape users started discussing a survey they were privy to from Jagex. The survey pertained to membership changes in Runescape, and it opened with several video clips and then screenshots of <strong>many </strong>options for potential membership packages and tiers.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to notice that some of these tiers and options were nothing short of shocking, with some requesting payment but still including ads, while others put ‘enhanced player support’ and ‘account security features’ behind sizeable paywalls.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beginning-of-the-end">Beginning of the End</h2>



<p>It’s not a new concept for RuneScape – the monetisation model has been around for quite some time (more than 20 years), but owing to inflation, the costs are increasing. In a recent survey that was shared on Reddit, it was revealed that Jagex intends to make membership tiers more lucrative and loaded with bonus features, but players have come away from the revelation feeling disappointed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1i2c8ig/heres_what_the_full_survey_looks_like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Reddit</a> revealed many membership tiers, which users were requested to give feedback on.</p>



<p>As the tiers went higher, the price rose considerably, with one month sitting at $10.99 for the lowest tier, while the highest tier had a price point of around $32.49 in some images. The features of these tiers also changed dramatically, starting with elements like:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Ads included’</li>



<li>Mobile-only access</li>



<li>Shorter AFK timer</li>
</ul>



<p>And quickly ascending to features including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improved data access</li>



<li>Pre-verified account recovery</li>



<li>Name reservations</li>



<li>Pause membership</li>



<li>Enhanced player support</li>



<li>Advanced account security features</li>
</ul>



<p>It sounds obvious, but with these new proposals, the more you pay, the more you get. However, charging around $10 – $14 a month and still including ads in the bundle feels bizarre at best. On top of that, users will be charged up to $15 for additional member characters <strong>per month</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of one of these tier bundles:</p>

<p>Put simply, you could end up paying more than $300 a year to play RuneScape with all the bells and whistles attached, some of which players are arguing should be inherently included in <strong>any </strong>RuneScape account. Paying for security features and player support just feels strange and a little like being cheated.</p>



<p>What do you think of these bundles and tiers? Would you pay this much to play RuneScape? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
