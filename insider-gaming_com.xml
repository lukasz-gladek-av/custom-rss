<p>BioWare’s headcount is . According to a new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the company now sits at less than 100 employees after having over 200 people just two years ago.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODM1MTgzMSwiZXhwIjoxNzM4OTU2NjMxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUVlXVThUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.91ztnslkcG02JwTwRRfVCXIJp8FOdqGBjCNQgz-bE8k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The report says</a> that a number of employees who were put “temporarily” on new teams were informed that those moves were permanent. No longer were they BioWare employees helping out in a different area. </p>



<p>Schreier’s report also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-bioware-employees-worried-about-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-bioware-employees-worried-about-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborates </a>Insider Gaming’s exclusive report that “dozens” of people were let go as part of this wave of layoffs at the studio.</p>

<p>“If they want to work at BioWare again in the future, they would have to look for job openings and re-apply,” Schreier writes. He adds that, for now at least, a small team will  work on the next game in the Mass Effect series. This team is being led by “company veteran who oversaw the development on the original trilogy as well as on 2019’s&nbsp;Anthem”. The goal is to then expand as needed later on in production.</p>







<p>As sources told Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-moves-some-employees-to-other-ea-projects-while-developing-mass-effect-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the memo</a> from BioWare was released, there is still an internal evaluation being done in order to see where things can be improved. There is still a worry from those who spoke under the condition of anonymity that more layoffs and moves within the studio are coming.</p>



<p>Neither EA nor BioWare have responded to multiple requests for comment on the state of things at the studio.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty League’s Major I tournament is unravelling in Madrid as we speak. It’s the first major CDL event in Europe in several years, and the fans are <strong>electric</strong>. One player who wants to see more events in Europe is OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy, who I caught up with after OpTic’s close win over LA Guerrillas M8.</p>



<p>It has been <strong>many years </strong>since Call of Duty esports (outside of Warzone) landed in London, but that’s a fan – and a player – favourite for a future event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-love-the-eu-crowd">‘I Love The EU Crowd’</h2>



<p>Speaking after a 3 – 2 win over LAG that was closer than many people expected, Shotzzy revealed his love for the EU crowd:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I love the EU crowd, they’re insane. I love y’all.</p>



<p>I will say you guys are definitely the better crowd than NA, but obviously we love NA, so.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When I probed and asked if Shotzzy wanted to go anywhere else in Europe, he revealed: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d say London. I had a really bad interview back then, in London, so I’ve got to get my get back.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic’s Huke, who started with the team following Pred’s sudden departure last year, mirrored Shotzzy’s sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think the EU crowd is crazy, I’m not going to lie – in a good way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic Texas came into Major I as the first seed, but a 2 – 3 loss handed down by the Miami Heretics (damn that curse) sent the team into the elimination bracket. Following a win over LAG M8, OpTic now moves forward to face the Carolina Royal Ravens.</p>



<p>At the first CDL Minor tournament, the Royal Ravens forcefully ejected OpTic Texas from the running, before being promptly eliminated by FaZe. Could this be an opportunity for OpTic Texas to, as Shotzzy puts it, ‘get their get back’?</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more of the latest news from the CDL Major I tournament in Madrid.</p>
