<p>Transformers Reactivate gameplay leaked online after Splash Damage announced the game would be canceled.</p>



<p>Uploading by the X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/DpzLuna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@DpzLuna</a>, six and half minutes of footage reveal what the game would have been like. According to the watermarks, the footage was captured on March 28, 2023. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>







<p>The footage shows the player driving around in a car and seamessly transforming into a transformer to battle enemies.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, Splash Damage announced that Transformers Reactivate would be canceled and that a number of roles at the company are at risk of redundancy. Splash Damage said the company would “refocus” on some of its other projects.</p>



<p>“While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more,” they said. “We’re now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.”</p>



<p>Transformers Reactivate was first announced on December 8, 2022, and little about the game has been heard since then.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how many roles at Splash Damage have been affected, but Insider Gaming has contacted Splash Damage for comment.</p>
