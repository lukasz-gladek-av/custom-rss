<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why.

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout: The New West Reveal Trailer Posted With a Promise to Uncover ‘The Original Fallout 3’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-the-new-west-reveal-trailer-published/</link>
            <guid>1436596</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout/" id="311">Fallout</a> is a bustling realm that’s as much made up of the original projects by the developers as it is fan-made projects pieced together by those enthralled by the post-apocalyptic universe that emerged in the late 1990s. The latest entry into that world, Fallout: The New West, is no different, but it’s one of the more ambitious concepts to surface in recent years.</p>



<p>Fallout: The New West is a fan-made project that aims to remake the cancelled Fallout: Van Buren, which many die-hard fans have always dubbed ‘the original Fallout 3’. It’s what might have been had the original team not hit a patch of financial distress and shifted focus away from the series, ultimately selling the label to Bethesda Game Studios.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-the-new-west-revives-what-might-have-been">Fallout: The New West Revives What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>Van Buren was canned in 2003 after months of development at Black Isle Studios. It would have been the third major release in the series, bearing the name ‘Fallout 3’ and taking players to the American southwest, around Colorado. Coincidentally, that’s where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-fallout-set-colorado-season-two-explained/" id="174234">the next season</a> of the Fallout television show is headed.</p>



<p>It was never to be, and in 2008, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda/" id="419">Bethesda Game Studios</a> released Fallout 3, a monumental overhaul to the series and a real risk-taker of a game, after acquiring the licenses from Interplay and Black Isle.</p>



<p>Now, a group of dedicated modders is bringing Van Buren back to life with Fallout: The New West. It’s a complete conversion mod that promises to transform Fallout: New Vegas, telling the ‘same broad story envisioned by Fallout: Van Buren.’ On the website for Fallout: The New West, the game’s narrative was outlined, and by all accounts, it’s an ambitious stab at a near-forgotten game.</p>



<p>Days ago, The United West Team, the group assembling The New West, posted the first teaser trailer for the mod:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout: The New West Reveal Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KY5X0G_05h0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>At the time of writing, the trailer had garnered more than 100,000 views and hundreds of positive comments. One user wrote, <em>‘For a moment, I thought this was from Bethesda and went, ‘Oh, so they were actually cooking.’ As always, it’s the community that keeps Fallout alive.’</em></p>



<p>Fallout: The New West actually surfaced around five years ago. In May 2021, the team at The United West announced plans to piece the mod together, but back then, it was dubbed Fallout Revelation Blue. Back then, it was noted that Fallout: The New West <strong>would not </strong>treat New Vegas as canonical.</p>



<p>One thing is for sure, and that’s that Bethesda’s Todd Howard probably won’t play this mod either, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-no-interest-fallout-4-mod-london/" id="167864">effectively snubbing Fallout: London</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bloober-team/" id="1451">Bloober Team</a> officially reveals Layers of Fear 3, the next chapter in its psychological horror series.</p>



<p>Bloober Team previously teased a countdown clock that would expire on Valentine’s Day, featuring audio featuring a quote from The Sick Rose and a poem by William Blake.</p>



<p>The countdown clock was tied to the franchise’s 10th anniversary. It led to the reveal of Layers of Fear 3. The game’s tagline uses the same line from that poem heard in the audio, “Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.”</p>

<p>The Six Invitational 2026 comes to a head tomorrow in Paris, and it’s all down to just two teams: FaZe Clan and Team Secret. Following an intense tournament, the grand finalists are lined up and raring to go, but only one will walk out of the stadium with $1 million and the coveted Six Invitational trophy.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most valuable grand finals in esports, as even the second-place team takes a $450,000 check home. Let’s jump into everything you need to know about the Six Invitational 2026 grand final.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-2026-predictions-faze-clan-vs-team-secret">Six Invitational 2026 Predictions: FaZe Clan vs. Team Secret</h2>



<p>The Six Invitational is a tough one to call at this point. Even though only <strong>two teams remain</strong>, they’re very evenly matched as we run into the grand final. The group stage yielded similar results for both squads, with Team Secret having the edge, but FaZe Clan shone a little brighter during the playoffs.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that it’s FaZe Clan’s <strong>third </strong>grand final in a row at the Six Invitational, which is impressive by itself. Last year, the organization lifted the trophy in Boston after wiping Team BDS in the grand final, making up for a tough second-place finish on home turf in 2024.</p>



<p>Team Secret bloomed <strong>heavily </strong>last year, securing the win at the Esports World Cup, but FaZe Clan remains the favourite to lift the hammer this year in Paris. The community is behind FaZe Clan, but it’s <strong>close</strong>, and both teams are playing on neutral ground.</p>



<p>If you want to tune in, the grand final of the Six Invitational 2026 will start at 17:00 GMT, and you can expect some huge news from Ubisoft before it lands.</p>







<p>What are you thinking? Will we see an underdog upset from Team Secret, or will FaZe Clan go back-to-back at the Six Invitational? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
