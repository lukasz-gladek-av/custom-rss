<p>It has been revealed that Firing Range is returning to Call of Duty when Season 03 launches in Black Ops 6 on April 2. The map has been remastered by Treyarch, which was revealed earlier today on social media. This is the first time the map has been seen in a main multiplayer title since Black Ops 4 in 2018.</p>



<p>Home on the range, indeed.</p>

<h2 id="h-stacked-update">Stacked Update</h2>



<p>Season 03 is set to be one of the most impressive updates in modern Call of Duty history. It will see the return of Verdansk for the first time since 2021, when it was abruptly stripped from Warzone in favour of Caldera. The reappearance of Verdansk is expected to bring back millions of players, many of whom haven’t played Warzone since the map was taken out of the game.</p>



<p>Additionally, Activision’s teams have worked to bring back to life several fan-favourite weapons, such as the Kilo 141, AMAX, and HDR sniper rifle. There will be plenty to get your teeth into on April 2nd, which is when Season 03 goes live in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Treyarch has also revealed that Firing Range will return to Call of Duty on April 2. The remastered map represents one of the most iconic battlegrounds in Call of Duty history. It was a map that first appeared in Black Ops in 2010, and way back then, it was one of the most adored maps in the rotation. </p>











<p>There is plenty in store for Season 03 and beyond, and for once, it seems like Call of Duty is well and truly on the up. Are you excited about the return of Verdansk or Firing Range? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Corinne Busche, the director of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and longtime BioWare employee, has joined Wizards of the Coast’s Skeleton Key Studio. The news was confirmed in by Wizards of the Coast’s Dan Ayoub.</p>



<p>In a new interview with Stephen Totilo’s <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-preps-an-edgy-snake-eyes-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, Ayoub confirmed that Busche has joined the studio as a creative lead on a new game currently in production. It’s the studio’s first game since opening in 2022.</p>



<p>Skeleton Key had been working on two projects, but cut one of them in order to streamline its focus. Since then, Ayoub says that a “vast majority” of those who were working on the cancelled project have moved over to the unannounced game.</p>



<p>News of Busche’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure from BioWare</a> became public in January. The move comes after she spent 18 years at the Canadian-based studio. Busche has yet to comment publicly on her new role. At the time she said that she didn’t want people to “read too much” into her departure. </p>



<p>“I want to encourage everyone not to read too much into this,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/corinnebusche.bsky.social/post/3lfxyo5h5vk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">she said</a>. “This was my decision so I could continue making the kind of RPGs you (we) enjoy. Thank you for the outpouring of love and support. You mean the world to me.”</p>



<p>What do you think the new game in development at Skeleton Key is, and Dragon Age’s former director Busche joining the team?
