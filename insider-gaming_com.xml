<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s hype and status are bringing the game perilously close to that limbo state of an indie game and a AAA title. However, I think it’s still in the indie bracket, but Silksong’s price could reflect its years of development and content. Here’s the latest on its potential cost.</p>



<p>2025 has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong</a> go from the game on everyone’s wishlist for Nintendo Direct and State of Play showcases to being a literal wishlist item in preparation for its release. Team Cherry has worked diligently on one of the most anticipated indie sequels in history. It’s remained Steam’s most-wishlisted game for an eternity after all!</p>



<p>A bigger game and more content mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> probably won’t cost the same as its predecessor, though, so let’s see how much difference there might be.</p>

<p><strong>As of August 27, Hollow Knight: Silksong does not have an official price tag on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, or PC storefronts.</strong></p>



<p>We’re so close to launch, but Silksong’s price tag is mysteriously absent. <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10005908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation</a>, for example, simply says “Announced” and “Add to Wishlist.” Unless something changes, there’s every chance we won’t find out the full price until the game’s long-awaited September 4 release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-hollow-knight-silksong-going-to-cost">How Much is Hollow Knight: Silksong Going to Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Based on estimates, predictions, and the size of the game and overall project compared to the original Hollow Knight, we think Silksong is going to cost in the region of $24.99 to $29.99.</strong></p>



<p>Let me be clear, there is nothing definitive to suggest this. But 2017’s Hollow Knight was $14.99 at launch. Silksong is expected to be much bigger than the original—hence <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why it took so long to release</a>. </p>



<p>More bosses, more enemies, and more content usually mean more money to pay. If Silksong is anywhere near the level of Hollow Knight, it’s going to be worth it.</p>

<p>Square Enix is bringing the first part of the epic Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy to the Nintendo Switch 2. FF7 Intergrade arrives in 2025, and this is likely the first of two ports that make their way on Chocobo back to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>If you’ve been keeping up with the news, this announcement might not be that shocking. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-coming-to-switch-2-square-enix-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy Remake director Naoki Hamaguchi said the Nintendo Switch 2</a> “would have enough power to run the FINAL FANTASY VII remake series” back in May 2025. </p>



<p>It seems the Switch 2 can handle the JRPG after all.</p>

<p>The official Final Fantasy 7 <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account proudly announced Intergrade’s Switch 2 debut to the world on August 27.</p>



<p>“Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches this winter on Nintendo Switch 2, running at a stable 30 frames per second, offering smooth performance and crisp visuals,” a message said.</p>



<p>It didn’t specify <em>when </em>in Winter 2025 we could expect it. But it should mean many Christmas trees have a nice Final Fantasy 7 aura flowing off of them, like the Lifestream.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches this winter on Nintendo Switch 2, running at a stable 30 frames per second offering smooth performance and crisp visuals.</span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s unlikely the Switch 2 receives Final Fantasy 7 Intergrade and that’s it. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was a big hit, so I’d expect to see a port in the future. The third and final part should inevitably make its way over, too. </p>
