<p>ARC Raiders is a pretty challenging game when it comes to finding quest items and locations. It doesn’t <strong>entirely </strong>hold your hand and requires you to explore a little to get to the objectives you need to resolve the game’s many tasks. With that being said, there are a few ARC Raiders maps and resources you can rely on to get the fastest route possible to what you need.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll help you figure out what the best sites are for ARC Raiders maps.</p>



<h2 id="h-find-quest-objectives-in-arc-raiders-with-ease">Find Quest Objectives in ARC Raiders with Ease</h2>



<p>When it comes to playing extraction shooters, you’ll often need to rely on maps and wiki pages to track down what you need. It’s an inherently tricky genre that wants players to go the extra mile, rather than relying on map markers and guide lines to find where they need to go.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders might be more accessible and have maps and a more detailed UI, but the quest objectives are sometimes tough to find, as all Embark Studios has offered is a <strong>clue</strong> or two.</p>



<p>That in mind, here are two of the best resources for ARC Raiders maps:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://mapgenie.io/arc-raiders">MapGenie</a></strong></li>



<li><strong><a href="https://metaforge.app/arc-raiders/map">MetaForge</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These maps are brilliant, as they’re adjustable and modular, meaning you can apply filters to select exactly what you’re looking for in ARC Raiders, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARC locations</li>



<li>Containers</li>



<li>Nature resources</li>



<li>Events</li>



<li>Biomes</li>



<li>Supply Stations</li>



<li>Field Debots</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-easiest-map-in-arc-raiders">What’s The Easiest Map in ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p>By definition and rating, the easiest map to learn in ARC Raiders is Dam Battlegrounds. It’s a relatively open map with a lower difficulty ranking, except for when night falls and it becomes much more treacherous. It’s also the first map that players can explore after completing the opening sequence of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Buried City is the next easiest map to learn, but the tight-knit streets and densely-packed buildings make PvP a challenge, as you never know where enemies might be lurking. There are a few observation points higher up that players can use to scan the map with a powerful rifle, so you’ll need to keep your eyes open when on this map.</p>



<p>The Blue Gate is the hardest map by the game’s rating, but it’s not <strong>that </strong>bad. It’s so open that your chances of running into other players are slimmer, and it has plenty of verticality, meaning you can jump deep into tunnels to escape pursuing ARC enemies.</p>



<p>I think Spaceport is the toughest map, mainly because of the way it’s built. It’s a sprawling thing that’s heavily occupied by ARC forces, and the central Launch Tower area serves as a hub that players rush to at the start of the match, but to get to it, you need to cross an immense amount of open ground without cover.</p>



<p>Any budding snipers can pick off their kills with ease.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been suggested in the latest round of Fortnite leaks that a <strong>movie theme </strong>might be front and centre when Chapter 7 lands next month. On social media, a famed leaker posted images claiming that Kill Bill is coming to Fortnite via a collaboration, and eagle-eyed users noticed Epic teasing the ‘Hollywood sign’ in a new trailer for Chapter 7.</p>



<p>That, in addition to recent claims that both Harry Potter and SpongeBob Squarepants crossovers are coming, is enough for fans to believe that the next Chapter will be focused on film and television.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-a-huge-leap">Not a Huge Leap</h2>



<p>It’s not a vast leap to assume that Fortnite’s Chapter 7 will be focused on film and television, based on the latest leaks.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Shiina, one of the most reliable Fortnite leakers, revealed references to Kill Bill that had been discovered by two other users.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Others have noticed further references, such as the coordinates to the <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1985358100870963419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollywood sign</a> being found in a recent teaser trailer for Chapter 7, and the presence of a ‘Nevada’ theme that includes both a <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1984705463112384643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">casino and Area 51 POI</a>.</p>



<p>In the most recent leaks, it was suggested that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpongeBob Squarepants</a> are headed to Fortnite in future collaborations. All this is poised to follow the current period of the immensely popular battle royale game, which features classic television icons, The Simpsons.</p>



<p>This is all lined up as the latest in a <strong>very </strong>long line of pop culture collaborations that have swollen the skins and bundles repository in Epic Games’ free-to-play shooter over several expansive years.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/solo-queen-arc-raiders-someone-did-it/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-has-solo%E2%80%99d-the-queen-in-arc-raiders%E2%80%94but-it-took-a-while.1342888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a feat that everyone deemed impossible, a content creator has managed to solo a Queen in ARC Raiders. The hulking mech is the most dominant and terrifying enemy in the game right now, and up until this point, it was believed that it was <strong>not possible </strong>to take it down as a solo player.</p>



<p>To put it into perspective, during an earlier testing session, the Queen was killed 58 times out of <strong>four million raids</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-solo-the-queen-in-arc-raiders">How to Solo the Queen in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>In a short clip uploaded to social media, JGOD revealed the closing moments of a <strong>20-minute battle </strong>with the Queen on Dam in ARC Raiders. In the comments under the video, JGOD revealed that he used a variety of locations, some of which could be considered ‘cheesing’ the boss character, but remaining dynamic was key to defeating the fearsome enemy.</p>



<p>JGOD suggested taking a good Hullcracker into the fight and running in with ‘around 200’ shots for it. The rifle that he used went from 125 durability to under <strong>20 </strong>as the fight progressed. Any longer, and his weapon might have broken entirely. He didn’t <strong>count</strong>, but he said that he fired ‘about 180’ because he ‘missed a bunch as well’.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another user suggested taking in a stack of Wolfpack grenades to whittle down the Queen’s HP pool, which sits at around 30,000 points.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is becoming famous for having some of the most entertaining AI enemies to fight, and that naturally includes the gargantuan Queen. In this PvPvE extraction shooter, the ARC enemies represent something dynamic, unpredictable, and adaptable, which is much more enjoyable than the cannon fodder NPCs seen in some extraction shooters.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The superhero narrative game Dispatch has already sold over a million copies in just ten days. Bolstered by a big cast and impressive production team, the game is already one of 2025’s biggest games.</p>



<p>Released in late October with episodes 1 and 2, Dispatch follows a former superhero working a desk job and dispatching former villains to do good in Los Angeles. AdHoc Studios, composed of former Telltale Games members, keeps the spirit of its pedigree alive with a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-type dialogue choices and consequences. The game became <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1981416301709934652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the best-selling title</a> on Steam last week, though it was unknown just how much it sold. Now, we have an official number and it’s quite impressive.</p>



<h2 id="h-dispatch-hits-impressive-sales-record-in-only-10-days">Dispatch Hits Impressive Sales Record in Only 10 Days</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1985470807804453077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from AdHoc Studios</a>, the team reveals that Dispatch has sold one million copies in ten days. With only four episodes out, the game technically isn’t fully out yet. Therefore, it’s a pretty impressive feat to sell as much, especially since the studio is new. </p>



<p>It isn’t too surprising to see Dispatch get as popular as it is. With a cast led by Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul and Telltale’s narrative sense, it struck a lot of notes for fans. Plus, even with four episodes, it’s already a hit with critics and fans. We at Insider Gaming reviewed the title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two episodes</a> and loved our time with it. With how things have been shaping up for Dispatch, we could see a surprise newcomer to the Game of the Year discussions right at the tail end of 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of Dispatch’s sales so far? Have you played it yet? If so, what do you think? Where does it rank for you for 2025?
