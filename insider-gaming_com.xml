<p>Announced today, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC will be playable on the Steam Deck on release day.</p>



<p>When Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC is released on January 23, 2024, Steam Deck owners <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1879895195178901895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can play the game</a> anywhere they want: on the train, in the park, on a flight, or in the car. The official announcement post also features the game running on the handheld console, and it seems the device can handle the title seamlessly, with no visible stuttering or performance issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the arrival of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam Deck, Square Enix has revealed a limited-edition Fluffy Chocobo Steam Deck. The custom edition covers the entire handheld console in bright yellow Chocobo feathers. The game developers have stated that they don’t advise wrapping up “high-tech gaming gear in fur at home, ” so they have made the casing removable.</p>

<p>Apart from the Steam Deck, FF 7 Rebirth PC will be best experienced on a desktop where you can take advantage of enhanced features such as 120fps, refined lighting, improved environment detail, and more detailed textures. Depending on your setup, you can also benefit from improved framerates and image quality with NVIDIA DLSS.

<p>It’s not even been a full day since the Nintendo Switch 2 was revealed, and the pre-order sign-ups have already started popping up for the upcoming console. Best Buy was the first to join the fray.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sign-up-for-notifications-at-best-buy/1100-6528859/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a>, you will see a new sign-up page for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders if you go to <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch/nintendo-notifications/pcmcat1736965129196.c?id=pcmcat1736965129196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Best Buy’s website</a> right now. However, the signup doesn’t confirm the pre-order for you; instead, it sends out notifications when pre-orders go live, announcements regarding games for the upcoming console are released and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details such as pricing or availability have not been provided on Best Buy’s Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order sign-up page, as the company has yet to release that information. However, Nintendo will reveal the pricing, release date, games arriving for the console, and the device’s capabilities during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive Direct event</a> for the Switch 2 on April 2, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, only the console and some of its functionality have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>. The Switch 2 will feature a larger console and joy-cons that snap to the device now instead of sliding in. The console’s colour has changed too, with the company going for an all-black casing with red and blue accents. Players can also have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-experience-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on experience</a> with the highly anticipated Switch 2 in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hype for the Nintendo Switch 2 has been unreal, so much so that analysts have already claimed that the new console will sell <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-20-million-sales-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 20 million units</a> in the first year. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here’s a guide</a> on all the Nintendo Switch 2 leaks, rumours and other information.

<p>Call of Duty’s pro scene isn’t in a good place. From lengthy gaps between stages to Black Ops 6 being in a pit thanks to cheaters, the Call of Duty League isn’t all that appealing right now. That’s a huge sticking point for both fans and pro players, most of whom rely on COD’s competitive ecosystem to make a living.</p>



<p>To support the floundering esports scene, Vegas Falcons, which entered the CDL this season, has stood up a Respawn 8s tournament with a sizeable cash prize to keep the content flowing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-falcons-on-top">Falcons on Top</h2>



<p>Despite being at the bottom of the CDL standings, the Vegas Falcons are trying their darndest to help the scene out as much as possible. One of the biggest issues in the Call of Duty esports ecosystem is the lack of content. Outside of the CDL, there’s not much to watch, leaving the scene’s brands and creators to organise tournaments and events.</p>



<p>And the less said about Warzone, the better. It’s in a shocker of a spot right now.</p>



<p>Today, the Vegas Falcons revealed a $10,000 Respawn 8s tournament, set to run from today through the weekend (17 – 26 Jan). On <a href="https://x.com/VegasFalcons/status/1880057467968934354" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the organisation wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Introducing the Vegas Falcons Ladder</p>



<p>A pick-up game initiative designed to bring together the best talent to fight for $10,000 over 10 days. </p>



<p>Who will be crowned king ahead of Major I?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Major I is the most highly anticipated event of the CDL season thus far. It’s taking place in Madrid between January 30 and February 2, marking the first EU Major in Call of Duty League history. After that, things return stateside for Major II, which will take place in Texas, and then Major III, set to surface in Florida in April.</p>



<p>Do you think it’s fair that organisations have to scrape together to arrange events just to keep the fans switched on? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Riot Games announced today that the company will be launching “in-game fundraisers” in VALORANT and League of Legends to support relief for the wildfires affecting the city of Los Angeles. <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/la-wildfire-fundraiser" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot says</a> the fundraisers will go live next week, and are part of several initiatives that the company has undertaken to aid the city it’s based in.</p>



<p>The wildfires in Los Angeles started earlier this month, destroying hundreds of homes and doing billions in damage.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-chance-for-valorant-and-league-players-to-do-some-good">A Chance For VALORANT and League Players to Do Some Good</h2>



<p>Beginning January 22nd, the latest EX.O skin collection in VALORANT will be converted to a Give Back Bundle. Proceeds from the bundle items will go directly to the <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/who-we-are/social-impact/social-impact-fund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games Social Impact Fund</a>. VALORANT has featured a Give Back Bundle, featuring fan-voted skins from other collections, every year since the game’s release. In previous iterations, 50 percent of skin proceeds and 100 percent of accessory proceeds are sent to the Fund. The EX.O bundle will leave the store on January 30th.</p>



<p>Additionally, League of Legends is un-vaulting Firefighter Tristana on January 23rd until February 5th. Firefighter Tristana was originally released back in 2010, and is one of the rarer skins that League fans have wanted to get their hands on.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At the beginning of today’s VALORANT Champions Tour Americas broadcast, Head of VALORANT Esports Leo Faria addressed the wildfires. He implored fans to donate to the California Fire Foundation and the International Medical Corps.</p>



<p>Since the wildfires began tearing up the city, Riot has provided temporary housing and stipends to displaced employees, donated meals, and even provided a backup generator to a local fire station that had lost power. The developer says it is “in this for the long-term and will support both the immediate response and years-long recovery efforts in Southern California.”</p>
