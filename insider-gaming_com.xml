<p>Regular new content drops continue to take place in Fortnite, and February 2026 is stacked, with Epic Games dropping a big teaser roadmap of what to expect.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/">Battle Royale</a> behemoth is in the latter stages of the current season, but a new Fortnite Festival season has only just begun. Additionally, updates are also coming to other modes, including Reload and Fortnite OG.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for all of the dates and new content coming in the Fortnite Roadmap for February 2026, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-complete-fortnite-february-2026-roadmap">Complete Fortnite February 2026 Roadmap</h2>

<p><strong>Fortnite has plenty to add in February with the month-long Love Legends event, featuring new collabs, free rewards, and more.</strong></p>



<p>The Love Legends event kicked off immediately after the update on February 5, with the first major content coming the following day with the second wave of KPop Demon Hunter Skins. </p>



<p>Later in the month, players can expect new weapons and items in Battle Royale, along with the long-awaited return of The Seven.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the major additions coming to Fortnite in February 2026, as revealed by Epic Games. New announcements will be added regularly.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Fortnite Addition</th><th data-align="center">Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">February 6</td><td data-align="center">– KPop Demon Hunters Wave 2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 7</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour<br>– Pink Storm Shield</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 13</td><td data-align="center">– Nitemare Island Returns<br>– Cupid’s Crossbow</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 14</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 15</td><td data-align="center">– Fortnite OG Ice Storm Live Event</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 19</td><td data-align="center">– DeLorean Return<br>– Lantern Fest Reload Map</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 21</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 23</td><td data-align="center">– Return of The Seven<br>– New Item</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-there-more-coming-in-february-2026">Is There More Coming in February 2026?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Fortnite will definitely have plenty more to add in February 2026, including content added beyond February 23.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games’ reveal teaser only covered up until February 23 and the additions beyond that date will likely center around the long-awaited return of The Seven.</p>



<p>There will also be a significant build-up to the first seasonal change of 2026, with Chapter 7, Season 2 kicking off in early March.</p>



<p>Players should also expect further collab skins to drop in the Item Shop, as Epic Games is on a roll of major additions so far this year.</p>

<p>Fortnite continues to drop regular updates, but the latest has caused some confusion, with some questioning whether the popular Zero Build modes have been removed.</p>



<p>Zero Build is a more accessible version of Fortnite’s popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> mode, removing all of the complicated build mechanics from the game, and it regularly attracts hundreds of thousands of players.</p>



<p>Tweaks in Fortnite’s February 5 update have raised some questions for Zero Build, but Insider Gaming is here to clear the air.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-is-zero-build-in-fortnite">Where is Zero Build in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Settings. Screenshot by FGZ</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Zero Build is found in the lobby settings for the mode,  the same area where options for Team Size and Squad Fill are located.</strong></p>



<p>Once the game mode you want to play has been selected, the option for Zero Build can then be toggled. Here’s a step-by-step approach to the full process.</p>



<ol>
<li>Log in to Fortnite as you normally would.</li>



<li>Choose a game mode with Zero Build available (Battle Royale, OG, Reload, Blitz).</li>



<li>In the lobby screen, select the options found above the yellow Play button, where it should currently say: Build, Solo.</li>



<li>In the pop-up screen, click where it says ‘Zero Build.’</li>



<li>Select any other options as you desire, including Ranked and Team Size.</li>



<li>Hit ‘Close’ to return to the lobby, with your changes saved, or press ‘Play’ to begin searching for a match.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-did-fortnite-remove-zero-build">Did Fortnite Remove Zero Build?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Fortnite has not removed Zero Build from the game, but there have</strong> <strong>been some changes to tidy up the lobby and mode selection screen.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite has evolved significantly since Epic Games initially released the title, regularly adding new game modes for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>Additionally, there’s far too much to keep track of when all the popular Creative modes are taken into account.</p>



<p>In the update on February 5, Epic Games made a big change to the mode select screen. However, Zero Build is still available across all major modes, including Fortnite OG, Reload, and Blitz.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MachineGames Still Plans to Finish the Wolfenstein Trilogy]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Jerk Gustafsson is the studio director at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/machinegames/" id="87686">MachineGames</a>. MachineGames has been developing Wolfenstein games since 2014, and Gustafsson says he still plans to finish the trilogy.</p>



<p>During a recent discussion with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry</a>, Gustafsson admitted that, because of the time it takes to make video games in 2026, he may only have a few more projects in his career, about two or three to be more specific.</p>



<p>When asked if one of those games would be a third <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wolfenstein/" id="2953">Wolfenstein</a>, he remained coy, but expressed the intent to always return to the series, saying, “We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don’t want to comment on. It can be now, it can be later, but we’re not done with it. That’s what I can say.”</p>







<h2 id="h-machinegames-also-worked-on-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">MachineGames Also Worked on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>While there hasn’t been a Wolfenstein game since 2019, Machine Games was hard at work for the release of 2024’s Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Released first on Xbox platforms, the game made its way to PlayStation 5 in 2025 and will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-avoids-game-key-card-on-nintendo-switch-2/" id="174746">arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.</a></p>



<p>Gustafson discussed the game’s development and its departure from Wolfenstein’s first-person action. He admitted that it’s the first game the team has ever made that’s rated T for teen rather than M for mature.</p>



<p>When discussing some of the challenges of working on the game, he admitted it was hard for him to convey the overall goal, noting that it took until the final year of production for things to click. </p>



<p>He noted that he is proud of the games they make, enjoys expanding his horizons, and even wants to test himself and his team by making a mobile game, saying, “It just requires a different skillset that we don’t have at MachineGames. Maybe sometime in the future, but who knows?”</p>







<p>For now, there’s no confirmation of a third Wolfenstein game from MachineGames, but the team’s goal is to make one more game.</p>
