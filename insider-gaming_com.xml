<p>Despite rumours, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will release on its previously revealed release date, November 14, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who don‚Äôt know, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a claim</a> from yesterday stated that there was evidence of a potential release date change for Black Ops 7, with the game arriving a week earlier. However, Treyarch has debunked this claim, revealing that the release date for the upcoming title remains on track. </p>

<p>The latest post from Treyarch on <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1980670037985042637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) discusses the release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The developers have stated, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre less than a month away from #BlackOps7‚Äôs launch on November 14,‚Äù which clears up any doubts about a potential announcement of a release date change. The post also talks about their newest dev talk dropping today, October 21, along with more juicy multiplayer updates from the beta. </p>

<p>Talking about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Beta, it was revealed that RICOCHET Anti-Cheat achieved the strongest Beta results in Call of Duty history. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-matches-beta-cheaters-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">99% of the matches were cheater-free</a>, and cheaters were detected within three matches. This is excellent news for fans of the series, as Call of Duty has been one of the franchise‚Äôs biggest victims of in-game cheating. Hopefully, the case remains the same during launch. </p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 developers have announced that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-will-have-non-disbanding-lobbies-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feature</a> non-disbanding multiplayer lobbies at launch. Additionally, the game didn‚Äôt include a Wall Run feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-have-wall-run-due-to-its-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to its timeline</a>.

<p>Season 1 of Battlefield 6 is the start of regular free post-launch updates for the latest game in the Battlefield franchise. The season will be split into three parts: Rogue Ops, California Resistance, and Winter Offensive. </p>



<p>Rogue Ops, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on October 28</a>, includes the Blackwell Fields map as well as the new Strikepoint game mode, Traverser Mark 2 vehicle, three new weapons, and more. </p>



<p>After Rogue Ops comes California Resistance on November 18. Part two of the season also brings a new map in Eastwood, along with the Sabotage mode. Lastly, Winter Offensive won‚Äôt give players a new permanent map, but it will introduce the Ice Lock Empire State limited-time event map. </p>



<p>There‚Äôs also the planned release of the free-to-play Battle Royale mode. While rumors continue to suggest that the mode will launch alongside the start of Season 1, EA has yet to confirm that to be the case.</p>
