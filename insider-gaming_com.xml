<p>The mystery surrounding Highguard stayed with the game until its inevitable launch. The FPS revealed next to nothing in the build-up to its launch, but Wildgate Entertainment was happy to address one major detail about Highguard: Its price and free-to-play status.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> aptly kept up a high guard following its shocking The Game Awards 2025 reveal, even as the days and weeks ticked by to its release date. This added only to Highguard’s aura, and while we all tried to work out what the game was and what it was about, the dev left no doubt about Highguard’s price tag.</p>

<p><strong>Highguard doesn’t cost anything, and it doesn’t have a price, because Highguard is a free-to-play shooter.</strong></p>



<p>That’s the first big stumbling block out of the way. Games like Concord have shown that charging a fee for this type of game can warrant a backlash, or worse (in the case of Concord), nothing at all from anyone.</p>



<p>The gaming world was left with its mouth ajar, watching Highguard be the final reveal of TGA 2025. By not showing anything since, this ironically increased the game’s appeal and hype. On the plus side, no matter how Highguard turns out, whether you love it or hate it, it won’t cost you a penny.</p>



<p>In fact, the game’s only real marketing at all, a few days from launch, was its initial reveal trailer. The impressive footage ended with a definitive message: “Play Free.”</p>

<p><strong>Steam claims that Highguard will have ‘In-App Purchases,’ but this is the full extent known about Highguard’s extra paid purchases and potential live-service elements.</strong></p>



<p>All that is known about Highguard—other than the Steam notice about the purchases—is a brief description of the shooter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From the creators of&nbsp;Apex Legends&nbsp;and&nbsp;Titanfall, comes&nbsp;Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to battle for control of a mythical continent. There they’ll clash against rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>You’ll find out, like everyone else, what Highguard has in store (potentially literally) when it launches as a F2P game on January 26.</p>



<p>If Highguard wasn’t free-to-play, would it have put you off? Will you still be skipping Highyuard anyway? IG is very interested to hear your thoughts on the game, its lack of promotion, and more, which you can share via the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
