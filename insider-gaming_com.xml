            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>BLAST has set the stage for one of the biggest structural overhauls in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/counter-strike/" id="482">Counter-Strike’s</a> history, unveiling a massive redesign of the BLAST Premier circuit that will kick off in 2027. This update marks a decisive pivot towards a full LAN-focused model, deeper integration with Valve’s Regional Standings, and a significant financial boost aimed at stabilizing the competitive scene.</p>



<p>At the heart of the overhaul sits a whopping $10 million investment directly into teams and the wider ecosystem, which is a leap up from the $8.5 million commitment in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-blast-bags-bigger-financial-commitment">BLAST Bags Bigger Financial Commitment</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blast/" id="3530">BLAST</a> has promised that the $10 million investment for 2027 will be spent across four critical pillars:</p>



<ul>
<li>Prize Money</li>



<li>Team Payments</li>



<li>Acceptance Fees</li>



<li>Player Experience Investment</li>
</ul>



<p>The lion’s share of the $10 million goes to team payments, with $4.5 million being attributed to ‘performance-based compensation retained by organizations.’</p>



<p>Behind that, there will be $3 million prize money, and $1.8 million reserved as rewards for teams attending events. The player experience portion of that investment concerns upgrades to travel, accommodation, and on-site conditions.</p>



<p>This is all part of BLAST’s drive to produce a more LAN-centric competitive structure. The endeavour means that some major changes have taken place:</p>



<ul>
<li>BLAST Bounty is reduced from 32 to 16 teams and will now focus 100% on LAN play</li>



<li>More regional open qualifiers will be hosted across all territories</li>



<li>An extra week of competition has been added to the overall season</li>
</ul>



<p>BLAST Bounty, Open, and Rivals have all been brought back with key refinements, but it’s Bounty that faces the biggest changes.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://blast.tv/cs/news/premier-2027-new-formats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a>, Anne Banschbach, the Programme Director for BLAST Premier, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are evolving BLAST Premier to better serve the entire Counter-Strike ecosystem.</p>



<p>Increasing our investment to $10 million is not just about bigger prize pools, it is about revamping our formats to deliver a more sustainable and premium experience for teams, players and fans.</p>



<p>With a fully LAN-focused structure, stronger VRS impact and the removal of main event online matches, the biggest moments will play out on the biggest stages.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>BLAST Rivals remains the ‘crowning jewel’ of the ecosystem in 2027, and will retain the same eight-team format. <strong>But</strong>, in 2027, the prize pool will be increased to the maximum possible – $1.25 million.</p>

<p>It’s a we, Mario!</p>



<p>March 10 has become Mario Day (Mar 10) for many gamers. This year, a New York City GameStop is to celebrate the day by attempting to break a record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Mario. The current record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Mario is 230 participants. This was set on August 18, 2010, in Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia, China.</p>



<p>It will be an entire Mario-themed event. There will be prizes and many photo ops. The best Mario cosplayer will receive a free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. All who participate will also receive $5 in bonus store credit to use on any item in the store. You’re free to come dressed as Luigi, but you won’t get the store credit.</p>



<p>Qualifications for the costume are simple. All you need is a red shirt, blue overalls, a red hat, and a mustache.</p>







<h2 id="h-mario-is-still-celebrating-his-40th-anniversary">Mario Is Still Celebrating His 40th Anniversary</h2>



<p>Through April, with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/" id="3170">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, Mario continues to celebrate his 40th anniversary. As part of the anniversary, Nintendo has released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mario-tennis-fever-2/" id="170927">Mario Tennis Fever</a>. There’s also an upcoming Yoshi game, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. However, most are wondering when the next 3D Mario experience will be released.</p>



<p>It has been almost 9 years since Nintendo released<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/super-mario-odyssey/" id="165895"> Super Mario Odyssey</a> on the original Nintendo Switch. This is easily the longest timeframe between brand-new 3D Mario releases. Nintendo released a port of Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Switch, which included a secondary mode in Bowser’s Fury. However, they have not released a full 3D Mario game since 2017.</p>







<p>With the latest Mario movie celebrating the legacy of one of the best-reviewed 3D Mario games of all time, many are dying to get back to the Mushroom Kingdom in a brand new experience. For now, maybe you can go to New York City and dress up like Mario and hope of winning a free Nintendo Switch 2 so that you’ll be ready whenever that new game does come.</p>



<p>RSVP for the gathering <a href="https://partiful.com/e/BhTQ2ZaAdQaLoiqX0Fb2">here.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/raven-software/" id="1897">Raven Software </a>has revealed <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2026/02/call-of-duty-bo7-warzone-season-02-patch-notes">patch notes</a> for the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" id="147395">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> Season 2 update. The patch includes an update to Killstreaks in multiple modes and other bug fixes.</p>



<p>Regarding Killstreaks, several updates have been made. They have adjusted the spawn rates of Killstreaks in loot. Resurgence modes have received a 50% reduction from Supply boxes and a 25% reduction from ground loot. This adjustment also counts for Ranked Play. Battle Royale modes have received a 10% reduction in Killstreaks overall.</p>



<p>They’ve also made specific adjustments to Precision Airstrikes, Napalm Strikes, Cluster Strikes, and Bunker Busters. The radius for Killstreak call-ins has gone down to 150 meters. It was originally 255 meters. They’ve also adjusted the limit from three to two. Additionally, they’ve made a change to where only one type of Killstreak is allowed in any given radius.</p>



<p>“Individually, you can deploy one Killstreak of a specific type every 20 seconds. Your squad is limited to one active Killstreak of that type as well. Once used, this allows opponents a window to retaliate. We will continue monitoring Killstreak usage and performance across all modes and make adjustments as needed,” the notes state.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-bug-fixes-in-the-latest-call-of-duty-warzone-patch">Additional Bug Fixes in the Latest Call of Duty: Warzone Patch</h2>



<p>Additional bug fixes include a fix to an issue that prevented players from properly progressing the “Absolute Zero” mastery camo challenge for the NX Ravager. Also, an issue that allowed players to fall through maps in certain areas has been fixed. </p>
