            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been announced (kind of) that Lords of the Fallen 2, an assumed follow-up to 2023’s Lords of the Fallen, will be revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase. Not much is known about the sequel, but in a bizarre twist, the developer’s CEO confirmed the impending announcement after Geoff Keighley teased it on social media.</p>



<p>While the Lords of the Fallen release in 2023 didn’t move mountains, subsequent updates polished the game up quite nicely to make it a pretty strong Soulslike with an innovative core concept.</p>



<h2 id="h-lords-of-the-fallen-2-coming-soon">Lords of the Fallen 2 – Coming Soon</h2>



<p>On social media, Geoff Keighley, the host of the Opening Night Live showcase, posted a reference to a new game being revealed at next week’s show. It was an image of a ‘II’ graphic, seemingly drawn in blood, with the caption ‘Blood Will Spill’.</p>



<p>From what Geoff said, it seems as though the trailer will be the first thing to play at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live show.</p>



<p>Shortly after Keighley posted his teaser, the CEO at CI Games, Marek Tyminski, shared the image and simply wrote: ‘Lords of the Fallen II’.</p>



<p>That’s it – the most basic announcement I’ve ever seen for a new game.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In 2023, I had the pleasure of being one of the first people in the UK to play Lords of the Fallen. In my subsequent preview, I wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Lords of the Fallen is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most impressive games I’ve played in recent years. As I explored this dark, twisted universe that’s split between two parallel words, I found myself sucked in and desperate to progress through the game despite its challenges – and there were plenty of those.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s possible we might even get a release date for Lords of the Fallen 2, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-new-details/">it was confirmed recently</a> that it’ll be dropping in 2026.</p>



<p>In this world populated so heavily by Soulslike games, what’s one more? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you’re looking forward to Lords of the Fallen 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is back for more with a new Open Beta event, with this one running from August 14 to 17 and opening up new maps and modes for players worldwide. The hype surrounding EA’s next big shooter is unparalleled, and as soon as the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 event kicked off, hundreds of thousands of players flooded the platform.</p>



<p>On Steam alone, more than 300,000 users poured into Battlefield 6, which continues to impress fans both old and new.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end">When Does The Battlefield 6 Beta End?</h2>



<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta is set to run until August 17, at which point it’ll be shut down, and any findings produced will be used by Electronic Arts’ studios to finesse the intense and destructive first-person shooter. The full game will be released on October 10, which seems like an age away when the anticipation for this game is <strong>so high</strong>.</p>



<p>When the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 kicked off today, it caused the player count on Steam to immediately swell beyond 300,000 concurrent users. While some dropped because of the pesky DLSS issue that has surfaced, the count stayed pretty strong, and going into the weekend, it could rival the record secured by the game last week.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Last weekend, during the first Open Beta phase, Battlefield 6 secured a peak player count of 517,000 users, beating every Call of Duty game ever hosted on Steam. It also hit more than 800,000 viewers on Twitch, effortlessly walking over every Call of Duty game bar Warzone.</p>



<p>In other Battlefield news, it has been claimed by a prominent dataminer that Battlefield 2042 is about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-update-surprisingly-big-soon/">to get a massive update</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[4 Best Defensive Playbooks in Madden 26]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/4-best-defensive-playbooks-in-madden-26/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/4-best-defensive-playbooks-in-madden-26.1269945/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The rapidly approaching new NFL season also means a new Madden game to enjoy, with Madden 26 now available. While all eyes may be on your offense, having a strong defense is crucial, so we’ve selected some of the best defensive playbooks.</p>



<p>Regardless of your game mode of choice, defensive playbooks are vital for success in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-review-a-mixed-bag-of-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden 26</a>, even if you’ve settled into a strong offensive output using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-offensive-playbooks-madden-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best offensive playbooks</a> in the game. </p>



<p>Rather than sifting through all the teams to find the right defensive playbook for you, however, we can make things much easier by pointing you in the direction of the best defensive playbooks Madden 26 has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-defensive-playbooks-in-madden-26">Best Defensive Playbooks in Madden 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rock solid. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</h3>



<p>With a variety of strong formations, the Green Bay Packers’ defensive playbook is a solid choice, particularly when you’re just starting to get to grips with <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>. With 4-3 and 4-6 formations included, it’s great for defending against both the running and passing game.</p>



<p>One of the biggest strengths, however, is the variety of Nickel approaches, putting your Linebackers pretty much anywhere you want them to. This allows for regular pressure on any opposition quarterback, forcing opposing players into mistakes.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</h3>



<p>Another option for any player who wants their defensive setup to be highly versatile is the New England Patriots defensive playbook, which includes 3-4, 4-3, and 4-4 formations. If you’re new to Madden 26, it’s another solid option to get you started while you get a feel for the game.</p>



<p>There’s also decent Nickel and Dime options, the latter being some of the best formations in the game. Essentially, the Patriots playbook fits into pretty much every category you’d want it to, ticking off all the boxes.</p>



<h3 id="h-kansas-city-chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</h3>



<p>The strong 4-2-5 formation choices in the Kansas City Chiefs defensive playbook is great for defending against the passing game and, surprisingly, there’s still an abundance of Blitz options to put pressure on the opposing quarterback and halting the running game.</p>



<p>You’ll need to call upon your cornerbacks for a lot of these Blitzes, however, but with an abundance of deep coverage, it shouldn’t leave you too exposed. Once you get used to things, it can be a really effective playbook option.</p>



<h3 id="h-detroit-lions">Detroit Lions</h3>



<p>The 3-3 formation is a fan-favorite in the Madden series and the Detroit Lions rely heavily on this setup in their defensive playbook. You’ll have more than enough options to call upon and, while it might not stand out at first glance, I highly recommend trying it out.</p>



<p>Other options include 4-3 and 3-4 formations, as well as Nickel and Dime, but, in truth, it’s fairly limited in that capacity. If the 3-3 is your calling though, look no further.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-dlss-dlaa-not-working-issue-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>DLSS and DLAA are sophisticated graphical and performance-related techniques. They’re crucial for games like Battlefield 6 and its Open Beta. If you’re having problems with DLSS and DLAA not working, this guide has all the answers on why this is.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Weekend 2 Open Beta</a> is up and running. You can already tell there’s a greater strain being placed on the beta compared to week one. The social media clips and the hype have got everyone worked up and excited to play.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Week 2 has been hit by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-matchmaking-update-01-arrives-to-fix-playlist-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matchmaking and playlist problems</a>, and there’s also DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling<br>) and DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) nuisances.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-dlss-amp-dlaa-working-in-battlefield-6-open-beta">Why Isn’t DLSS &amp; DLAA Working in Battlefield 6 Open Beta?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not as crisp and clear as it could be. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Both DLSS and DLAA are currently disabled in the Battlefield 6 Open beta due to an “issue” being investigated by the BF6 team.</strong></p>



<p>This is a very vague explanation, I know. But this is all the Battlefield Comms <a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X page</a> has disclosed for now. This was its first statement on the technical fault:</p>



<p>“The team is aware of reports regarding DLSS / DLAA being unavailable in the Open Beta. We’ll follow up with additional updates as soon as possible. Thanks for your patience!”</p>



<p>Thankfully, we’ve had further updates since then with better news.</p>



<div><article><p><span>The team is aware of reports regarding DLSS / DLAA being unavailable in the Open Beta. We’ll follow up with additional updates as soon as possible.

Thanks for your patience!</span></p></article></div>



<h2 id="h-when-will-dlss-amp-dlaa-be-fixed-in-battlefield-6">When Will DLSS &amp; DLAA be Fixed in Battlefield 6?</h2>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 team believes the DLSS and DLAA issues will be resolved by the end of August 14.</strong></p>



<p>Update 01 on the DLSS and DLAA indicates the root cause of the problem has been found. The team is working on it as I write this—alongside a myriad of other headaches—and has given a timeframe.</p>



<p>“The team have identified the root cause of this issue and are working to have this resolved and DLSS / DLAA active once again within the Battlefield Open Beta. We anticipate this to be resolved later today, and will update accordingly.”</p>



<p>As always, this doesn’t mean this <em>will </em>be the case, and there could be unforeseen delays. For now, you’ll have to endure slightly more uneven performance and sub-optimized explosions and gunfire for now. The Battlefield Comms is being very active and vocal on the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, so we do anticipate updates through the beta weekend.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates!</p>



<div><article><p><span>DLSS / DLAA Issue Update 01 —

The team have identified the root cause of this issue and are working to have this resolved and DLSS / DLAA active once again within the Battlefield Open Beta.

We anticipate this to be resolved later today, and will update accordingly.</span></p></article></div>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-gooner-reputation-has-been-addressed-by-its-game-director/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals%E2%80%99-%E2%80%98gooner%E2%80%99-reputation-has-been-addressed-by-its-game-director.1269891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the beginning, Marvel Rivals started out as a budding hero shooter. A few weeks in, and it had amassed an audience of several hundred thousand players and counting. It’s established as one of the best free-to-play games, but recent skins that leave little to the imagination have raised eyebrows.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-version-might-become-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> launched with a star-studded roster with fabulous unlockable skins. It is a free-to-play game after all, so paid cosmetics were always going to be a thing. We’ve seen an increased influx of more scantily-clad costumes and somewhat exposed heroes, shall we say, in recent skins—leading to the ‘Gooner’ accusations.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-a-gooner-game">Is Marvel Rivals a ‘Gooner’ Game?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>C’mon, you’ve probably bought at least one of them. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-summer-party-swimsuit-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Summer Party Swimsuit Event</a> and its array of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-swimsuit-costumes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Swimsuit Costumes</a> have contributed greatly to Marvel Rivals’ ‘Gooner’ label.</p>



<p>Game director Guangyun ‘Guangguang’ Chen recently spoke with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RivalsAssembled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rivals Assembled</a>. In a special interview talking about all things Marvel Rivals—including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EOMM</a>—Guangguang was asked: “How do you guys respond to people calling Marvel Rivals a gooner game?”</p>



<p>Guangguang barely flinched before replying: “Because our design is inspired by classic comic themes, including some very outstanding skins, like Mantis and also Psylocke’s Vengeance, these all come from classic comic designs, and we create some more fashionable designs based on them to gain players’ appreciation. I think this also reflects the broad recognition from our players.”</p>



<p>“As mentioned earlier, with the Squirrel Girl and the Krakoa Resort skin, these are actually designs based on real-world themes and the season’s storyline. For designs like these, we try our best to integrate the storylines from the season, including elements from Krakoa, and blend popular elements from real life. We create new designs based on that, and I’m very grateful these designs have been well received by the majority of players.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Black Myth: Wukong Coming to Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-wukong-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-black-myth-wukong-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1269879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a long wait, Black Myth: Wukong is finally set to release on Microsoft platforms, so you may now be wondering whether the title will be available on Xbox Game Pass. We’ve got the answer.</p>



<p>Releasing August 20th on Xbox Series X|S, Black Myth: Wukong was one of the stand-out games of 2024, making huge waves after launching on PlayStation 5, and was one of the contenders for the Game of the Year title.</p>



<p>12 months after an initial release, Black Myth: Wukong is poised to make its debut on Xbox, and we’ve got the details on whether that includes a Game Pass inclusion.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-myth-wukong-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been a long wait. Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Black Myth: Wukong will not be available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on August 20th.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/black-myth-wukong/9NWQ1Q1FR0C9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is not an Xbox first-party title, and there has not been any announcement on the game coming to the service. As such, this confirms it won’t be included.</p>



<p>Although Xbox has not announced the second wave of August titles coming to the subscription service, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-for-august-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous announcement</a> covering up until the 14th, Black Myth: Wukong will not be one of the titles included. If it was, it would have been a huge surprise and would have been announced well in advance.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-myth-wukong-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Black Myth: Wukong Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that Black Myth: Wukong will ever be added to the Xbox Game Pass catalog in the future, although nothing can be ruled out entirely.</strong></p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science has close ties with Sony, releasing the title exclusively on PlayStation in August last year, and, while that timed-exclusive period has come to an end, it doesn’t mean the floodgates will open for an addition to the service.</p>



<p>Truthfully, if Black Myth: Wukong were to become available on any subscription service, it would probably be Sony’s PS Plus service. Even then, such an addition is unlikely to happen for a while, given the popularity of the title, so there’s not really any reason for Game Science to secure a deal.</p>



<p>Have you pre-ordered Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox? How long have you been waiting for its arrival on the platform? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The official Battlefield Communications page has acknowledged an issue concerning matchmaking when choosing playlist options in Battlefield 6. The ‘Update 01’ has been deployed in a bid to rectify this, and there’s more details on future measures in the works.</p>



<p>Was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Weekend 2</a> ever going to go smoothly without a single problem? Probably not. That’s a testament to the work that Battlefield Studios has put into the game’s testing and marketing. Thousands—potentially millions—of players are desperately trying to log in for the second-week beta. Understandably, there’s a big issue.</p>

<p>The Battlefield Comms <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page has been active since the Weekend 2 beta started. It’s trying to keep players up to speed with bugs and potential hiccups you might encounter.</p>



<p>Matchmaking is proving to be one of the biggest walls we want to blow a hole through, though.</p>



<p>Here’s what Update 01 brings: “If you are currently experiencing matchmaking issues, please ensure that you have the most recent client update. EA App: Repair functionality is available via the 3-dot button, and Repair. The team continues to assess this.”</p>



<p>If the problem is happening to you, I recommend trying these methods. The final sentence shows that this is a <em>high priority</em> for the team, and more updates are likely in the works.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[6 Best Offensive Playbooks in Madden 26]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Madden 26 is here with a fresh slew of content to dig your teeth into, though you won’t be able to get anywhere without the best offensive playbooks. Fortunately for you, that’s where we come in.</p>



<p>Whether your mode of choice is Franchise Mode or Ultimate Team, Superstar Mode or going head-to-head against your friends online, a strong offensive playbook in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-review-a-mixed-bag-of-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> is crucial. Without one, you’ll struggle to find any momentum.</p>



<p>Even if you have the best players in the world, a decent playbook is pivotal to unlocking their full potential. To make things easier for you, we’ve picked out our six favorite offensive playbooks.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-offensive-playbooks-in-madden-26">Best Offensive Playbooks in Madden 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of options. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</h3>



<p>Arguably the best option in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden 26</a> for those who want a versatile offence, able to call upon both passing and running plays, the Chicago Bears playbook is incredibly strong. In fact, the only downside is that there are no Pistol plays to call upon, but there’s enough to keep you busy.</p>



<p>If you have a decent slew of receivers and running backs in your team, and you don’t want to rely heavily on one player, the Bears playbook is the perfect choice. With it at your disposal, it will be difficult for any opponent to predict your next move.</p>



<h3 id="h-green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</h3>



<p>Another option for those who want to rely on short passes, the Green Bay Packers playbook is exceptionally strong. Overall, the Packers have one of the most versatile playbooks in Madden 26, with a wide range of formations to call upon.</p>



<p>Top of the list are the Bunch formation plays, a go-to for many players in the community, and they are the perfect tool in your arsenal for breaking down a tough defence. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-orleans-saints">New Orleans Saints</h3>



<p>The New Orleans Saints playbook is the best choice for those who want to rely on short passes, as well as having several options for a mobile quarterback. While it might not be the playbook that dominates highlight reels, it’s effective in getting you moving and is probably the best choice to start with.</p>



<p>Well-balanced with a variety of formations, including Wildcat, there are some deeper plays you can call upon to mix things up. However, the strength is certainly in quick passes and pitches. </p>



<h3 id="h-philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</h3>



<p>The Eagles have been one of the strongest teams in the NFL for years, so it’s hardly surprising that they boast one of the strongest and most versatile playbooks in Madden 26. To unlock the full potential of the playbook, however, you’ll need a strong Tight End in your ranks.</p>



<p>Another strength is the variety of ways you can keep your opponent on their toes, with an array of trick plays to call upon. Even against the toughest defences, the playbook is loaded with options to keep you ahead and leave your opponent on the backfoot.</p>



<h3 id="h-san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</h3>



<p>If you want to lean heavily on a talented running back, the San Francisco 49ers playbook is the one for you. Ideally used when facing a zone defense, this playbook is perfect for finding a receiver in wide open space, or hammering through the defensive line with your running back.</p>



<p>The downside, of course, is the playbook requires a top-class running back, and, without it, you’ll struggle to find momentum. If you’re in Franchise Mode and have that at your disposal, or have packed a top-class running back in Ultimate Team, I highly suggest taking a looking at this option.</p>



<h3 id="h-los-angeles-chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</h3>



<p>Another option for anyone wanting a run-focused offense is the Los Angeles Chargers playbook, with boasts a wide array of Singleback plays. There are also some rather unique plays to call upon to leave your opponents in a spin, though you’ll require decent depth with your running options.</p>



<p>The benefit over the 49ers playbook is a decent chunk of Shotgun plays to call upon, bringing your receivers into the game more and providing greater options when calling plays. </p>



<p>Which playbook has been your go-to in Madden 26 so far? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>!</p>
