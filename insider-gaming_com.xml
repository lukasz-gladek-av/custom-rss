<p>You’ve made it (so far) to the middle of the week, but whatever tribulations you’ve been through, you still need to overcome today’s challenge. The NYT Connections puzzle for today is a tricky one, but that’s where I come in. Below, I’ve shared the best NYT Connections hints you need to wrap your puzzle up nicely and quickly.</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections solutions you need for today.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #878:</p>



<ul>
<li>KNIGHT</li>



<li>COAT</li>



<li>BUTCHER</li>



<li>BAKER</li>



<li>FLACK</li>



<li>KNIFE</li>



<li>CANDLESTICK</li>



<li>MAKER</li>



<li>FRANKLIN</li>



<li>FOREST</li>



<li>BOW</li>



<li>BLOW</li>



<li>SPOIL</li>



<li>WRENCH</li>



<li>BOTCH</li>



<li>ROPE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of verbs that describe messing something up—whether it’s a recipe, a plan, or a performance.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are the classic implements you’d find in a whodunit board game. Colonel Mustard would know.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Last names only—each belongs to a legendary artist whose vocals defined a genre and an era.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word completes the phrase “rain_____” to form something familiar, poetic, or practical.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 5.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<p>Nintendo isn’t planning on stopping movie adaptations of its games. Even more so, according to a new sales report, it’s going to be a more common thing.</p>



<p>For the longest time, video game adaptations were a curse on Hollywood. It never seemed to work out, no matter what form it took, from animated (like Final Fantasy) to live-action (like Max Payne). However, the 2020s proved to show it off in style, having massive successes like Sonic the Hedgehog, Fallout, Arcane, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-tv-show-receives-high-praise-from-critics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a>. One of those hits was Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which raked in more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-movie-record-breaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one billion dollars</a> at the box office. With a sequel and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action Zelda film</a>, it’s on one heck of a hot streak. Fortunately, it doesn’t seem like it wants to slow down at all.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a sales report from Nintendo Japan</a>, the company talked about its success with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its plans for the future. One big part of its strategy is multimedia, with a big push for films. Nintendo states that it’s currently involved in multiple projects on its IP in various stages. No specifics were given as to what franchises those are, but they’ll be releasing after The Legend of Zelda in 2027.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Nintendo plans to be heavily involved in all of the films, from production to financing. Given how well the collaboration worked with Mario, having the creators on the team always leads to a better adaptation. It’ll be interesting to see what the future for Nintendo’s films will look like, whether it be in-house, like it teased with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75JEwjP_GD8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Close to You</a>, or licensed. Either way, we may see series like Metroid or Animal Crossing make it onto the silver screen soon.</p>



<p>What do you think about Nintendo’s push for IP-based films? Which Nintendo franchise do you want to see as a movie? Metroid? Animal Crossing? F-Zero? Star Fox?
