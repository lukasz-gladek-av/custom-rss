<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct almost upon us, details about the upcoming console’s Pro Controller have surfaced online.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrades-nbsp">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Upgrades&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4192#post-1701204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famiboards</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/nintendo-switch-2-unofficial-name/227778/news/fcc-filing-could-indicate-a-possible-upgrade-for-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), FCC Filings for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller have been revealed, providing an idea about the new upgrades for this device. The filing has been listed for ‘BEE-008’, a controller with both Bluetooth and NFC. Interestingly, the filing suggests that Nintendo could finally add a headphone jack to their Pro Controller for Switch 2.&nbsp;Moreover, the controller should feature a new battery, too.</p>



<p>The community has long requested a headphone jack for the Pro Controllers. When the console is docked, wired audio is impossible unless you are glued to the TV. However, with the upcoming console finally introducing voice chat for the platform, a headphone jack for the Pro Controller seems more likely. We will have to wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event tomorrow to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct-last/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will last one hour</a> and explain everything we need to know about the upcoming console. It will be followed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-gameplay-showcase-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Treehouse: Live</a>, featuring hands-on gameplay for Switch 2 games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Compulsion Games is ready to bring the world South of Midnight. Its release date comes several years after its announcement, and the developer is preparing everyone for its debut by showcasing start times for its normal and Early Access launches.</p>



<p>If We Happy Few is anything to go by, then we already know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/south-of-midnight-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a> is a can’t-miss adventure. Xbox shares Compulsion Games’ affinity for the weird and wonderful, and this is the first project under the Xbox banner. South of Midnight looks like a mature and realized vision, and its release date can’t come soon enough for some. </p>



<p>If you’re after the earliest possible start time, you’ve come to the right place.</p>

<p><strong>April 8 is the confirmed South of Midnight release date, and it’s one of the month’s biggest games.</strong></p>



<p>South of Midnight—at the time of writing—hasn’t been subjected to a delay. It’s had little-to-no controversy and got a lot of hype ahead of its launch. It’s available to Xbox Series X|S and PC users, so let’s see if being available on these platforms helps its sales.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight being on Xbox Game Pass</a> is sure to go in its favor.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-start-times">South of Midnight Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Expect South of Midnight to launch and get underway at 9 AM PDT / 11 AM CDT / 12 PM EDT / 5 PM BST.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is for the official launch date. South of Midnight’s release has several editions to consider, so depending on which one you opt for, there’s a chance you’re entitled to Early Access—giving you an earlier start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-early-access-start-times">South of Midnight Early Access Start Times</h2>
