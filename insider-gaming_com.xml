            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>COD NEXT, the monumental event that unravels the short-term future of the Call of Duty franchise, sits firmly on the horizon. It’s set to drop in a matter of weeks, unveiling everything coming in Black Ops 7 and beyond. This will follow the latest trailer and preview that was showcased during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering when COD NEXT 2025 will take place or how to watch COD NEXT when it surfaces, read on. I’ve got all the information you need, including predictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-cod-next-2025-being-streamed">When is COD NEXT 2025 Being Streamed?</h2>



<p><strong>COD NEXT will be streamed live on September 30, 2025. </strong>It’s set to feature several hours of Call of Duty content and will almost certainly boast the usual arrangement of COD creators and pro players streaming the game from a centralized location.</p>



<p>COD NEXT 2025 is set to take place in <strong>Las Vegas</strong>, and in typical COD NEXT fashion, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ll see trailers</a>, gameplay walkthroughs, and dev panels unfold during the event. The insights will be unparalleled, and we’ll come away from COD NEXT with all the knowledge we’ll need for Black Ops 7, which will be released worldwide on November 14.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-cod-next-2025">Where to Watch COD NEXT 2025</h2>



<p>The best place to watch COD NEXT 2025 is, as always, via the official Call of Duty channels. Every year, Call of Duty NEXT rewards viewers with exclusive drops that they can redeem in-game, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Beta codes</li>



<li>Double XP tokens</li>



<li>Exclusive charms, skins, sprays, or emblems</li>
</ul>







<p>Here are the links you’ll need to watch COD NEXT:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/callofduty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty on YouTube</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/callofduty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty on Twitch</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Alternatively, you’ll be able to watch <strong>some </strong>of COD NEXT by tuning in to see if your favorite Call of Duty streamer is broadcasting live from the event in Las Vegas on September 30. This will afford you a first-person perspective of Black Ops 7, but you might miss things like the developer panels and trailers.</p>



<h2 id="h-cod-next-2025-predictions">COD NEXT 2025 Predictions</h2>



<p>It’s easy to predict that we’ll see stacks of Black Ops 7 multiplayer content at COD NEXT. We’ll likely explore the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-weapon-build-feature-makes-sharing-loadouts-easier/">create-a-class systems</a>, maps, modes (especially new ones like Skirmish), and potentially ‘extra’ deliverables like Ranked or the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7’s Zombies platform will be revealed in full, and like the multiplayer ecosystem, we could see some creator-driven activations that’ll allow Activision’s studios to dive deep into the fan-favorite mode.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that Warzone will also be explored at COD NEXT 2025. It’s the staging ground for anything related to Call of Duty, and with each new iteration, Warzone undergoes some dramatic changes. How will Warzone differ when Black Ops 7 comes around?</p>



<p>Finally, we’ll see a walkthrough of whatever content and updates are coming next for Call of Duty Mobile, which is by numbers the most popular COD game in the world.</p>



<p>What do you want to see most at COD NEXT 2025? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is easily one of the most anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 games of this year, and being a die-hard fan of the franchise, I’ve really been looking forward to this one. Insider Gaming was present at Gamescom 2025 this year, and we had the chance to test the preview build for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and here are our impressions on it. </p>



<p>To set some context, Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the latest game in the series, where players get to return to Lumiose City from the X and Y games. The upcoming installment introduces a dynamic battle system that completely changes the way players approach battles in the series. Fortunately, we had the opportunity to preview the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A battle system during Gamescom 2025. </p>



<h2 id="h-dynamic-battles-keep-players-on-their-toes">Dynamic Battles Keep Players on Their Toes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Gamescom preview build for Pokémon Legends: Z-A was only 10 minutes long, featured the Switch 2 version and was restricted to the German language. However, you were able to gauge the new battle system quite well, even with the language barrier. The demo had players walking through a Red Zone, where they would have to face three different trainers. It was a highly compact area, so there was no way to get a sense of the exploration; the only thing you could do was battle. </p>



<p>I had access to four Pokémon: Chikorita, Weedle, Mareep, and Fletchling. Each of these Pokémon came with its individual skill set, which could be activated with the press of a button. The PP system has been replaced with a cool-down system, where players must wait a short period before executing their next move. At the same time, players can swap Pokémon on the fly, and that’s a brilliant way to get away from some of the attacks. </p>



<p>The battle system also features a new ambush mechanic, where players can either ambush the other trainer’s Pokémon or be ambushed by them. A new stealth system has also been added, which allows players to sneak around a trainer if they do not wish to fight them at that moment. However, if you are caught off guard, the opponent trainer can dish out some hefty damage when ambushing you. </p>



<p>Every Pokémon has the ability to learn four moves that can be executed by aiming at the opponent with the ZL button and then pressing either X, Y, A, or B to pull off the move. The animations look really crisp, and the performance seems pretty solid too. Similar to previous games, the Pokemon learns new moves as they level up with battles. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new battle system appears to be heading in the right direction, introducing a fresh layer of strategy and gameplay that will appeal to existing franchise players. As it is no longer a turn-based system, the player is no longer offered the luxury of time; you must be quick with your actions, as the opponents can be relentless. That was all we were able to explore during this demo; hopefully, we can see more of the redeveloped <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/story-world/lumiose-city" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lumiose City</a>, the mega evolutions, gym battles, and more soon. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mega-victreebel-revealed-for-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Victreebel</a> has been revealed for the upcoming title.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-free-new-story-content/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-mirage-is-getting-free-new-story-content.1278966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is getting some surprise new content later this year, thanks to Ubisoft. The title, which was released in 2023, hit Xbox Game Pass a few weeks ago. With all the new players, it now seems that Basim’s origin story is not quite over yet. </p>



<p>Taking place in 9th-century Baghdad, you play as Basim Ibn Ishaq, whose older self appears in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla as Eivor’s mentor. It’s more classic Assassin’s Creed than Odyssey and Valhalla, so longtime fans were quick to praise the title, and for good reason. </p>



<p>While the recent Shadows has outplaced Mirage, a new update from Ubisoft confirms there’s more to come for the stealth-heavy entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-mirage-getting-additional-free-dlc-later-this-year">Assassin’s Creed Mirage Getting Additional Free DLC Later This Year</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Assassin's Creed Mirage players, we have a surprise coming your way later this year!</p><p> 📖 New story chapter &amp; missions set in 9th century AlUla<br>🎮 Gameplay improvements for the base game and the new location<br>🎁 All for free</p><p> Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/8CjB3MRvfR">pic.twitter.com/8CjB3MRvfR</a></p></div>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a tweet from the <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Assassin’s Creed account</a>, it states that, later this year, new content will be available for players to enjoy. Outside of new gameplay improvements, the game will get a brand new location and story content, all set in Al Ula. To top it all off, the DLC is free to all who own the game. Unfortunately, no set release date was given outside of releasing this year.</p>



<p>While it isn’t out of the ordinary for new content for years-old games to drop, Assassin’s Creed Mirage is an interesting one. As mentioned previously, it’s not the newest title anymore, as AC Shadows came out this February. Even more so, it’s also getting its own <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free DLC</a> in late September. </p>



<p>Having Mirage get new content, especially story content, may hint at possible ties to Shadows or future games like Hexe. Still, the game’s addition to Xbox Game Pass is now sure to get some traction, as now even more people can play the DLC whenever it comes out.</p>



<p>Are you excited to return to Assassin’s Creed Mirage? Have you played it before? How does it stack up against other AC titles? Let us know in the comments and on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forums</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-revealed-game-is-not-ready/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-1-0-release-date-has-been-revealed-but-the-game-isn%E2%80%99t-ready.1278963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has finally lifted the lid on the <strong>full release date </strong>for Escape from Tarkov. In November, the pioneering extraction shooter will transition to a <strong>fully released state </strong>with a 1.0 version that comes almost a decade after the game first hit the market in a beta state.</p>



<p>However, many of the game’s most die-hard fans are skeptical about the stability of the game and the readiness of Escape from Tarkov when it comes to <strong>officially leaving the beta</strong>. I doubt that Escape from Tarkov is ‘1.0 ready’, but I’m willing (and hoping) to let Battlestate Games prove me wrong.</p>



<h2 id="h-blurring-the-lines">Blurring The Lines</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has always sat in a weird place, presenting players with the impression of it being <strong>a live service beta</strong>. It was recently confirmed by Battlestate Games that Escape from Tarkov has had <strong>more than 400 updates </strong>since it entered the long-running beta phase, and those updates include immense overhauls, engine updates, new maps, modes, integrations, and events.</p>



<p>That reads like a live-service game to me, and in the time that Tarkov has been online, a spin-off has emerged (Tarkov: Arena), <strong>and </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-battle-pass-and-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microtransactions started being fed</a> into the ecosystem.</p>



<p>It could be argued that Battlestate Games has been iterating but not <strong>refining</strong>, given that the game still suffers from stacks of issues <strong>right now</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Audio glitches that have long been a cause of broken immersion</li>



<li>Inconsistent AI that still acts erratically and disrupts gameplay</li>



<li>Server instability that causes outages and maintenance windows that are (almost) always extended</li>

<p>In a patch deployed on August 20, several new issues were uncovered and shared on social platforms by the game’s most prominent and prolific creators:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok so this patch has the following bugs:<br>– Horrible sound reverb issues back<br>– Raiders have literally 0 delay and instant kill you<br>– Item Duping<br>– 1000x skill points transfer from Arena<br>– UBGL unlimited ammo spam in PVE<br>– Containers bug out when opening and have to be closed and…</p>— Pestily (@Pestily) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pestily/status/1958331960750899417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>If a general patch deployed three months before the full release of Escape from Tarkov can introduce all these issues, it doesn’t bode well for the road ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-invisible-evidence">Invisible Evidence</h2>



<p>Foundational flaws aside, Battlestate Games has wasted no time making bold promises for the future of Escape from Tarkov. We’ve been hearing about a story-driven campaign that’ll finally allow players to <strong>escape from Tarkov</strong> for the longest time, but even with the full release announcement being out there, we still don’t know if it’s coming or what it’ll look like.</p>



<p>The trailer released by Battlestate Games to showcase the 1.0 release date for Escape from Tarkov was a live-action sequence that <strong>looked good </strong>but didn’t tell us anything besides the date: November 15, 2025.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov - Official Version 1.0 Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jjd9iEOy2XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Perhaps it’s unfair to suggest that all the 1.0 cards should have been revealed with this trailer, and Battlestate Games still has three months to uncover everything in store. In a comment under a post on social media, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov revealed that all new content drops are being reserved exclusively for the 1.0 release.</p>



<h2 id="h-still-testing">Still Testing</h2>



<p>The most recent Escape from Tarkov ‘wipe’ was an experiment of sorts that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-hardcore-wipe-experiment-backfired/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced a hardcore vibe</a> to the game. It didn’t hit as well as Battlestate might have liked, pushing the more casual players far out of the frame and alienating a vast portion of the community.</p>



<p>As the ‘farewell wipe’ for Escape from Tarkov’s beta, it seems bizarre that Battlestate Games was willing to make such drastic changes. Even now, Nikita Buyanov wants feedback from the community, suggesting what should be tested during this ‘final wipe before release’. </p>



<p>In a move that seems like polishing the brass on a sinking ship, Battlestate is still pushing the sync between Tarkov: Arena and Escape from Tarkov, and has recently opened up a PvE-focused element to that mechanic. For some, that was Battlestate building a bridge between two unfinished modes, which is hardly the steps you should be taking before a full release.</p>

<p>Let’s not forget that Escape from Tarkov has a horrific reputation in the open market for the sheer number of cheaters that find their way into the game and actively disrupt the entertainment of thousands of legitimate players.</p>



<p>It’s perhaps the <strong>single biggest flaw </strong>in Escape from Tarkov’s formula, and there is no indication that the situation will improve just because the game is being released in full. If anything, Battlestate Games might prepare to ‘move away’ from Escape from Tarkov, thus reducing support in various areas, including anti-cheat.</p>



<p>That’s conjecture, though.</p>



<p>Every few weeks, Battlestate Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-bans-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bans thousands of cheaters</a>, and the number never seems to subside. It’s like fighting a multi-headed hydra, and it’s almost impossible to see any major changes being lined up before the game releases in full in November 2025.</p>



<p>Even with all that covered, there’s still more. We’re still awaiting some map expansions and additions, movement reworks, new weapons, storylines, and engine updates to hit the platform that have been promised over the years.</p>
