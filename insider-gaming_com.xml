<p>A new update on the lawsuit reveals that Sony has filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Tencent from using Aloy’s resemblance and other elements from the Horizon series. </p>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has filed a case against Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement in a California federal court. The company has already called the accused’s upcoming title a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-calls-tencents-defense-in-horizon-clone-lawsuit-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blatant knock-off</a>” after their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a>. Now, Sony is seeking an injunction. </p>



<h2 id="h-sony-wants-to-hold-a-hearing-next-month">Sony Wants to Hold a Hearing Next Month </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/breaking-sony-asks-judge-corley-for-preliminary-injunction-against-tencents-upcoming-light-of-motiram-in-november-or-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Fray</a>, Sony is seeking a preliminary injunction in the Horizon clone lawsuit against Tencent. The motion is to stop Tencent “from reproducing, preparing derivative works of, displaying, performing, and distributing any works copied or derived from SIE’s Horizon Works, including Light of Motiram, and from using the ALOY Character Mark or any confusingly similar mark pending trial.”</p>



<p>Coming to what the Aloy Character Mark is, “she is a young and fierce tribal warrior huntress characterized by fiery red hair, high cheekbones, and outfits that blend tribal and industrial metallic elements.” The injunction also seeks to stop Tencent from using visual, audio, and storyline elements from the Horizon series.</p>



<p>Sony has asked Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, from the FTC v. Microsoft-Activision Blizzard case, to hold a hearing by November 20, 2025. The company wants a decision by the end of that month or in December. Sony has also added several sworn declarations along with the personal injunction, which includes statements from Guerrilla Games Studio and Art Director Jan-Bart van Beek, the studio’s music lead Lucas van Tol, PlayStation Productions head Asad Qizilbash, and Sony brand IP director Matthew Kuykendall.</p>



<p>In other news, Horizon Zero Dawn movie plans to start shooting in 2026 and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-movie-planned-to-release-in-2027-court-documents-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeting a 2027 release</a>.

<p>Plants vs. Brainrots pays homage to the classic Plants vs. Zombies tower defence title.

This mode features increased weapon damage, restricted loadouts, a limited HUD, and a far more unforgiving combat environment. Friendly fire is also enabled, adding an extra layer of intensity and fun in the Hardcore Conquest experience.&nbsp;</td><td data-align="center">Players looking to level up their favorite weapons in a high-stakes, tactical combat setting that rewards precision, situational awareness, critical thinking, and swift movement.</td><td>-100% Match Completion Bonus.<br>-100% Win Bonus.<br>-100% Score.<br>-100% Accolades.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Bomb Squad</strong></td><td data-align="center">X8X1</td><td data-align="center">If you enjoy planting bombs or defending against enemy bombers, then Bomb Squad is the experience for you. Loadout restrictions, custom logic, and decisive moments are the magic ingredients of this experience.

Attackers must capture points to control the sector and advance to the next one, while defenders must establish a strong defensive setup to protect the points and sectors.</td><td data-align="center">Players who prefer methodical, team-based gameplay and strategic territorial control. Breakthrough is also compatible for those who like coordinating with teammates to push through multiple objectives while holding or contesting key sectors.</td><td>-100% Match Completion Bonus.<br>-100% Win Bonus.<br>-100% Score.<br>-100% Accolades.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Breakthrough Solo Bots</strong></td><td data-align="center">7AUR</td><td data-align="center">In this mode, a default match is generated, and you are deployed on the map against 63 AI bots. Your goal? Eliminate all the bots using your preferred weapons and gameplay style. The match ends once all bots are defeated. This mode also serves as an excellent opportunity to practice shooting, improve reflexes, and farm XP. You can level up and master your weapons at your own pace, free from the pressure of competing against other players.</td><td data-align="center">Solo gamers who want to practice and XP farm before entering a long multiplayer session. If your aim or precision feels off, then this mode helps you regain your form and obtain XP for it.</td><td>-100% Match Completion Bonus.<br>-100% Win Bonus.<br>-100% Score.<br>-100% Accolades.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-are-battlefield-6-portal-xp-farms-being-nerfed">Are Battlefield 6 Portal XP Farms Being Nerfed?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Battlefield Studios will be adjusting Battlefield 6’s Portal mode to “Diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.”</strong></p>



<p>We can’t have nice things, can we? It depends on how you look at it, really. Battlerfield Portal probably wasn’t designed to be an XP grind; it was supposed to be a creative playground filled with fun-filled rides packed with madness. However, the community got smart and used Portal to level up player ranks, weapons, and more much quicker.</p>



<p>Depending on when you read this guide, the nerfs might have already happened. But we know for sure that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Portal XP Farms will be patched</a>.</p>



<p>Are you playing BF 6’s Portal mode the way it was intended? Or are you having fun mercilessly beating bots and showing that you’re better than the AI?

<p>The Horizon Zero Dawn movie aims to start shooting in 2026 and release in 2027. </p>



<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-copying-the-horizon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony is fighting Tencent</a> for allegedly copying its Horizon series in its upcoming title, Light of Motiram. Sony recently described the title as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-calls-tencents-defense-in-horizon-clone-lawsuit-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blatant knock-off</a> of their game. Now, new documents have revealed more information, including the release plans for the Horizon Zero Dawn Movie. </p>



<h2 id="h-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-has-a-working-script-and-is-looking-for-a-director">Horizon Zero Dawn Movie Has a Working Script and is Looking for a Director</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-filming-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, the head of PlayStation Productions, Asad Qizilbash, spoke about the release plans for the Horizon Zero Dawn movie in a sworn declaration. Qizilbash stated that a film based on the Horizon series is in development in partnership with Columbia Pictures, with whom they have already partnered on the Uncharted and Gran Turismo films in 2023 and 2023, respectively. </p>



<p>Qizilbash added that they “already have a working script and are actively searching for a director.” The team aims to start “shooting the picture in 2026 and releasing it in 2027.” In the declaration, the PlayStation Productions head also spoke about Aloy’s significance as a brand, not just to the Horizon franchise, but to Sony PlayStation itself. The declaration doesn’t mention anything about the upcoming movie’s cast or plot. </p>



<p>In other news, Tencent had responded to Sony’s copyright and trademark infringement lawsuit with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a>.
