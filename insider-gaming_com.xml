<p>The fifth chapter of Poppy Playtime is almost upon us, and console fans are bound to be wondering whether they can get in on the action. </p>







<p>It’s not one they’ll want to miss, either, as it’s rumoured to be the final part of the long-running saga. If you’re a PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch owner and a fan of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a>, here’s whether you can continue the journey or not.</p>

<p><strong>Despite Chapters one through three being available on Sony’s latest console, Chapter 5 of Poppy Playtime will not be readily available on PlayStation 5 at launch. </strong></p>



<p>The franchise was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally released on PC</a> all those years ago, and ever since, the titles have first and foremost debuted there. Console ports were eventually developed for some older chapters, but it looks like PS5 fans will have to miss out—at least at launch.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that a PS5 port will be developed in the future, but how far away it is remains to be seen. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s equally bad news for Xbox fans, as Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 won’t be available on either Xbox console alongside the PC launch. </strong></p>







<p>Xbox fans often get the short end of the stick, with numerous titles opting to miss their systems in recent years. However, Chapter 5 of Poppy Playtime should arrive on Xbox eventually; it’s just a matter of when. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo fans don’t fare any better; Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 will not be on the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch.</strong></p>



<p>It might be majorly disappointing for Poppy Playtime fans, but there is a silver lining. As has been mentioned numerous times, console ports will arrive in the future, typically a few months after the PC release. It’s a shame, but console ports take time, especially for Indie devs like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mob-entertainment/" id="3160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mob Entertainment</a>. </p>

<p>Mob Entertainment has excelled at delivering grit-your-teeth, bite-your-nails action through the Poppy Playtime series. It’s always been a well-priced franchise for such replayable content, but questions are being asked about Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s price.</p>



<p>Greater quality means more work, which unfortunately factors in increased cost. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a> has gotten bigger as the years have gone on, but so has its price tag. Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 could be the end for the franchise, and it could go out with an expensive bang.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5">How Much Is Poppy Playtime Chapter 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Needs more light. Credit to Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>While there is no official confirmation as yet, Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is expected to cost about $25, possibly going up to $30.</strong></p>



<p>Everything shown from the Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 gameplay trailer suggests this is the most complete game to date. Mob Entertainment’s indie project has gone from free-to-play to a fairly premium price tag.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 Release Date Countdown &amp; Exact Start Times</a></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s unlikely Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is going to buck the trend, and it’s looking very likely that the price will go up again. In keeping with the previous chapter’s increase, Chapter 5 is probably going to cost in the region of $25-30 or £20-25. </p>



<p>Chapters 2 through 4 have seen a five-dollar increase each time. Still, this is mostly guesswork based on previous games and logic, so this is only a prediction for now.</p>



<p>This guide will be updated with the accurate price once the game is out and everyone knows for sure, so keep checking back!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-have-previous-poppy-playtime-chapters-cost">How Much Have Previous Poppy Playtime Chapters Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Historical data shows that each new chapter has raised the price between $5-10, with the first game having started as a free-to-play download.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, the first game was (and still is) completely free to play. The journey had to start somewhere, and the price has only gone up as the years have gone by.</p>

It will be split into three updates, but the first one is right around the corner.</p>







<p>From a new map to multiple new weapons and vehicles, it’s a great time to jump back into the war and fight on the frontline. But make sure you don’t miss the start times if you want to get in early for the new progression. </p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA</a> announced that Season 2 of Battlefield 6 would be delayed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/">back in Jan</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">u</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/">ary</a>, as they instead made plans to extend Season 1. This decision was made with the intention of improving the content on the way, as the studio wanted to refine and polish their plans for the future.</p>

<p>It’s been a while since a new chapter brought the nightmare-inducing Huggy Wuggy to the fore, which is why you should check out Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s release date and start times to let some new horrors fester.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a> is rumored to be the final part of the saga. Whether this ends up being the case remains to be seen, but one thing’s for sure: You shouldn’t miss out on Chapter 5. The Prototype is there to explore in its entirety, and it’s not long until you can do so.</p>

<p><strong>Mob Entertainment has issued a February 18 release date for Poppy Playtime Chapter 5.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been on this journey to this point, number one, you’re brave, and number two, this could be the culmination of a five-year journey that has seen hilariously evil-looking Poppy Playtime merch appear all over the world and capture the minds and haunt the dreams of everyone in that time.</p>

<p>Huggy Wuggy has been anything but cute and adorable in that time (maybe the most misleading name in history), and it’s back to chase you around The Prototype.</p>

<p>The director of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 has confirmed that the visuals will not be lowered for the multiplatform release. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade has already been released for Xbox and Switch 2, and the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-xbox-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth</a> has also been confirmed for both platforms. The developers have announced that FFVII Remake Part 3 will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-part-3-confirmed-for-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on additional platforms</a> as well. However, players have expressed concerns that optimizing for lower-spec systems might compromise the graphics quality. The director has now addressed these concerns and assured players.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-multiplatform-release-won-t-impact-the-visuals">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Multiplatform Release Won’t Impact the Visuals</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 director Naoki Hamaguchi said the multiplatform release would not affect the graphics. Hamaguchi stated, “our decision to go&nbsp;multiplatform&nbsp;with&nbsp;the FFVII Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment.&nbsp;Our development structure simply&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;work that way&nbsp;to begin with.&nbsp;…I suppose&nbsp;I’ll&nbsp;just have to keep saying&nbsp;it.” </p>



<p>The director split it into 4 aspects to explain how quality won’t be affected. First, he stated that, in terms of ROM, none of the platforms is a concern. Coming to RAM, the Switch 2 has “ample” memory, whereas the Xbox Series S has its limits, but they optimize&nbsp;for&nbsp;each&nbsp;platform individually. </p>



<p>Coming to CPUs, the studio doesn’t&nbsp;“design the game to fully saturate a high-end CPU at 30fps”; instead, they “scale density elements,&nbsp;like&nbsp;increasing the number of NPCs in towns”. Lastly, for the GPU, the director stated that assets are created for&nbsp;high-end environments first, then optimised for each platform’s constraints. The highest-end environment is PC, PS5, and PS5 Pro, which are considered mid-range platforms. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 is sticking to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-stick-to-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unreal Engine 4</a>. The Switch 2 gameplay experience for FF7 Rebirth will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-gameplay-experience-will-be-similar-to-other-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar to other platforms</a>.
