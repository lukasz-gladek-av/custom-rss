<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, introducing the world to one of the best RPGs slated for 2025. On social media and across the internet, gamers have been abuzz about the impending release, causing all manner of questions to surface about the open-world RPG.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m addressing one of those questions: ‘Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 a sequel?’ That ‘2’ might be a bit of a giveaway, but let’s dive into the topic below and answer that question in full.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-set-after-kingdom-come">Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Set After Kingdom Come?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> is a direct sequel to the first game. It’s set mere months after the ending of the first game, which was released in 2018. In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, players assume control of Henry of Skalitz once again, slotting them into a very familiar perspective, provided they’ve played Kingdom Come Deliverance.</p>



<p>KCD2 is as instant a follow-up game as you could ever hope to play. Many themes from the first game roll over into the second title, and it’s as though you’re picking the story up right where you left it at the end of Kingdom Come Deliverance.</p>



<p>That means you’ll recognise returning characters, and understand various plots and quests, and you’ll also be familiar with many of the game’s mechanics, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockpicking</a> or making potions <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-make-saviour-schnapps-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Saviour Schnapps</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-first">Do You Need to Play Kingdom Come First?</h2>



<p>In 2018, Kingdom Come Deliverance was released to a popular enough reception, despite being a relatively gruelling and realistic game that punished average gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>This story-rich, open-world game turned heads because it was so immersive and such a faithful representation of the setting, leaning on real people, places, and events to enrich the game.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s not <strong>necessary </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-deliverance-before-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to play the first Kingdom Come Deliverance</a> before Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. This is because the developer, Warhorse Studios, has done a remarkable job with the writing of the second game, working in flashback sequences, conversations that dive into the first game’s history, and nods to the story of the opening title.</p>



<p>If you’ve not played Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018), you should be fine starting with Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>That being said, the first game is stellar, and it shouldn’t be missed.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-cheated-diablo-poe-admit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98i-am-a-living-god-of-video-games%E2%80%99-elon-musk-has-admitted-he-cheated-in-diablo-and-poe.1087458/</guid>

<p>If you’re an avid social media user, you might have heard the debate recently regarding the ‘legitimacy’ of Elon Musk’s gaming successes. In recent weeks, claims from the enigmatic and eccentric billionaire surfaced, suggesting that he’s one of the top-ranked players in both games – and he appeared to have the numbers to back those claims up.</p>



<p>However, his bold claims attracted the attention of content creators familiar with the games he plays, and the holes in his story started to show quite quickly. In a follow-up conversation with a YouTuber named NikoWrex, Elon Musk admitted that he cheated in both games to get to where he is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dishonest-conduct">Dishonest Conduct</h2>



<p>It’s no big secret that Elon Musk is an avid gamer. In the summer of 2023, Musk appeared in a live chat on Twitter (which was still <strong>named </strong>Twitter back then) and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started talking about his obsession</a> with Diablo 4, which had just been released at the time.</p>



<p>A couple of months later, he became one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most instantly successful streamers</a>, broadcasting his Diablo 4 gameplay to a concurrent viewer count of more than <strong>1.3 million </strong>users. That act alone marked him as one of the most-watched streamers in history.</p>



<p>Since then, Musk’s gaming habits have been relatively public, and weeks ago, the topic of him being a ‘top 20 player’ in Diablo 4 surfaced once again. He was quickly investigated and called out by streamers like Asmongold, who promptly fell into a social media beef with the tech billionaire and close friend of President Trump.</p>



<p>Now, in a series of DMs exchanged between Elon Musk and NikoWrex, it has been confirmed that all this time, Elon Musk was cheating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-was-elon-musk-cheating">How Was Elon Musk Cheating?</h2>



<p>A bunch of screenshots have surfaced online showcasing the full conversation between Elon Musk and NikoWrex (thanks, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/102692/elon-musk-confirms-he-cheated-to-become-top-player-in-path-of-exile-2-and-diablo-iv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TweakTown</a>). In these screenshots, Musk admits that ‘it’s impossible to beat the players in Asia’ if you’re not <strong>sharing your account </strong>with other users.</p>



<p>Account sharing is a prohibited action under the terms of service for many online games, and if it isn’t, it’s a morally corrupt concept. It’s exactly what it sounds like – you share the details of your account with other users who play when you’re busy, sleeping, working, or something like that.</p>



<p>Musk said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The top accounts in Diablo or PoE require multiple people playing the account to win a leveling race.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Musk does insist that he’s still a cracked gamer, though:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No matter how you cut it, a sub 2 min clear of the hardest level in Diablo is very fast. My run is posted to X. Very few mistakes were made.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the discourse, Elon Musk’s ex-wife took to social media to defend him, explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just for my personal pride, I would like to state that the father of my children was the first american druid in diablo to clear abattoir of zir and ended that season as best in the USA.</p>



<p>He was also ranking in Polytopia, and beat Felix himself at the game. I did observe these things with my own eyes. There are other witnesses who can verify this. That is all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However you think of his exploits in Diablo 4 and Path of Exile, it seems that Elon Musk is a talented gamer. </p>



<p>Do you think his actions are reprehensible, or should everyone chill on Elon Musk? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-organisation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shroud-might-start-a-marvel-rivals-esports-org-because-he-loves-the-game.1087278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-organisation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to turn heads since being released in December 2024. It has been a smash hit with tens of millions of players worldwide, which is aided by the fact that it’s a genuinely enjoyable, free-to-play hero shooter. NetEase is working hard to ensure the content pipeline remains stoked, and creators are locked in on the game.</p>



<p>One such creator is Shroud, one of the biggest streamers in the business. Recently, the former CSGO pro player gushed over Marvel Rivals and suggested he could be about to make an esports organisation focused exclusively on the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-jest-or-not">In Jest or Not</h2>



<p>Whether he was being serious or not remains to be seen, but if anyone can do it, Shroud can.</p>



<p>For years, Shroud has been one of the most popular streamers in the world, coming out of a relatively successful esports pro player career and opting to sit in front of the camera for years to follow. Today, he’s one of the biggest names in gaming.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Shroud once again delved into his love for Marvel Rivals, explaining a potential goal for the near future:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If we raise a certain amount of money, I’ll make a Marvel Rivals team, slash org.</p>



<p>This game might just be it.</p>



<p>I might have to set a donation goal, for this number to hit something, and <strong>I will make an org</strong> for Marvel Rivals only.</p>



<p>I might be playing this game for the rest of my life. I genuinely might be playing this game for the rest of my life.</p>
</blockquote>



<div><article><p><span>Shroud says he might make an org just so he can have a Marvel Rivals team 

“This game might just be it…I genuinely might be playing this game for the rest of my life”</span></p></article></div>







<p>Marvel Rivals boasts a solid foundation that would easily support a competitive ecosystem. For now, it’s tied almost exclusively to a ranked platform, but recently, Twitch Rivals hosted a <strong>Marvel Rivals </strong>tournament, which was more or less a first for the game.</p>



<p>In the past, Shroud has dominated the likes of Counter-Strike, Overwatch, and VALORANT, so edging into the Marvel Rivals space is nothing but familiar territory.</p>

<p>The VALORANT rivalry between North American teams Sentinels and 100 Thieves has always been hot, but it reached unhinged levels just one week into the 2025 season. After some spicy photos hit the timeline this past weekend though, the two organizations asked their outspoken stars to tone it down.</p>



<p>Still, those photos will be seared into our memory for some time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sentinels-and-100t-requested-the-images-be-taken-down">Sentinels and 100T “Requested” The Images Be Taken Down</h2>



<p>Prior to the highly anticipated match between Sentinels and 100 Thieves at VCT Americas, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/100t-valorants-boostio-says-nrg-cant-win-championships-with-fns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100T’s sparkplug in-game leader Kelden “Boostio” Pupello</a> posted a wild couple of photos on X. This included one of someone bent over in front of him wearing Sentinels’ Jordan “Zellsis” Montemurro’s jersey, with the caption “Banging @Sentinels today.”</p>



<p>However, it was Sentinels that got the last laugh, defeating 100 Thieves in three maps and knocking them down to the lower bracket of the VCT Americas Kickoff event. After the match, Boostio willingly posed in a similar bent-over position for Zellsis, who posted the image onto his Twitter account.</p>



<p>Eventually, both images were taken down, causing some on reddit to speculate that Riot forced the players to delete the photos. Some even claimed that both Zellsis and Boostio were fined for their tweets, but the Sentinels star has denied that speculation.</p>



<p>On X, Zellsis <a href="https://x.com/Zellsis/status/1881173481553101274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> “the internet [is] spreading misinformation as usual. I was not fined for that tweet, nor do I think Boostio was. The tweets were definitely out of pocket so Riot and our orgs politely requested we take them down.” Zellsis previously was fined by Riot Games back in 2023 for making a lewd gesture while on camera.</p>



<p>Should Zellsis and Boostio have received fines for their photos? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-civilization-7-civilizations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here-is-all-civilization-7-civilizations-coming-day-one-%E2%80%93-factions-guide.1087239/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-civilization-7-civilizations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a move that’s quite similar to Humankind, the relatively recent 4X strategy game that saw players leading a budding nation through history, Civilization 7 no longer requires you to pick a static faction and remain the same leader from start to finish. Instead, the game is divided into stages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. During these ages, you’ll evolve your faction from a lowly tribe to a powerhouse with nuclear missiles. Here is a look at all the Civilization 7 civilizations available on day one!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-factions-in-civilization-7-at-launch">All Factions in Civilization 7 at Launch</h2>



<p>As you progress through the various eras in Civilization 7, you’ll expand your empire, bolster your troops, and inevitably evolve your culture from one, such as the Greek, to the next, such as the Norman, before inevitably finishing the game in the modern era as, say, the Prussian. It’ll offer players many opportunities to customize the experience and ensure replayability for quite some time!</p>



<h3 id="h-antiquity">Antiquity</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Aksumite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Egyptian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Greek</strong></li>



<li><strong>Han</strong></li>



<li><strong>Khmer</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mauryan</strong></li>



<li><strong>Maya</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mississippian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Persian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Roman</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-exploration">Exploration</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Abbasid</strong></li>



<li><strong>Chola</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hawaiian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Inca</strong></li>



<li><strong>Majapahit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ming</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mongolian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Norman</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shawnee</strong></li>



<li><strong>Songhai</strong></li>



<li><strong>Spanish</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-modern">Modern</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>American</strong></li>



<li><strong>Buganda</strong></li>



<li><strong>Imperial French</strong></li>



<li><strong>Meiji Japanese</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mexican</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mughal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Prussian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Qing</strong></li>



<li><strong>Russian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Siamese</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-will-we-see-additional-civilizations-in-dlc">Will We See Additional Civilizations in DLC?</h2>



<p>Most likely, yeah. While it’s not guaranteed that we will receive DLC and expansions for Civilization 7, it’s highly considering the franchise’s overall track record for additional content. In the last game, Civilization VI, players were treated to Portugal, Vietnam, Byzantium, Gaul, and the Maya, to name a few of the leader packs that launched post-release.</p>



<p>For Civilization VII, which launches on February 11, we suspect 2K and Firaxis Games want to offer players even more content, keeping everyone satisfied for years to come!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-settings-and-options/</link>

<p>The Counter-Strike 2 settings menu is filled to the brim with different options that can change your gameplay, for better or worse. Newer CS2 players may be overwhelmed and will resign to going with the settings recommended by your system. While these options are fine, they can be better.</p>



<p>These are the best CS2 settings we can recommend you try out for yourself.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-video-settings">Best CS2 Video Settings</h2>



<p>Display Mode, Aspect Ratio, and Resolution are very dependent on personal preference. Players that alt-tab during matches or tab over to a program like Spotify, Discord, or a browser will have a more fluid time playing on Fullscreen Windowed. However, playing on Fullscreen Windowed means you can’t alter Aspect Ratio or Resolution. <strong>Playing in 4:3 stretched resolution</strong> is very popular amongst pros and long-time competitive players, as the game feels smoother and character models look wider.</p>



<ul>
<li>Under Video Settings, switch to Fullscreen, 4:3 Original, and 1280×960. By default, you’ll have black bars on the sides of your screen but these can be removed.</li>



<li>Tab out of CS2, and open the NVIDIA Control Panel. Under Display, click Adjust desktop size and position. 
<ul>
<li>Set the Scaling mode to Full-screen</li>



<li>Select GPU under “Perform scaling on”</li>



<li>Keep your resolution native</li>



<li>Set the refresh rate to your monitor’s maximum</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>When you tab back into CS2, you should have the stretched resolution that so many players prefer.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-advanced-video-settings">Best CS2 Advanced Video Settings</h2>



<p>As for your Advanced Video Settings, your goal should be improving FPS, reducing lag, and making CS2 look as clear as possible. Under the Advanced Video tab of your CS2 settings menu, make the following changes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>V-Sync: </strong>Disabled</li>



<li><strong>Multisampling Anti-Aliasing Mode:</strong> None</li>



<li><strong>Global Shadow Quality: </strong>Very High</li>



<li><strong>Model/Texture Detail: </strong>Medium</li>



<li><strong>Texture Filtering Mode: </strong>Anisotropic 16X</li>



<li><strong>Shader Detail: </strong>Low</li>



<li><strong>Particle Detail:</strong> Medium</li>



<li><strong>Ambient Occlusion: </strong>Disabled</li>



<li><strong>High Dynamic Range: </strong>Quality</li>



<li><strong>FidelityFX Super Resolution: </strong>Balanced</li>
</ul>



<p>These settings in the Advanced Video section of the CS2 menu should provide a solid balance between performance and visual clarity. With these, you should get good FPS performance without sacrificing your visuals.</p>



<p>Have these settings improved your performance in CS2? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Did you know Escape From Tarkov has in-game achievements?</strong> Despite playing since Factory was the only available map, I didn’t for the longest time. It’s true, though. As part of the 0.14 content update, EFT now offers achievements. Some remain hidden; others are common enough to score during casual play. Here’s a look at all of them!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-achievements-in-escape-from-tarkov">All Achievements in Escape From Tarkov</h2>



<p>Escape From Tarkov features a ton of achievements, but don’t expect them to unlock anything special, like in-game rewards or transfer over to Steam if the game ever launches on Valve’s digital storefront. They’re primarily for show, a bit of bragging rights as you complete raid after raid, losing all of your equipment…is that just me?</p>

<p>Civilization 7 is ready to launch. Developer Firaxis Games has announced that the game has officially gone gold three weeks ahead of the game’s February 11 release date.</p>



<p>The announcement came via a post on social media on Monday.</p>



<p>“We’ve struck gold,” the <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1881386264856772846" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post reads</a>. “[Civilization 7] has officially gone gold – we’re ready to hit shelves on February 11.”</p>



<p>With the game going gold, it signals that—barring something drastic—there’s no chance of a delay for the latest entry in the classic franchise. When it launches, Civilization 7 will be available for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. The game will feature full cross-play on release day.</p>







<p>Those who decide to pre-order one of the more expensive versions of the game will get to play starting February 6, five days before Standard Edition owners.</p>



<p>If you plan on playing the game on PC, there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-full-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different spec requirements</a> depending on the quality you’re looking from. The game will allow you to play it on CPUs as old as the Intel Core i3-101000 or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 and graphics cards as old as the Nvidia GTX 1050 and AMD RX 460. If you want to play it at the highest settings, you’ll need at least a 14th-gen Intel CPU or AMD Ryzen 9 5950X along with an Nvidia RTX 4070 or AMD Radeon RX 7800XT.</p>
