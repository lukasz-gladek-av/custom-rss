<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of February 2025 in the United States (US), knocking Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 from the top spot after four months.</p>



<p>In the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqahyb5hk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, four of the top five games from February were brand new releases. Coming in second was Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 while Civilization 7 and PGA Tour 2K25 were third and fourth, respectively. Rounding out the top five was NBA 2K25, which fell from second.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 finished sixth.</p>



<p>Regarding new game releases, six releases found their way into the top 10 for February after just one <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-was-january-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the top 20</a> in January. Aside from what was mentioned above, the other new games that made February’s list of best sellers were Avowed at seven and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii at eight.</p>



<p>Lastly, a number of games that found themselves near the top of the sales charts for months have continued to fall. In addition to the aforementioned Call of Duty and NBA 2K25, EA Sports College Football 25 has fallen out of the top 10 for the first time, coming in at 16th compared to seventh. The only game to stay in its same spot from month to month is Elden Ring at 18.</p>

<p>A game called Plants vs Zombies Reloaded has been rated by the Brazil rating board, sparking discussion that a remaster of the original could be in development.</p>



<p>The rating, which simply says “Plants vs Zombies Reloaded” was rated for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X, PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile with an ‘L’ rating.</p>



<p>Plants vs Zombies was first developed and published by PopCap Games in May 2009 and later was acquired by EA in July 2011. Despite the initial game being a success and multiple spin-offs and a few sequels, the Plants vs Zombies community has criticized the developers for not replicating the success of the original game.</p>



<p>“I hope it means ea (or popcap idk if they can make decisions by themselves) will get his shit together to deliver a proper sequel in the future but at this point the mere thought of it falls into hopium territory, they fumbled the franchise so hard that it hurts,” said Reddit user kdk_2002.</p>



<p>“Thankfully you don’t have to even look to EA, I sure as hell don’t, since the fans have taken it upon themselves to continue PvZ and have made a plethora of great mods expanding upon PvZ1 and PvZ2. We’re eating good and not giving EA a dime, as it should be until they deliver something actually worth paying for,” said another user.</p>

<p>United Videogame Workers (UVW), in conjunction with the Communication Works of America (CWA) and the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) have announced the first ever industry-wide, direct-join union in North America. The UVW-CWA Local 9433 was revealed during Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2025 in San Francisco, California.</p>



<p>As a direct-join union, anyone working in the video game industry in both the United States and Canada can join. That includes artists, developers, QA tester, and more whether they are freelance or full time. It also doesn’t matter how many people from their specific company have joined.  </p>



<p>“The creation of this union was not done in isolation; it’s a cumulative effort by the thousands of video game workers who have been fighting for years to redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power in one of the largest and highest-grossing industries on the globe,”&nbsp;said CWA’s Senior Director of Organizing Tom Smith <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-launch-industry-wide-union-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via press release</a>. “These workers are taking a bold stand, joining together to build power for the workers behind the games we all know and love.”</p>



<p>CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. added: “As video game studios have consolidated, the workers whose creativity, dedication, and skill bring the games to life have become more an afterthought. They are subject to endless cycles of layoffs and rehiring as corporate executives pursue short-term profits at the expense of a sustainable future.”</p>



<p>The press release adds that as part of the union’s launch, its members will be running a petition “demanding dignity and job security for all video game workers, particularly those facing layoffs.” They will also have a large presence around GDC 2025, including panels and other events.</p>



<p>The unions mission statement reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Our mission is to take back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs; to empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers laboring invisibly to keep this industry afloat</em>. <em>We are going to create a game industry that works for us, one that nourishes its talent and invests in its future, rather than constantly seeking short-term profits. We are the ones that make the games, so we must be the ones that set the terms of how we work.</em></p>




</blockquote>



<p>As of publishing, there have been a <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">known 1,493 jobs lost</a> due to layoffs in 2025 across 47 companies. This comes after an estimated 16,000 people lost their jobs in 2024.</p>

<p>The Boys’ collaborations in the gaming world are popping up left, right, and centre, with the latest one being with Rainbow 6 Siege.</p>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-6-siege-the-boys-bundles">Rainbow 6 Siege The Boys Bundles</h2>



<p>The collaboration between The Boys and Rainbow 6 Siege introduces new bundles to the game, which include Operator skins, weapon skins and charms. The first bundle is called the Ace Homelander Bundle, and it turns the Operator into one of the main antagonists from The Boys, with his themed weapon skin and charm. Similarly, the other bundle sees the Operator, Deimos, put on the Black Noir outfit, along with his special weapon skin and charm.&nbsp;</p>
