<p>The debate around the use of generative AI in video games is one of the more hotly debated topics of the last handful of years. While some find the value in what it could mean to the development timeline of larger games, others are worried that it will lead to lower-quality games being released and talent artists and developers losing their jobs. It appears that Steam users are concerned about generative AI in their games as well, and they want to be about to know which games are using the technology.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/10/595140105668154379/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam forum’s suggestions</a> thread, a suggestion to allow players to filter out games made with generative AI has picked up steam—no pun intended—since it was posted earlier this month. </p>



<p>Said original poster AyeforScotland, “I don’t have any interest in playing demos from games that use Generative AI in their development. It would be good if an option was added to filter these games in the same way players can already filter Adult/NSFW content.”</p>



<p>In 27 pages of replies, as of publishing, it appears to be a feature that everyone is in agreement with wanting. And the reasons, while similar, have some specific variance.</p>



<p>“I don’t want to play a game nobody wanted to make,” one user responded. “I want to play things people made, who love what they’ve created.”</p>



<p>Said another: “All the AIs out there are trained on stolen labour. I’d rather not financially support anyone who’s happy to use them to produce games, and every demo download translates into financial support via Steam’s own algorithms.”</p>



<p>What do you think about being able to filter games based on whether generative AI was used or not? Let us know down below, and join the discussion further in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1691/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>The Mecha Break Release Period is great news to the hundreds of thousands who wishlisted the manic mech title. The beta is proving to be a hit, and the full Mecha Break release could be groundbreaking.</p>



<p>Amazing Seasun Games is an ambitious studio focused on making fun and different games. You only have to look at the difference between Snowbreak Containment Zone—a fully-fledged sci-fi shooter—and Mecha Break to see this. But it’s the latter drawing a lot of eyes in 2025.</p>



<p>Did you know Mecha Break’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-announces-open-beta-and-new-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta</a> hit a monumental <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-beta-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">317,000 concurrent players on its first day</a>? Sleep on it if you dare. Let’s get stuck into the latest on the multiplayer mech shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-mecha-break-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Mecha Break is Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A spectacle. Credit to Amazing Seasun Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mecha Break doesn’t have a specific release date, but it’s been confirmed the game is arriving in Spring 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The general release period was confirmed by developer Amazing Seasun Games via an <a href="https://x.com/MechaBREAK/status/1888331963536400723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X post</a>. They let players know: “Mecha BREAK launches Spring 2025!”</p>



<p>I have to think the open beta feedback will have a bearing on launch plans. If there’s a lot to work on, don’t be surprised to see the release window get pushed back. Very rarely are games brought forward, so expect <a href="https://mechabreak.seasungames.com/index/en/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mecha Break</a> to launch in the months of <strong>March, April, or May</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-mecha-break-platforms">Mecha Break Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox Series X|S and PC players can enjoy Mecha Break at release, and the mech shooter is also coming to PlayStation 5 later on.</strong></p>



<p>In the same post concerning the release window, the developer confirmed its initial platforms: “Play on Steam, Windows PC via the Xbox App, and as a console launch exclusive with Xbox Series X|S.” A curious fan quizzed the Mecha Break X page on the status of a PlayStation 5 launch.</p>



<p>If you are on PS5, don’t worry, a future release is on the cards: “<strong>We look forward to bringing Mecha BREAK to PlayStation players later in 2025</strong>.” </p>







<p>It’s disappointing for PlayStation users, but at least a port is coming! Nintendo Switch players must sit this one out for good—unless the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> can handle it.</p>

<p>Mecha Break is one of many incredible games scheduled for 2025. From Soulslike titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> to the Devil May Cry-inspired action title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, and FPS royalty with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>. If you do play Mecha Break, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-earn-mecha-break-twitch-drops-all-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get free Twitch Drops</a> for it.</p>
