<p>The first in-game look of Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 Terminator has been unofficially revealed for Mortal Kombat 1. The first look comes via a Mortal Kombat 1 Pro Kompetition trailer. </p>



<p>In the first look, we see T-1000’s hand go from liquid metal to human. The character is based on actor Robert Patrick’s likeness from the movie. For Conan the Barbarian, it’s based on the likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger from the 1982 movie. His appearance showcases a brutality where he puts a dagger through his opponent’s face before cutting him in half.</p>



<p>Conan the Barbarian won’t feature Schwarzenegger’s voice. However, Patrick is voicing his character in the game. You can check out the trailer for yourself below with the new character appearances starting around the 45 second mark.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Conan the Barbarian is scheduled to release for players on January 21. There is no release date yet for T-1000 Terminator. They are the last of the announced DLC fighters coming to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster. Current reports suggest that Warner Bros. Games and NetherRealm Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/">scrapped plans for Kombat Pack 3</a> after a lackluster performance of the Khaos Reigns expansion. </p>



<p>Neither Warner Bros. Games nor NetherRealm Studios have confirmed this to be the case or responded to requests for comment on the reports. That said, should it be the end of future releases for the game, Mortal Kombat is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to be a focus</a> for Warner Bros. Games moving forward, according to its CEO.</p>

<p>PGA Tour 2K25’s release date carries on the series’ pattern of two-year cycles. A new installment of expert ball-striking and green-reading beckons, and your tee time is arriving sooner than expected. We have news on 2K25’s launch and its day-one platforms.</p>



<p>Many golfers out there struggle with the round-to-round grind of the real thing. I fall into this category, and while I’m not the worst golfer, only the wish from a genie’s lamp could get me close to being good. 2K’s simulated golf series is the perfect playground for disillusioned players (like me) to capture a sliver of what it’s like to be great at golf. </p>



<p>PGA Tour 2K25 looks to be a natural evolution of everything we’ve seen before, and its release date and platforms are known.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-pga-tour-2k25-s-release-date">When is PGA Tour 2K25’s Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A serene setting. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>PGA Tour 2K25 releases worldwide on February 28, but you can play the game earlier on January 21 through Early Access.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7TlP1WBr50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Next Round, Best Round” announcement trailer</a> dropped on January 14. It highlighted visual upgrades over its predecessor, the introduction of three of the four majors (The Masters being exclusive to EA), some of its stacked roster, and the anticipated release date.</p>



<p>Clean your clubs, mark your balls, and prep your outfit because the round gets underway soon. Even though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-revealed-releases-february-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25 has officially been announced</a>, we’ve known about a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour game</a> since November. Take-Two let the news slip during a November 6 Earning’s Call.</p>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-release-time">PGA Tour 2K25 Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>A worldwide midnight launch for PGA Tour 2K25 is expected.</strong></p>



<p>It’s standard practice for pretty much most titles nowadays, but expect a mightnight release in each region. This does mean it varies—depending on where you live—but Early Access also has a big say on how soon you get to experience PGA Tour 2K25 anyway.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-pga-tour-2k25-platforms">All PGA Tour 2K25 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>2K has confirmed the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC as the only launch platforms at launch.</strong></p>



<p>This means PGA Tour 2K23 is the last of its kind to incorporate all generations of consoles. A PS4 and Xbox One launch was also included, but the same can’t be said for PGA Tour 2K25. The developer and publisher have decided to move on, so if you’re looking to tee up 2K25, you need to have the right launch hardware.</p>



<hr>



<p>As a golf enthusiast, I’m very excited to see the improvements 2K has made for PGA Tour 2K25. With rival franchise <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-pga-tour-gets-latest-major-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports PGA Tour</a> now competing in the simulated golf space, it’s an exciting time. Which features are you eager for 2K to add? Does anything from 2K23 fundamentally need changing or improving?</p>

<p>A new job listing by Guerrilla Games suggests that the developers hope to attract more than 1 million players globally to their upcoming Horizon Multiplayer title.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/horizon-multiplayer-game-live-service-player-count-ambitions-guerrilla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a> via (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horizon/horizon-zero-dawns-multiplayer-spinoff-has-big-dreams-as-guerrilla-confirms-its-hoping-to-attract-more-than-1-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), a new <a href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/join/senior-platform-engineer-decima/7779018002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> for a senior platform engineer at Guerrilla Games’ Online Infrastructure team has seemingly provided new details about the upcoming online multiplayer title based in the Horizon universe. One of the job requirements for this position is for the applicant to have experience in “building and operating multi-service, 1M+ user globally distributed systems across multiple public cloud providers”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though the listing hints that Guerrilla Games could expect over 1 million players for their Horizon Multiplayer game, the game itself is not mentioned. However, considering they do not currently have any other multiplayer games in the works (that have been confirmed), it can be speculated that it is the Horizon online title. At the same time, the million-player user base might be an upper limit to ensure the server can smoothly handle the influx of players during the launch period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Horizon Online Multiplayer title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in 2022, announcing, “A new internal team is developing a separate Online Project set in the Horizon’s universe.” Since then, no official announcements or news have arrived about the game; however, a recent job listing suggested that the online Horizon game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-online-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Horizon Zero Dawn movie was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced by Sony at CES 2025</a>. Also, according to a new claim, LEGO Horizon Adventures <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could come to Xbox in a few months</a>. What are your thoughts on Guerrilla aspiring to bring more than one million players to their Horizon online multiplayer game?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A isn’t being built to take advantage of the hardware improvements of the Nintendo Switch 2. That’s according to Jeff Grubb on his latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/TfkNfMonxoc?t=3942s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Last of the Nintendogs</a>” episode.</p>



<p>Grubb said that when the next Pokémon Presents takes place—likely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-pokemon-presents-date-seemingly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Pokemon Day</a>—all of the games shown will be developed for the current Switch console.</p>



<p>“I did hear that everything in that Pokémon Direct will be positioned as ‘These games are Switch 1 games’,” Grubb said. “They will work on Switch 2, but there will not be anything that is obviously made for Switch 2. Which is normal for The Pokémon Company.”</p>



<p>His co-host, Mike Minotti, seemed surprised by that with a belief that “of all that games that should get a performance boost on the Switch 2” it should be the next Pokémon game.</p>







<p>Announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during last year’s Pokémon Presents</a> on Pokémon Day, Pokémon Z-A is the follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus from 2022. The game features “a new adventure awaits within Lumiose City, where an urban redevelopment plan is under way to shape the city into a place that belongs to both people and Pokémon.”</p>



<p>More on the game is expected to be shown, including the announcement of a release date, during the upcoming Pokémon Presents event in February. There will also be new information on upcoming plans for Pokémon Go along with the expected surprises that always seem to appear during the events.</p>
