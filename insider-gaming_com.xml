<p>The Counter-Strike 2 competitive scene is known for its dauntingly stacked calendar, but one team is racking up official maps played at a breakneck pace. Unsurprisingly, it’s a tier two team that has to play a marathon of matches just to qualify for events like the illustrious Majors.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tier-two-bc-game-could-break-the-cs2-record-for-most-official-maps-played-in-a-year">Tier Two BC.Game Could Break the CS2 Record for Most Official Maps Played in a Year</h2>



<p>It’s not even halfway through March, and the European veteran roster playing for BC.Game has already <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/teams/12878/bcgame?startDate=2025-01-01&amp;endDate=2025-12-31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played 107 official maps</a> of professional Counter-Strike in 2025. BC.Game, a crypto casino website, entered CS2 in the summer of 2024. In the second half of that year, the team played 94 maps, but they have already beaten that number this year in less than half the time.</p>



<p>107 official maps played so far averages out to more than 1.55 maps per day. While that doesn’t sound like a lot to a casual player, that’s only taking into account official matches as part of a tournament or qualifier. It doesn’t include the hours spent practicing, scrimming, or traveling. In 2024, the team that played the most official maps was Polish team Permitta, who played 467. But at their current rate, BC.Game could pass 500 official maps played before the end of the year.</p>



<p>Tier two teams like BC.Game are burdened with having to play far more maps of Counter-Strike than the higher ranked tier one teams. In comparison, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reigning Major champions Team Spirit</a> have only played 35 maps so far this year, less than a third of the total that BC.Game has accrued. Tier two teams such as BC.Game consistently have to play through open qualifiers to reach prestigious CS2 events, as they don’t have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-vrs-in-cs2-valve-regional-standings-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Valve-determined ranking</a> to receive a direct invite to playoffs or later stages of certain events. Even Fnatic, who once dominated Counter-Strike a decade ago, had to play <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/4991/fnatic#tab-matchesBox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seven best-of-three series</a> across the past two days.</p>



<p>Will BC.Game, or any CS2 team, reach 500 official maps played in 2025? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The next-generation Xbox console is two years away from release. According to a new report from Windows Central’s Jez Corden, Microsoft is currently targeting 2027 for release of its next mainline Xbox consoles.</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the report</a>, the new systems are in full production at Microsoft. </p>



<p>“[Our] sources also indicate that Microsoft’s internal successor to the Xbox Series X|S platform has been fully greenlit all the way up to CEO Satya Nadella,” Corden writes.</p>



<p>He adds that it’s believed that the current plans for the next generation of Xbox include a “premium successor” to the Xbox Series X along with its own in-house developed handheld console. There are also plans for “several” new controllers.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Future Of Call of Duty—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>Corden’s report also follows up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-not-a-console-at-all-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his earlier claims</a> that new Xbox consoles will be “closer to Windows than ever before”.  The new systems will also still support backwards compatibility to allow older games to be played.</p>



<p>In addition to the new consoles, Microsoft is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-launching-partner-gaming-handheld-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly planning to launch</a> an Xbox-partnered handheld gaming system later in 2025.</p>



<p>None of these plans have been officially announced by Microsoft. Until that happens—and even after they become public—, understand that targets can always change. Insider Gaming has reached out to Xbox for comment on the claims. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Xbox is finally getting into the gaming handheld space. According to a new report from Jez Corden of Windows Central, Microsoft is working to launch an Xbox-branded handheld later in 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report states</a> that it won’t be a Microsoft produced device. Instead, the company is working with a partner OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer).</p>



<p>The device, under the codename “Keenan”, “will look unmistakably Xbox”, the report says. The device will even feature an Xbox Guide button that is featured on Xbox controllers.</p>



<p>Not much was given regarding features. However, there was speculation from the report.</p>



<p>“Given that this is a partner device, similar to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lenovo’s SteamOS partnership with Valve</a>, I expect this handheld to be more PC-oriented,” Corden says. “It’ll most likely run full Windows, putting the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass front and center, alongside the ability to install things like Steam.”</p>



<p>In addition to the plans for an Xbox-themed handheld this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft is targeting 2027</a> for its next-gen console.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Xbox for comment on the claims. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft working on launching an Xbox gaming handheld this year? Is it something you’ll pick up? Let us know down below and in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1733/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 Classes dictate how you approach every match. The franchise has notoriously stuck by the same few Classes throughout the years. EA’s early work on Classes for the 2025 Battlefield sequel has been revealed, and each one favors a particular playstyle.</p>



<p>The Class system has always helped Battlefield stand out from its competition. Whereas Call of Duty allows users to create bespoke loadouts—usually factoring in the best meta gear and equipment—Battlefield is more restrictive. DICE gives the community a small handful of Classes to pick, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> looks to be much the same in 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs test</a> is an early pre-Alpha designed to test the game’s foundations. But <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked gameplay footage</a> has already shed light on the direction the full Battlefield 6 release is heading.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-class-in-battlefield-6-revealed-so-far">Every Class in Battlefield 6 Revealed so far</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is it the same Classes again? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Leaked Battlefield 6 Labs footage reveals four familiar Classes: Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon.</strong></p>



<p>Like the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield</a> 2042 image I’ve posted above shows, Battlefield 6 looks to be a continuation of the popular Classes. Apart from Battlefield 1—which had Assault, Medic, Support, Scout, Pilot &amp; Tanker, Cavalry, and Elite Classes—most Battlefield games use the same Classes.</p>



<p>As we’ve covered, the Battlefield Labs pre-Alpha has already leaked. In-match gameplay footage clearly shows you can choose from Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon. This doesn’t mean these are the final Classes though: Everything is subject to change between a pre-Alpha and a full release.</p>



<h3 id="h-assault">Assault</h3>



<p>This is your typical Battlefield, on-foot infantry with automatic weapons designed to eliminate the opposition at close-to-medium distances. They get stuck in, offer limited healing properties, and are an all-round killer.</p>



<h3 id="h-engineer">Engineer</h3>



<p>An Engineer gets stuck into the technical and mechanical side of things. Repairing ally vehicles, sabotaging enemy vehicles, and using a full breadth of equipment to be as impactful as any other role.</p>



<h3 id="h-support">Support</h3>



<p>Your Support are your healers, the fastidious individuals scurrying around the Battlefield resupplying and restocking teammates. They can also hinder the enemy team with their unique equipment and are very important.</p>



<h3 id="h-recon">Recon</h3>



<p>If you prefer to engage at long distances, pick off enemies, and remain unseen, Recon is the way for you. The role is known for Sniper Rifles and players capable of highlighting and identifying threats for the rest of their team.</p>



<hr>



<p>There’s plenty of time between now and the full Battlefield 6 release. We know Battlefield Labs is a testing ground and nothing more. We’ll have to wait and see, but are you happy to see Battlefield 6 stick to the same four Classes? Or should the shooter be more ambitious?</p>
