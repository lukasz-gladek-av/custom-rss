            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s upcoming Season 1 will come with a series of different challenges that will change the game for the better. In a post by Battlefield Communications, the patch notes reveal that changes will be coming to some of the game’s absurd challenges, improvements to player visibility, and changes to weapon dispersion.</p>



<p>You can see the full patch notes below; some of which are already live.</p>



<p><em>Live Now:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Search: </strong>We’ve made some adjustments to improve how accurately matchmaking aligns with your selected map and mode preferences. The system still maintains flexibility to support reasonable queue times, so players with more specific selections may notice slightly longer waits. We’ll keep monitoring Custom Search performance and continue fine-tuning as needed.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Spawn Bug:</strong> We recently deployed a targeted backend change to address an issue where vehicles could sometimes fail to spawn as expected across certain maps and modes. The current results have shown that it has greatly reduced the number of occurrences and started to improve the balance issues on some map/mode combinations. We are aware of a few outliers that this fix did not address, and we’re working on a fix to resolve these outstanding issues. We also saw that this backend change had a slightly positive impact on Breakthrough win rates, but we are working on further balancing changes that are meant to be more impactful and bring the win rates into a better state.</li>



<li><strong>Portal Server Availability:</strong> Earlier this week, we made XP adjustments for Community Experiences. In case you missed it, check out the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981556746482307086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details</a> on how to get Full XP in Verified modes.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Upcoming Changes:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Player Movement</strong>: We are actively refining player movement to address areas that previously felt inconsistent, while staying true to the gameplay pace and maintaining the core feel of the launch experience. In parallel, we are enhancing sight stability by minimizing reticle movement during specific animations. These adjustments aim to deliver a smoother and more precise aiming experience, all while preserving an immersive first-person feel.</li>



<li><strong>Progression: </strong>We are continuing to monitor the impact of the changes that were made <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979183830113087566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week</a> and already seeing a smoother experience as we roll into Season 1. Some additional areas we are tracking:</li>



<li>XP earned in Escalation and King of the Hill is not always working as intended. We are planning to significantly increase the payout to bring them in line with other modes and will keep monitoring once the changes are live.</li>



<li>We’ve seen all your feedback about the challenges and their criteria, the team’s working on a series of improvements to make challenges more straightforward to understand and faster to complete. Given the scale of challenges, these changes will roll out over at least two updates. Some examples of what we are currently considering are:</li>



<li>Class Assignment – Assault 1 – Get kills while using the Adrenaline Injector – 30 to 3</li>



<li>Class Assignment – Engineer Expert 3 – Repair Vehicles in a Match – From 6000 to 1000</li>



<li>Weapon Assignment – Deadeye 2 – Get headshot kills over 200m with Sniper Rifles – from 150 to 5</li>



<li>In addition, a later game update will reduce the 200m distance</li>



<li><strong>Visibility:</strong> We are actively looking into adjustments to exposure and brightness. This will lead to improvements in places where players have experienced blinding light when looking outdoors, overly dark interiors when looking indoors, and a lack of visibility around weapon optics when zooming in. These adjustments are part of a wider pass focused on improving visibility that we expect to complete later in Season 1.</li>



<li><strong>Weapon Dispersion: </strong>As part of our Season 1 Update 1 (October 28), we’re making several adjustments to how weapon dispersion behaves. These changes are aimed at ensuring each weapon’s accuracy better reflects its intended performance over range. We’ve also fixed a bug that caused dispersion to not decrease as expected when transitioning from sprinting to a prone position.</li>
</ul>



<p>We’ll continue refining how weapon accuracy behaves in battle to make your shots feel more consistent and rewarding across all weapon types. Our upcoming tuning pass will reduce the overall impact of dispersion across multiple weapon types while keeping the core intent intact. Burst-firing will remain the most effective way to control a weapon, and each weapon will still perform best within its intended range. We’ve also identified a couple of bugs that caused weapons to feel less accurate than intended:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Post-Sprint Firing:</strong> Weapons fired immediately after sprinting while zoomed could retain higher dispersion, reducing accuracy.</li>



<li><strong>Movement Start:</strong> Dispersion was increasing faster than it should when players began moving, making even small adjustments unexpectedly impact precision. This was especially noticeable on controllers.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-regarding-battlefield-labs"><strong>Regarding Battlefield Labs</strong></h2>



<p>We are taking a brief hiatus on Battlefield Labs as we prioritize the rollout of Season 1 content. Labs is at its best when we can iterate quickly with you, and it was invaluable in how much it helped us prepare for the launch of Battlefield 6. More updates will be shared when play sessions are returning and we will continue to develop the future of Battlefield 6 together.</p>



<h2 id="h-battle-royale-mode-learnings-and-updates"><strong>Battle Royale Mode: Learnings and Updates</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking of Battlefield Labs, we have updates on the</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battle-royale-testing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Battle Royale mode</a></p>



<p>following the suggestions we received during our play sessions. Your Battlefield Labs feedback has helped us fine-tune key elements for this experience. Here’s a quick look at what changes you may notice the next time you play:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Close-range TTK</strong>: We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li>



<li><strong>Armor Changes</strong>: Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li>



<li><strong>World Improvements</strong>: We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Balance</strong>: We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li>
</ul>



<p>We have also been working on providing smoother performance overall. We have identified and addressed a range of issues that affected performance that we simply couldn’t have done without our players’ involvement in the tests.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does ARC Raiders Have A Wipe? Does Progression Carry Over From Betas?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-arc-raiders-have-a-wipe/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-arc-raiders-have-a-wipe-does-progression-carry-over-from-betas.1333876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is looking to capture the extraction shooter market. Doing so brings up a myriad of questions concerning wipe progression, if any beta progress carries over into the full game, and how it differs from its rivals.</p>



<p>Let’s not beat around the bush: Escape From Tarkov is regarded as the first extraction shooter, and it introduced a whole new hybrid of shooter, looting, and exploring. One of the reasons it’s both adored and frustrating for players is progression and wipes. Tarkov regularly has a ‘wipe’ where the entire player base effectively starts over from scratch—restarting your progress and giving you a new reason to play again.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is also an extraction shooter using a lot of the same fundamentals. Let’s see how similar its wipe system is, and if it even has one.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-have-a-progression-wipe">Does ARC Raiders Have A Progression Wipe?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Best of both worlds. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders has an optional progression wipe called “Expedition Projects” that works in a similar style to wipes, but is much deeper, and not every player has to do it.</strong></p>



<p>It’s good news for those of you who don’t like progression wipes. Since day one, the developer has stressed that the <strong>game will not have mandatory wipes</strong>, and the game uses something they’ve touted as a “Voluntary reset mechanic.”</p>



<p>It’s understandable if you don’t want to have hours and days of gameplay essentially be for nothing once the wipe hits. This is why Embark Studios has worked hard to create its own system for ARC Raiders—<a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Expedition Projects</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the full game, players will have access to a feature called “Projects”. At level 20, the first major project players will have access to is the Expedition Project. Upon completion, this project makes a character reset available. If a player completes a reset, they will be able to do so again so long as they complete another of these projects.</p>



<p>The Expedition Project will operate on a repeating cycle of roughly 8 weeks. During the course of these 8 weeks, players can contribute toward and make progress on their Expedition Project, which will overall be a somewhat large time investment. At the start of the 8th week, the ability to finalize the project will become available &amp; will remain available for that entire week. If a player has fulfilled all of the necessary stages of the project, they will be able to commit to completing the Expedition during this period.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s also explained that you can continue making progress toward the project, even after the period of time has passed.</p>



<p>Performing an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-have-optional-progression-wipes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">optional progression wipe</a> grants you exclusive rewards and unlocks that will stay with your account forever. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-beta-progression-carry-to-full-game">Does ARC Raiders Beta Progression Carry To Full Game?</h2>



<p><strong>None of the progress you have made in ARC Raiders betas carries over into the game’s full release.</strong></p>



<p>From the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam Playtest</a> to initial betas, you’ve likely racked up many hours of gameplay. Killed robots, being killed by other players, and had a great time. Well, they have to stay as memories, as anything you’ve achieved until now is (ironically) wiped.</p>



<p>It’s a clean slate from October 30. It goes without saying, though, that you have an advantage if you have registered any beta hours.</p>



<p>Let us know if you’re happy that ARC Raiders doesn’t have a mandatory wipe. Is it the perfect answer to people who hate losing all their progress playing Escape From Tarkov? You know what to do.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-to-play-like-ninja-gaiden-4-top-hack-and-slash-games-to-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/7-best-games-to-play-like-ninja-gaiden-4%E2%80%94top-hack-and-slash-games-to-play.1333855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone’s gaming journey varies, and we all reach different places at different times. You might only now be playing a hack-and-slash game for the first time with Ninja Gaiden 4, and it’s not a bad way to start. There will come a point where you feel the need to move on, and this is why we’ve picked out some of the best hack-and-slash games in a similar vein to Ninja Gaiden; you should play now or at some point.</p>



<p>Some of them are oldies, but they’re all goldies in one way or another. We love the hack ‘n’ slash genre as it’s fast-paced, usually brutal, and demands a higher skill level to master these games. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-preload-guide-file-size-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> is a continuation of everything the genre has established to this point.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve completed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4 trophy list</a> (seriously impressive!) or you’re ready for a new challenge, there’s something on this list for everyone.</p>



<h2 id="h-games-like-ninja-gaiden-4-you-should-play">Games Like Ninja Gaiden 4 You Should Play</h2>



<h3 id="h-devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dance with the devil. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>With some of these entries, it’s hard to isolate a single game, and the Devil May Cry series is the perfect example. Apart from the much-maligned Devil May Cry 2, which didn’t resemble a DMC game and was a travesty, let’s face it, every other release is incredible in its own right. </p>



<p><strong>This even includes the controversial 2013 reboot</strong>—where Ninja Theory took a break from Ninja Gaiden to give Dante a midlife crisis makeover. The action is slick, the combo and score system gives you incentive to keep replaying levels, and the franchise is a thematic treat.</p>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war">God of War</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s take a trip through time. Credit to Santa Monica</figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, we won’t be picky here, but let’s take the modern-day God of War reboots out of the equation. Ignore them and go back in history to revisit Kratos’ humble and horrible beginnings. Learn how the God of War got his title, why he looks the way he does, and why the recent incarnation of Kratos seems tired and devoid of anger and conflict wherever possible.</p>



<p>God of War is the best hack and slash series (in this writer’s opinion), and <strong>God of War 3 is the pinnacle of the action</strong>. Like DMC, every entry is special in its own right, but God of War 3 is the culmination of an epic trilogy. It features some of the series’ most iconic set-piece battles ever, and the action and gameplay look and play beautifully.</p>



<h3 id="h-bayonetta">Bayonetta</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sultry yet skillful. Credit to PlatinumGames</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.platinumgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlatinumGames</a> really knows its shizzle, doesn’t it? The company appears multiple times on this list in both development and publisher roles. Here, it’s as a developer, and you can choose any of the three mainline Bayonetta games for your hack-and-slash fix. <strong>Bayonetta is a wicked witch, and oozes charisma and personality</strong>. With guns for shoes and a penchant for using her whole outfit as part of her arsenal, Bayonetta has combos and chaos coursing through her veins.</p>



<p>Intricate combat systems are supported by the usual slew of magic and special abilities, and it all weaves together to make Bayonetta a joy to behold. It’s a series you should definitely consider, and you should play each game after playing Ninja Gaiden 4.</p>



<h3 id="h-nier-automata">Nier: Automata</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Nier, far. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>Developer? PlatinumGames. Unbelievable fast-paced action and engaging story? Check. <strong>PlatinumGames generally doesn’t miss</strong>: From Vanquish to Astral Chain, they know what players want. They know how to make immersive action games, and there’s a reason why Nier: Automata was in the running for Game of the Year in 2017.</p>



<p>Playful parkour and pleasant platforming sections intertwine frenetic action-heavy sequences. Blink, and you’ll miss a building being destroyed and 2B (the main character) being swarmed by hostile robots and threats. One of Automata’s pulls is the story, which requires multiple playthroughs to fully experience and realize the game’s ambitious vision.</p>



<h3 id="h-metal-gear-rising-revengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Not a proper MGS game, but it’s still pretty good. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Copy and paste everything about PlatinumGames again. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was a different kind of game. Having Raiden—the cyborg ninja—as the protagonist meant Konami pivoted toward a more hack-and-slash approach. <strong>It’s an MGS spin-off</strong>, for sure, but it doesn’t make it any less fun.</p>



<p>Outside of the typical action cadence Platinum delivers, there’s a terrific story here with the usual Kojima-inspired narrative licks and splashes of Metal Gear Solid nuance. This is a short but sizzling sweet ride.</p>



<h3 id="h-dante-s-inferno">Dante’s Inferno</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s get the major and obvious negative out of the way: <strong>Dante’s Inferno is a blatant reskin of God of War</strong>, and doesn’t deliver the same compelling experience. On the other hand, if you enjoy hack-and-slash games and love God of War, there’s a lot to relish about Dante’s Inferno.</p>



<p>You guide Dante through the Nine Circles of Hell before confronting Lucifer himself. You have to fight your way through a LOT of enemies and bosses to get there. Each of the Seven Sins is explored, with environments and enemies designed to match up with the current area’s theme. The game is actually badass, and had this come out before the first God of War game, the annals of history might look quite different.</p>



<h3 id="h-ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Why not. Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>We come full circle with Ninja Gaiden. Logically, if you enjoy Ninja Gaiden 4, why not go back and play any other NG release? News Flash: There are quite a few of them. 2025 has seen the release of two other launches alone: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-complete-list-of-ninja-gaiden-2-black-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> (A complete remaster of the second game) and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-ninja-gaiden-ragebound-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>.</p>



<p>You’ve got NES and SNES releases from the 80s and 90s, and <strong>2004 onwards is seen as the real start of Ninja Gaiden</strong>. You can’t go wrong with most of them, to be honest, and you know what you’re going to get!</p>



<p>We’ve tried to pick the absolute must-play hack-and-slash games and franchises. However, you’re more than welcome to disagree. So let us know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> which hack ‘n’ slash titles or series you think NG4 fans have to play next.</p>
