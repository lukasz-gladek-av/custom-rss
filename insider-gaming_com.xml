<p>If you follow Insider Gaming, you know a few of us are huge fans of the extraction shooter genre. We play the top games in the genre in our spare time, and we‚Äôre always watching new and indie releases in the scene. But few delve into the horror scene. Now, horror extraction shooter Level Zero: Extraction has hit 1.0 with a massive patch, a vast content revamp, and even a new game mode!</p>







<p>You can check out the full patch notes below, but the developer sent over a little release detailing everything different in 1.0 compared to the Early Access version of the game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Most lights are now on by default. Alien Monsters now take damage from UV light‚Äîflashlights, glowsticks, and flares have been changed to UV;</li>



<li>Lots of new grenades &amp; weapons as well as attachments for the guns, including optics;</li>



<li>Research Facility map size increased, added two new sectors‚ÄîMedblock and Radiation Tests‚Äîthat require access cards to enter, printable on the map itself;</li>



<li>Mutation system for Alien Monsters: Aliens progress each session, gaining mutations that alter gameplay and add a new power layer;</li>



<li>Improved shooting, animations, item swap, and movement;</li>



<li>Contract system rework: Items are now shown on the holomap;</li>



<li>Leaderboard section: Filtering by kills, K/D, extractions, etc.</li>



<li>Rebalanced economy after a series of iterations;</li>
</ul>











<p>You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1456940/view/500562881802142345?mc_cid=125b97a780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full patch notes</a> below or via the game‚Äôs Steam page:</p>



<h3><strong>Revamped the Caves of Turion map as a ‚Äúbattle royale-like‚Äù experience</strong></h3>



<p>Here‚Äôs a list of changes:</p>



<ol>
<li>The main elevator can only extract three Mercs; as the session approaches its end, the elevator can‚Äôt be called;</li>



<li>Two additional solo exits that are one-time only;</li>



<li>Better loot;</li>



<li>A ring of erosion starts moving toward the central elevator 10 minutes into the session;</li>



<li>Aliens are immune to ring of erosion damage.</li>
</ol>



<h3><strong>üíº A ‚ÄúMercs Only‚Äù mode</strong></h3>



<p>This is a separate optional mode for Mercs only. It offers a more forgiving experience without Alien Monsters, but the loot is of a slightly lower tier.</p>



<h3><strong>OTHER CHANGES:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Final screen UI rework</strong>:<br>
<ol>
<li>Causes of death;</li>



<li>Names of all the people in the lobby with more details about what happened to them during the session;</li>



<li>An ability to add friends.</li>
</ol>
</li>



<li><strong>New skin attribution system</strong>: Skins are now obtainable through achievement-style goals and are never reset after completion.</li>



<li>New Alien Monster feature:&nbsp;<strong>Cocoons</strong>. When playing as an Alien, wrap a dead Merc in a cocoon; if it stays intact until the end of the session, you get a share of the loot that the Merc was carrying.</li>



<li>New weapon:&nbsp;<strong>Sniper rifle</strong></li>



<li>New grenades:&nbsp;<strong>Gas, UV Flashbang</strong></li>



<li><strong>Revised economy</strong>&nbsp;with faster progression</li>



<li><strong>Steam Friends through in-game UI</strong>. You can add other players as friends during a session‚Äîa pop-up will appear above them.</li>



<li><strong>Matchmaking update</strong>: Locked regions. If you choose a region, you will only look for games in that region.</li>



<li>Various&nbsp;<strong>UI &amp; UX Improvements</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-general-changes"><strong>General Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Added matchmaking lock for the 1.0 release to provide better latency, matching players in specific regions without expanding matchmaking to other regions.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-research-facility-changes"><strong>Research Facility Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Increased the amount and chance of weapon spawns in the warehouse and airdrops.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-caves-of-turion-changes"><strong>Caves of Turion Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>The central elevator is no longer called but instead arrives on a timer and leaves 2 minutes after arriving. Max capacity: 3 mercs;</li>



<li>The bore exit can only extract 1 merc per match;</li>



<li>The Grappling Hook exit can only extract 1 merc per match;</li>



<li>The solo elevator can only extract 1 merc per match;</li>



<li>The loot quality on Caves of Turion has been increased.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-merc-changes"><strong>Merc Changes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Reduced prices for items and weapons;</li>



<li>Headshot multiplier has been reduced from x3 to x2 against mercs;</li>



<li>Rebalanced damage for all weapons according to the new headshot multiplier;</li>



<li>Added a distinct sound for headshots;</li>



<li>The starter kit weapon changed to FoxFive;</li>



<li>Increased recoil for most of the weapons by 20-30% (reverted recoil changes);</li>



<li>Reduced the amount of stamina it takes for a melee attack for both one-handed and two-handed melee weapons;</li>



<li>Reduced the damage of marksmanship rifles;</li>



<li>Removed icons of card printers from the holo map when they‚Äôre active;</li>



<li>New item: Gas Grenade, working as a perfect mix between smoke grenade and alien‚Äôs acid cloud ability;</li>



<li>New item: UV Flashbang. It doesn‚Äôt blind mercs, but it will do heavy damage to aliens close to the explosion.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, note that this update includes a complete server wipe, meaning your entire stash, trader rep, and levels will disappear, but your cosmetic skins will remain.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike pro players Joshua ‚Äústeel‚Äù Nissan and Braxton ‚Äúbrax‚Äù Pierce are now unbanned from competing at official Valve events, over 10 years after the two were involved in the notorious iBUYPOWER match fixing scandal. Whether it‚Äôs as players, coaches, or team analysts, the two can now participate at the Major.</p>



<p>After spending a decade banned from competing at the highest level of pro Counter-Strike, the two are free to pursue any opportunities.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-doors-to-the-counter-strike-major-are-finally-re-opened">The Doors to the Counter-Strike Major are Finally Re-opened</h2>



<p>Back in August 2014, members of the iBUYPOWER CS:GO roster purposefully lost a match against NetcodeGuides.com, after betting against themselves on CS skin gambling site CSGOLounge. Despite some evidence being present immediately after the match, the story wasn‚Äôt uncovered until journalist Richard Lewis <a href="https://dotesports.com/general/news/match-fixing-counter-strike-ibuypower-netcode-guides" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a report</a> in January 2015. Within two weeks of the story‚Äôs publishing, Valve handed indefinite bans to all that participated, preventing them from competing at any Valve-affiliated events.</p>



<p>These bans, coupled with bans from other prominent tournament organizers such as ESL, effectively ended the careers of the players involved. Given that they were unable to participate at any major tournament, their team options were severely limited. In 2017, the players had their bans lifted from organizers like ESL and DreamHack, however the Valve bans had been made permanent in 2016. In 2020, both steel and brax transitioned to VALORANT, with steel finding some success with 100 Thieves.</p>



<p>Valve finally relented in 2023 though, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/37331/steels-valve-ban-set-to-elapse-in-january-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making the bans no longer permanent</a> and letting them expire after 10 years. That day where the bans expire has finally come, and the players can now compete at or participate in the Counter-Strike Majors. During the IEM Katowice broadcast, a small celebration was held for steel, who‚Äôs worked on stream as an analyst for a few years. During the segment, steel said that he learned ‚Äúa very hard lesson for myself, as well as for everyone in the tier two scene.‚Äù</p>



<p>The bans and their length have been a major talking point in the community for a long time. In fact, it was Richard Lewis himself who petitioned months after his original report in 2015 that Valve not leave the bans indefinite. Over the years, some have argued the bans be lifted earlier as the players had been punished enough. Some though have argued that the severity of the punishment is crucial to deterring future instances of match-fixing.</p>



<p>Has 10 years been enough for these players? Join the discussion down below or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Sony has announced the PlayStation Plus monthly games for February 2025 will be Payday 3, High on Life, and Pac-Man World Re-Pac.</p>



<p>All <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-payday-3-high-on-life-pac-man-world-re-pac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">three of the games</a> will be available for PlayStation Plus members starting February 4. Like always, once you add the games to your library, they will be available to download as long as you have an active subscription.</p>



<h2 id="h-february-2025-s-free-playstation-plus-games">February 2025‚Äôs Free PlayStation Plus Games</h2>



<p>Of the three games coming on February 4, Payday 3 is the biggest name. First released in September 2023, the latest game from Starbreeze has seen its share of ups and downs over the last year-plus. High on Life was released in December 2022 while Pac-Man World Re-Pac launched in August 2022.</p>



<p>Payday 3 will be available for PS5 while High on Life and Pac-Man World Re-Pac will be available on both PS4 and PS5.</p>

Instead, the focus will be on PS5 titles.</p>



<p>‚ÄúAs we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026,‚Äù Sony said.</p>



<p>Until February 3, PlayStation Plus Members can still add January‚Äôs games to their library. Those games include Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered, and The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe.</p>
