<p>Just one day before the theatrical release of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Paramount Pictures has confirmed the next movie in the series. First reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-2027-1236254778/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 will release in theaters in spring 2027.</p>



<p>No other details about what Sonic the Hedgehog 4 would be about were revealed. The only thing we can guess comes from spoilers of the latest movie, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-credits scene</a> that reveals another new character.</p>



<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 features the return of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles along with Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. Joining the cast for the third film is Keanu Reeves who voices Shadow the Hedgehog. And, yes, Shadow does have his gun.</p>



<p>Based on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sonic_the_hedgehog_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">early reviews</a>, the latest movie in the franchise is going to be yet another success. According to Variety, it’s expected to make anywhere from $55-$60 million at North American theaters on opening weekend. The first two movies pulled in roughly $725.4 million.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone. 11 Bit Studios has announced that it has cancelled its game known as Project 8 will have layoffs at the studio because of it.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement released</a> earlier this week, 11 Bit Studios says they had 37 people working on the game up until the decision to end it was made. As far as why it was cancelled, a number of reasons were given by 11 Bit Studios President Przemyslaw Marszal.</p>



<p>“With&nbsp;Project 8, we experienced both breakthroughs and setbacks,” he said. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, stabilising the development team proved particularly difficult, yet progress continued. While we achieved noticeable quality improvements in certain areas, several critical aspects of the game and its development process remained problematic despite multiple iterations. Over time, delays accumulated, and with each milestone, the project’s budget grew.”</p>



<p>He then said that the “tipping point” happened after what Marszal called a “thorough evaluation” of the game’s latest milestone.</p>



<p>“When assessing a project, the Management Board always considers its development progress, including internal reviews and independent surveys,” Marzal said.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, in this case, our findings revealed unresolved issues and challenges that would require further extensions of the production timeline and corresponding budget increases to address. This, coupled with revised sales forecasts, largely reflecting the changing market environment, raised significant doubts about the project’s overall profitability.”</p>



<p>The exact number of layoffs at 11 Bit Studios weren’t revealed. However, it was said that “more than half” of the Project 8 team will be offered the opportunity to move to other projects within the company. Those who are being let go will receive severance packages, counselling, and assistance with finding new work.</p>



<p>The company estimates to have spent $11.8 million on the game’s development at the time of cancellation. Marszal said that the full cost of ending Project 8 won’t be known until the release of the company’s Annual Report for 2024.</p>



<p>The games industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 15,000 known jobs</a> lost in 2024. The real number is likely approaching 17,000 when taking into account unconfirmed numbers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Counter-Strike on Mobile?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-on-mobile/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-counter-strike-on-mobile.1065660/</guid>

<p>Counter-Strike is already the biggest multiplayer game in the world, and a mobile version would be a total game changer. As big as the PC gaming industry is, the mobile gaming industry is that much bigger with the amount of phones out there.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-on-mobile">Is Counter-Strike on Mobile?</h2>



<p>There is no official version of Counter-Strike available on mobile. Other first person shooters have stepped into the mobile space though. Call of Duty Mobile is one of the most popular and highest grossing mobile shooters ever. Riot plans to eventually launch their tactical shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-mobile-china-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT on mobile</a>, and Ubisoft is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-china/">working on a mobile version of Rainbow Six Siege</a>.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike is technically playable on phones through apps that can stream Steam to mobile devices, but if it does work, it won’t be well optimized. The closest thing to CS2 on mobile is playing it on Steam Deck, but the game is not Steam Deck Verified. While it’s not impossible for Counter-Strike to eventually reach phones, it’s extremely unlikely, as Valve has never prioritized mobile game development.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a mobile game like Counter-Strike though, there’s plenty to choose from.</p>



<h2 id="h-mobile-games-like-counter-strike">Mobile Games Like Counter-Strike</h2>



<p>Just by searching “Counter-Strike” on the iOS or Apple app store, you’ll see tons of games clearly trying to emulate the iconic first person shooter. Even the names of the games are trying to capitalize on the popularity of CS: Critical Strike, Modern Strike Online, Critical Ops, Counter Attack. All of these games advertise CS-like tactical gameplay and weapon skins, and many of these games have just ported over nearly exact copies of iconic maps.</p>



<p>Top-down camera versions like Bullet Echo are also similar to Counter-Strike, but offer a different perspective. Both Call of Duty Mobile and Arena Breakout are also really good, popular mobile shooter games. However they’re more similar to arcade-like action shooters than tactical shooters. As mentioned above, both VALORANT and Siege are eventually making their way to mobile, but not for some time.</p>



<p>Do any of these mobile copies of Counter-Strike interest you?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
