            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-weapon-%E2%80%98free-look%E2%80%99-mechanic-will-have-youtubers-running-wild.1285407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This weekend, videos emerged on social media showcasing Battlefield 6’s new ‘free look’ mechanic that allows users to examine their weapons from almost any angle. While holding the weapon, players can twist, tip, and turn the gun in any direction to get a better look at the weapon’s minute details, and it’s an element that’s going to have content creators running wild.</p>



<p>In almost every first-person shooter space, the most common thing for YouTubers to do for ‘thumbnails’ is to look up, reload, and capture a screenshot to showcase a weapon. It seems Electronic Arts’ studios are aware of this and have added a neat feature to add a little more diversity to the pot.</p>



<h2 id="h-get-creative-in-battlefield-6">Get Creative in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>Some YouTubers are worse than others at this, but for years, the running theme has been the old ‘look-up-and-reload’ trick. It has served as the basis for FPS-based thumbnails on YouTube for the longest time, regardless of whether we’re talking about Battlefield, Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, Escape from Tarkov, or something in between.</p>



<p>The studios piecing together Battlefield 6 have tried to take that concept a step further, adding in a free look mechanic that allows players to actively manipulate how their weapon is being held.</p>



<p>A video surfaced on social media recently, perfectly showcasing this new mechanic:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don't know if this was in the beta but you can inspect your gun and it's some kind of free look inspect, where your right stick will move the gun around <a href="https://t.co/b7SrCMGY2P">pic.twitter.com/b7SrCMGY2P</a></p>— bob. (@BobNetworkUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1961417910229897219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>It wasn’t present in the Battlefield 6 beta, but it has been added now for the next round of Battlefield Labs tests. As you can see in the video above, it’s a pretty fluid, functional mechanic that screenshot lovers will adore, giving them much more accessibility in the thumbnail space.</p>



<p>I’m just excited that we might start to see <strong>differences emerge </strong>between YouTubers and the incessant reload-trick thumbs they’re uploading with each new video.</p>



<p>Are you excited to play with this feature in Battlefield 6? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Left 4 Dead Coded Shooter is Coming From The Game’s Creator]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/left-4-dead-coded-shooter-coming-from-game-creator/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-left-4-dead-coded-shooter-is-coming-from-the-game%E2%80%99s-creator.1285404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mike Booth, the creator of Left 4 Dead, has emerged on social media to reveal he’s piecing together an all-new four-player co-operative shooter that is ‘built on the foundations of what made L4D special.’ He promoted an application process inviting prospective fans to jump into the project as playtesters, giving an indication of how far along the game’s development is.</p>



<p>Booth boasts a storied tenure in the games industry, but he’s currently at Bad Robot Games, which has links to JJ Abrams, best known for his work in the film and television industries.</p>



<h2 id="h-teamwork-tension-and-replayability">‘Teamwork, Tension, and Replayability’</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/l4d2/comments/1n3jvu3/from_the_creator_of_l4d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a post</a> on the Left 4 Dead 2 Reddit channel, Mike Booth surfaced to promote his new game, but didn’t drop a title or any graphics.</p>



<p>He wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m Mike Booth (creator of Left 4 Dead), and I’m excited to share that I’m working on a brand new project —a 4-player co-op shooter built on the foundations of what made L4D special.</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you’ll probably find this one interesting. It expands on the co-op formula in ways I’ve wanted to explore for a long time.</p>



<p>We’re still in the early stages of development, but we’re opening up playtests to a limited number of players. If you’re interested in joining us on this next adventure and helping shape the game early on, we’d love to have you involved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/left-4-deads-creator-is-making-a-comeback-to-create-the-next-big-co-op-shooter-3244290/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The comment section exploded with excitement as users realized that it could be a spiritual successor to the franchise that effectively died a death in 2009 when Left 4 Dead 2 was released and promptly marked <strong>the end </strong>of the series.</p>



<p>In 2021, Back 4 Blood was released by Turtle Rock Studios, but despite being marketed as a twisted successor to Left 4 Dead, it fell flat on its face relatively quickly.</p>



<p>Coincidentally, Mike Booth was working at Turtle Rock more than a decade ago, before leaving for Blizzard. That post eventually fell through, and Booth <a href="https://x.com/_MikeBooth/status/627164439788138497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed on social media</a> that his project ‘wasn’t a good fit’ for Blizzard.</p>



<p>There’s definitely room for another Left 4 Dead-coded game, but will Mike Booth deliver from his position at Bad Robot? It’s worth stressing that at no point does Booth mention <strong>zombies</strong>, but you never know.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you’re excited for this game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-page-available-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-steam-page-%E2%80%98available-soon%E2%80%99-it%E2%80%99s-confirmed.1285395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This past weekend, teasers started surfacing from Battlestate Games suggesting that Escape from Tarkov, the most popular extraction shooter ever made, is heading to Steam. This landmark move for the game was met with a mixed reception from fans worldwide, but it’s all part of the 1.0 release of Escape from Tarkov, which is happening on November 15.</p>



<p>On social media, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, has just confirmed that Escape from Tarkov <strong>is </strong>coming to Steam soon, and more details are incoming.</p>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-coming-to-steam-soon">Tarkov is Coming to Steam Soon</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-release-teased-battlestate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teasers posted recently</a> on social media followed a promise made months ago that Escape from Tarkov would come to Steam with the game’s 1.0 release. In recent weeks, we learned that Escape from Tarkov will be released as a full game on November 15, bringing to an end almost a decade of beta testing.</p>



<p>Nikita Buyanov followed up on the teasers with a shot of Tarkov’s Steam page and wrote that it’ll be available soon:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov fans were quick to criticize, with some pointing out how Steam’s lenient refund policies could negatively impact Battlestate Games’ decision, especially as many feel that the game isn’t ‘1.0 ready’.</p>



<p>This weekend, Battlestate Games took <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 version</a> to PAX, letting swarms of fans, including some of the game’s top creators, demo the new version. The feedback has been positive, with many stressing that players ‘aren’t ready’ for how good the 1.0 release will be.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s arrival on Steam is a <strong>huge </strong>moment for the game, but will you fork over the cash to buy the game again on a new platform? Let me know on the Insider Gaming forum what you’re planning to do.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-5-reloaded-start-times/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-does-black-ops-6-season-5-reloaded-start-%E2%80%94update-times-and-content-explained.1285392/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 remains one of the world’s best-selling games, even now. It has had a troubled life, marked by controversies, bizarre skin bundles, and issues with cheaters, but there’s no doubting the pull of Call of Duty. Now, fans are preparing to pick up the Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded update, which brings a nice mid-season content drop.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve pulled together the key information about the Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded update that you’ll need while you wait for it to drop.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-season-5-reloaded-coming-to-warzone-and-black-ops-6">When is Season 5 Reloaded Coming to Warzone and Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><strong>Season 5 Reloaded of Black Ops 6 and Warzone will be released on September 4, 2025. </strong>This supersized update introduces a new map, ‘Jackpot’, a high-octane new multiplayer mode, fresh weapons and attachments, and new limited-time events (LTMs).</p>



<p>Here are the release times for Season 5 Reloaded in Black Ops 6 and Warzone:</p>



<ul>
<li>September 4, 11:00 AM CT</li>



<li>September 4, 12:00 PM ET</li>



<li>September 4, 5:00 PM BST</li>



<li>September 4, 6:00 PM CEST</li>



<li>September 4, 8:00 PM GST</li>



<li>September 5, 1:00 AM JST</li>



<li>September 5, 2:00 AM AEST</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-season-5-end-in-black-ops-6">When Does Season 5 End in Black Ops 6?</h3>



<p>Season 5 will wrap on September 9, which doesn’t give you all that long to grind the Call of Duty Battle Pass and unlock this season’s rewards ahead of the imminent release of Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-season-5-reloaded">What’s in Season 5 Reloaded?</h2>



<p>Season 5 Reloaded features a casino-themed map called Jackpot, a core 6v6 map. It’s pulled straight from the Black Ops 6 campaign. Players diving into Black Ops 6’s multiplayer platform after the update will also be able to play Cranked Demolition, Ransack, and Blueprint Gunfight, most of which can unfold on Jackpot.</p>



<p>When Season 5 Reloaded hits, you’ll be able to unlock the sweet Gravemark .357 Revolver, a stunning pistol with insane power output. Later in the update, players will be able to get the Combat Bow, a scorestreak rather than a core weapon. Those who love to run and gun will also appreciate the new PPSh-41 Helical Magazine attachment.</p>



<p>Zombies fans will get access to the Directed Mode for Reckoning, helping them to solve the map’s puzzles and trials, and Warzone users will gain access to the Deadline LTM.</p>



<p>What are you most looking forward to in Season 5 Reloaded? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Another Key Fairgames Developer Quietly Leaves Haven Studios]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/another-key-fairgames-developer-quietly-leaves/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/another-key-fairgames-developer-quietly-leaves-haven-studios.1285380/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fairgames was the talk of the town a few weeks back when it was rumoured that Haven Studios had <strong>cancelled </strong>the upcoming live-service shooter. This claim was retracted within a matter of hours, and as far as we know, Fairgames continues to be developed and backed by PlayStation.</p>



<p>However, prospective fans of the game have used their eagle-eyed powers to learn that yet another high-ranking departure has occurred at Haven Studios, as the game director of Fairgames has left the company. This news comes just three months after the studio’s founder also left for greener pastures.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-happening-with-fairgames">What’s Happening with Fairgames?</h2>



<p>The recent retraction of the claim that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fairgames-not-cancelled-confirmation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fairgames was cancelled</a> was enough to shake the boat considerably, as the rumor sent gamers into a spiral, wondering about the future of this seemingly ill-fated live-service shooter.</p>



<p>Fairgames (stylized as Fairgame$) was revealed in 2023, and since the first trailer dropped, almost nothing more has been shared about the game’s development. Haven Studios was founded in 2021 to bring the game to life, but it seems things aren’t going as well as expected.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jade-raymond-leaves-haven-studios-after-founding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jade Raymond</a>, one of the studio’s founders, departed the team in May, and now, the game’s director has also split.</p>



<p>It was discovered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1n5bmy9/game_director_leave_fairgames_after_45_years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by a Reddit user</a> that Daniel Drapeau, the former game director at Haven Studios, has left the company to take up a role at WB Games Montreal. He’s now a creative director at the studio most recently known for Gotham Knights and for assisting on Suicide Squad, which isn’t the best track record.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That sentiment was echoed by users on Reddit, with one writing, ‘Out of the pan and into the fire.’ Another quipped, ‘Escaped Titanic, ended up on the OceanGate submarine.’</p>



<p>Do you think Fairgames is in danger of being cancelled? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Gameplay Leaks Online]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-leaks-online/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-leaks-online.1285332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gameplay for the upcoming Battlefield 6 Battle Royale game mode has been leaked online. The gameplay originally appeared on the Chinese social media site bilibili but has since found its way onto other social media platforms.</p>



<p>The clip, <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield_inf/status/1962273931819127268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which you can watch</a> below for now, is 1:53 in length. In that short time, you can see the start of the mode, swimming mechanics, building destruction via sledgehammer, and more. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though details remain slim, the new game mode <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was confirmed during Battlefield 6’s reveal</a> back in July. What is currently known is that there will be a standard Battle Royal mode as well as a more competitive mode called Gauntlet.</p>



<p>While it won’t launch alongside the game, the new mode will be free-to-play and is EA’s challenge to Call of Duty Warzone. Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/">first reported the existence</a> of the Battle Royale mode in early 2024. And although the gameplay footage above is new, it’s not the first leak related to the mode to surface online. In recent weeks, gameplay, points of interest, and the map have all been leaked—though each was taken down within hours.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 releases October 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
