<p>Simpsons Hit &amp; Run and Prototype developer, Radical Entertainment, has relaunched as New Radical Games. </p>



<p>There have been almost no updates on the Simpson Hit &amp; Run and Prototype franchises for a very long time. The last we heard about Prototype was some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-prototype-remaster-evidence-discovered-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential evidence</a> that a remaster could be in the works. We also saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/futurama-mod-takes-simpsons-hit-run-to-new-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a mod</a> that took Simpson Hit &amp; Run. Now, the developer behind both these games has relaunched. </p>

The new development studio will have Ian Wilkinson, the co-founder of Radical Entertainment, as CEO, and Tim Bennison, a former COO at Capcom Game Studio Vancouver, will join as COO of New Radical Games. </p>



<p>Regarding services, New Radical Games will offer work-for-hire for full game development, mobile &amp; console development, co-development, porting, and remastering.

<p>A new development reveals that the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Creative Director has been tasked with working on the live-action movie adaptation. </p>



<p>The last details we heard about the Kingdom Come: Deliverance franchise were KCD 2 coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-games-for-february-wave-2-features-witcher-3-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> in February 2026 and the previous title receiving an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-enhanced-update-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enhanced Update</a> for current-gen consoles. Now, we have been informed of a live-action movie that will be supervised by the game’s creative director. </p>







<h2 id="h-kcd2-director-daniel-vavra-moving-to-live-action-movie-won-t-work-on-new-warhorse-game">KCD2 Director Daniel Vávra Moving to Live-Action Movie Won’t Work on New Warhorse Game</h2>



<p>The latest update on the shift in focus for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s creative director comes from a new interview with the studio head on <a href="https://cc.cz/daniel-vavra-uz-nepracuje-pro-warhorse-studios-na-nove-hre-misto-toho-pripravuje-hrany-film-kingdom-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Czech Crunch</a>. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/warhorse-studios/" id="1409">Warhorse Studios</a> head Martin Frývaldský has stated that creative director Daniel Vávra has a “new role” in the “creation of the Kingdom Come movie”. Frývaldský added that the franchise has already expanded into other media, such as comics, concerts, and tourism; however, a movie has attracted them the most, and there is already a “draft script”. </p>



<p>Frývaldský added that Warhorse can already feel “interest from the film world” in the Kingdom Come: Deliverance movie, with “negotiations already underway”. The studio head added that they aren’t looking to sell the rights and want the film to be what the studio imagines it to be. </p>



<p>Martin Frývaldský added that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 creative director’s decision to move to the movie was his own. Vávra had already made three games that achieved global success, and he has been “wanting to try something different for a long time.” Getting Kingdom Come to the screen in the “next few years” is a milestone the studio wants to achieve, and that’s Daniel Vávra’s new responsibility. </p>



<p>Warhorse Studio’s head also explained that Daniel Vávra won’t be part of the daily work in the office, but he will still be part of the studio in a “broader sense”. Frývaldský elaborated that Vávra’s new position can be called “transmedia director.” Vávra is no longer involved in a new game from Warhorse Studios. </p>







<p>In other news, Kingdom Come: Deliverance’s director previously stated AI is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-is-here-and-not-going-kingdom-come-director-admits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here and it’s not going anywhere</a>“.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders neglects the ever-popular battle passes in favor of Raider Decks, which offer pages of rewards for you to claim, all in exchange for Cred. From usable items to cosmetics and currency, they’re quite popular amongst the player base, and Shrouded Sky has finally added a new one—the Surgeon Deck.</p>







<p>However, you’ll need to claim it before you can start unlocking the brand new rewards, but thankfully, it’s easier than ever. If you’re interested in the new Surgeon Raider Deck in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, here’s how to claim it, as well as every reward it has on offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-the-surgeon-deck-in-arc-raiders">How To Claim The Surgeon Deck In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Free as a bird. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To claim the Surgeon Deck in ARC Raiders, all you have to do is head on over to the Decks tab and purchase it for free. </strong></p>



<p>Despite the Decks showcasing Raider Tokens as the pricing, not a single one has released that isn’t free yet, with all three of them being readily available for all to claim. It’s a consumer-friendly approach by Embark Studios, and long may it continue. </p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>That being said, you’ll need Cred to unlock these rewards, but luckily for you, they’re easy to earn. The fastest way to earn them is by completing Feats, which are simple in-game tasks to complete during raids. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-from-the-surgeon-deck-in-arc-raiders">All Rewards From The Surgeon Deck In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Solid Outfit. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Overall, there are 25 rewards to claim from the Surgeon Deck in ARC Raiders, totalling 1,070 Cred. </strong></p>



<p>Based on the theme, you can expect a lot of medical supplies in the Surgeon Deck, although there is a healthy amount of Raider Tokens to claim, too. The star of the show, however, is easily the suite of cosmetics on offer, with the new Surgeon outfit getting a variety of colours.</p>
