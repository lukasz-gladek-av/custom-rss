<p>Developer Wildlight Entertainment went big with a year-long 2026 roadmap for Highguard. It features information on each episode and what to expect from every batch of new content: Each includes a new Warden and much more.</p>



<p>The time for talking is over as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> is out now. Geoff Keighley bigged it up as the second coming of Apex Legends and Titanfall, and it’s not bad at all. If you think Highguard’s base-raiding action is something that’ll keep you gripped for a while, then you need the full 2026 roadmap hub bookmarked for the good times ahead.</p>

<p>Highguard Episode 1 is the launch-day content. You obviously need content to get a game going, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-is-finally-getting-a-gameplay-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay showcase</a> revealed the shooter’s first Wardens, maps, guns, and the rest of the glitz and glamour for opening day:</p>



<ul>
<li>5 Maps</li>



<li>6 Bases</li>



<li>8 Wardens</li>



<li>3 Mounts</li>



<li>10 Weapons</li>



<li>3 Raid Tools</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-2-2026-roadmap-content-february-to-march">Highguard Episode 2 2026 Roadmap Content—February to March</h2>



<p>Following up on the launch episode is Episode 2, and this one debuts a fresh Warden, map, and Ranked Mode. Here’s the full list of content announced:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Map</li>



<li>Ranked Mode</li>



<li>New Mount</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Raid Tool</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-3-2026-roadmap-content-april-to-may">Highguard Episode 3 2026 Roadmap Content—April to May</h2>



<p>You’re going to see a familiar theme with a lot of this content as we go. The character selection screen will become more full, and the meta will be shaken up with a new weapon:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Loot Item</li>



<li>New Amulets</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-4-2026-roadmap-content-june-to-july">Highguard Episode 4 2026 Roadmap Content—June to July</h2>



<p>The biggest addition in Episode 4’s content (featuring the tropical months of the year!) is a new Limited-Time Mode. There aren’t many mentions of LTMs in the 2026 roadmap, so it’ll be interesting to see what the new mode is:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Map</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Limited-Time Mode</li>



<li>New Amulets</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-5-2026-roadmap-content-august-to-september">Highguard Episode 5 2026 Roadmap Content—August to September</h2>



<p>Episode 5 looks like a standard couple of months of new content. New additions to many of the Highguard’s core components await:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>New Mount</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>



<li>New Loot Item</li>



<li>New Amulets</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-highguard-episode-6-2026-roadmap-content-october-to-november">Highguard Episode 6 2026 Roadmap Content—October to November</h2>



<p>We’re getting the word, ‘Surprise.’ Given that it falls during Episode 6 and the Halloween season, it’s reasonable to assume the community is getting special spooky surprises, events, and costume tie-ins. Will Highguard do crossovers? We’ll have to see, check out the haul:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>New Map</li>



<li>New Weapon</li>



<li>Surprise</li>



<li>New Mods</li>



<li>New Base</li>

</ul>

<figure><figcaption>A big 12 months awaits. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Rounding off Highguard’s first year is a rather sparse Episode 7, but more details are sure to be revealed closer to the time. A Winter-themed event and content are expected, and it carries on the tradition of a new Warden every Episode:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Warden</li>



<li>Surprise</li>



<li>New Mods</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s always an element of unpredictability with a new live-service game. Highguard looks the part, but it remains to be seen if it can maintain its player base.

<p>Triple H is on the cover of the Deluxe Edition of WWE 2K26.</p>



<p>2K Games announced on Twitter that Paul “Triple H” Levesque would be featured on the cover of the Deluxe Edition, dubbed the “King of Kings Edition,” for the upcoming WWE 2K26 game. </p>



<p>A two-time WWE Hall of Famer, Triple H has appeared in every WWE video game since his debut in WWF In Your House, the 1996 title released for the original PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC.</p>



<p>Over the years, he has also been a frequent cover star, starting with WWF Attitude in 1999. Iconic games such as WWE SmackDown: Shut Your Mouth, WWE Day of Reckoning, and WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 also feature “The Game” on the cover art. However, this cover is historic for the “King of Kings” because it marks the first time he has been featured solo.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-this-is-not-the-only-cover-of-wwe-2k26-featuring-triple-h">This Is Not the Only Cover of WWE 2K26 Featuring Triple H</h2>



<p>As announced on January 23, WWE 2K26 will also have a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Attitude Era edition</a>. The cover art for that edition features many WWE legends from the late 1990s and early 2000s. Triple H was also on the cover. He was featured in the trailer alongside Shawn Michaels, Chyna, and the other members of D-Generation X.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE also announced a Monday Night War Edition of WWE 2K26. </a>Triple H appears on the cover, representing WWE alongside Steve Austin, Undertaker, The Rock, Chyna, and Kurt Angle. He also appeared in the trailer for this edition, which focuses largely on the promotional rivalry between WWE and WCW that dominated the late ’90s and catapulted wrestling to a new level of popularity and success.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-will-bring-back-classic-match-types-familiar-to-longtime-triple-h-fans">WWE 2K26 Will Bring Back Classic Match Types Familiar to Longtime Triple H Fans</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As first reported by Insider Gaming,</a> WWE 2K26 is expanding its gameplay offerings with four new playable match types. The game introduces the Dumpster Match for the first time while bringing back the Inferno Match, I Quit Match, and 3 Stages of Hell. Triple H has a history of competing in all three returning gimmick matches. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Island</a> will make its return this year, featuring a completely new storyline.</p>







<p>As of now, 2K Games has not announced any specific DLC coming to this year’s game. However, on January 24, WWE confirmed that the Monday Night War Edition will provide access to the most content.</p>



<p>Pre-orders begin on January 30. However, there’s currently no set release date or price point. Recent WWE 2K games have released in March. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>

            <guid>1416694</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/highguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> is out now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and at least one segment of the gaming community has already left their impressions on the game. Within an hour of its release, Highguard has received “mostly negative” reviews on Steam from players.</p>



<p>From reported performance issues to players saying they’ve been booted from the game, there seems to be a number of concerns from players. </p>







<p><strong>“Barely had 60 fps on a 5070 Ti &amp; 14700K,”</strong> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said one user</a>.</p>



<p>Another added that they <strong>“logged in immediately and got kicked out of the game.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>That said, while some of the concerns appear to be valid, there are many simply joining in on the belief of many that this will be a “Concord 2” situation. For what it’s worth, Concord peaked at just 697 players on Steam while Highguard has reached <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 100,000 concurrent players</a> as of writing. </p>



<p>And while the reviews are mostly negative in the early stages, there are plenty of positive reviews from players. </p>



<p><strong>“The biggest takeaway after the first few matches is that the rules are really different,” </strong>one review reads. <strong>“This isn’t just a Temu Concord or [Overwatch]. The build-up, flag, and siege phases give the match a clear rhythm, and once you get used to it, it’s way more fun than pure aim duels.”</strong></p>



<p>Another user said that nothing in the game felt <strong>“messy”</strong> despite the mixing of <strong>“a lot of gameplays”.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wildlight Entertainment’s Highguard has officially been released to the public after a long month of waiting. The multiplayer FPS is available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple platforms</a>, but it’s not always guaranteed that these systems can play alongside one another.</p>



<p>For an online game like Highguard, the matter of crossplay is an important one. Some fans out there will want to raid together with their friends, but if it’s platform-exclusive, that can put a serious dent in their plans.</p>







<p>If you’re unsure of what platform to download Highguard on and whether crossplay will be an issue, then read on: Insider Gaming has all the details you’ll need.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-crossplay">Does Highguard Have Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Breaking down those platform walls. Image via Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Highguard does have Crossplay across all platforms, allowing you to team up with friends across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</strong></p>



<p>Gone are the days when everyone had to play games on the same platform, as it’s common courtesy that multiplayer titles offer crossplay across all platforms—or at least as many as possible. </p>



<p>Highguard is no different, and it should prove to be a great feature going forward to get as many onto the newly-released shooter as possible. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-highguard-have-cross-progression">Does Highguard Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Your noble steed. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, cross-progression remains unconfirmed for Highguard, meaning your progress will probably be limited to one platform. </strong></p>



<p>That makes choosing your starting platform especially important. You won’t want to unlock cosmetics and gear for your Wardens, only to lose them if you decide to play somewhere else. </p>







<p>This could easily change in the future, as it has done for plenty of other titles in the past. If you’re hoping for a cross-progression announcement for Highguard, look nowhere else than Insider Gaming, as this article will be updated as soon as anything changes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Roadmap Reveals An Entire Year of Content Plans]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/</link>
            <guid>1416637</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wildlight Entertainment has officially released Highguard, a ‘new breed of shooter’, and by all accounts, it’s doing pretty well for itself. It follows a month of radio silence after the game was unveiled at The Game Awards in December. Earlier today, the team at Wildlight shared a massive, one-year-long roadmap packed with seven episodes of content.</p>



<p>The post-launch spree looks great on the surface, but time will tell if the player counts remain high enough for the delivery to matter. For now, there’s enough meat on the bones to get prospective fans very excited about what’s coming.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-2026-roadmap-has-content-drops-every-month">Highguard 2026 Roadmap Has Content Drops Every Month</h2>



<p>The surprising thing about Highguard’s 2026 roadmap is that there’s a content drop planned <strong>every single month</strong>. This isn’t the most standard approach for live-service games, but Wildlight obviously has immense stock in what it has created to reveal so much, so early. We’ve got content stacked in the pipeline way up until December.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It all begins with the game’s launch, but the second episode of content will hit in just <strong>two weeks</strong>. It’ll bring a new Warden (read: hero character), a fresh map, <strong>Ranked Mode</strong>, and a new mount, expanding on the bear, horse, and panther that already exist. The second part of that episode will drop in March, bringing a new <strong>base</strong> and a raid tool.</p>



<p>The difference between a map and a base? A Base is what you defend <strong>on </strong>the map, selecting it from a lineup of options when the match kicks off. This is the end zone of a match, and it’s the ultimate objective. The ‘map’ is the environment upon which you play… Simple?</p>



<p>Highguard’s roadmap expands further throughout the year.</p>



<p>There’s a new Warden coming every second month, as well as new bases, following that same launch pattern. We’ll get new maps in Highguard in June and October, and a special, limited-time mode is in the book for July. October and December yield ‘surprise’ events, and in terms of equipment, players can expect a hefty assortment to arrive as the year unfolds.</p>



<p>For instance, a new <strong>weapon </strong>will be added to Highguard in April, June, August, and October, while new <strong>amulets </strong>will appear in May, July, September, and November. Mods will be added in April, June, August, October, and December, and a new <strong>raid tool </strong>is coming in March <strong>only</strong>.</p>



<p>New loot items will be published in Highguard in May and September.</p>



<p>Oh, and all the content is <strong>entirely free</strong>.</p>



<p>This is a pretty dense roadmap, but time will tell how the delivery of it fares.</p>

<p>It’s here, Highguard is out. The electric and innovative first-person shooter is raiding bases all over PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. If you plan to download the game, check out the Highguard file sizes.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-times-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> has gone from being the quietest and most unmarketed shooter in history to one of the most intriguing shooters of 2026. Backed by a team of world-class devs, Highguard exudes a premium vibe. You’d think it would be optimized with lower file sizes, and this would be good for all hard drives.</p>

<p><strong>Highguard only requires 20.13 GB for its initial file size on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>We can’t believe it as much as you can. A brand-new, fast-moving online shooter only requiring 20 GB at launch? It’s unheard of, and it’s magnificent. More games need to be better optimized at launch, and communities shouldn’t have to choose between certain games on limited storage space.</p>



<p>PS5 owners, get downloading, and forget about deleting games to have Highguard on your console.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-file-size-on-xbox-series-x-s-explained">Highguard File Size On Xbox Series X|S, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The Xbox file size for Highguard is 21.09 GB, keeping in line with the PlayStation.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox just can’t catch a break, can it? PlayStation is even winning in terms of Highguard optimization! Only joking, but this is more good news overall. Highguard is a supreme spectacle, and if this only requires 21 GB on a powerful Xbox Series X|S, then other games probably need to take a look in the mirror.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-file-size-on-pc-amp-steam-explained">Highguard File Size On PC &amp; Steam, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>PC and Steam users need a measly 20.65 GB of space to have Highguard installed.</strong></p>



<p>That’s pretty much a big tick for all three platforms. 20 GB or so is needed for Highguard at launch. Obviously, more content will be added down the line, and the initial file size will increase. For now, enjoy the first-person shooter taking up a tiny chunk of storage space.</p>



<p>Are you happy with Highaurd’s file size across major platforms? Do we need to get away from the days of 50-100 GB games sapping precious storage space? It’s mostly rhetorical, but still let the IG community know your thoughts on this through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
