<p>Geoff Keighley gave us all a sneaky 30-second look at Wildflower Interactive’s new game in the build-up to The Game Awards 2025, and now it’s here—Coven of the Chicken Foot<a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> was the stage for many incredible games. The three-hour showcase not only rewards the virtuous and skilled in the gaming industry, but it’s the perfect platform to put new games on the pedestal. There’s been plenty of excitement about Wildflower Interactive’s first game, and it looks promising.</p>







<p>It was well known that former The Last of Us Director Bruce Straley was showing off a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-director-bruce-straley-wildflower-interactive-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new game being revealed at The Game Awards 2025.</a> Would it be narrative-driven? Would it be violent?</p>



<p>It’s…interesting. All we’ve seen is an old woman with chicken feet, seemingly escorting or being escorted by a beastly companion. You know just as much as anyone else!</p>



<p>Does the new developer’s maiden game look good? What were you expecting from a new game from the mind of The Last of Us’ director?

<p>One of the biggest ‘will it’ or ‘won’t it’ mysteries surrounding The Game Awards 2025 was solved when Divinity was revealed. Larian Studios is returning to the franchise it built before another certain RPG came along.</p>







<p>2017’s Divinity: Original Sin 2 was the last one in the franchise. Larian decided to take a break from its baby to work on a small game no one’s heard of—Baldur’s Gate 3 (pardon the sarcasm). The time has come for the developer to go back to its roots with the announcement of the next Divinity.</p>



<p>You can watch the trailer below:</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2025 took everyone off guard with a shocking reveal of Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, a spiritual successor to all-time great Knights of the Old Republic.</p>



<p>While everyone is clamoring for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/old-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-images-appear-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KOTOR</a> news, TGA 2025 decided to reveal a huge surprise early on in the show—Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-game-awards-2025-reveals-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic">The Game Awards 2025 Reveals Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</h2>



<p>The game is described as a single-player player narrative-driven action RPG and spiritual successor to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.</p>



<p>Early footage clearly showed it was a Star Wars game, but there was immediate mystery about the title.</p>



<p>Now we know it’s basically a new KOTOR, and it looks phenomenal.</p>



<p>Check out the full trailer below.</p>

<p>The team at Xbox, including Matt Booty, has just revealed that the next Xbox Developer Direct, scheduled to take place in January 2026, will be huge, but regardless of that, it can’t fit in everything that is launching across the platform in the next year.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the team teased a phenomenal year for Xbox through 2026, with the imminent launches of some massive titles, and some sizeable anniversaries being lined up.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-xbox-developer-direct-is-coming-soon">Next Xbox Developer Direct is Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a recent<a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> interview with Variety</a>, Xbox’s Matt Booty spoke about the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct showcase, poised to take place in just a few weeks:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t share exactly what’s there, but we’ve got a lot of stuff that we’re shipping next year. In fact, usually Dev Direct is about highlighting what’s coming up for the year ahead. This year, we’ve got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show.</p>



<p>So I will tell you that Playground Games is going to be in the Dev Direct, but we’ll have more stuff next year to ship than we can fit into one Dev Direct show in January, which is a good place to be.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to talk about all the good things happening for Team Green through 2026:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For us, it’s really going to be a great year. It’s going to be the 25th anniversary of Xbox, we’re coming up on franchises of ours that have got these decade-level anniversaries. </p>



<p>It’s the 40th anniversary of Bethesda, Blizzard’s 35, ‘Diablo’ shipped 30 years ago. We’ve announced things like the ‘Halo Remastered’ collection that we’ve got coming, and we’ve got a lot of other things that we’ll talk about soon, that ship next year. So it’s going to be a real banner year for the brand and a banner year for some of our biggest franchises to show up across the industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Booty also took the opportunity to address the developing Call of Duty movie, explaining how good a pick Taylor Sheridan is as the project’s writer.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you think about the way that he tells stories, you think about the other things that he’s been a writer on, I think that the team feels that he’s got a good approach to characters and a good approach to story that’ll match up with their vision of what a ‘Call of Duty’ movie is.</p>
