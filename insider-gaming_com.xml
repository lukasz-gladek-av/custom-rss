<p>Ubisoft has a big launch on the new through Rainbow Six Siege X—a successor to 2015’s Siege. More original Siege content is on the way, but it looks like Rainbow Six Siege X is replacing its predecessor, and offering big upgrades.</p>



<p>Fun Fact: I got Rainbow Six Siege shortly after release and ended up selling it a few months later because <em>I couldn’t stop playing it</em>. Siege greatly disrupted my single-player gaming, and I decided to end the relationship. I fondly look back on those early days, and 10 years later, the game is as celebrated as ever. It’s a huge esports hit, the gameplay is still strategic and intricate, and tens of thousands of players still hop on each day.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege 2 rumor</a> gained huge traction in January 2025. The leak came to fruition with the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege X</a>.</p>

<p><strong>There is no release date locked in for Rainbow Six Siege X, nor a vague release period.</strong></p>



<p>Common sense suggests Siege X will likely be released following the conclusion of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-y10s1-reveal-prep-phase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege Y10</a>. This isn’t factual though, so be sure to check back as we update you.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date">When is The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase Date?</h2>



<p><strong>The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase is penciled in for March 13 at 10 AM PT / 6 PM CT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT.</strong></p>



<p>A <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/4IUTIzwOdeRG4l3ms7h1Dz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft article</a> confirmed Siege’s X Showcase date. “A new era of&nbsp;Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;will be revealed on <strong>March 13</strong> at the Siege X Showcase,” it said. The Showcase will show us every aspect of Siege X and its new changes compared to the original.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase">How to Watch Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase</h2>



<p><strong>Ubisoft has confirmed you can check out the full Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase by watching the action unfold on the Ubisoft Twitch Channel.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft Rainbow6 Twitch Channel</a> is the home of all things Rainbow Six Siege. So it makes sense for Siege X to be unveiled here. It remains to be seen if any YouTube channels also broadcast the Showcase.</p>



<p>Keep your eyes peeled for alternative sources—as will we.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x">What is Rainbow Six Siege X?</h2>



<p><strong>Rainbow Six Siege X is described as a “major evolution” of Siege, but it isn’t considered a sequel or normal update.</strong></p>



<p>Ubisoft game director Joshua Mills revealed Siege X aims to keep <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege around for the next 10 years</a>. He raised expectations for Siege X at the Rainbow Six Invitational: “It is not Siege 2, and it’s not just another update. It’s a major evolution. We’re expanding and reinforcing the very foundation of Siege to ensure it remains the pinnacle of tactical PvP first-person shooters.”</p>



<p>“Graphical and audio upgrades, deepened tactical gameplay, and new ways to play the game,” are also at the forefront of Siege X’s marketing ahead of the Showcase.</p>



<p>Check out its first teaser trailer below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I imagine Siege X is following in the footsteps of Overwatch 2 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-hits-all-time-player-peak-on-steam-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS2</a> by being a massively upgraded free-to-play enhancement of the original. If so, we can start dreaming of the new content, gameplay mechanics, and much more Ubisoft has in store.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s no secret Ubisoft needs a big win in the next year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> might not be enough, but Siege continues to do the business. Does the prospect of X get you amped up? Which new features and twists does Siege X need to separate itself from the OG Siege?</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to jump into Rainbow Six Siege now if you haven’t already. Let’s answer some common questions about Siege: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-rainbow-six-siege-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Does it have crossplay?</a> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is cross-progression enabled?</a> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-a-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">And is there a Rainbow Six Siege Campaign?</a></p>

<p>The all-Brazilian FaZe Clan roster has stepped up in the grand final of the Six Invitational in Boston to hand Team BDS a decisive loss. With a 3 – 1 scoreline, the curtain came down over the $3 million tournament and FaZe Clan took centre stage to lift the iconic hammer. Team BDS had a solid run to reach the final, but ultimately failed to overcome FaZe Clan’s staying power.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-year-done">Another Year Done</h2>



<p>The Six Invitational was a monumental event, which is fast becoming the par for the course with this tournament. As one of the single-biggest esports events in the world, the Six Invitational awards a whopping $1 million to the victor, and nobody goes home empty-handed.</p>



<p>In Boston, in front of a sold-out crowd, FaZe Clan stormed to the top spot and secured that hefty cash prize.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan has competed at every Six Invitational since 2018, but this is the organisation’s first win. It follows a close second-place finish in 2024 when the team lost against w7m Esports in front of a packed crowd in Sao Paolo.</p>



<p>It was a dramatic couple of weeks in the run-up to the grand final. In the qualifying stages, emotions were running high, and M80 faced a fine and a two-year staff suspension when the team’s coach, Budega, exploded against DarkZero. Those scenes came shortly after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/m80-gunnar-team-liquid-six-invitational/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M80’s Gunnar went on a rant</a> against all comers – then dropped out of the tournament a day later.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan’s finish against Team BDS came after a defiant run through the elimination bracket. It was an epic thing, with FaZe Clan being knocked into the lower bracket by Spacestation at the earliest opportunity.</p>



<p>From there, the team knuckled down and pushed forward, eliminating Team Liquid, Virtus, Falcons, <strong>Spacestation</strong>, Unwanted, and finally FURIA, which also hails from Brazil. It was one of the most incredible lower-bracket runs in esports history, and it ended with FaZe Clan securing the ultimate win over Team BDS and securing the $1 million prize.</p>



<p>That’s not bad at all.</p>



<p>Just before the grand final took place, Ubisoft jumped on stage to reveal Siege X – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/">find out more here</a>.</p>

<p>The CDL Major II qualifiers are in full flow after the competitive season resumed this past weekend, but it hasn’t been fun and games for all involved. In a twist of fate, OpTic Texas – last year’s Call of Duty Championship winner – failed to secure a single map against both Atlanta FaZe and Minnesota Rokkr just days after Pred returned to the starting lineup.</p>



<p>Pred temporarily departed the team late last year to deal with personal issues, and Huke stepped up to fill in for him. Following Huke’s dismissal from the roster, some fans are up in arms, as the change seems to have done more harm than good.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-result-you-wanted">Not The Result You Wanted</h2>



<p>To put it in a word, OpTic Texas was <strong>decimated </strong>this weekend by Atlanta FaZe and Minnesota Rokkr.</p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe is coming into the qualifiers hot off a win at Major I <strong>and </strong>the first CDL Minor, while OpTic Texas was nursing a sore spot after dropping out of the running at the recent Madrid Major. FaZe now has a relatively ridiculous record over OpTic Texas in the CDL era.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Minnesota Rokkr currently occupies sixth place in the overall standings and hasn’t clashed with OpTic Texas since June 2024. Coincidentally, Rokkr was able to hand OpTic Texas a loss back then, too.</p>



<p>Between these two fixtures, OpTic Texas failed to secure <strong>a single map win</strong>. On social media, the team was quick to express concerns:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Actually unacceptable from me. 

Feel terrible to everyone who supports me, gotta just be better. Simple as that, sucks but I’ve been here before. GGs Faze and MN.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Following the loss against Atlanta FaZe, a clip was captured showing OpTic Texas’ Dashy trying to snap his webcam in half. It has been a tough couple of weeks for the OpTic side, and we’re already a long way from the COD Champs win.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the Call of Duty League this weekend, LAT continued to lay the smackdown against all comers, wiping the Royal Ravens with a 3 – 0 scoreline and laying waste to the Vegas Falcons. The Falcons are still to grab a single win this season.</p>



<p>LAG M8 lost again, this time against Boston Breach. It started as a close match, with the opening Hardpoint coming down to just a two-point difference, but things quickly fell apart for LAG M8. Presently, the team sits in 11th place in the CDL standings with just two matches won to <strong>eight </strong>lost. </p>



<p>The Call of Duty League Major II qualifiers will continue this coming weekend, with all eyes resting firmly on the Major II tournament in Texas. It’s set to run between March 20 – 23.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 has reached a new milestone today, setting a new standard for total players while still chasing the the all-time record for the series. The latest iteration of the Counter-Strike franchise reached its highest player peak ever.</p>



<p>Is CS2 perfect? No, but it couldn’t be further from “dead.”</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cs2-strengthens-its-hold-as-the-most-popular-game-on-steam">CS2 Strengthens Its Hold As The Most Popular Game on Steam</h2>



<p>On February 16, 2025, Counter-Strike 2 reached a concurrent player peak of 1,744,015 players, according to the trusted <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB database</a>. This occurred around 13:50 UTC: mid-to-late afternoon in Europe, night-time around Asia, and morning for the Americas. This number represents the most amount of players playing CS2 at once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-reaches-highest-player-peak-after-shanghai-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since just a couple months ago in December 2024</a>.</p>



<p>Since December, CS2 has averaged over 900,000 players, according to SteamDB. As impressive as the peaks and averages have been recently, they’re still just a bit short of the all-time records set by CS:GO. May 2023 saw the highest player peak ever in Counter-Strike history at 1,818,773 players, as well as the highest average ever at over 1.11 million players. Those historic numbers can be attributed to the announcement of the CS2 limited test and the start of the final CS:GO Major, BLAST Paris.</p>



<p>The slight dip in CS2 player peaks and averages in January 2025 could be attributed to the break in the professional circuit following the Perfect World Shanghai Major. As the schedule has resumes with events like BLAST and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vitality-stuns-spirit-3-0-in-grand-finals-of-iem-katowice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEM Katowice</a> at the start of February, the player count swells once again. CS2 effectively owns the top spot on Steam’s player charts, as it has only been surpassed in active players in exceptionally rare circumstances.</p>



<p>While the game’s popularity and player base show zero signs of trailing off, there are still concerns that players want addressed. These range from the still-rampant cheating issue to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-launch-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">problems with FPS performance</a> to a lack of content such as operations or new modes. Still, outside of maybe League of Legends, it remains the most popular PC game in the world.</p>



<p>Will CS2 eventually beat the CS:GO player peak? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
