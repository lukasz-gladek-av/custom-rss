<p>The Simpsons are on their way to Fortnite, and it appears Bart Simpson is the first to make his arrival, as his iconic treehouse can be found on the Battle Royale island, and we’ll tell you exactly where to go.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s mini-season themed around The Simpsons kicks off this week, starting with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge live event</a>, which marks the final part of Chapter 6 in the game, with Epic Games now gearing up for the big release of Chapter 7 at the start of December.</p>



<p>Ahead of the big live event, a new quest is live in Fortnite that tasks you to investigate the Mysterious Anomaly, and we’ve got a full breakdown of where you need to go.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Head here. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Mysterious Anomaly in Fortnite, aka Bart Simpson’s treehouse, is located in the northwestern part of the map, close to the Creepy Camps POI.</strong></p>



<p>Approaching this location, you’ll immediately spot a cell-shaded treehouse that sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the environment, which serves as a huge teaser ahead of the Simpsons-themed mini-season that will serve as the final swansong of Chapter 6 in Fortnite.</p>



<p>To claim the 20,000 XP and complete the quest, which provides a huge bump to your season level and can help you unlock any remaining rewards from the Battle Pass and Fortnitemares, simply approach the Treehouse. When you appear close enough, the challenge will automatically tick off and provide the reward.</p>



<p>There’s no need to head inside the treehouse, but if you do, you’ll be treated to another mini easter egg for the forthcoming season, with a TV that has a sketchy signal in the corner of the building. Periodically, images will flash up with memes from The Simpsons, another major hint at what is coming.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-any-other-simpsons-easter-eggs-in-fortnite">Are There Any Other Simpsons Easter Eggs in Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, there are other Simpsons-themed easter eggs located on the Fortnite app, though none of the others provide an additional quest or XP bonuses.</strong></p>



<p>In the Steamy Shacks location, a workstation very similar to Homer Simpson’s at the nuclear power plant can be found, with no secret as to who it belongs to, as pink-glazed donuts are also there, many of which have had a bite taken out of them.</p>



<p>Additional teasers could be added before the start of the live event this weekend, but it’s not too long to wait now until the big reveal of everything there is to enjoy.</p>

<p>The current season in Fortnite, along with the heap of collabs in the Fortnitemares event, is rapidly approaching its conclusion, with all eyes cast towards The Simpsons mini-season, and we’ve already seen a bunch of leaked skins.</p>



<p>The Simpsons are making a long-awaited arrival in the world of Fortnite this week, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live event set to kick off the huge collab</a>, with a month-long stage in the spotlight before Chapter 6 comes to an end and Chapter 7 begins.</p>



<p>Leaks for the big Simpsons takeover in Fortnite have already emerged, and we’ve highlighted all of the skins that are coming to the game as part of the update.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-leaked-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-skins">All Leaked Fortnite x The Simpsons Skins</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Collab crazy. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Keyart leaked for Fortnite, and a small batch teased by Epic Games themselves, has provided a first look at a total of 12 skins coming in The Simpsons mini-season.</strong></p>



<p>As usual, a bunch of skins will be available as part of the Battle Pass, now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included with a Game Pass subscription</a>, and the usual approach is that characters front and center of keyart will be included in the Pass.</p>



<p>Therefore, we expect Homer, Marge, Simpsons Jonesy, and Simpsons Hope to be included in the Battle Pass skins, while Ned Flanders could be the final reward, along with his trademark moustache-styled glider.</p>



<p>Other skins could still be included in the Battle Pass, but we’ll have to wait and see. There’s plenty more to come in the Item Shop though via V-Bucks purchases, including Lisa Simpson and Krusty the Clown.</p>



<p>As usual, many of the skins will be NPCs to interact with on the map, with Moe Syslak standing out as the leading candidate for that regard, with his bar likely to be a POI, while Lisa Simpson could potentially be found the the school. Again, we’ll have to wait for full confirmation.</p>



<p>Check out the table below for all the leaked Simpsons skins in the Fortnite collab.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Sims Games Coming to Xbox and PlayStation, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-sims-games-coming-xbox-and-playstation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-sims-games-coming-to-xbox-and-playstation-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1336498/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reputable source has claimed that MySims, an adorable version of the popular life simulation series, is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox later this year. MySims first surfaced in 2007 on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii, before expanding to PC, mobile platforms, and in 2024, the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>This marks the first time that MySims will be available to play on Xbox or PlayStation, and fans of the franchise are excited. The MySims: Cozy Bundle, which was recently announced for Apple Arcade (November 6), will arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series platforms from November 18.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-sims-in-mysims">More Sims in MySims</h2>



<p>In an exclusive report published <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mysims-cozy-bundle-arrive-enfin-sur-playstation-et-xbox-on-vous-devoile-sa-date-de-sortie-60696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Dealabs</a>, backed by leading industry insiders, it was claimed that MySims: Cozy Bundle will be released on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5 on November 18, 2025. It was stressed that the game will be priced at $39.99.</p>



<p>The bundle includes the original MySims game, released almost 20 years ago, and MySkins: Kingdom. They’re <strong>remastered version </strong>of the original titles, though.</p>



<p>MySims is something along the lines of The Sims fused with Animal Crossing, presenting players with a cutesy take on the life sim that was first released way back in 2000. It was a spin-off of sorts from SimCity, with developers wanting to explore a more granular take on the city builder, zooming in and allowing players to simulate a life of their dreams.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>As the MySims Cosy Bundle is set to drop exactly one year after it was released on Nintendo Switch, it’s easy to assume that an exclusivity deal was arranged between Electronic Arts and the Japanese gaming titan.</p>



<p>The ‘retro re-release’ of MySims has been met with excitement from fans of the franchise. It has been a while since we had a new Sims game, given that The Sims 4 is now a free-to-play, live-service game, and anyone who hasn’t played MySims before is hungry to experience all it has to offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon’s latest round of closed technical testing is unravelling as we speak, and in social circles, the inevitable leaks are surfacing. While Bungie has been quick to plug the more serious leaks, comments have made it to social media platforms and are staying up for all to see.</p>



<p>On Reddit, users breaking their NDA (or sharing content from others who have broken their NDA) have uploaded clips and screenshots from the Marathon tests. These have already been taken down, but the opinions and comments from those playing the game are still up and represent a mostly positive reception.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-marathon-leaks-are-looking-good">Latest Marathon Leaks Are Looking Good</h2>



<p>In the newest Marathon leaks to hit the social space, users seem to be experiencing mixed feelings about Bungie’s floundering extraction shooter. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/">Marathon was delayed</a> by Bungie amid a wave of issues, leaving prospective fans out in the cold and unsure of what would happen next.</p>



<p>This was after information surfaced regarding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/">stolen art appearing in Marathon</a>, which was addressed by Bungie.</p>



<p>As Marathon came crashing down, we heard information from employees at Bungie concerning the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/morale-at-bungie-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-over-marathon/">free-falling morale</a> at the studio.</p>



<p>At the start of October, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-new-closed-technical-test-october-2025/">a new closed technical test</a> would take place under NDA, with Bungie inviting several hundred players to experience the evolution of Marathon behind closed doors. Inevitably, information has leaked from that closed test.</p>



<p>On Reddit, one user praised work done on factions and quests, while another bagged on some weird mechanics, such as paying credits to remove attachments from your weapons. The latter user also hated limited stash space, poor audio, and the continued existence of ‘bullet magnetism’.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ohmvpy/marathon_nda_technical_test_pastebin_leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Those comments</a> came after 25 hours of playing the NDA’d Marathon, and ultimately the user stressed that they’re ‘still enjoying the game but (they) hope it receives the time in the oven that it needs.’</p>



<p>Another, who may or may not be directly experiencing the technical test, wrote, ‘Our friend says he had zero expectations but has not been able to put the game down since the playtest began. He said the solo experience is a borderline horror experience.’</p>



<p>Others regarded the game as a ‘significant improvement’, while some pointed out that ‘basic, minor things’ are still being overlooked, like some button mapping elements and directional audio mechanics.</p>



<p>Those who managed to see the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ohbx2w/leaked_footage_of_the_marathon_closed_technical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked Marathon gameplay footage</a> suggested that ‘it looks better than the alpha’, while another who didn’t play the first round of tests said, ‘It’s pretty decent and I’m actually having fun.’</p>



<p>Could Bungie genuinely be turning around the perceptions of Marathon? Might this ‘social extraction shooter’ be a success after all? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Hideo Kojima, the legendary creative behind the likes of Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding, could have once upon a time created a game based in the <strong>Matrix </strong>universe. The idea surfaced in 1999 following the release of the first Matrix movie, but Konami reportedly shut down the concept on the spot.</p>



<p>Later, it was reported that team members at Konami expressed ‘immense disappointment’ at never having had the chance to assemble a Matrix game. It was just three years or so after the Wachowskis (the creators of the Matrix) met with Konami and floundered that Enter the Matrix (2003) was released.</p>



<h2 id="h-konami-didn-t-want-to-touch-the-matrix">Konami Didn’t Want to Touch The Matrix</h2>



<p>In a new report published <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Time Extension</a>, a discussion with Chris Bergstresser, former VP of Licensing at Konami, revealed the time that the Wachowskis approached Hideo Kojima about creating a Matrix game.</p>



<p>By that time, Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, and Metal Gear Solid had all been released and were doing very well.</p>



<p>Bergstresser explained that while Kojima specifically was approached about the project, it was Kasumi Kitaue, Executive Producer at Konami, who shut down the idea of the Japanese firm creating a Matrix game:</p>

<p>The Wachowskis were big fans of Kojima. Kazumi Kitaue, Kojima, Aki Saito, and I were at the Konami HQ, and we got a call from the Wachowskis, who wanted to come in and meet with Kojima. So they did!</p>



<p>The two of them came in with their concept artist, and effectively they said to Kojima, ‘We really want you to do the Matrix game. Can you do that?’ Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No’. We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Enter the Matrix was released as the first game in the series in 2003, which was right between the launch of Metal Gear Solid 2 in 2001 and Metal Gear Solid 3 in 2004. Both of these titles were critically acclaimed, award-winning successes that still have a cult following today.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Konami released a top-to-bottom remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.</p>



<p>It’s easy to see why Kitaue didn’t want to meddle with the Matrix, given that Konami had so much more on its plate in the shooter space.</p>



<p>Do you wish we’d gotten a Matrix game from Hideo Kojima? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bully-online-has-been-announced-but-there%E2%80%99s-a-huge-catch.1336480/</guid>

<p>If you’ve ever wanted to play Rockstar Games’ 2006 hit that was dubbed ‘GTA for kids’ alongside your friends, you’ve finally got the opportunity – or at least you will have soon. Bully Online has been revealed, and it features multiplayer exploration, new minigames (some of which are utterly bizarre), and races.</p>



<p>There’s one <strong>huge </strong>catch, though. Bully Online isn’t an official game – <strong>it’s a mod</strong>. It has been pieced together by a team headed by SWEGTA, a popular YouTuber who specializes in Rockstar content.</p>



<h2 id="h-bully-online-actually-looks-like-insane-fun">Bully Online Actually Looks Like Insane Fun</h2>



<p>SWEGTA posted a new trailer to YouTube showcasing Bully Online, a fan-made concoction that brings multiplayer madness to the 2006 open-world title from Rockstar Games. He stressed it has been ‘in the making for a very long time’, and it seems that, for now, Take-Two and Rockstar are willing to let it slide.</p>



<p>The trailer, posted below, showcases the game’s core mechanics, which include things never before seen in the world of Bully (known in some markets as Canis Canem Edit):</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The team working with SWEGTA to bring this mod to life has left nothing untouched when it comes to creative potential. There are races in everything from cars to shopping carts, clique battles, first-person shooter arenas, gnome skateboarding, and boxing matches.</p>



<p>It’s looking highly customizable, accessible, and entertaining, and as SWEGTA says, there’s really no end to what they can bring to life in Bully Online. It’s a crowdfunded project that is being backed by a Ko-Fi initiative, and it’s only now that SWEGTA and his team feel ready to reveal Bully Online to the public.</p>



<p>In the video, SWEGTA explains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the things we thought were impossible just a few years ago can now be done, including making an online mode. We do have an official server for Bully Online, and we plan on making that available to the public to enjoy in due time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The week is in full flow, and while you’re off to work, school, or whatever else you’re doing today, you can’t forget to keep up your NYT Connection streak. That’s why I’m here, bringing you the best and latest NYT Connections hints and solutions, so you can get this puzzle out the door as quickly as possible and start cracking on with your day.</p>



<p>Read on to get the solutions for today’s NYT Connections puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-28">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 28)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #870:</p>



<ul>
<li>CHESTNUT</li>



<li>SELECT</li>



<li>OCHER</li>



<li>AWARE</li>



<li>PLATITUDE</li>



<li>MENU</li>



<li>KENYA</li>



<li>WISE</li>



<li>TROPE</li>



<li>CLICHÉ</li>



<li>BACK</li>



<li>HIP</li>



<li>SAVVY</li>



<li>HOME</li>



<li>GUSHER</li>



<li>PELVIS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all describe ideas or phrases that have been said so often they’ve lost their impact.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these words suggests someone who’s clued in, sharp, or culturally attuned.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>You might see these on a remote control or a game controller—they’re all common interface commands.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Musicians with an extra letter.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 28.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-28-870">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 28 (#870)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>
