<p>Completing every achievement and unlocking every trophy in Blue Prince, like reaching Room 46, will be difficult, even for grizzled puzzle genre veterans.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-blue-prince-release-start-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Prince</a> is far from the traditional puzzle title. Dogubomb’s debut project puts you in the shoes of an heir to Mount Holly Manor and features tabletop card game and roguelike exploration elements. The simple objective is to explore all 45 rooms of the house and discover a secret 46th room, but there is a twist.</p>



<p>Each door opens to one of three rooms, and the choice is yours. The floor plan resets at the end of each in-game day, changing the house layout. It’s up to you to discover tools and permanent upgrades to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of a children’s book author and more secrets along the way. And If there is one thing puzzle fans also love, it’s trophy hunting in games. </p>

<p>Every room in Mount Holly Manor features some puzzle, tool, or blueprint to discover. Yet, what makes Blue Prince so unique is that players don’t need to complete every challenge. Every player will experience their own journey based on the map layout. However, this list of achievements applies to everyone and can be completed by following the steps below. </p>



<p>In total, there are eight standard achievements and eight secret achievements. While we have this list of achievements, Dogubomb has remained tight-lipped on what trophies will be available. Yet, completing every achievement above should put you on track to acquire every trophy.</p>
