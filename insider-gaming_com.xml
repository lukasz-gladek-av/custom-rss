<p>The Shopify Rebellion Game Changers roster, the reigning two-time champions, have made history. The women became the first GC team to qualify for a VALORANT Challengers event, after years of attempts.</p>



<p>The roster core that has dominated the women’s VALORANT scene has finally overcome their greatest obstacle on the path to their ultimate goal: the international VCT leagues.</p>

<h2 id="h-shopify-rebellion-makes-history">Shopify Rebellion Makes History</h2>



<p>While the Shopify Rebellion Game Changers team has dominated the GC circuit, they had always fallen short of advancing past qualifiers into Challengers. For VALORANT teams, the Challengers leagues are the path to the Ascension event, a regional tournament that determines who is promoted to the international VCT leagues.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-game-changers-vct-win/">winning their second Game Changers Championship in December</a>, Shopify were dealt a huge blow when their star Ava “florescent” Eugene signed with VCT EMEA team Apeks. In doing so, flor became the first Game Changers player to compete in VCT, but it left a big hole in the roster for Shopify to fill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just prior to the North American Challengers closed qualifier, Shopify found their replacement in Karnthida “dodonut” Chaisrakeo. In the closed qualifier, Shopify overcame dodonut’s former team, FlyQuest RED, before beating Funhaver to secure the third and final qualifier spot in NA Challengers.</p>







<p>For the Shopify Rebellion organization, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-merges-with-ludwig-and-cr1tikals-esports-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh off their merger with content creator stars Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig’s Moist Esports</a>, they will field two roster in NA Challengers, as their men’s roster returns after competing in the league last year. Organizations are permitted by Riot to field two teams in the same ecosystem, provided one of them is eligible to compete in Game Changers. The Shopify GC roster is the two-time champion of Game Changers, so they should be permitted to compete when the NA Challengers League stage one begins later this month.</p>

<p>EA has announced that Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to meet the company’s internal expectations. In its <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preliminary Q3 FY2025 earnings report</a>, EA revealed that it was forced to lower its revenue forecast for both the quarter and fiscal year after the first Dragon Age game in 10 years missed expectations by a wide margin. </p>



<p>“Dragon Age engaged approximately 1.5 million players during the quarter, down nearly 50% from the company’s expectations,” the company said. </p>



<p>Because of the lower player engagement of Dragon Age: The Veilguard—as well as EA Sports FC 25—EA adjusted its expected net bookings for the year to be between $7-$7.15 billion compared to the originally expected $7.5-$7.8 billion. For the quarter itself, EA has adjusted its expectations to $2.21 billion in net bookings.</p>







<p><strong>“</strong>During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio; however, Dragon Age and EA SPORTS FC 25 underperformed our net bookings expectations,” said EA CEO Andrew Wilson in a prepared statement. “We remain confident in our long-term strategy and expect a return to growth in FY26, as we execute against our pipeline.”</p>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was released on October 31, 2024 to generally favorable reviews from critics. The game’s director, Corine Busche, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently left BioWare</a> after 18 years with the company for a new opportunity.</p>



<p>EA will present its full earnings on February 4 at 5pm ET/2pm PT. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the call when it takes place. </p>
