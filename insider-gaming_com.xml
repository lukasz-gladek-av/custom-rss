<p>It’s time for a new expansion with Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s Shining Revelry content. We’re already putting Triumphant Light behind us as we’re being blinded by the long-awaited arrival of Shiny Pokémon&nbsp;in Shining Revelry.</p>



<p>The next main-set Expansion is here, and it’s called Shining Revelry. A fitting name as it welcomes Shiny Pokémon&nbsp;variations into Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Shinies have become part and parcel of the Pokémon&nbsp;experience in the mainline games and Pokémon&nbsp;GO.</p>



<p>It’s Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s turn to have Shinies, and they are the centerpiece attraction of Shining Revelry.</p>

<p>The Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket Shining Revelry expansion comes to us on <strong>March 27</strong>—giving you only a few days to fill in the gaps of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-triumphant-light-secret-missions-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a> and other sets.</p>



<p>The headline-makers we’ve seen—so far—in <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Pocket</a>‘s Shining Revelry set are a <strong>Shiny Charizard ex</strong> and a <strong>Shiny Lucario ex</strong>. They look absolutely stunning, and it introduces a new form of rarity to the grading system.</p>



<div><article><p><span>It’s time to shine ✨ in the latest </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PokemonTCGPocket</a><span> expansion!

Shiny Pokémon arrive alongside Pokémon from the Paldea region in the upcoming expansion, Shining Revelry! Available on Thursday, March 27.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket Shining Revelry’s debut likely coincides with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ranked-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-period-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Battles</a>. The PvP mode was announced a while back after being a rumor. So it’s a double-whammy for Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket players as the mobile app continues to Rock Smash it.</p>

<p>The dust has finally started to settle on Monster Hunter Wilds’ incredible launch. But if you thought Capcom would leave it there, you’re deadly wrong. We’re just getting started, and the newly announced Monster Hunter Wilds First Title Showcase coming in April is the next phase.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-united-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game in the United States</a> in 2025. Monster Hunter Wilds is also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-become-the-fastest-selling-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling game in Capcom’s long and illustrious history</a>. They’re some impressive accolades to shout from the mountains. Although I wouldn’t recommend it as you’re likely to disturb <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/creature-coin-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ancient Wyverns</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-catch-whoppers-in-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoppers</a>, and other other-worldly creatures.</p>



<p>The first major content injection is on the way courtesy of the Monster Hunter Wilds First Title update. A Showcase has been set in stone which will unveil new footage and features.</p>

<p>Capcom has announced a Showcase for the first Free Title Update in Monster Hunter Wilds. The presentation is set for <strong>March 25</strong>, with the update launching in “<strong>Early April</strong>.”</p>



<p>The developer has also declared the Showcase is being presented by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto. You can watch the show on the <a href="http://twitch.tv/monsterhunter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds Twitch channel</a>, and it will show “Mizutsune and a host of other new additions.”</p>



<p>We reported a while back that Mizutsune was part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-roadmap-mizutsune-dlc-update-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds roadmap</a>. This will be our first real look at the creature, how it fights, and how you can prepare yourself for the titanic battle.</p>



<p>Capcom is making sure fans are eating good. If this announcement isn’t a testament to that, you only need to look at the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-promotion-is-rewarding-players-with-lots-of-free-goodies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds promotion offering free goodies and bonuses</a>.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Join us March 25 at 7am PT/2pm GMT for the Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase, hosted by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto! We’ll be detailing the first Free Title Update coming in early April, which includes Mizutsune and a host of other new additions.

<p>Final Fantasy 14 is gearing up for the colossal 7.2 update titled Seekers of Eternity. Square Enix isn’t content to sit around and leave us all wondering though. The developer has already showcased the preliminary patch notes revealing much of what’s to come in the update.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-director-leaves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix</a> can release as many remakes and new mainline FF entries as it wants. However, none of them are likely to have as great an impact as Final Fantasy 14 Online continues to have. With tens of millions of subscribers coming back each month, FF14 Online is where it’s at—and new DLC expansions help.</p>



<p>Every so often a giant update comes along with a content pile so big it makes the content of Santa’s sleigh seem minimal. The Seekers of Eternity 7.2 update is the latest and great patch for Final Fantasy 14, so let’s check it out.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-14-update-7-2-release-date">Final Fantasy 14 Update 7.2 Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>March 25 is when the Seekers of Eternity update goes live in Final Fantasy 14.</strong></p>



<p>There’s also a cinematic trailer to get you ready for the incoming content and patch notes. You can check it out here.</p>

<h3 id="h-new-quest-to-complete">New Quest to Complete</h3>



<p>A ton of new quests have been added requiring the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-14s-dawntrail-launch-trailer-tells-us-more-about-the-expansions-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawntrail expansion</a>. This includes Main Quest missions, Chronicles of a New Era quests, side missions, and more.</p>



<h3 id="h-battle-system-bolstered">Battle System Bolstered</h3>



<p>We know there’s a new dungeon to explore called the Underkeep. Plus, Season 8 of Final Fantasy 14’s PvP is set to get underway, and many other changes and tweaks have been made to combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-greater-graphics">Greater Graphics</h3>



<p>Square Enix has made a serious graphical improvement to lots of the game’s weapons and accessories, improved the resolution for vegetation and environmental objects, and adjusted lighting and shadows to appear more realistically.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A wealth of content. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thanks to Square Enix, we have the <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/ad533b893feebc1a06995b73a33497345dfcd8aa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Seekers of Eternity 7.2 update patch notes</a>. Here, you can see every single change, which piece of DLC you need to benefit properly, and what to expect overall.</p>



<p>This should keep Final Fantasy 14 fans ticking over until the 7.3 update and the eventual successor to Dawntrail.</p>

<p>After a hugely successful release, it seems several studios are already set to battle it out to claim the rights to a full-length Split Fiction movie—bringing the dramatic journey of Mio and Zoe to life.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-trophy-and-achievement-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> had the tough job of following up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>—2021’s Game of the Year. I’d argue that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-reaches-major-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">milestone of two million copies sold in just one week</a> has put this doubt to rest. Josef Fares and his team have done it again, and it looks like another triumphant statement that cooperative multiplayer sells.</p>



<p>Now, it’s time to see if the medium is as effective on the big screen. A Split Fiction movie is heavily rumored—barely two weeks removed from its debut—and it looks promising.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the 2025 Game Developers Conference has birthed Split Fiction movie talk. Story Kitchen is the company potentially “<strong>Putting together the film’s cast, writers and director into a package as offers for the rights keep coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios.</strong>“</p>



<p>Again, the rumor and chatter come directly from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gdc-awards-balatro-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC 2025</a>, so it remains to be seen if the talk will continue once the event has concluded. Hopefully, a Split Fiction movie has better luck than the It Takes Two one. A movie for the previous co-op title was given the go-ahead, but it apparently remains on hold for now.</p>



<p>If we do get a Split Fiction movie, will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-split-fiction-voice-actors-revealed-who-voices-zoe-mio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoe and Mio’s voice actors</a> get to reprise their roles? Only time will tell. For now, we’ll continue to lap up every second of Split Fiction. After all, new secrets keep being discovered such as the now-infamous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-split-fiction-laser-hell-secret-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laser Hell Secret Hell</a> featuring a guest appearance from director Josef Fares himself!</p>
