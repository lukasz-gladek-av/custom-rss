<p>During The Game Awards, Blizzard unveiled Diablo 4’s upcoming Lord of Hatred expansion, scheduled to drop on April 28, 2026. The trailer, which was in typical cinematic fashion for a Blizzard reveal, showcased Mephisto, otherwise known as the Lord of Hatred, and it offered a little glimpse at the new Paladin class, a ‘holy knight’ kind of character.</p>



<p>Check out the new Lord of Hatred trailer below.</p>

<p>The next major expansion for Diablo 4 is dubbed Lord of Hatred, and it’s centered around Mephisto, one of the universe’s most terrifying and capable entities.</p>



<p>Blizzard revealed that the Paladin class is coming to Diablo 4 <strong>now</strong>, but it’s available exclusively to those who pre-order the new Lords of Hatred expansion. In the trailer content, a second new class was teased, but we don’t yet know what that will look like.</p>



<p>In the subsequent information divulged from Lord of Hatred, it was confirmed that massive gameplay updates are incoming, including an overhaul to endgame systems, a level cap increase, and the return of the Horadric Cube.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer for Lord of Hatred:</p>

<p>It was later reported that the new expansion, Lord of Hatred, will introduce <strong>fishing</strong> as a side activity. It’s not clear why you’d want to consume the fish found across the Diablo universe, but perhaps they serve another purpose.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals already has a roster that can rival any hero game in existence. So, it makes sense to throw in the foul-mouthed and hilarious Deadpool for good measure in 2026.</p>



<p>Deadpool might be one of the most popular Marvel heroes ever. Let’s be clear, this was BEFORE Ryan Reynolds elevated the character to new, bloody heights. At The Game Awards 2025, Deadpool made his mark and will make his mark in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-confirmed-to-feature-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-adding-deadpool-in-2026">Marvel Rivals Adding Deadpool In 2026</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 6: Night at the Museum starts on January 16, and Deadpool will be a headline attraction.</p>







<p>The wonderful Wade Wilson arrives in the legendary Deadpool get-up, and it’s going to be fascinating how much NetEase can keep a lid on the silly, sarcastic, and sharp (in more ways than one) assassin.</p>



<p>Check out the complete Deadpool reveal trailer below, first shown during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>
