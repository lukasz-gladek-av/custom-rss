<p>Fortnite recently released its new anti-cheat policy, which revealed that players with lifetime bans will be offered a second chance in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-cheaters-will-receive-a-second-chance">Fortnite Cheaters Will Receive a Second Chance</h2>



<p>Fortnite has confirmed that players who have received a lifetime ban for cheating in the game and have been banned for more than a year can return to matchmaking in April 2025, when the new update rolls out. Players who have cheated in tournaments will not be able to participate in competitive events; however, they can also enter matchmaking in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in April, Fortnite’s lifetime ban policy for cheaters will change. First-time offenders will now receive a year’s ban, after which they will receive a second chance to return to the game. However, if they cheat again, a lifetime ban will be enforced. Players who sell cheats or break other rules, resulting in a lifetime ban, will not receive a second chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s new <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-anti-cheat-update-february-27-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">anti-cheat policy</a> also introduces new PC requirements for tournaments. Players should have an Account Level of 350 or higher to participate in tournaments and enable TPM and Secure Boot while playing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players wonder whether they will see the return of popular content creators who received lifetime bans for cheating. Jarvis, who was banned in 2019 for using cheat software while live-streaming, has also <a href="https://x.com/liljarviss/status/1895161943725613220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to Fortnite’s recent announcement about giving cheaters a second chance.</p>

<p>Netease recently spoke about their plans to grow Marvel Rivals as a franchise, and one avenue they are focusing on is “crossover events and promotions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marvel-rivals-crossover-events-and-promotions-with-other-media-confirmed-by-netease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, Netease spoke about its growth strategies for Marvel Rivals during a Q&amp;A section of its Q4 2024 <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netease-inc-ntes-q4-2024-070339624.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>. When asked about marketing expansions, the developers confirmed that Marvel Rivals will receive “crossover events and promotions with other media to expand the user base.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from crossovers in Marvel Rivals, the developers also spoke about the “wide acclaim” the game has received since the release of Season 1. Moreover, their investments in development and marketing have continued following a “long-term operational strategy”. Regarding esports, the team has a plan in the works and will announce it soon to “enhance the gaming ecosystem”.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has massive potential for crossovers with a name like Disney behind it. Players will also look forward to collaborations with the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as other games. A game like Fortnite already has its own Marvel Universe; imagine if Marvel Rivals were to join the fray, too. </p>

<p>Forza Horizon 5 developers haven’t planned a physical release for the PS5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Playground Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> late last month that their highly popular racing title is finally arriving on PS5 after being an Xbox exclusive for years. Forza Horizon 5 will arrive for PS5 on April 29; however, it will only be a digital release; the developers have “no current plans” for a physical disc at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the official X announcement, many players asked whether Forza Horizon 5 would receive a physical release on the PS5. The developers <a href="https://x.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1895217916506747364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1895218127073394945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reiterated</a> several times on the thread that they have “no current plans” for such a release. The developers also confirmed that there are no cross-saves between Xbox and PlayStation 5.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-nbsp">Forza Horizon 5 on PS5&nbsp;</h2>



<p>On the PS5, players will be able to experience Forza Horizon 5 in two modes: Performance (60 fps) and Quality (30 fps). The game will also receive PS5 Pro support on release, with increased fidelity for Performance mode and ray-traced car reflections in Races and Free Roam for Quality mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game comes in three editions: Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. Standard provides the base game with free content and the upcoming Horizon Realms update. The Deluxe edition will add an extra 42 cars through the Car Pass. The Premium edition will include all the previous content along with both Forza Horizon 5 expansions (Rally Adventure and Hot Wheels), VIP Membership, and extra perks that are included in the Welcome Pack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pre-ordering the premium edition will also provide players with early access from April 25, 2025. Normal pre-orders will reward players with a special bundle.&nbsp;</p>
