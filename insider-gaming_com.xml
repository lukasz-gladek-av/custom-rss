<p>Life simulator inZOI is heading to Early Access. In a message on the game’s Discord server on Thursday, director and producer Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim announced that inZOI Early Access will launch on March 28, 2025.</p>



<p>The new date <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">moves the game</a> out of the original late-2024 Early Access timeline. </p>



<p>Kim started his message by thanking players for taking part in the Character Studio demo over the summer, and saying that the reception was more than he or the team could’ve expected. </p>



<p>“Seeing so much engagement brought us immense happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with inZOI,” he said. </p>



<p>When the Character Studio was available, over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-character-creator-shows-players-are-ready-for-sims-competitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19,000 concurrent players</a> created over 100,000 characters. With that response and feedback, it gave Kim and the studio the insight needed to provide players with “the most complete experience possible”.</p>



<p>“It’s said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings,” Kim said. “The extra love and care required to nurture a child to adulthood is how I see our journey with inZOI—a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. </p>



<p>“This change in our release date reflects our commitment to building a stronger foundation for inZOI, so we can embark on this journey in the best way possible.”</p>



<p>Kim closed by saying the team’s goal is to “deliver an experience fans can enjoy for a long time to come”.</p>



<p>Recently, Insider Gaming sat down with Kim&nbsp;to talk about inZOI about the game’s development, his goals, and more. Stay tuned for that in the near future.</p>

<p>You’ll play whatever is brand-new, launching alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 whenever the system finally releases, right? But what about past titles? I don’t know about you, but I have zero intention of tossing aside my old system or games, so I’d like to get additional playtime from them, even with a new console generation in hand. So, here are a few games you should play first on Nintendo Switch 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible">Is The Nintendo Switch 2 Backwards Compatible?</h2>



<p>Following official confirmation that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 offers backward compatibility</a> for Nintendo Switch titles, I thought it would be fun to look at a few of the top games of the current generation. They’ll surely carry forward, with fun gameplay and adequate graphics, even though competition will be stiff with an entirely new series of launch games.</p>



<p>Here’s what Nintendo’s Furukawa said about the upcoming system:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is Furukawa. At today’s Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-what-backwards-compatible-games-should-you-play-on-nintendo-switch-2">What Backwards Compatible Games Should You Play on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p>Since the idea here is to ensure all Nintendo Switch titles work on the Nintendo Switch 2, on day one, we’ll have a massive library of games to choose from, along with anything new coming out for the successor system. But instead of speculating about what’s to come, let’s look back toward the top games on the Nintendo Switch that you’ll want to play on Nintendo Switch 2:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong></li>



<li><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon Quest 11 S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hollow Knight</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</strong></li>



<li><strong>Octopath Traveler 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Honestly? We could continue listing exceptional Nintendo Switch titles until the list hits the triple digits. But for now, these ten titles prove time-consuming and extraordinary in their own ways.</p>

<p>Of course, the list of Nintendo Switch games continuously grows with each passing month. Not long ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-red-rescue-team-arrives-for-nintendo-switch-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we received Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team</a>!</p>

<p>Following the announcement that a Death Stranding Director’s Cut will be coming to Xbox, Kojima Productions has also announced that the Death Stranding IP now belongs to the developer. </p>



<p>The announcement, which came via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20241107-317236/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">automaton-media</a>, read, “In addition, KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS announced that the IP for this work will belong to the studio. They said that they will continue to connect more fans around the world in various forms of entertainment”.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is scheduled to release for the PlayStation 5 in 2025. However, recent news could suggest that the game could launch on day one on the Xbox platform and PC, too, if PlayStation didn’t get some form of marketing/exclusivity deal.</p>



<p>Regardless<span>, today’s announcement of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-xbox-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death Stranding Director’s Cut on Xbox</a>&nbsp;suggests that Death Stranding</span> 2 will eventually be released on Xbox and PC. </p>



<p>We’ll have to wait for an additional announcement of such details, with the most likely announcement coming at Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards this December (granted, if PlayStation doesn’t have some exclusivity). </p>



<p>Death Stranding on the Xbox will be published by 505 Games.</p>
