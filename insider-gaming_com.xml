            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-small-content-creator-is-suing-inkslasher-for-allegedly-stealing-her-content.1355452/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A small content creator by the name of EvenBadWolves Gaming (real name Elizabeth McAulay) has decided that she will be suing a much larger content creator by the name of InkSlasher for allegedly stealing her content. </p>



<p>In her video, which she uploaded to her YouTube channel, EvenBadWolves Gaming, she releases a side-by-side comparison of both her video and InkSlasher’s, of which she claims over 30 minutes of InkSlasher’s 43-minute video is directly ripped from her video. The side-by-side comparisons show duplicate footage and the same editing style, and, in some cases, the same watermarks.</p>







<p>According to McAulay, her original video took 200 hours to create, so seeing the majority of her content stolen is understandably frustrating. As she explains, such issues are typically swept under the rug by YouTube because of its copyright policies, where counter-notifications make it nearly impossible for smaller creators to obtain justification for their content being stolen.</p>



<p>However, McAulay is a real lawyer, and as such, she has decided to sue InkFlasher for stealing her content. McAulay says she has submitted her case to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia over copyright infringement.</p>



<p>Of course, McAulay says that taking someone to court isn’t cheap, and she was quoted up to $135,000 Australian for the case. <span>McAulay currently has a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-big-youtuber-stole-my-video-im-fighting-back" target="_blank">GoFundMe setup</a>&nbsp;to try to</span> raise some of the funds for her case, for which she is seeking $50,000 AUD. Alternatively, you can watch EvenBadWolves Gaming’s video below to help support her.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Since the video was uploaded to YouTube, InkSlasher’s video has mysteriously disappeared from YouTube, and he’s seemingly avoiding discussing the allegations as anything said will likely be used against him in court.</p>







<p>What do you think of EvenBadWolves Gaming case? Do you think she will be successful in taking InkSlasher to court?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-producer-addresses-leon-kennedy-rumors.1355437/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Leon Kennedy has overshadowed all of Resident Evil Requiem’s development so far, as fans are more fixated on the long-term hero either making an appearance or being a playable character. It’s no longer a vocal minority, and Resident Evil Requiem’s producer has commented on the rumors.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the horror series. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-third-person-camera-because-resident-evil-7-was-too-scary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 7 Was “Scary,”</a> and Resident Evil 8 did a great job of making a quiet village terrifying. Resident Evil Requiem takes us back to Raccoon City, and everyone wants to know if Leon Kennedy will be there.</p>







<h2 id="h-could-leon-kennedy-be-in-resident-evil-requiem">Could Leon Kennedy Be In Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>He has to be, right? Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stevivor</a>, Resident Evil Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa opened up on the upcoming sequel. </p>



<p>It should be noted that Kumazawa’s responses were translated via an interpreter. While we don’t discredit the translator, there’s always the possibility that something was lost in translation. But when asked about the future of Leon Kennedy and the rumors that he might be in Resident Evil Requiem, Kumazawa had a simple response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more detective work [on the part of players]. So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value. Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong. It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation. There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eye patch, and just basically saying there’s a DLC or a new costume for Leon — but just to make sure, these are all fake news.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Firstly, at no point did Kumazawa outright say Leon isn’t in the game. He merely stated that speculation is speculation, and AI could be responsible for the leaks. On the other hand, this is the most PR-appropriate answer he could’ve given.</p>







<p>Of course, he’s not going to say if Leon is in RE9 and ruin the surprise. <strong>However, he could certainly shut down any suggestions, and he didn’t outright</strong>. Fake news doesn’t mean no, and how many times have we seen or heard a dev say something isn’t happening, knowing full well it is?</p>



<p>You only have to look at Summer Game Fest 2025, where Capcom fooled everyone by teasing us with future RE9 news, before unveiling the game at the end of the show to fake everyone out!</p>



<p>With news of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-skin-spotted-on-playstation-portugal-pre-order-page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Leon Skin Being Spotted On The PlayStation Portugal Pre-Order Page</a>, all signs point toward the legendary character being involved one way or another.</p>



<p>We’ll keep monitoring the situation and checking the latest RE9 leaks. DO you think Leon will be in Resident Evil Requiem?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar Games sent the world into overdrive two years ago with the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1. It has amassed countless views, and now it’s been claimed that it’s risen to the top as the number one YouTube trailer without ads.</p>



<p>One day, many from now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> will release. It will be a glorious day, everyone will rejoice in the game’s outrageous content and over-the-top violence, and appreciate that Rockstar Games spent a lot of time crafting a probable masterpiece. The most recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 delay</a> hurts, yes, but we’ll look back on the journey with newfound fondness—particularly Trailer 1.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 set the wheels in motion, and it continues to be watched worldwide.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-trailer-1-smashes-youtube-trailer-record-without-ads">GTA 6 Trailer 1 Smashes YouTube Trailer Record Without Ads</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The day and nightlife. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evidence shows that Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 has recently passed 269 million views (and counting) on YouTube, making it allegedly the number one YouTube trailer of all time <strong>without ads</strong>.</p>



<p>We have to emphasize this as there are a small handful of worldwide trailers that eclipse this, but do feature YouTube ads. It’s an incredible feat as Rockstar Games could quite easily have monetized this trailer, and still landed themselves a nice, hefty chunk of revenue.</p>



<p>The video also has over 1 million comments! Trailer 2 isn’t doing too badly either, sitting at just under 150 million views at the time of writing.</p>



<p>With another year to go until Grand Theft Auto 6, we’ll keep rewatching Trailer 1 (and Trailer 3), await Trailer 3, and hope for a full gameplay reveal or walkthrough sooner rather than later.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-trade-anything-day-coming-december/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamestop-will-host-a-%E2%80%98trade-anything%E2%80%99-day-in-december.1355371/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On December 6, GameStop is hosting a bizarre event dubbed ‘Trade Anything’ Day. This is exactly what it sounds like, with the retailer suggesting that <strong>almost anything </strong>can be exchanged for store credit on that day only. There’s a list of excluded items, like ‘radioactive waste’ or alcohol, but everything else goes – including <strong>taxidermied animals</strong>.</p>



<p>There are a few more catches involved, and nobody knows how much these items will be worth, but it’s certainly a bold attempt to get customers into GameStop stores across the nation.</p>







<h2 id="h-gamestop-trade-anything-day-coming-soon">GameStop ‘Trade Anything’ Day Coming Soon</h2>



<p>GameStop might have opened the door to some truly weird potential this coming Trade Anything Day. On December 6, customers will waltz into GameStop stores with anything they can get their hands on in the hope of securing some store credit.</p>



<p>It’s highly unlikely the average item will be worth much, and there are a lot of caveats tied to the event, but it’s nothing if not a humorous event that’ll get people into the retailer’s stores.</p>



<p>GameStop staff will have the final say on what can be accepted as a trade item, and there’s a pre-defined shipping container that has been handed to stores to determine the maximum size of said items. That stops you from wheeling a refrigerator or something bizarre into the store to trade.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of things that you <strong>can not </strong>trade to GameStop during Trade Anything Day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hazardous waste or material, chemicals, liquids. Lithium ion batteries or items containing lithium ion batteries. Weapons and ammo. Dead or alive animals (Taxidermy items are valid for trade). Alcohol, Tobacco, drugs or pharmaceuticals (legal or not). Computers (such as desktops, laptops, notebooks, all-in-ones, minis, workstations, e-readers, tablets, thin clients, smart displays, virtual reality headsets with built-in processor, interactive flat panel displays with built-in processor) excluding certain MacBooks GameStop normally accepts in trade. Computer peripherals intended for use with a computer and weighing less than 100 pounds (monitors, keyboards/keypads, mice/pointing devices, external hard drives (excluding those normally accepted in trade), facsimile machines, document scanners, printers, 3D printers, label printers, digital picture frames. Small electronic equipment (portable digital music players, VCRs, DVD players, DVRs, digital converter boxes, cable or satellite receivers, projectors including those with DVD player capability). Small scale servers. Televisions. Gift cards and other currency (foreign or domestic). Jewelry. Sexual and explicit items. Items resembling body parts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a hefty list after all, and there are some strange things on there that you <strong>think would </strong>be accepted, like computers, peripherals, and ‘small electronic equipment.’</p>



<p>‘Items resembling body parts’ are also banned from trading, which is understandable.</p>







<p>Do you want to take part in Trade Anything Day? Let me know what you intend to take in on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-17-890/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-890-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-monday-november-17.1355368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a new week, and we’re smack-bang in the middle of November. It’s a busy time all around – Thanksgiving is on the horizon, Christmas is just beyond, and Black Friday starts soon. There’s a lot to focus on, but today, let’s start small by smashing this NYT Connections puzzle.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need to start your week on a high.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-17">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 17)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #890:</p>



<ul>
<li>TABOO</li>



<li>SLAM DUNK</li>



<li>GO-GETTER</li>



<li>SURE THING</li>



<li>SHOO-IN</li>



<li>SCATTERGORIES</li>



<li>OKEY-DOKE</li>



<li>PROSCRIBED</li>



<li>ALLEY-OOP</li>



<li>ABSOLUTELY</li>



<li>VERBOTEN</li>



<li>FADEAWAY</li>



<li>OFF-LIMITS</li>



<li>LEAVENING</li>



<li>FINGER ROLL</li>



<li>OF COURSE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Responses that enthusiastically confirm agreement</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Words that mark something as off-limits or prohibited</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Different ways to score on the court</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word begins with a command meaning “get lost!”</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 17.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-17-890">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 17 (#890)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– ABSOLUTELY, OF COURSE, OKEY-DOKE, SURE THING</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – OFF-LIMITS, PROSCRIBED, TABOO, VERBOTEN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ALLEY-OOP, FADEAWAY, FINGER ROLL, SLAM DUNK</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – GO-GETTER, LEAVENING, SCATTERGORIES, SHOO-IN</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>If you’ve played ARC Raiders, you’ve heard about (or seen, or fought…) the Queen. She’s a terrifying enemy with a hulking construct, an immense attack set, and an enormous health pool. Before the Matriarch arrived, she was the game’s apex predator and an aspirational target for talented players worldwide.</p>



<p>In a recent clip uploaded to social media, the Queen was flipped on her head and taken down in the most hilarious, unscripted way by her own kin, a lone Probe looking to ascend to the stars.</p>







<h2 id="h-queen-faces-brilliant-and-unscripted-takedown">Queen Faces Brilliant and Unscripted Takedown</h2>



<p>In a clip uploaded to social media by cHipChrome and shared by numerous users, we see a Queen thrown high into the air, flipped onto her belly, and sent crashing back down to Earth because she happened to wander over a Probe that was taking off at that moment.</p>



<p>The Probe, which must have one hell of a jet engine, took the Queen on a partial ascension to the skies, lifting her and bringing her back down again in the most undignified way for an ARC of her stature.</p>

<p>The player who captured the clip could do nothing but stare in awe at the event, which is a perfect representation of how unscripted and unpredictable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/arc-raiders-loaded-pc/">ARC Raiders</a> really is.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has been on the market for almost three weeks, and just yesterday, it managed to hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/">new all-time high</a> peak player count on Steam, securing another lofty height even amid the launches of Black Ops 7 and Escape from Tarkov.</p>







<p>It’s proving to be one of the most genre-disrupting games ever, shattering expectations and standing firm as one of 2025’s most impactful smash hits.</p>

<p>The BLAST R6 Munich Major concluded in dramatic fashion in Germany, with M80 devastating Team Falcons with a 3-1 finish during the Grand Final. The victory secured M80 a massive $250,000 cut of the prize pool <strong>and </strong>direct qualification for next year’s Six Invitational tournament, the biggest event in Rainbow Six esports.</p>



<p>M80 commanded control of the final fixture, with Team Falcons firing back on just one map, and even that was a close finish that went down to the final round as a decider.</p>



<h2 id="h-m80-secures-top-spot-in-munich">M80 Secures Top Spot in Munich</h2>



<p>This is a monumental moment for North America as M80 stands up and collects a Major trophy in the Rainbow Six Siege esports scene. Team Falcons put up one hell of a fight and had a stellar run, but M80 proved to be the rock that broke open the hull of Falcons.</p>



<p>M80 has ticked a major box and qualified for the Six Invitational, which is the most important event in the Rainbow Six space. The Six Invitational will be held in Paris, France, and it will feature a multi-million-dollar prize pool.</p>



<p>This is now an even more insane record for M80’s Fabian ‘<strong>Fabian</strong>‘ Hällsten, a 31-year-old competitor-turned-coach who has achieved a stunning number of accolades in his many years in the Rainbow Six space:</p>



<ul>
<li>Six Invitational 2018</li>



<li>Six Invitational 2019</li>



<li>Six Invitational 2023</li>



<li>Dreamhack Winter 2018</li>



<li>Pro League Year 2 Season 1</li>



<li>Pro League Year 2 Season 2</li>



<li>Six Major Paris 2018</li>



<li>South Korean League 2024</li>



<li>North American League 2025</li>



<li><strong>Munich Major 2025</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>In 2023, Fabian also coached G2 Esports to success at the Six Invitational, but in 2025, a drastically poor finish left the veteran so far down the leaderboard, he might as well have not bothered attending the tournament.</p>



<p>Will 2026 bring about a redemption tale for Fabian? It also has the potential for M80 to give it a solid run and end up higher than ever before, a seventh-place finish.</p>



<p>I had the pleasure of attending the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in 2024, when the M80 crew, then playing under the beastcoast banner, beat BTS in a dramatic grand final that blew the roof off the venue. This event told a similar story.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-just-hit-another-all-time-high-even-as-black-ops-7-and-tarkov-launch.1355245/</guid>

<p>ARC Raiders, the exhilarating extraction shooter from Embark Studios, is still going from strength to strength. Today, the title hit a new all-time high player count on Steam, pushing ever higher and continuing to hold a solid bar for the genre. As time goes on, ARC Raiders is only getting stronger, even with the arrival of Black Ops 7 <strong>and </strong>Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Not only that, but ARC Raiders maintains a phenomenal track record in terms of user ratings, boasting a score of 88% on Steam from more than 100,000 reviews.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-won-t-slow-down">ARC Raiders Won’t Slow Down</h2>



<p>There’s no stopping ARC Raiders. It was thought that the 1.0 launch of Escape from Tarkov might halt ARC Raiders where it stands, but even that wasn’t enough to pull hundreds of thousands of players out of Embark’s all-new extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the game recorded a peak player count of 481,966 users, a new high and a stunning figure for any extraction shooter. By numbers, ARC Raiders is the most popular and successful extraction shooter ever made, and it’s <strong>dominating </strong>the genre.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As this article was written, ARC Raiders was the third-most popular game on Steam, beaten only by Valve’s titans, Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2. It has topped Call of Duty, Battlefield 6, Marvel Rivals, PUBG, and Where Winds Meet this weekend with ease. </p>







<p>There’s plenty in the pipeline for ARC Raiders. Embark Studios has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">promised a hefty roadmap</a> for the title, which already covers November and December. Next month, we’ll get the Cold Snap update, which brings new map conditions, a new legendary weapon, a fresh Raider Deck, and <strong>much more</strong>.</p>
