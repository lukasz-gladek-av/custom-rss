<p>The First Berserker: Khazan, the souls-like game from Nexon, has had its release date leaked by the reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-et-de-nouvelles-informations-sur-le-jeu-the-first-berserker-khazan-59763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>.</p>



<p>According to the leaker, the game will be released on March 27, 2025. He also said that the official announcement will be made tomorrow at The Game Awards 2024. Pre-orders will start immediately after the event.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the game will be sold 10 dollars lower than usual, going for U$60. I had the opportunity to test a closed beta of the game and I had the impression that the title was ready for release.</p>



<p>During my playthrough, all I got was the feeling that it needs some slight balancing adjustments, given that some enemies can destroy the protagonist with two hits. The bosses, even the initial ones, were extremely challenging, and I’m a veteran of the genre. It’s a similar feeling to the first NiOh, with the first demo on the beach.</p>



<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is set in the DNF universe. As the subtitle suggests, the game stars Khazan, a legendary general who ended up being betrayed by the Empire. The narrative sets the general on a journey of revenge.</p>



<p>The game is scheduled for release on PS5, PC and Xbox Series. Unlike other Nexon games, this title will be single-player focused.</p>

<p>The surprise announcement came courtesy of a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/11/astro-bot-winter-wonder-update-out-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog post</a>.</p>



<p>It reads, “Since releasing&nbsp;Astro Bot&nbsp;earlier this year on PlayStation 5, we have been submerged by lovely comments from you and the PlayStation community, and we are delighted with the critical response to the game all over the world.

<p>Ubisoft has released new combat gameplay for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and has deep-dived into the combat mechanics.</p>



<p>Ubisoft uploaded the gameplay as part of a new Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog update</a>, but YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AssassinRaptor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JorRaptor</a> has compiled all of the clips into one quick YouTube video.</p>

<p>You can read the full blog update on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft website here</a>. </p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shaodws was delayed from its intended November 15 release to February to give its developers time to polish the game. An <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal memo from Yves Guillemot</a> said that the delay was to “to offer an optimal experience from launch on all platforms and various PC configurations, and to remove the small frictions we typically used to address in post-launch title updates.”</p>



<p>Following the delay, Marc-Alexis Côté announced, </p>



<p>“Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a dream project for us; finally bringing the series to Feudal Japan with many features developed with our community in mind, such as parkour or the renewed stealth, brought by new technology, all set in a beautiful and immersive world.”</p>



<p>He continued, “As such, we’ve made the decision to postpone the release date to February 14, 2025. The game will be released on a broad range of platforms, including Steam at launch. Additionally, preorders will be refunded and all future preorders will be granted the first expansion for free.”</p>



<p>At the time of the delay, it’s understood that Assassin’s Creed Shadows pre-orders were strong, but behind that of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla which also release on past-generation consoles and thus, had a large market to release to.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches February 14, 2024 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>
