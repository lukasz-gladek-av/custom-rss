<p>The most expensive Counter-Strike skins ever have some massive price tags associated with them. Since the introduction of in-game cosmetics to CS:GO year ago, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-cs2-skin-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">value of this skin economy</a> has steadily grown, thanks to factors like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gambling</a> and the 2023 announcement of Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<p>The Counter-Strike skin economy is so large that it’s not contained to just the official Steam community market. Dozens of sites allow players to buy and sell skins. A few uniquely rare skins have fetched a very pretty penny, but one holds the record for selling for the most amount of money.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-most-expensive-cs-go-skin-ever-sold">The Most Expensive CS:GO Skin Ever Sold</h2>



<p>The most expensive purchase of a CS:GO skin ever occurred in April 2023, just a few weeks after Valve announced CS2. This announcement caused a spike in both renewed interest in the franchise as well as skin prices, leading to what appears to be the biggest purchase ever.</p>



<p>ZipeLCS, a long-time skin trader and co-owner of the Danish organization ECSTATIC, <a href="https://x.com/zipelCS/status/1647582159245385729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that they had sold <strong>a StatTrak Case Hardened “Blue Gem” AK-47 with four Katowice 2014 Titan Holo stickers for roughly $400,000.</strong> The transaction also included a Case Hardened “Blue Gem” Karambit knife that sold for an additional $100,000, roughly.</p>



<p>But what makes this AK valued at around $400,000?</p>



<ul>
<li>Case Hardened skins are more valuable if there’s more blue. The Case Hardened AK above features a “Blue Gem” 661 pattern, which gives it an incredibly rare shiny blue pattern.</li>



<li>It’s in Minimal Wear condition (second best next to Factory New).</li>



<li>The four Katowice 2014 Titan Holo stickers, the <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/top-20-most-expensive-csgo-stickers-in-history-1361385/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most rare and expensive Counter-Strike stickers</a>, were valued at roughly $60,000 each.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-the-most-expensive-cs2-skin-ever-sold">The Most Expensive CS2 Skin Ever Sold</h2>



<p>Just this past year, <strong>a StatTrak Case Hardened Factory New AK-47 with the 661 pattern was <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/counter-strike-2s-most-expensive-skin-sells-for-jaw-dropping-1-million-2762918/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> sold for more than $1 million</strong>, according to Dexerto. The seller claims to have rejected “multiple” offers at $1 million, placing the exact buy amount at somewhere between $1 million and $1.5 million.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While this AK appears to be the most expensive skin ever sold, it’s not the highest price ever listed for a skin. <strong>One player <a href="https://afkgaming.com/csgo/news/extremely-rare-csgo-knife-allegedly-costs-more-than-12-million-euros" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered to pay $1.5 million</a> in Bitcoin for a one-of-a-kind Factory New Case Hardened “Blue Gem” Karambit knife</strong>. For context, the one that sold for $100,000 above was Well-Worn. However, the owner of the skin was “not interested” and said that the offer was too low.</p>



<p>What’s the most you’d ever spend on a skin? And will the one-of-a-kind Factory New Case Hardened “Blue Gem” Karambit skin ever be sold?
