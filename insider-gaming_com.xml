<p>It has been revealed that Firing Range is returning to Call of Duty when Season 03 launches in Black Ops 6 on April 2. The map has been remastered by Treyarch, which was revealed earlier today on social media. This is the first time the map has been seen in a main multiplayer title since Black Ops 4 in 2018.</p>



<p>Home on the range, indeed.</p>

<h2 id="h-stacked-update">Stacked Update</h2>



<p>Season 03 is set to be one of the most impressive updates in modern Call of Duty history. It will see the return of Verdansk for the first time since 2021, when it was abruptly stripped from Warzone in favour of Caldera. The reappearance of Verdansk is expected to bring back millions of players, many of whom haven’t played Warzone since the map was taken out of the game.</p>



<p>Additionally, Activision’s teams have worked to bring back to life several fan-favourite weapons, such as the Kilo 141, AMAX, and HDR sniper rifle. There will be plenty to get your teeth into on April 2nd, which is when Season 03 goes live in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Treyarch has also revealed that Firing Range will return to Call of Duty on April 2. The remastered map represents one of the most iconic battlegrounds in Call of Duty history. It was a map that first appeared in Black Ops in 2010, and way back then, it was one of the most adored maps in the rotation. </p>











<p>There is plenty in store for Season 03 and beyond, and for once, it seems like Call of Duty is well and truly on the up. Are you excited about the return of Verdansk or Firing Range? Let me know in the comments.</p>
