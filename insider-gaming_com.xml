            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a blog post on Dying Light’s Pilgrim Outpost, Tymon Smektala, the franchise director at Techland, has expanded on everything coming to Dying Light: The Beast. The Techland veteran explained about the Call of the Beast challenge path, the New Game+ mechanics coming soon, and the new ‘Nightmare Mode’ that’s being added in the future.</p>



<p>In Tymon’s words, some elements of Nightmare Difficulty have been inspired by other games, namely Alien: Isolation and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-is-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving">Dying Light: The Beast is the Gift That Keeps on Giving</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a phenomenal open-world zombie game with plenty of meat on the bones, despite being born as a DLC for Dying Light 2: Stay Human. In a post on the Pilgrim Outpost, Tymon Smektala explained about everything else that’s in store for The Beast.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-11-week-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the post</a> references Legend Levels, the Ray Tracing update for PC, and the collaboration with PUBG Mobile, one of the juiciest tidbits came from the discussion about Nightmare Mode.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re currently looking into each of our bosses to see how we can adjust their behaviors to make them more unpredictable. On top of that we’re also considering some neat tweaks to our Volatile enemies – these are just intentions, so I don’t want to promise too much, but we’re looking at games like Alien: Isolation or Resident Evil 3: Nemesis for inspiration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Nightmare Mode loop will be introduced <strong>after </strong>New Game+ and the Legend Levels update, and it’ll be more of an intelligent update than just making enemies stronger. That’s what Tymon has promised, anyway.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yes, enemies will do more damage and the game more demanding, but that isn’t the point on its own. We’d like to try a more realistic survival loop – so expect some new mechanics in that regard.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast players can participate in an ongoing challenge path that will run into 2026. Through this, users can unlock exclusive rewards for taking part in community challenges, the first of which required the player base to rack up 60 million sliced off limbs.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-responds-emiru/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-responds-to-emiru-assault-%E2%80%98we-failed%E2%80%99.1334749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, clips surfaced on social media showing Emiru, a popular streamer and cosplayer, being forcefully assaulted by a man at TwitchCon in San Diego. The content creator was approached by a man who grabbed her in an embrace and seemed to try to kiss her. In the clips that emerged, we saw a woeful response from event security, and in the days that followed, Twitch failed to address the incident.</p>



<p>Now, in a lengthy post, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has written about the incident involving Emiru and has stressed what is being done to improve things moving forward.</p>



<h2 id="h-it-means-a-lot-to-us">‘It Means a Lot to Us’</h2>



<p>Dan Clancy’s <a href="https://x.com/Twitch/status/1981825064904667169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response</a> to the Emiru assault situation was lengthy, but fans and other creators have already batted the statement down and attempted to kick back the ‘apology’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>First, I want to be upfront and take accountability for the security incident that occurred during Emiru’s Meet and Greet. It shouldn’t have happened and we take that very seriously. We failed, both in allowing it to occur, and in our response following. We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made. I apologize to Emiru for all that took place. </p>



<p>What are we doing moving forward? For Meet and Greets, we’ve begun a complete analysis of the incident that took place, as well as other issues that came to our attention after TwitchCon concluded. We’re examining everything, from how we do sign ups, to the layout, to increased security controls. </p>



<p>We’re also doing a comprehensive review of overall event safety and security, and will be making updates for future TwitchCons. While we won’t be sharing all security updates for privacy and safety reasons, we will keep our community informed about changes that directly impact attendees. </p>



<p>We have heard concerns about IRL streaming at TwitchCon. Twitch has evolved over the years, and IRL streaming is a part of Twitch. But, we need to ensure that TwitchCon meets the needs of a variety of participants. We will be reviewing how we handle IRL streaming at TwitchCon, and will have more to share soon. </p>



<p>Finally, we got clear feedback on accessibility across the event. We’re reviewing with our teams, including our production and venue staff, so that we’re better equipped for future events. </p>



<p>You put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon, and we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously. We know that TwitchCon means a lot to a lot of people, and it means a lot to us. Be on the lookout for more updates, and thanks for being a part of Twitch. </p>



<p>– Dan Clancy</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Users were quick to jump on Dan Clancy’s comments under the post on X (formerly Twitter), with some pointing out how much of a holistic failure TwitchCon was (and will likely continue to be).</p>



<p>One streamer wrote, ‘I must pathetically claim that I am EMBARRASSED to be a Twitch streamer.’ Another was quick to point out similar failings from Twitch: ‘And you’re only saying this because Emi’s a big streamer and there are a lot of eyes on this. How many smaller streamers have dealt with similar or worse but have had their complaints swept under the rug?’</p>



<p>Do you think Twitch needs to do better, or is this par for the course for the platform? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the run-up to the release of Black Ops 7, a point of contention for the community is around the innovation (or lack of) tied to Call of Duty: Warzone. The battle royale platform that was released in March 2020 has started to stagnate yet again, and fans are dropping off for alternate experiences, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6 ‘RedSec’ battle royale release.</p>



<p>In a recent blog and <a href="https://x.com/RavenSoftware/status/1981852213581381882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a>, Raven Software acknowledged that Warzone’s Resurgence experience is becoming stale and recognized that the Rebirth Island map is in dire need of a revitalization.</p>



<h2 id="h-too-little-too-late">Too Little, Too Late</h2>



<p>Many Warzone creators and diehard fans have stressed that Raven Software is making changes far too late, especially as the first season of Black Ops 7 will bring a new small-form Warzone map – <strong>Haven’s Hollow</strong>.</p>



<p>In any case, the team at Raven is desperate to refresh the Rebirth experience by tidying up the map:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve heard you loud and clear – Rebirth Island and the broader Resurgence experience have started to feel a bit stale.</p>



<p>So, to start, we’re delivering a full refresh to Rebirth Island in Season 02, which includes new POI updates, a cosmetic pass, and several other upgrades that improve flow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the launch of Haven’s Hollow, Raven Software will reintroduce a map rotation system, switching between Haven’s Hollow and Rebirth Island to keep things ‘fresh’.</p>



<p>It was promised that, in the coming weeks, a ‘deep dive on how (they) intend to deliver a higher frequency of updates’ will take place. It was confirmed that Warzone will receive balancing changes to alter the meta <strong>twice per season</strong>, and that from season two onwards, the competitive community will receive updated Ranked and Private Match mechanics.</p>



<p>All this will come before or during the launch of Avalon, the new Blackout-themed Warzone map landing during season two, several weeks after the launch of Black Ops 7 on November 14.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-playstation-exec-slams-live-service-games-repetitive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-playstation-exec-slams-live-service-games-%E2%80%98it%E2%80%99s-a-repetitive-action-engagement-device%E2%80%99.1334740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden went in against the company’s pivot to focusing on live-service games, which has yet to pay off. For several years, PlayStation’s studios have tried to produce a solid live-service game, but have mostly failed in their quest to do so.</p>



<p>Layden, who departed PlayStation in 2019 due to the creative direction the company was taking, recently criticized the live-service market, explaining how, in his eyes, live-service titles <strong>aren’t real games</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-again-and-again-and-again">Again and Again and Again</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/10/24/video-games/sony-playstation-online-multiplayer-live-service-struggles-concord-marathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Ringer</a>, a variety of indutstry names gave their two cents to answer the question, ‘Why can’t Sony make more multiplayer hits?’</p>



<p>One such name was Shawn Layden, a former PlayStation executive who was at the company for just short of a decade, who has fired shots at the live-service mission on PlayStation’s slate.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A live-service game to me isn’t really a game. It’s a repetitive action engagement device.</p>



<p>For me, a game—because of where I come from—means I need three things. I need a story, I need a character, and I need a world. And&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>,&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>&nbsp;have all three of those things. </p>



<p>If you’re doing a live-service game, you just need a repetitive action that most people can get their head around, an ability to communicate in that world with other like-minded people, and the player’s desire to do it again and again and again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Layden went on to stress that every developer successful in the live-service space found the winning formula ‘five, six years ago’. There was a boom of sorts that saw games like Fortnite skyrocket in popularity, and since then, everyone with a multiplayer offering seems to have jumped on the seasonal operating model.</p>



<p>These days, it’s very rare to succeed with a new live-service game, Layden insists:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s like a mirage on the top of a sand dune. You pursue it. You can’t quite get there. Or if you do get there, what you brought to the party no one wants to play anyway.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think live-service games should be abandoned by developers in favor of an alternate operating model? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During the Halo World Championship event, the future of the Halo series was uncovered, including the imminent arrival of Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5. This marks a milestone moment, as it’s the first time in history that a Halo title has wound up on a PlayStation platform.</p>



<p>Those who have potentially never played a Halo game because of their platform of choice are now preparing to dive into the sci-fi shooter series. That’s all well and good, but when is Halo: Campaign Evolved coming to PS5?</p>



<p>Let’s find out about the release window.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-out">When is Halo: Campaign Evolved Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Halo is a legendary series that has been the face of Xbox for more than two decades. The franchise has been expanded over the years with a live-action television series, books, animated projects, and, of course, a hulking stack of major and minor games.</p>



<p>Next year, Halo will come to PlayStation for the first time. This was addressed by the PS team in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent blog post</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For nearly 25 years, Halo has offered players an epic sci-fi universe to explore, unforgettable characters to meet, and exhilarating gameplay to experience together. From large-scale battles to friendships formed over late-night co-op sessions, Halo has always been more than just a game – it’s about the players who’ve made it part of their lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the beginning, we wanted to build a world with stories and experiences that bring people together. And now, for the first time, PS5 players will get to be part of that journey too.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, there isn’t a release date for Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5, Xbox, or PC</strong>. It can be wishlisted on all these platforms, but aside from a window of ‘2026’, there are no further indications as to when Halo: Campaign Evolved will be released.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The worst level in Halo: Combat Evolved is getting some much-needed changes in Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p>



<p>Announced at the Halo World Championships,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>&nbsp;remakes the 2001 classic Halo: Combat Evolved. The game will tell the original story of Master Chief and Cortana beating the Covenant and saving the universe. As a campaign-only title, the game is set to release in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and, for the first time ever,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>. With excitement about the gameplay alive and well, the team told Xbox Wire about a change to the controversial Library level.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved-is-changing-the-library-level-developers-confirm">Halo: Campaign Evolved is Changing The Library Level, Developers Confirm</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">a blog post from Xbox Wire</a>, members of Halo: Campaign Evolved’s development team spoke on the remake. Max Szlagor, the game’s Creative Director, talked about changes being made to certain levels that weren’t done for the Anniversary Edition. Chief among them was the dreaded Library level. Speaking on it, Szlagor said,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We learned from&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</em>&nbsp;that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters,” Szlagor states <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">in the blog</a>. “In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We’ve added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there’s new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out. We’re not changing the stories, it’s about refining and adding context to this moment, and other levels like it, so players can stay on track.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you played Halo: Combat Evolved, you know how annoying The Library level is. Countless droves of The Flood and horrible level design made it a challenging chore. Fortunately, new fans, like those on PlayStation, won’t have to suffer much. Plus, with new dialogue for Guilty Spark, the intriguing lore will get the justice it deserves. From developer comments, a lot of changes are in the works for the game, so returning players will have new content to look forward to.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see The Library getting changes for Halo: Campaign Evolved? What are your feelings about the level? Will you be getting the remake?
