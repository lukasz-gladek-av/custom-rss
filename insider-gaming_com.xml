            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 RedSec Battle Royale will only be available in Duos and Squads at launch, one insider claims. Once known as Firestorm, we reported that it has changed its name to RedSec and will be shadow dropping on October 28th.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, another story has emerged that may confirm a pretty interesting addition to the mode. While nothing is yet confirmed, the leaker in question has leaked many details about the upcoming mode, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the name</a> and mode itself.</p>



<h2 id="h-duos-and-squads-are-only-team-options-for-battlefield-6-redsec-claims-insider">Duos and Squads Are Only Team Options for Battlefield 6 RedSec, Claims Insider</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>ðŸš¨ BF6 BR LAUNCH PLAYLIST ðŸš¨</p><p>EXCLUSIVE: Duos (2) and Squads (4) is currently planned to be the ONLY team sizes available at launch for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale / RedSec.</p><p>So with 100 player count max thats a total of 25 teams of 4 or 50 teams of 2 in every match of RedSec <a href="https://t.co/Uy2D7vlCUh">pic.twitter.com/Uy2D7vlCUh</a></p></div>â€” ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?t=p0lnGa3QMgZbPQs634JShw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>, which we reported on yesterday for the name RedSec, they claim that Battlefield 6â€™s battle royale mode will only be available in Duos and Squads. That means only groups of two and groups of four will be the only formations playable. Fortunately, the insider claims it will only be for launch, so future builds may expand that number. As they point out, the 100 player count could be made of 50 teams of two and/or 25 teams of four.</p>



<p>With 100 players, itâ€™s sure to be quite the spectacle. The popularity of EAâ€™s military shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has only grown</a> since its release earlier in October. While the surprise shadow drop isnâ€™t going to be exactly how they may have planned it, itâ€™s no doubt going to hit big. Other titles like Fortnite and Call of Duty have done the genre, so itâ€™s natural that Battlefield is going there. Still, it may be a bit disappointing for some who wish to go in by themselves or with a group of five or more.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Duos/Squads matching in Battlefield 6: RedSec? Do you think itâ€™s true? If so, have you already decided who youâ€™ll venture out with?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new mode for Marvel Rivals has caused a major player spike on Steam, its highest in a while.</p>



<p>Released in December 2024, the free-to-play multiplayer superhero shooter has been going steady. With the release of Season 4, which added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-daredevils-duelist-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daredevil</a> and Angela, the game has seen a decent, stable player base. While not as high as when its first season dropped, touting a 644,269 player count, it still ranks as one of the most popular games on Steam. In any case, earlier this week, the numbers rose quite a bit, heading into numbers only seen for the beginning of a season. Well, a new mode, one fans have been asking for for quite a while, has been added.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-pve-marvel-zombies-mode-almost-doubles-marvel-rivals-usual-player-count">New PvE Marvel Zombies Mode Almost Doubles Marvel Rivalsâ€™ Usual Player Count</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#1w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, earlier this week, Marvel Rivals kept at a usual 75k-80k player count, decreasing from the start of Season 4.5 with Daredevil. However, on October 23rd, the game spiked into the high 120k, almost double what it was the previous day. It continued into yesterday and today. The reason? The addition of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-pve-zombies-mode-arrives-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Zombies PvE mode</a> lets players fight against AI enemies. Based on the comic and new animated series, the limited-time Halloween-based mode brings it to life with droves of zombies and perilous fights with friends. </p>



<p>A quick look at Reddit supports the rise quite well, as many fans have praised the mode a ton. Some, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1oeqvfe/holy_fucking_shit_is_the_marvel_zombies_game_mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Living-Ad102</a>, want it to be a permanent addition to the game. Given that PvE has been asked for since the gameâ€™s release, the massive spike isnâ€™t too surprising. If anything, itâ€™s clear that NetEase may want to do more of these events. Either way, if you want in on the fun, best to do it before mid-November while Marvel Zombies lasts. </p>



<p>Have you played the Marvel Zombies mode in Marvel Rivals yet? If so, how is it? Would you like to see PvE added permanently to the base game? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-26-868/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-868-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-sunday-october-26.1334977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Itâ€™s a sleepy Sunday, but itâ€™s also time to wrap up your week with another round of NYT Connections hints and solutions. Todayâ€™s puzzle will be easy for some, including <strong>boxing fans</strong>, but Iâ€™ve still provided the best hints around so that you can get things finished as fast as possible, then get on with the rest of your weekend.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full scope of todayâ€™s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into todayâ€™s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and itâ€™s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Itâ€™s relatively simple, and thatâ€™s why itâ€™s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>Itâ€™s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. Thatâ€™s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>Whatâ€™s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as itâ€™ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-26">Todayâ€™s NYT Connections Hints (October 26)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out todayâ€™s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, Iâ€™ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and youâ€™ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from todayâ€™s puzzle, #868:</p>



<ul>
<li>BEE</li>



<li>BUTTERFLY</li>



<li>FLOAT</li>



<li>STING</li>



<li>BRASS</li>



<li>PERCUSSION</li>



<li>STRING</li>



<li>WIND</li>



<li>BEAUTY</li>



<li>POPULARITY</li>



<li>STARING</li>



<li>TALENT</li>



<li>DOGGY</li>



<li>DROPLET</li>



<li>KITCHENETTE</li>



<li>STARLING</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for todayâ€™s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>â€“ <em>Think orchestra sections! These are categories of musical instruments</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> â€“ <em>These all describe creatures or actions associated with light movement or flight</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> â€“ <em>These words relate to qualities often judged or admired in people or performances</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> â€“ <em>This group plays with diminutives or cozy-sounding words</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Hereâ€™s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 26.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-26-868">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 26 (#868)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for todayâ€™s NYT Connections puzzle, Iâ€™ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>â€“ BRASS, PERCUSSION, STRING, WIND</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> â€“ BEE, BUTTERFLY, FLOAT, STING</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> â€“ BEAUTY, POPULARITY, STARING, TALENT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> â€“ DOGGY, DROPLET, KITCHENETTE, STARLING</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>Thatâ€™s todayâ€™s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (thatâ€™s <strong>your </strong>local time). Youâ€™ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
