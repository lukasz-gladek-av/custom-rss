<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins is out, which means its Metacritic score is available. The hack-and-slash franchise has nearly 30 years of developing and publishing mileage on the clock, so let’s see if Origins has managed to land its biggest killing blow yet. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dynasty-warriors-cancelled-before-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynasty Warriors 10 was canceled</a> before it was ever shown to the public. Instead, we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynasty Warriors Origins</a>, one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-biggest-video-game-releases-of-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January 2025’s hottest games</a>. Origins features an unbelievable amount of soldiers on screen and more of the classic action that’s helped the series to ship over 20 million copies and counting.</p>



<p>As with any game’s release, reviews are everything. In today’s social-media-heavy society, review embargos are paramount. Everyone is desperate to know how a new title is received by critics, helping to sway people in their decision to buy it. Dynasty Warriors Origins’ reviews are out, so let’s dive into its final scores.</p>







<figure><figcaption>A beautiful blood-letting battle. Credit to Omega Force</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins has a score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic.</strong></p>



<p>Individually, Origin rates <strong>85 out of 100 for PC</strong> based on 18 reviews, <strong>80 on PS5</strong> using 48 reviews, and <strong>78 on Xbox</strong>—taking into account 10 reviews.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dynasty-warriors-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Origins’ Metacritic page</a> is the source for all the information we’ve collated. I find the best way to aggregate a game is the review score with the most quantitative verdicts, and in this case, it’s the <strong>PlayStation 5’s 80/100 score</strong>.</p>



<p>The Xbox’s number is only based on 10 reviews, so it’s hard to gauge this figure properly. A score of 80 out of 100 is a very good result for Dynasty Warriors—but more on this later.</p>



<h2 id="h-dynasty-warriors-origins-opencritic-score-explained">Dynasty Warriors Origins Opencritic Score Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins has a combined score of 82 out of 100—based on 62 reviews—on OpenCritic, with an “80% Critics Recommend” percentage.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17485/dynasty-warriors-origins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpenCritic</a> considers more reviewers than Metacritic and is considered to be a more versatile source of reviews and opinions. It also doesn’t split up platforms and takes the best from each format for one averaged-out rating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-dynasty-warriors-origins-reviews-compare">How Do Dynasty Warriors Origins Reviews Compare?</h2>



<p><strong>Dynasty Warriors Origins is the highest-rated game in the franchise’s history!</strong></p>



<p>Using Metacritic, and without historical data for 1997’s very first Dynasty Warriors, I can tell you Origins’ main Metacritic score of 80 out of 100 is a record high. Dynasty Warriors 3 and 4 are the closest competitors with a rating of 78 out of 100—so congratulations to Dynasty Warriors Origins for being the best yet.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at how every other DW title compares to Origins from a Metacritic standpoint.</p>

<p>According to a new leak, players will be able to transform into Godzilla in Fortnite thanks to a new mythic coming this Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-godzilla-mythic-giant-transformation-beam-stomp-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TheGamer</a>, reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1879121165522026773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a> has revealed that Fortnite is receiving a Godzilla transformation mythic this Friday, January 17. The new mythic will allow players to transform into Giant Godzillas and wreak havoc across the islands with their monstrous abilities. When transformed, players can use skills like Beam, Stomp, Roar, and more. Additionally, a “throw banana” ability has been spotted in the files, which is believed to be a Kong mythic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Godzilla descended onto Fortnite Island yesterday, marking the start of the Godzilla X Kong collaboration. We have already seen the Japanese kaiju make an appearance on the island, and it’s just a matter of time before King Kong from Skull Island shows up, too. If the Kong mythic does show up, there will be some interesting Godzilla vs Kong matchups that players can experience this season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talking about Fortnite and Godzilla, another <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1879115290157404348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leak</a> by HYPEX has revealed that Mechagodzilla has been confirmed for the game, too. The shop text description for this item stated, “B.E.A.S.T. Glove Emote utilizes different sounds when equipped with Mechagodzilla or Godzilla.”&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/segas-new-trademark-could-be-the-secret-game-at-xbox-developer-direct/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>SEGA’s trademarks for “Ecco the Dolphin” and “Ecco” went public today, and players believe this could be the surprise game at the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i0onuf/sega_has_filled_a_new_trademark_for_ecco_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, a post on X by <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1878873951344185652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> revealed that on December 27, 2024, SEGA filed trademarks for “Ecco the Dolphin” and “Ecco” in Japan, and this information was made public today. Players believe that this could be the secret game at Xbox Developer Direct as it matches the description of being an iconic Japanese IP with a lot of history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days ago, Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that a Developer Direct is scheduled for January 23, 2025, during which they will reveal more details about South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, DOOM: The Dark Ages, and a secret game. Right after the announcement, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-to-get-a-new-game-from-legendary-japanese-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> claimed that the secret title would be “a new entry in a legendary Japanese IP which has decades of history. ” Players speculate that this IP is none other than Ecco the Dolphin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecco the Dolphin is a video game series created by Ed Annunziata for the Sega Genesis console. In this game, you play the role of a bottlenose dolphin called Ecco, who is searching the vast ocean for his missing pod. The series received several instalments until 2000, including Ecco: The Tides of Time, Ecco Jr., and more. However, the franchise has been dormant since then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see if SEGA’s new trademark is indeed Xbox’s secret title. However, we will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a recent report stated that Sega could be working <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-subscription-service-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a new game subscription service</a>. Also, two Xbox exclusives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a>. What are your thoughts on SEGA’s new trademark? Is it Xbox’s secret title?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
