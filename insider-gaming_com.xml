<p>Reigns: The Witcher by Nerial and Devolver Digital releases for iOS, Android, Mac, and PC on February 25, 2026. </p>



<p>In recent days, we have been hearing a lot about the current and upcoming instalments of The Witcher series, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured expansion</a> for The Witcher 3 and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-could-spend-up-to-800-million-on-the-witcher-4-its-estimated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development and marketing budgets</a> for The Witcher 4. However, today we aren’t talking about any of these titles, but a spinoff within a choice-based title, Reigns. </p>







<h2 id="h-reigns-the-witcher-release-date-set-for-february-2026">Reigns: The Witcher Release Date Set for February 2026</h2>



<p>Nerial and Devolver Digital have teamed up with CD Projekt Red to introduce a new spinoff titled Reigns: The Witcher, as announced in the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9it7oMf0l00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a>. This game will incorporate Reigns’ signature decision-driven gameplay into The Witcher universe, featuring Geralt of Rivia as he navigates the ballads of Dandelion. Players will have the opportunity to explore a unique narrative experience, making choices that may involve running a hot bath instead of slaying monsters.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game will also feature beloved characters from the series, including Yennefer, Triss, and Vesemir. Players can look forward to numerous combat mini-games, where Geralt will face off against familiar foes such as ghouls and rotfiends. Ultimately, the decisions made throughout the game will have significant consequences; a wrong choice could provoke the mages, while the right choice could earn you respect among the nobles.</p>

In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scott-pilgrim-ex-hands-on-preview-pure-chaos-and-co-op-delight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, it was described as “a passion project for Tribute Games, and every pixel of the animation radiates that love.” Now, we have a release date for this project. </p>

<p>Scott Pilgrim EX takes place in Toronto 20XX, where the city is under the control of three rival gangs, VEGANS, the ROBOTS, and the DEMONS. It features a brand new story, written by series creator Bryan Lee O’Malley, and you get to play as seven characters that can be powered up and customised through coins. The game focuses on creative combos, wacky weapons, and environmental combat, and what’s more, you can bring in 3 more friends through local or online co-op. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There is no shortage of games demanding your attention in 2026, with a string of major titles landing onto the scene, and there are also games like Mewgenics that are worth keeping an eye out.</p>



<p>Mewgenics is a new title from Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, the former of whom is the mastermind behind The Binding of Isaac, and it has already built up a following on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> ahead of release, with over 20,000 followers.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Mewgenics release date and the exact start time, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-mewgenics-release-date">What is The Mewgenics Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Kitty. Image via Edmund McMillen/Tyler Glaiel</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mewgenics has an official release date of February 10, 2026, though this date may be impacted based on where you are located in the world.</strong></p>



<p>For the majority of players, Mewgenics will be playable on the above date, but players in some regions will have to wait until the early hours of the following morning.</p>



<p>This is due to Mewgenics having a global release structure, which is standard practice for Steam, and not a staggered release like players usually experience on consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-mewgenics-release">What Time Does Mewgenics Release?</h2>



<p><strong>Mewgenics</strong> <strong>will be released at 9 AM PT on February 10, with a later release time for other regions in the United States.</strong></p>



<p>Those in Europe will have to wait until later in the day to jump in and enjoy Mewgenics, while those in Asia and Oceania face a late night waiting up until the early hours of the morning for the release. Details of the release time come via SteamDB.</p>



<p>Players on console won’t be able to join the fun, as Mewgenics launches on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> only, so there are no variations in release time with different platforms.</p>



<p>The table below highlights the release time of Mewgenics in major regions across the world, so you can work out exactly how much longer you need to wait.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Feb. 10</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">11 AM – Feb. 10</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM – Feb. 10</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Feb. 10</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 AM – Feb. 11</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[NetEase Holds Layoffs At Montreal Studio With More Possible]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netease-layoffs-montreal-studio-more-possible/</link>
            <guid>1418509</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>NetEase is cutting jobs again. While not officially announced by the Chinese company, a number of employees have taken to social media in recent days to confirm the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a> at NetEase Montreal.</p>



<p>Right now, the only known employees to be impacted are on the QA staff.</p>







<p><strong>“Last week I was impacted by the layoffs at NetEase and my time with them has come to an end,”</strong> one former QA Project Manager said on LinkedIn. <strong>“It was a great experience and I’m thankful I was able to grow as I did.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Said another, <strong>“Unfortunately I have been affected by another round of layoffs, and my time at NetEase Games has come to an end.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out multiple times to NetEase for additional context on the scale of the layoffs. As of writing, however, no response has been received.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-netease-cuts-could-be-coming">More NetEase Cuts Could Be Coming</h2>



<p>While the NetEase Montreal layoffs are the ones known to be happening recently, it’s not a guarantee that more aren’t on the way. In recent months, Insider Gaming has been speaking with a number of sources around NetEase that have expressed worry and concern over the future.</p>







<p>NetEase has publicly said they would continue to support studios after a number of layoffs in 2025. However, sources say that the company is continuing to look at divesting from its Western studios. There is an increased desire to invest money domestically due to the recent success of Chinese-developed games like Wuchang: Fallen Feathers and Black Myth: Wukong. </p>



<p>That would see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-laid-off-as-netease-guts-entire-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio layoffs</a>, sales, and, potentially, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/another-netease-studio-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closures</a>. Insider Gaming has learned of two studios that NetEase is having talks about, including one that is working on a popular IP. Those who spoke on one of the studios said that “everything is on the table” with its overseas studios.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Half Sword on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/half-sword-playstation-xbox-nintendo-all-platforms/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re looking for a gruesome, gritty, and otherwise grim, yet hilarious, medieval combat game, this is what you need. Half Sword has a big following already, and its platform availability across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch devices could be a finishing blow.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/half-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half Sword</a> has more than just swords—full ones too! There’s a wide array of weaponry to slice and dice opponents in this crazy and entertaining physics-based combat title. Its uniqueness and identity should make it a standout indie hit, but let’s see if it’s relegated to just PC, and not other platforms.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-half-sword-on-ps5">Can You Play Half Sword On PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>En Garde. Credit to Half Sword Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Half Sword will not be making its bow on PlayStation 5 consoles at launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you want to violently spar with your friends, you’ll have to use another physics-based game for now, like Gang Beasts or Stick Fight. It’s been confirmed that PS5 (or PlayStation 4) will not be a launch platform for Half Sword, and this is heartbreaking (and stabbing).</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-half-sword-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Half Sword On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One launch for Half Sword.</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft users will feel the pain of PlayStation players. Half Sword made thousands of wishlists and most-wanted lists going into 2026, and its release date, and it might be a wishlist option for you Xbox owners in the future. For now, your sword will have to remain sheathed and your thirst for blood unsatiated.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-half-sword-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Half Sword On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Whether you own a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2, you can’t play Half Sword right away, as it’s not coming to any Nintendo platform on January 30.</strong></p>



<p>Half Sword is a game that looks like a perfect fit for all platforms. Alas, this ye old olde medieval combat is and is PC-only at launch. The Switch is usually a haven for indie titles, but not this time.</p>



<p>However, not all is lost for console owners.</p>



<h2 id="h-half-sword-console-release-date-details">Half Sword Console Release Date Details</h2>



<p><strong>According to the game’s official FAQ, Half Sword is coming to “Consoles later,” meaning a bit of patience is unfortunately required.</strong></p>



<p>The richness of Half Sword’s violence will be coming to consoles later on. Here’s what the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1043854763189600337/1272470349245579396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Intended for PC first. Consoles later. MAC support later if there is enough interest.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not specified WHICH consoles, though. PS5 and Xbox Series X|S owners are likely going to get the chance to buy it, but the jury is out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch (and Switch 2).</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates on Half Sword’s console and platform status later on.</p>



<p>Will you patiently wait for a Half Sword console port? Or would it be a case of FOMO for the early-game hype?
