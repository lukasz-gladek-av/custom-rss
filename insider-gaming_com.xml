            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will be released worldwide on October 29th, coming to Xbox Series, PC, and PlayStation 5 platforms. It’s the next iteration of the series started by Obsidian in 2019, which dropped and was dubbed ‘New Vegas in space’ by many.</p>



<p>In this ever-digital world, it’s always key to know when you can preload games, and the situation with The Outer Worlds 2 is no different. In this snapshot guide, I’ve got the information you need, including the data regarding The Outer Worlds 2’s file size on all platforms.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-you-preload-the-outer-worlds-2">When Can You Preload The Outer Worlds 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Preloads for The Outer Worlds 2 are available now on Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and Xbox on PC. </strong>I’m working to verify if preloads are available on PlayStation and PC via other platforms.</p>



<p>In a post published by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/10/10/the-outer-worlds-2-preload-is-up-on-xbox-its-a-chonky-boi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>, the preload window was confirmed, as were the file sizes for The Outer Worlds 2. Be warned, this is a very hefty game, which might come as a surprise to some.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-file-size-explained">The Outer Worlds 2 File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The preload file size for The Outer Worlds 2 is 79.49 GB on Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X and 77.30 GB on Xbox on PC.</strong> It hasn’t been confirmed how much space the game will occupy on PlayStation 5, but it’s safe to assume it’s around the same mark.</p>



<p>We’ll update this guide once we’ve got that information.</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is a single-player title with open-world elements and plenty of RPG mechanics, but it still comes as a surprise that it’s almost 80 GB on some platforms. That’s a huge installation in any world, especially for a game expected to have a 30 – 40 hour range.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-the-outer-worlds-2">How to Preload The Outer Worlds 2</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to preload The Outer Worlds 2, you can do so by heading to the Xbox Store on console or PC and clicking to preload the game. </strong>While we haven’t verified this yet, it’ll be the same process on PlayStation and other PC platforms like Steam.</p>



<p>If you don’t have Game Pass, you’ll need to purchase the game first. Those with Game Pass Ultimate can preload The Outer Worlds 2 <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord</a> server if you’re excited to play The Outer Worlds 2.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-dropped-to-low-point-in-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/youtube-has-dropped-to-a-low-point-for-the-first-time-%E2%80%98in-years%E2%80%99-as-competition-rises.1321555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent data, it was revealed that YouTube Live is suffering a comedown amid rising competition across the streaming space. In recent years, the likes of Kick.com and TikTok have come for the crowns claimed by YouTube and Twitch, and the video-based titans are starting to feel that pinch.</p>



<p>Steamscharts recently published a report for the Q3 2025 ‘Global Livestreaming Landscape’, and it revealed that quarter-over-quarter, YouTube Live saw a drop of more than 10% in hours watched, falling below the 50% market cap spot ‘for the first time in years’.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-streaming-space-is-becoming-saturated">The Streaming Space is Becoming Saturated</h2>



<p><a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/q3-2025-global-livestreaming-landscape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Streamscharts’ report</a> included coverage of every major and growing minor streaming platform around the world:</p>



<ul>
<li>YouTube</li>



<li>TikTok</li>



<li>Twitch</li>



<li>Kick</li>



<li>SOOP Korea</li>



<li>CHZZK</li>



<li>Rumble</li>



<li>NimoTV</li>
</ul>



<p>The numbers represent a considerable drop in foothold for YouTube Live, which is crumbling under the competition represented by TikTok Live. In recent years, TikTok has become a powerhouse platform for streamers looking to make a buck, with intense monetization features that are just too lucrative for anyone to ignore.</p>



<p>That’s why TikTok Live now makes up 31.4% of the livestreaming market, 4.4% of which is dedicated to gaming, fast becoming one of the cornerstones of the platform that was once made up of teenagers dancing to popular music.</p>



<p>YouTube Live still has a 45% claim over the market, but as Streamscharts wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>YouTube Live remains the top platform but</strong>&nbsp;saw a 10.6% drop in Hours Watched (13.25B) and its share fell below 50% for the first time in years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kick continues to grow, despite constant controversies being raised on the platform. It’s still a site under intense scrutiny, but that hasn’t stopped streamers from flocking to the site as another option for their broadcasts.</p>



<p>Are you surprised that YouTube Live has seen a drop this year? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-realm-verneath-opened-by-slipknot/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-realm-%E2%80%98vernearth%E2%80%99-opened-by-slipknot-member-as-%E2%80%98a-surrealist-experience%E2%80%99.1321543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At the end of October, Vernearth will go live, bringing a Realm to Minecraft players everywhere that bends the rules of time and reality. It is composed of more than 100 million blocks and offers ‘endless opportunities for creation, combat, and exploration,’ allowing users to build, battle or ‘just lose themselves in the atmosphere.’</p>



<p>Oh, and it has been created by M. Shawn ‘Clown’ Crahan, a founding member of Slipknot and lover of Minecraft. It has been stressed that Crahan will be playing alongside fans when the Realm goes live at the end of October.</p>



<h2 id="h-enter-vernearth-powered-by-slipknot">Enter Vernearth, Powered by Slipknot</h2>



<p>In a release, Vernearth is described as something almost otherworldly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What is Vernearth? For Clown, Vernearth isn’t just a game world, it’s an extension of his creativity outside Slipknot, suitable for players of all ages. This isn’t just Minecraft. It’s Vernearth. Vernearth is a surrealist experience. Think of it as a place where time and reality don’t play by the rules. </p>



<p>Over 100 million blocks make up this ever-changing landscape, home to mysterious beings called Mind Stewards and endless opportunities for creation, combat, and exploration. Whether you want to build, battle, or just lose yourself in the atmosphere, Vernearth is designed to pull you in and never let go.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the imagery provided, Vernearth resembles a gothic underworld of sorts, teeming with dark architecture that you’d probably be comfortable linking to a brand like Slipknot.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar, Minecraft Realms is a subscription service that allows players to set up, manage, and explore private servers that have unique rules, modifications, and shared server facilities.</p>



<p>From what we can see in the image provided by the team, Vernearth will feature some kind of daily reward system, awarding chests to players who log in every day.</p>



<p>Do you think you’d want to explore Vernearth? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Chapter 2’s Candy Factory takes a sinister right turn in Little Nightmares 3. It’s where the game starts to become unhinged and reveal its true colors. While exploring the mysteries of the facility, you need to find Dolls in Little Nightmares 3. Our Candy Factory guide is the perfect walkthrough to do this.</p>



<p>It’s hard to keep your eyes on the ball in Candy Factory. A nasty spider-bug lady is chasing you, and the whole building is a gargantuan cesspool of unnerving sights and sounds. Hidden amongst its many rooms, corridors, and hidey-holes are Doll collectibles.</p>



<p>If you’re after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>‘s collection of secret Dolls—especially for the game’s trophy list—you need this guide (and some prayers after).</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-dolls-in-candy-factory-chapter-2-in-little-nightmares-3">How Many Dolls in Candy Factory Chapter 2 in Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another five to go. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You must find five Dolls throughout Candy Factory in Little Nightmares 3 if you want to own every doll in the level.</strong></p>



<p>A tiny spoiler alert: Not every <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> chapter has five Dolls. That’s why it’s important to address this question in each Doll guide. Candy Factor does have five, so let’s get into the level!</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-2-candy-factory-doll-1-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 2 Candy Factory Doll 1 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Just out of your vision. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The compulsory path to completing Candy Factory takes you into a large room filled with filing cabinets, folders, and the chapter’s main antagonist. Sneak across the room to the other side and climb up the shelves. <strong>Reach the beams at the top</strong>, and when you start walking toward the screen, turn left at the end, and the first Doll is at the end of the beam.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-2-candy-factory-doll-2-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 2 Candy Factory Doll 2 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s there, we promise you. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Make your way through Candy Factory until you reach a room where you pull down a lever, making the bugs in the room flee, allowing Low and Alone to jump up and down on the platform in the middle of the room. After falling into the next room, climb up the ladder to the right, go through the vent, and move on until you climb up through the grate that puts you in front of a <strong>powered-down elevator</strong>. Take a left through the hole in the wall, and in the room with stacked tubs, <strong>use our screenshot above</strong> to find the second Doll.</p>

<figure><figcaption>One of the more hidden Dolls in the game. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once you’ve restored full power to the elevator, ride it up. Open the window shutter, taking you outside, and instead of running toward you (the player) to carry on, from the window, <strong>run down the long pipe in the opposite direction</strong>—left of the hot air balloon in the background. Climb through the window at the end, and claim Doll number three.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It pays to explore. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll find Doll four not long after the third one. Once you return to the beaten path, you naturally encounter <strong>a room filled with static TVs, the chapter’s boss enemy again, and a wooden plank you need to walk across</strong>. Do this, wait for the boss to leave, and descend to the bottom of the room. Instead of opening up the two-person vent, go to the opposite side of the room to find the Doll sitting small and cute in the open room.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-2-candy-factory-doll-5-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 2 Candy Factory Doll 5 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The end is nigh. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A final chase sequence with the Candy Factory’s boss</strong> results in them being squished in a hydraulic press (lovely, I know), and the door in the press room unlocks once they’re defeated. Go down the long corridor and into the room on the left. The Doll is on the table next to a machine.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed this guide was more of a treat for you than the horrors of the Candy Factory! Little Nightmares 3 sure does have some creative levels, and we might be brave enough to attempt to clean up the game’s remaining Dolls.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-necropolis-chapter-1-dolls-in-little-nightmares-3%E2%80%94every-chapter-1-doll-location-explained.1321504/</guid>

<p>Necorpolis is where Low and Alone’s journey begins in Little Nightmares 3. The game starts brighter and sandier than you might expect, but just because it’s light doesn’t mean you’ll have an easy time tracking down every Chapter 1 Doll in Little Nightmares 3’s Necropolis level.</p>



<p>It depends on which side of the fence you reside where collectibles are concerned. Some people love them, and some hate them. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> does have collectibles across its various chapters, there aren’t many—but each one can be an endeavor to track down (and a nightmare).</p>



<p>If you’re having trouble with so much as one collectible Doll in Chapter 1’s Necropolis, we’re here to help.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-dolls-in-necropolis-chapter-1-in-little-nightmares-3">How Many Dolls in Necropolis Chapter 1 in Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We did it, and so can you. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five collectible Dolls to find in Little Nightmare 3’s first chapter—Necropolis.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a fairly easy start to Doll collecting in the game. A couple are handed to you on a silver platter, but the others are very missable if you don’t know where to look in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-1-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 1 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The first Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Doll number one is <em>unmissable</em>. Proceed through Necropolis and travel through the long, dusty desert. Eventually, you climb a huge ladder that takes a long time to climb. Once you reach the top, crawl through the tunnel, break through the wall, and the Doll is there out in the open in the middle of the floor.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-2-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 2 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Second Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The next Doll requires you to carry on as normal until you reach the point where Low and Alone fall into a giant room—behind a helter skelter-like pillar—and the giant baby monster appears and leers into the room. Move between the statues; both of you need to trigger the floor switch, and an elevator takes you all the way down. Instead of going right through the hole in the door, <strong>use Alone’s wrench to break down the wall to the left</strong>. The Doll is in the middle of this secret room.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-3-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 3 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can’t miss the third Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>After a section where you <strong>climb up a large wall of broken wooden planks, shimmying from side to side</strong> occasionally, you reach a market area at the top. Go right, and instead of using your umbrella to ride the vertical breeze to the platform, instead, go up the exposed staircase. The third Doll is at the top, next to a wicker basket.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-4-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 4 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The fourth Doll in a dark room. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Doll number four is available after we go through <strong>Low’s cutscene, where they’re in a prison-like room, unmasked, and hiding under the bed</strong>. When Low and Alone come to, go left, crouch through the hole in the broken door, and the fourth Doll is in the room—this one is easily missable because you’d think to go right as the game hints at.</p>



<h2 id="h-chapter-1-necropolis-doll-5-location-in-little-nightmares-3">Chapter 1 Necropolis Doll 5 Location in Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The sneaky fifth Doll. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our fifth and final Doll is toward the end of the level. <strong>You must complete a sequence in a bell tower where you smash the head of a statue, and use the bow to cut the rope and ring the bell</strong>—summoning the baby monster. Hide in the box, and once it grabs the bell and leaves, exit through the window to the right. Now, complete the mini umbrella and ladder puzzle, and proceed. You will reach a section where you use the umbrellas to ride across a gap and then pull the plank off the bottom of a door. Climb through and into the alley. Head up the path, and instead of turning right into the opening, carry on going forward, and the final Doll is sneakily hidden away at the end of the passage on the left.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Little Nightmares 3 trophy and achievement list has as much aura and mystery as the whole game. Supermassive Games has whipped up a truly confusing trophy and achievement list that will have you thinking more than twice about each one. Let’s check out how many there are and their descriptions.</p>



<p>It’s apt that a horror game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>—shrouded in mystery and shadows—clouds its own trophy and achievement list with unclear descriptions. You’ll be scratching your head over the majority of the trophies in this fairly extensive list.</p>



<p>The Little Nightmares 3 trophies and achievements list is a curious one.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-little-nightmares-3-achievements-amp-trophies">All Little Nightmares 3 Achievements &amp; Trophies</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hang in there. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p>Usually, we give you a quick rundown of what you need to do for a trophy list. The <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> list doesn’t specifically mention completing chapters or activities. However, we’ve earned a lot for ourselves—because <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming was able to review the game</a> fully before launch—and can tell you some will be earned without you realizing.</p>



<p>So, let’s cut the chatter and get straight into the Little Nightmares 3 trophies and achievements list.</p>

<p>Supermassive Games has gotten its hands on the Little Nightmares franchise. The studio brings a wealth of experience to one of the most niche yet beloved indie horror franchises. That said, we’re giving you information on how long the game is based on our experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmare 3</a> is finally out. The transition from Tarsier Studios to Supermassive Games may have caused the game to take longer than thought. However, the new developer isn’t actually new, and has built up a reputation in the horror genre—highlighting titles like Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology as fine examples.</p>



<p>The third game oozes quality—which we can testify to, thanks to our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3 review</a>—so let’s see how much there is to enjoy.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-little-nightmares-3">How Many Hours to Beat Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A solid ride. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>By the time we rolled the Little Nightmares 3 credits, the PlayStation home screen indicated that we had spent at least 7 hours playing the game, but it might be closer to 8 hours, to be safe.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re a PS5 owner, you’ll know that when you highlight a game on the home menu screen, there are two indicators on the screen: One indicating playtime and one showing main story progress. When we wrapped up our first playthrough, the home menu was showing 7 hours.</p>



<p>However, this figure doesn’t always seem 100% accurate, based on previous games we’ve played. <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> doesn’t show your playtime in any of the save file slots.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco’s PR did tell us: “We’d expect a playthrough to come in at under 10 hours!”</p>

<p><strong>To get every collectible and even get all of the Little Nightmares 3 trophies, you’re probably looking at anywhere between 10-15 hours—depending on how you approach the game.</strong></p>



<p>Little Nightmares 3 has an obscure and lengthy trophy and achievement list. If you go into this without a trophy guide at the ready, you could spend a while figuring everything out. Furthermore, each of the four main chapters has a set amount of collectibles. Again, without guidance, it’s going to eat up your time replaying chapters.</p>



<p>Depending on your approach, we’d say that if you use guides to assist you, 10-15 hours sounds about right. If you insist on doing everything yourself and figuring out trophies on your own, you could be looking at even greater game length numbers!</p>
