            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans can rejoice as their beloved Snowboarding min-game is returning in a more meaningful way in Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3. </p>



<p>We keep learning more and more information on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 as the days go on. It was recently revealed that the game’s title has been finalized, and they will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-stick-to-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sticking with Unreal Engine 4</a> for the upcoming instalment. Now, discussions about the upcoming title’s mini-games have surfaced online. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-director-mentions-queen-s-blood-and-snowboarding-mini-games">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Director Mentions Queen’s Blood and Snowboarding Mini-Games</h2>



<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi mentioned part 3’s snowboarding and Queen’s Blood mini-games in a new interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a>. Talking about Queen’s Blood, the director reveals that he wants to expand and enhance the min-game, to provide players “a more powered-up version” in Part 3. </p>



<p>Regarding Snowboarding, the director informed players that he can’t reveal too many details about these mini-games, but he knows how much they mean to fans’ hearts. Hamaguchi did confirm that it will not be a simple snowboarding mini-game, instead they will incorporate it into the story “to have that sort of connection with the theming of it.”</p>



<p>Additionally, the director also discussed the development progress of FF7 Remake Part 3. Hamaguchi stated that it is coming along “smoothly” and the team has been “tracking on time” for the milestones they have set for themselves. At this moment, “the game is playable, technically.” However, further polishing is required to bring it to the level where they can release it. </p>







<p>In other news, FF7 Remake series director has stated that he wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-should-be-led-by-someone-else-says-ff7-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">someone else to lead</a> the Final Fantasy 6 Remake. Additionally, the developers are considering a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-devs-are-considering-a-full-title-after-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full title</a>” after Part 3.

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has confirmed that Part 3 is also being built on Unreal Engine 4. </p>



<p>Square Enix’s next big remake project is Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3, and though we haven’t received any gameplay or an announcement video yet, the devs have shared plenty of information. We already know that the game experience is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>“, and now the title has been decided too, so hopefully an announcement could be right around the corner. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-title-decided-going-to-continue-with-unreal-engine-4">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Title Decided, Going to Continue with Unreal Engine 4</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameSpot</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi revealed additional details about part 3, including the continuation of Unreal Engine 4. Hamaguchi first stated that creative director Tetsuya Nomura has decided on which title to go ahead with, and he has “locked” one of the two titles the devs were discussing. </p>



<p>Next up, Unreal Engine 4: it seems the dev team discussed transferring the title’s development to Unreal Engine 5; however, they later decided against it. Hamguchi stated that they have made “a lot of modifications to fit our needs” on Unreal Engine 4, which is why it’s beneficial to work on something the team is “already familiar with.”</p>



<p>Hamaguchi also shared his views on AI, confirming that they don’t rely on the tech to “come up with ideas”. Hamaguchi and the team use it as a tool to make their work smoother, or let AI take over menial tasks. However, he added that AI is “becoming more and more necessary” and can create an environment where work is more efficient and more creative options can be explored. </p>







<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is reportedly still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to Xbox in 2026</a>. Additionally, the developer has confirmed that Rebirth’s Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-gameplay-experience-will-be-similar-to-other-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experience will be similar to other platforms</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has revealed its plans for the future of ARC Raiders, and it looks like content will be dropping thick and fast. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The roadmap</a> details plans up until April 2026, but the first batch of updates falls under a mysterious title—Headwinds.</p>



<p>Substantial updates are what keep live-service titles like ARC Raiders alive and fresh, and the rust-belt has been pretty barren since Cold Snap ended. Well, new content is just around the corner, as Headwinds is set to soar into the game pretty soon.</p>







<p>Here’s when you can expect Headwinds to arrive in ARC Raiders, as well as what content has been confirmed for the update. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-headwinds-release-in-arc-raiders">When Does ‘Headwinds’ Release In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s looming on the horizon. Image by Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Headwinds update has been confirmed by Embark Studios to arrive in ARC Raiders on January 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>When the roadmap was initially revealed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-arc-raiders-february-2026-content-map-update-raider-deck-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, it was fairly surprising to see a slate of content listed to arrive in January, as the month was practically over. However, Embark Studios clearly didn’t plan to partake in dry January, as new content is just around the corner. </p>



<p>Headwinds is expected to launch at the usual update times for ARC Raiders, but if you’re unfamiliar with those, Insider Gaming has them listed down below:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Headwinds Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PST)</td><td data-align="center">1:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">3:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (EST)</td><td data-align="center">4:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">8:30 PM—January 27</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-headwinds-confirmed-content-for-arc-raiders">All ‘Headwinds’ Confirmed Content For ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roll on April. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As announced within the roadmap, three new pieces of content can be expected to drop with the Headwinds update for ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>These are the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>New Matchmaking Option Level 40+</li>



<li>New Minor Map Condition</li>



<li>New Player Project</li>
</ul>



<p>As things stand, further details are scarce. The Player Project is bound to be another five-stage project filled with items you’ll need to submit in return for rewards, but the new Minor Map Condition and Matchmaking Option remain a mystery.</p>







<p>Early player theories are that the new Map Condition will be a sandstorm, as alluded to by the background image in the roadmap, as well as the Headwinds title. If this were the case, then the likelihood is that it’ll be exclusive to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-find-guitars-shakers-in-arc-raiders-buried-city-easter-egg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buried City</a>, and maybe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hidden-bunker-arc-raiders-how-to-open-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spaceport</a>, as a sandstorm sweeping through The Blue Gate might be a bit far-fetched. </p>



<p>As for the new Matchmaking Option, it’s interesting that they highlight it’s for Level 40+ players. It might be in an effort to circumvent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-will-implement-significant-changes-to-crack-down-on-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheaters</a>—who primarily use new, low-level accounts—from ruining the match experience for high-level players with valuable gear.</p>



<p>Should more information be announced before the Headwinds update, Insider Gaming will be sure to update this article with the latest details. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Code Vein 2 On Xbox Game Pass? Code Vein 2 Game Pass Status, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>1415977</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass keeps receiving new games. With increased Game Pass costs, it begs the question of whether Code Vein 2 is coming to Xbox Game Pass to justify the cost, and if not, if it will ever happen.</p>



<p>Soulslike fans should be in for a good time with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein 2</a>. There was plenty to enjoy from the genre in 2025 with Nightreign, The&nbsp;First&nbsp;Berserker:&nbsp;Khazan, and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Code Vein 2 is the first real Soulslike contender of 2026, and if it’s on Game Pass, it’s a win-win.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-code-vein-2-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Code Vein 2 On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An unsuccessful ride. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Xbox Game Pass isn’t adding Code Vein 2 as a launch-day game, meaning all players need to buy the game outright to own it and play.</strong></p>



<p>The pro of Xbox Game Pass is that you get a <em>lot</em> of free titles as part of your subscription. The bad news is that you only get a select variety of games. Also, even if you have the more expensive Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier, your day-one release entitlement is limited, and it depends on any agreements between Microsoft and other publishers.</p>



<p>A quick check of the Xbox store shows that under Code Vein 2’s listing, there is nothing about Xbox Game Pass. There’s no Game Pass icon or mention, nor has it been referenced in any Code Vein 2 trailers. It hasn’t been outed by Bandai Namco, nor Microsoft or Xbox, so we can safely assume that it’s not on Xbox Game Pass, and it probably won’t be in the foreseeable future.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-code-vein-2-ever-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Code Vein 2 Ever Come To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>This one has to be filed under ‘Unlikely,’ as the first Code Vein hasn’t even debuted on Xbox Game Pass at any point.</strong></p>



<p>Any sort of a sequel is great as it gives plenty of background data on previous entries in a series, and if they’ve ever been on Xbox Game Pass. The original Code Vein doesn’t appear to have been on Game Pass (but we’ll update this if it’s incorrect), making the case for Code Vein 2 on XGP quite bleak.</p>



<p>Like Code Vein 2 itself, it’s not impossible, and a Game Pass addition could be doable in the future. Stay tuned for further updates.</p>



<p>If you’ve heard anything different about Code Vein 2 being on Xbox Game Pass, or think you’ve seen it first on XGP, drop a comment via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
