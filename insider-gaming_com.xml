<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada were set to begin at 12:01am ET on April 9 in some stores. Unfortunately, players across the country will have to wait as Nintendo has delayed pre-orders for the console in the country at the last minute.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MobileSyrup</a>, Nintendo confirmed the decision to wait until a later date.</p>



<p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in Canada will not start on April 9, 2025 in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the U.S. Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”</p>



<p>The statement reads similar to the one provided when the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed pre-orders in the United States</a> last week.</p>







<p>The Nintendo Switch is currently priced at $629 CAD for the base system and $699 CAD for the Mario Kart World Bundle. It’s currently unknown if there could be any change to pricing of the system in the country or if it will just be, as the company said, to align with United States plans.</p>

<p>Anticipation is high for Clair Obscur Expedition Expedition 33, an upcoming turn-based RPG with real-time fighting mechanics, and players want to know if the title will be available on Game Pass.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a> is inspired by the Belle Epoque, a period in French history from 1871 to 1914. Since there was no war, the era is remembered for being peaceful, and technology flourished. For example, The Eiffel Tower and the Paris Subway system were created, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut project puts a dystopian spin on that quiet time.</p>



<p>In this universe, there is a paintress. When she paints a number on a monolith, everyone of that age turns to smoke and fades away. That number decreases every year, and one group sets out to stop her before she paints their age. </p>

<figure><figcaption>This isn’t the standard turn-based combat you are used to. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Clair Obscur Expedition 33 is a day-one launch for <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9PPT8K6GQHRZ/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscribers on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>To get access to games on the day they are released, you need to be a<strong> Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, which costs $19.99 monthly</strong>. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qgOZDRDynw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal trailer</a> set the tone for what to expect from this unique take on a turn-based RPG. The Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe are bent and distorted, and the expedition group needs to worry about more than just the paintress. </p>



<p>Strange marionettes and other large beasts have overrun France, and players have an arsenal of turn-based attacks but can also dodge, parry, and counter in real-time by timing the rhythms of attacks to take down every enemy. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-xbox-game-pass">How to play Clair Obscur Expedition 33 on Xbox Game Pass</h2>



<p><strong>Once South of Clair Obscur Expedition 33 launches, you need an Ultimate subscription to Xbox Game Pass and a working internet connection to play it.</strong></p>



<p>Here are quick step-by-step instructions showing you what to do once you have your membership:</p>



<ol>
<li>Check your Xbox Game Pass status via your Xbox account.</li>



<li>If it’s active, it’s time to go to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/microsoft-store?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Store</a>&nbsp;on console or PC.</li>



<li>In the search function, look for<strong> Clair Obscur Expedition 33</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on the game page.</li>



<li>Once the option is available, press to download the title.</li>



<li>You can play Cair Obscur Expedition 33 once it’s live!</li>
</ol>



<hr>



<p>Even though Microsoft raised the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate price from $16.99 to $19.99 in 2024, the subscription service is still one of the best deals in gaming and consistently adds new titles to try out. <span>For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank">South of Midnight</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank">GTA 5</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-developer-is-laying-off-employees/" target="_blank">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a>&nbsp;are all joining the service in April</span>.</p>

<p>The promised Schedule 1 April 7 update has arrived. TVGS—the game’s solo developer—has added many new features, including handy new Pawn and Boutique shops as the game enters a new beta test. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> aptly has a lot of content logged in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> diary. Developer TVGS has lots of ideas and ways to keep its cornucopia of kingpins coming back for more. It’s probably for the best as they fend off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infringement claims</a> from rival title Drug Dealer Simulator—although it’s reported there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-rival-drug-dealer-simulator-says-there-is-no-lawsuit-amid-review-bombing-investigation-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no lawsuit</a>.</p>



<p>Either way, a new update has dropped. It expands on Schedule 1’s foundations and is only a snippet of what’s to come.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-schedule-1-adds-new-buildings">New Schedule 1 Adds New Buildings</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The interiors keep coming. Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pawn-shop-interior-and-functionality-added">Pawn Shop Interior and Functionality Added</h3>



<p>There are already a fair few buildings in Schedule 1. But they won’t stop being built as a new Pawn Shop is open where: “You can now <strong>sell pretty much anything (excluding product)</strong> to Mick at the pawn shop.”</p>



<p>Your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best weed</a> needs to wait for customers, unfortunately. But anything else you can get your hands on is fair game. It’s a good way to make extra cash to spend on new items.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-boujee-boutique-awaits">A Boujee Boutique Awaits</h3>



<p>Also included in the April 7 Schedule 1 update is the new “Bleuballs Boutique.” I’m choosing my words carefully here, but if you’re old enough to play Schedule 1, there’s already a good chance you know the meaning behind the store’s name.</p>



<p>I’ll avoid this topic like the plague and say it’s another fab addition to the game. You can find expensive jewelry watches here, and it’s best that you make some money at the Pawn Shop or by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-calculator-guide-how-to-maximise-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maximizing your profits</a> before buying anything!</p>

The fuller list also mentions tons of smaller additions to the game and a few fixes.</p>

<h3 id="h-additions">Additions</h3>

<p>Hades 2 fans desperate for the game’s full launch can only pick it up on Nintendo Switch 2 at release. It’s currently locked in as a Switch 2 console exclusive for the time being, with a PlayStation and Xbox launch coming later.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-nintendo-switch-2-release-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 exclusives</a> keep coming. We’re still reeling from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct where the bombshell dropped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fromsoftwares-new-game-a-bloodborne-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoftware’s next game</a>—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-will-feature-8-player-pvpve-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>—is a Switch 2 exclusive. Now, Supergiant Games has revealed Hades 2’s full release is closing in, and its first port of call on console is the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Again, it’s a timed exclusive, but this is still big for Hades 2 and Switch fans.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Shocking. Credit to Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo of America X channel</a> posted a video on April 8 about Hades 2 and its journey. The media clip is an interesting developer walkthrough, and an insight into the much-hyped sequel and its progress.</p>



<p>What you don’t expect is a message toward the end of the video saying: “<strong>Hades 2 Launching first for consoles on Nintendo Switch 2. More information coming later this year.</strong>“</p>







<p>Hades 2 has been in Early Access on PC since 2024. Supergiant Games has been honing the roguelike sequel, tightening up the mechanics, and making sure it lives up to the expectations of its Game-of-the-Year-winning predecessor. </p>



<p>You’re going to have to wait a bit longer to see how powerful Melinoe is if you’re on PlayStation or Xbox Series X|S.</p>
