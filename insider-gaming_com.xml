<p>All Steam users now have a brand new built-in system called Game Recording to take advantage of. This system allows you to create and share footage directly from Steam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steam’s Game Recording <a href="https://x.com/Steam/status/1853950924018118790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">introduces several features</a>, such as Background Recording, On-Demand Recording, Replay, Clip, and Share. Through Background Recording mode, players can continuously save footage on their preferred drive according to their specified duration and storage limits. On-demand recording, on the other hand, allows you to stop and start the recording process manually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Replay allows players to jump back in time, helping them catch up on what they might have missed during their adventures. A new Recordings and Screenshots interface includes the Clips feature, allowing you to choose the specific gameplay footage you want to share. The Share feature in the same interface will enable you to share your game recordings with the world or between devices such as your PC, Steam Deck, and Mobile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, when using Steam Game Recording, a Steam Timeline is introduced, which features event markers, player-added markers, game-added markers, game mode indicators, and highlight views. These markers are great for editing and going back through the footage to find something specific. There are timeline-enhanced games that “proactively notify Steam when relevant events happen” to add game-event markers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game recording feature will also work with non-Steam titles as long as the Steam Overlay is running. However, the feature will not record your desktop; only the games you are playing will be recorded, and all footage will be stored on your hard drive. Lastly, Game Recording is Steam Deck verified so you can record on the go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Steam now shows that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-now-shows-that-you-dont-actually-own-the-game-youre-buying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you don’t own the game you are buying</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sparking-zero-tops-all-dragon-ball-games-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sparking Zero has topped all Dragon Ball games</a> on the platform.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nuketown-manniquin-easter-egg/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has reintroduced one of the most iconic maps in Call of Duty history, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-nuketown-in-black-ops-6-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown</a>. After debuting in the original Black Ops, Treyarch have brought the map back in every Black Ops game since, and it usually comes with an interesting little <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-super-hero-easter-egg-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easter egg</a>.</p>



<p>In the past, shooting all the heads off the mannequins on the map would initiate an Easter egg. In Black Ops 3, the mannequins awoke and started attacking you, while in the original, music would start playing much like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teddy bear Easter eggs in Zombies</a>.</p>



<p>So, many have been wondering if Black Ops 6’s Nuketown has something similar, so, here’s your answer.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-an-easter-egg-on-nuketown-in-bo6">Is there an Easter egg on Nuketown in BO6?</h2>



<p><strong>No, there is currently no Easter egg in Black Ops 6’s Nuketown</strong>. Players have shot all the heads off the mannequins on the map and nothing happens. This is strange since every iteration of Nuketown has included some sort of secret for doing so, but players were surprised to see that the devs have not put anything in the map.</p>



<p>While many may be slightly disappointed to learn this, it’s important to note that the devs could implement an Easter egg in the future. </p>



<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oih841WfYiw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inkslasher</a> noticed an intriguing map of Nuketown on the wall of the middle truck that’s open for players to go into. This map has not been in any other version of Nuketown, and since this is supposed to be the original version of the map, it poses the question of why the devs decided to introduce it. It may have nothing to do with an Easter egg, but Treyarch are known for hidden secrets and don’t tend to introduce things like this for no reason.</p>

<p>The map is also not available in Private Matches and you can’t watch Nuketown matches on Theatre Mode, so perhaps the devs are still working on things for Nuketown before pushing an Easter egg live.</p>



<p>Some in the community have managed to glitch into Theatre Mode for Nuketown and clip out the map, allowing them to explore the surrounding area. It was discovered that both the Warhead Face Off map and the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/area-99-revealed-as-new-resurgence-map-in-warzone-at-codnext-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Area 99 Warzone map</a> can be found very close by.</p>



<p>We knew these maps were in the same location, but the fact that they exist in the same space while playing on either map, albeit in much lower resolution, could suggest that Treyarch have a much larger, more intricate Easter egg in store.</p>
