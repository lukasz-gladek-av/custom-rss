<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is a more powerful console than the Nintendo Switch, but, according to Nvidia, it’ll feature ten times the graphics power of the original.</p>



<p>In a post on its website going over Nintendo’s latest console, Nvidia discussed DLSS and 4K gaming coming to a Nintendo platform for the first time. The post goes over how Tensor Cores will help improve “AI-powered graphics” while adding that RT Cores will “enhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections.” Nvidia also says that variable refresh rate and G-Sync for the console’s screen result in “ultra-smooth, tear-free gameplay.”</p>



<p>These features, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company says</a>, will give the new system “10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch”, providing “smoother gameplay and sharper visuals.”</p>







<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-features-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features a 1080 LCD screen</a> that supports up to 120 frames per second (FPS) and HDR in handheld mode. When docked, the system supports 4K output at 60 FPS. One game that doesn’t seem to have 60 FPS on the system, however, is CyberPunk 2077 as CD Projekt Red’s RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-on-nintendo-switch-2-runs-at-40-fps-costs-70/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runs at 40 FPS</a> when docked.</p>
