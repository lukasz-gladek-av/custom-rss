<p>The release date for Marvel Cosmic Invasion draws ever closer, and Insider Gaming has all the details so you don’t miss a second in the push to force Annihilus back into the Negative Zone.</p>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion from Tribute Games and Dotemu pits players in control of famous Marvel characters against the horde of bug-like enemies from the Negative Zone, and it’s confirmed to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/9-new-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-next-wave/">available day one on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>



<p>If your Spidey Sense is tingling and you can’t wait to jump into the new beat ’em up title with a classic look, this guide has all the details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-marvel-cosmic-invasion-release-date">What is The Marvel Cosmic Invasion Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beat ’em up. Image via Dotemu</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is set for release on December 1 across pretty much every possible platform, including last-gen consoles and the original Nintendo Switch.</strong></p>



<p>The beat ’em up title featuring a host of Marvel characters, including Captain America, Nova, Venom, Spider-Man, and the Silver Surfer, battling against the threat of Annihilus.</p>



<p>15 playable heroes will be available, with the Cosmic Swap tag-team system allowing players to switch between two selected heroes quickly to combine for creative team-ups and devastating moves, all brought to life with retro, full-color pixel art designs.</p>







<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-marvel-cosmic-invasion-start-time">Do We Know The Marvel Cosmic Invasion Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is expected to release across all platforms simultaneously at 8 AM PT on December 1, with no opportunity for players elsewhere in the world to jump in early.</strong></p>



<p>Rather than a staggered global release at midnight local time, the doors open for Marvel Cosmic Invasion simultaneously across the globe, which means a wait until later in the day for some regions of the world, while others can jump in first thing in the morning.</p>



<p>Timings come from the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, and may be subject to change, but the table below details the release time and date for Marvel Comic Invasion across the globe.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Peak Evolution monthly redeem codes for November 2025&nbsp;to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gems, Boosts, Potions and more.</p>



<p>Peak Evolution is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dueling-grounds-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> clicker action game with a medieval theme, where players have to defeat various enemies to purchase new characters and upgrade their weapons and abilities. Boasting enemy characters like Pirates and Knights, Peak Evolution is all about gaining coins and EXP points, which can then be used to get better gear, Pets, Evolutions and much more.&nbsp;</p>







<p>There are many worlds that players can explore using their character, and each of these worlds has hordes of enemies to defeat. The main objective of the game is to achieve the strongest warrior form, and this can be done by progressing through the game and by going through multiple rebirths. With daily objectives and seasonal events for players to complete, Peak Evolution can be a fun experience for enthusiasts of the action genre, and with the addition of some free rewards using redeem codes, it’s definitely worth checking out.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-peak-evolution-codes">Expired Peak Evolution Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Roblox Peak Evolution. With the game having only been released recently, none of the codes dropped by the developers have expired yet. When one of the active codes expires, it will promptly be moved to this section of the page. Considering that there are three active codes already, the likelihood of one of them expiring soon is quite high, so players are urged to redeem them as soon as possible, as you don’t want to miss out on free rewards and fall behind the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-peak-evolution-codes">How To Redeem Peak Evolution Codes</h2>

</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-peak-evolution-codes">How To Get More Peak Evolution Codes</h2>

However, tracking both of these regularly can be a hassle, which is why we recommend that all players keep this page bookmarked for future reference. We update this page with new and expired codes as soon as they drop, making it the most efficient way for players to stay up to date with the latest codes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Pickaxe Simulator monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Potions and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pickaxe Simulator is an up-and-coming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-drift-36-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> incremental simulator game where players are tasked with mining various blocks using their pickaxe. The main objective of the game is to have the strongest pickaxe, thereby enabling its user to mine blocks quickly and efficiently. Players can also train their characters to be more effective while mining, increasing the amount of any material that can be mined in a given time.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Another key element of Pickaxe Simulator is Pets. These Pets, once hatched, provide users with additional benefits while mining, making the players’ operations even more profitable. While playing the game from scratch isn’t too difficult, a boost to resources at the start of the game can be quite beneficial. That’s where the Pickaxe Simulator codes can be helpful to players.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-active-pickaxe-simulator-codes-nbsp">Active Pickaxe Simulator Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Update1</strong> – Potions&nbsp;</li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-pickaxe-simulator-codes-nbsp">Expired Pickaxe Simulator Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Roblox Pickaxe Simulator, as the game was released quite recently. In the short time it has been around, however, two new updates and their corresponding codes have come out, which suggets that more updates and codes are likely on the horizon. When any of the active codes given above expire, they will promptly be moved to this section of the page. With this in mind, players are urged to make use of the active codes so as not to miss out on the free rewards.&nbsp;</p>

These codes are often released through the game’s Roblox page, the developers’ socials or through the game’s official Discord server. However, tracking all three of these avenues can be a hassle for the average player, which is why we recommend that all players keep this page bookmarked. We update this article as soon as any new codes drop, making it the best place to get your codes without missing out on any free rewards.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-20-893/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-893-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-thursday-november-20.1358839/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The weekend is almost here, but before it comes, you need to smash a couple more NYT Connections puzzles! Fortunately, I’m on hand (as always) to bring you the best NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need to ace today’s challenge. If you’re stuck on today’s NYT Connections puzzle, this is the guide that you need.</p>



<p>Read on to secure the tips and answers that you need to keep that streak going.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-20">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 20)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #893:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARTY</li>



<li>KISS</li>



<li>ENAMEL</li>



<li>ESSAY</li>



<li>CROWN</li>



<li>DECAY</li>



<li>BRUSH</li>



<li>PASTE</li>



<li>ANY</li>



<li>SKIM</li>



<li>PLASTER</li>



<li>PULP</li>



<li>STICK</li>



<li>STROKE</li>



<li>ROOT</li>



<li>FIX</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of things you’d literally apply to bond surfaces; one is more “medical wall stuff” than “craft glue.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are words for a light touch; one of them can be romantic or just feather-light.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Mix inner anatomy and outer protection; two are internal tissues, two are what you see or what caps it.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Say them out loud. One hides a “decay” pun that echoes D-K, and another rhymes its way to S-A.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 20.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-20-893">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 20 (#893)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– FIX, PASTE, PLASTER, STICK</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BRUSH, KISS, SKIM, STROKE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CROWN, ENAMEL, PULP, ROOT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ANY, ARTY, DECAY, ESSAY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>



<p>How did you do? Did you get a perfect run? Let me know what your streak looks like on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord serve</a><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">r</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty DMZ is Coming Back Soon, But There’s a Catch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-dmz-coming-back-catch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-dmz-is-coming-back-soon-but-there%E2%80%99s-a-catch.1358827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that Call of Duty’s DMZ mode is returning in December, but there’s a huge catch. The once-popular extraction shooter platform first emerged in Modern Warfare II in 2022, but after a few months of updates, it eventually disappeared from the ecosystem, never to return – until now.</p>



<p>There’s a huge catch though.</p>







<h2 id="h-dmz-recon-coming-december-11th">DMZ: Recon Coming December 11th</h2>



<p>DMZ: Recon is a new extraction shooter experience coming to Call of Duty: Mobile in December. It’s a reflection of the DMZ title that was released alongside Modern Warfare II in 2022, albeit a ‘shrunk-down’ version.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It will land during COD Mobile’s Season 11 update, and like the original, it’s set to feature PvPvE gameplay. Unlike the original DMZ, it’s expected that there will be no punishment or negativity surrounding PvP, as that was a sticking point for fans of the first platform. This is reflected in there being no ‘team recruitment’ mechanics, which were in the first DMZ.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDutyMobile/comments/1oyh2hg/dmz_recon_is_official_heres_what_to_expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early impressions from COD Mobile leakers</a> suggested that DMZ: Recon will be entirely first-person and will feature an in-match buy store, just like the one found in the original DMZ mode. There will be boss characters, weapons can be levelled up in flight, and loot is based on a tier system that includes extremely rare collectibles.</p>



<p>Players can reportedly purchase vehicles on the fly, and as it’s a smaller experience, only eight teams of three will occupy each match.</p>



<p>It has also been suggested that two maps will emerge at launch on December 11th: Serpent Island and Building 21. It was also claimed from those attending preview events that players arrive in the game via a wingsuit, can use killstreaks, carry three weapons, and can extract using a helicopter system, just like the first game.</p>







<p>Are you happy to see DMZ coming back, even if it’s only in COD Mobile? Let your thoughts be known via the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
