<p>It appears Activision and Call of Duty teams have listened to the community’s cries, as it’s been revealed Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t feature a Black Ops 6 carry forward. This would’ve seen cosmetics from BLOPS 6 be available in BLOPS 7.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-players-think-black-ops-6-purchases-carrying-over-to-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB summary hinted at Black Ops 6 purchases carrying over</a> into Black Ops 7. Despite claims that Call of Duty remains a realistic military shooter, this would’ve meant <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-adding-beavis-butt-head-operators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beavis and Butt-Head</a>, Squid Game, and various other novelty skins existing in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This now appears to be off the cards.</p>

<figure><figcaption>I mean, what is this? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>An August 26 news briefing on the Call of Duty <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> addressed the “Identity of Call of Duty.” It addresses Black Ops 7 being a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2, but also some changes to BLOPS 7.</p>



<p>“Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7,” is the front-page story here. Activision has decided against the planned carry-forward from Black Ops 6 to Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The statement continued:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.&nbsp;Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward,&nbsp;because we recognize your time and progression are important. This change applies only to Black Ops 7.&nbsp;<strong>Call of Duty:</strong>&nbsp;Warzone is not affected,&nbsp;and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there.”</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Co-op gaming isn’t making a comeback; it never left. LEGO Voyagers is the latest title to feature two-player-focused adventuring in a fantastical world you’re encouraged to explore. I had the opportunity to play it at Gamescom 2025. I also had the pleasure of talking to (and playing the game with) Karsten Lund, who revealed LEGO Voyager’s potential 5-hour length and other features in a special interview.</p>



<p>Karsten is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a>‘s senior quality manager. He graciously kept me company as we journeyed together through a succinct LEGO Voyagers demo. He had likely played the demo to death when Gamescom 2025 was all said and done. However, I conducted a one-to-one interview all about the LEGO Voyagers demo.</p>



<p>He was more than happy to answer several key questions I had about the game and gave us all a sneak peek at the game’s motives and content.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-voyagers-is-something-everyone-s-ready-to-play">LEGO Voyagers is Something “Everyone’s Ready to Play”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We smashed it. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/games/lego-voyagers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LEGO Voyagers</a> doesn’t focus on a specific media license or property, or a talkative character with a riveting backstory. We care about two mute bricks who want to rescue a spaceship. Lund explained the dynamic and what the team wanted to achieve with Voyagers.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This time around, we focus on the brick; figuring out a way to put brick and brick building as the star of the show as opposed to the minifigure-based games that are also out there. So in this game, you actually play as a LEGO brick, a small one-by-one brick with an eye. Then you have to navigate the levels that are completely brick-built as well.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I did mention recent contemporaries that have excelled in the genre—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hazelight-is-already-working-on-its-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a>‘ work, in particular. Karsten says that “the way has been paved now, right?” in (presumably) reference to the likes of It Takes Two and Split Fiction. </p>



<p>Furthermore: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s something everybody loves to play and everybody’s ready to play.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Hazelight’s games, LEGO Voyagers supports the Friends Pass system. This means only <em>one of you</em> needs to buy the game to play it in co-op. Future content hinges on the game’s success. With it being an easy and accessible co-op LEGO release appealing to a wide demographic, this probably won’t be an issue.</p>



<p>I also enquired about the game’s length and if there are any fun mini-games to break up the gameplay.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We have a game of tic-tac-toe in the middle of the game, so we’re giving lots of opportunities to play and hang out in the game. We’ve seen players complete this in four and a half to five hours, if they just run through it and solve the puzzles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I gave my full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-voyagers-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Voyagers verdict in my complete Gamescom 2025 preview</a>, which I encourage you to check out!</p>

<p>LEGO Voyagers is scheduled to release on September 15. Will you be picking it up straightaway? Do we need even more co-op games and fewer multiplayer-only titles?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts is preparing to welcome gamers to San Vansterdam from September 16 as Skate (I’m not writing skate., I hate that title) enters early access. This news was announced on social media earlier today, and it comes after months of closed testing phases have unravelled much of the game’s content.</p>



<p>The Skate team also released a short trailer to celebrate the announcement. It has been more than 15 years since the last Skate game was released, and fans are <strong>hungry</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-skate-will-release-in-early-access-next-month">Skate Will Release in Early Access Next Month</h2>



<p>In little more than two weeks, Skate will be released in early access by Electronic Arts. Earlier today, the team posted a small trailer to announce the release date:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>For months, fans have been testing Skate (stylized as skate.) and running the game through its paces. This has meant that stacks of content have emerged online, giving us a fair indication of what to expect when San Vansterdam opens up on September 16, 2025.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the team revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-skate-game-gets-official-cover-art-and-early-access-release-date-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover art for Skate</a>, promising that the early access release date would drop <strong>today</strong>. Well, as you can see from the above, they’ve delivered on that promise.</p>



<p>In June, the biggest update ever made to the playtest product was unveiled, adding more challenges and upping the server limit to 150 players per map. Even in a testing state, Skate featured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-skate-playtest-update-revealed-wishlists/">a whopping 140 challenges</a> and activities.</p>



<p>The full game could end up being something pretty monumental, scale-wise.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Skate when it enters early access on September 16? Let me know what you’re most excited about with this game on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: When Did The IndyCar Deal Come Together With iRacing?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-when-did-the-indycar-deal-come-together-with-iracing/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On Tuesday, it was announced that iRacing and IndyCar had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indycar-game-coming-in-2026-from-iracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached an agreement</a> on a new game for the second half of 2026. The first console game in over 20 years for IndyCar, this new title is planned to launch on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam. </p>



<p>But when did the deal come together? </p>



<p>Back in early 2024, iRacing president Tony Gardner <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-iracing-not-planning-an-indycar-console-game-right-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Insider Gaming</a> that an IndyCar console game wasn’t in a “short-term plan” for the company, but that the door was open. Later that year, the door blew wide open.</p>



<p>Gardner says that while the long-term plan was <a href="https://iracingstudios.com/iracing-studios-to-produce-standalone-indycar-video-game-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to eventually get here</a>, talks really picked up in late 2024.</p>



<p><strong>“We finalized an agreement with them early this year,”</strong> Gardner told Insider Gaming, <strong>“So, it was six to nine months ago and, and we didn’t want to announce it too soon because we’d rather get some development under our belt and whatnot.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as why announce the game now, Gardner said it made sense to do it ahead of the final race of the 2025 season on August 31. </p>



<p><strong>“We need to to start talking more openly to the teams and getting driver feedback on the physics and things like that,” </strong>he said. <strong>“So it’s a good time for us to let the cat out of the bag.</strong>“</p>



<p>In addition to the console game, iRacing will continue to have a relationship with IndyCar on its main platform. The game is <a href="https://www.iracing.com/iracing-development-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to add</a> the Dallara IL-15 from the INDY NXT series is set to join iRacing in season 4 of 2025.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2’s long-awaited Xbox arrival is far from the end of the road, and a new Premium Warbond is right around the corner. Here, we’ve got all the details for the Dust Devils launch.</p>



<p>Though the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a> understandably took the headlines following the Xbox launch, new content is coming thick and fast.

<p>We’ve got all the details on the Helldivers 2 Dust Devils Warbond here, including the exact start time and what it includes.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2’s latest Premium Warbond is added in the days following the Into the Unjust update, with the store rotation on September 4 coming alongside the Dust Devils Warbond.</p>



<p>The release is slightly earlier than the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-warbond-release-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a>, which was pushed back from the usual update time to align with the long-awaited release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox.</p>
