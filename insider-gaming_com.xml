<p>A slew of roster moves have been made amongst the teams competing in the highest tier of competitive VALORANT. The time for trials and experimentation during Kickoff is over now that Stage One of VALORANT Champions Tour 2025 is about to begin. </p>

<p>EA Sports is set to pay players who appear in EA Sports College Football 26 a bit more money. According to an email sent out to NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) players (via <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6213494/2025/03/18/ea-sports-college-football-26-nil-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Athletic</a>), the company is increasing payment to $1,500 per player for their inclusion in the game.</p>



<p>That’s up from the $600 individual players received for College Football 25. </p>



<p>Players will also get a Deluxe Edition of the game, which is similar to what players from last year’s game received. Select athletes who are brand ambassadors for the game will get additional compensation.</p>



<p>The increase in player payments comes after College Football 25 became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">best-selling sports game</a> in US history, surpassing NBA 2K21. According to an EA representative, again via The Athletic, the increase was done as a way to “make sure athletes feel recognized for the success of the game.”</p>



<p>EA is expected to spend over $16 million on NIL rights for players to appear in the game before accounting for any extra payments for brand ambassadors as well as the cost of the game itself. </p>



<p>College Football 26 is expected to launch in July. After not being a part of last year’s game, it’s anticipated that real coaches will be added to the game this year after a <a href="https://x.com/bmarcello/status/1900019548520075267?s=46&amp;t=iGRZfb8A0Ak5amUsoqdLIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked cover</a> from a recent EA photoshoot made its way online. No other details about the game are currently known.</p>



<p>What do you think of EA increasing its payments to players who appear in College Football 26? Let us know down below and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Big is the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Map? (Answered)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-assassins-creed-shadows-map/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-big-is-the-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-map-answered.1138269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-assassins-creed-shadows-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest supersized title from Ubisoft in the flagship franchise. It’s enormous, like previous games, but just how big is the central map for this all-new title? Like the games that have been released since 2017, Assassin’s Creed Shadows boasts an enormous open-world environment for players to explore, and it can get pretty daunting.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in and determine how big the map is in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-map-size">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Map Size</h2>



<p>The map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is massive and split up into nine core regions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wakasa</li>



<li>Omi</li>



<li>Tamba</li>



<li>Yamashiro</li>



<li>Iga</li>



<li>Harima</li>



<li>Settsu</li>



<li>Yamato</li>



<li>Kii</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s one of the biggest maps released in the series thus far, and traversing it is often a chore because of mountainous terrain that can’t be overcome on foot. While you have a horse, Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t have a ‘path follow’ mechanic, which means you’re forced to make manual journeys quite often.</p>



<p>Additionally, the team at Ubisoft has advised that players use an immersive mode that removes map indicators and marked pathways, which means you’re relying on instincts and discovery to locate your objectives in this vast open world.</p>



<p>I’d say that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is just as big as – if not slightly bigger than – the core map in 2020’s Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-navigate-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">How to Navigate in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>The best way to navigate the massive map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is simply to explore. By using synchronisation viewpoints, you can get your bearings relatively easily, and you can use map markers to keep track of key locations you want to visit.</p>



<p>If you’re really stuck for navigation, you can employ Scouts that go out and determine the specific location of objectives for you. Alternatively, you can just use the guided mode to have map markers revealed in full, which makes the game a walk in the park.</p>



<p>It’s advised to stay out of the dense forests and mountainous regions of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows map, as moving through them can be laborious and, at times, impossible. You can’t climb every surface in this game as you could in previous titles.</p>



<p>It’s guaranteed to take you a <strong>very long time </strong>to uncover everything the Assassin’s Creed Shadows map has to offer, and there’s plenty of side content up for grabs. Be prepared to spend many hours exploring the beautiful environments found in this game.</p>

<p>EA is “confident” that an extension of the licensing agreement between the company and the NFL will be reached and the partnership for Madden NFL will continue “for years to come”. That, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation.</p>



<p>For months now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-nfl-negotiating-license-extension-for-madden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negotiations between the league</a> and publisher regarding the exclusive NFL license that EA has held for 20 years have continued. The current deal is scheduled to end after the 2026 NFL season.</p>



<p>A reason behind the confidence of the partnership continuing are the current plans in development for the Madden NFL franchise.</p>



<p>“We have things in the works that are two, three, four years away,” one source said. “There’s a lot in the pipeline that has been heavily planned with designing well underway. Putting those resources into something that might be ending just wouldn’t make financial sense.”</p>



<h6 id="h-subscribe-insider-gaming-on-youtube">SUBSCRIBE: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming on YouTube</a></h6>



<p>When pressed on what that “pipeline” includes, sources wouldn’t go into much detail aside from saying there are features coming “brand new to the game”. They couldn’t confirm whether any will be ready for Madden 26 or not.</p>



<p>One NFL source said that the league is “so closely aligned with the development with the key beats and moments throughout the season” and that “over the years, that relationship has only gotten stronger.”</p>



<p>When asked about the possibility of EA retaining the license but in a non-exclusive matter, it wasn’t ruled out. However no one who spoke under the condition on anonymity think it’s likely unless the NFL is “blown away” by an offer to open it up.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that, as of publishing, nothing sources have said indicate that a deal has been signed. That said, there’s always the possibility that something has already been agreed up and limited people know about it. On the other side, until i’s are dotted and t’s are crossed, there’s always the chance things turn south.</p>



<p>When looking for official comment on the status of talks with EA regarding the license, the NFL chose to “hold off&nbsp;on providing any official commentary”.</p>
