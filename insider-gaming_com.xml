            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Krafton isn’t backing down from its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-says-former-subnautica-2-leadership-abandoned-their-responsibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims that former executives</a> at Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds had “abandoned” the game before their dismissal from the studio.</p>



<p>In an official response to the lawsuit filed against it by the studio’s founders, Krafton said that Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire <strong>“abandoned their roles as studio-wide Game Director and Technical Director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown Worlds entirely.”</strong> As far as former CEO Ted Gill, Krafton says that he was <strong>“focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game.”</strong></p>



<p>Krafton’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-subnautica-2-leadership-suing-krafton-after-firing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response continues</a> to allege that in July 2023, staff at Unknown Worlds, specifically Subnautica 2’s development director, had suggested that both Cleveland and McGuire were “checked out” and that they were confused about it. With both studio heads not around, Krafton says that it led to the game’s multiplayer delays from it’s original Q1 2024 release date.</p>



<p>By Spring 2025, the publisher says, the development team received “extensive feedback” from the internal teams which believed that Subnautica 2 wasn’t ready for a release into Early Access. Even Krafton’s CEO reportedly warned the studio heads that a <strong>“premature Early Access release of a highly anticipated sequel like Subnautica could cause irreversible harm to the entire IP franchise—pointing to the sequel to Kerbal Space Program as a prime example.”</strong> </p>



<p>Despite that, they say, the executives attempted to push forward the Early Access release of the game in order <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-wanted-to-delay-subnautica-2-to-avoid-250m-payout-lawsuit-claims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to hit the earnout</a>. That’s even with comments made that at the rate of current development, the game would <strong>“be in development for 30 years”</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>“Krafton, fearing how an underbaked EA Subnautica 2 would be received by both existing fans and the broader market, urged Cleveland and McGuire to return to their posts to generate a market-ready product that would not disappoint fans,” </strong>the document reads. <strong>“Cleveland and McGuire declined. In response to Krafton’s request for the Key Employees to return to lead the development of Subnautica 2, Gill stated that ‘[t]here’s no coming back to a job they didn’t have.'”</strong></p>



<p>It was also said that Cleveland and McGuire claimed they would self-publish Subnautica 2 without the support of the publisher, and began secretly downloading <strong>“massive amounts of confidential information from Unknown Worlds”.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“The Key Employees’ insistence on releasing the game immediately was singularly driven by self-interest in obtaining the earnout,” </strong>Krafton says. <strong>“At every turn during development, the Key Employees were laser focused on avoiding ‘a timeline that doesn’t tank the earnout opportunity’ and scheduling the release to maximize their payments.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Conversations throughout the post-acquisition period make clear the Key Employee’s [sic] focus was on their payday, and not on the game. As early as 2022, an employee who was due to receive a portion of the earnout stated that despite the significant delays in the game, he was confident ‘Ted [Gill] will&nbsp;concoct a scheme to get us that earnout.'”</strong></p>



<p>There’s plenty more in the response, which you can read for <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">yourself via Scribd</a>.</p>

<p>After the cancelation of Football Manager 25, developer Sports Interactive is back, teasing news for the upcoming Football Manager 26.</p>



<p>In a short video released on Wednesday, Sports Interactive gave players a glimpse at the “enhanced Match Day experience” from the game. They call it “just a taste of what you can expect” following the shift of the franchise to the Unity engine. At the end of the trailer, it says that a “Match Day First Look” is “coming soon”.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>“[Football Manager 26] promises to propel players on an adventure to shape their footballing destiny with our most immersive and visually rich Football Manager experience to date,”</strong> Sports Interactive said. <strong>“All the story-making potential is redefined as players get ever closer to the heart of the beautiful game.”</strong></p>



<p>Football Manager’s move to Unity has been a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-documented journey</a> that led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-to-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple delays</a> of Football Manager 25 only for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-cancelled-after-multiple-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game to be canceled</a> altogether.</p>

<p>Gamescom 2025 is right around the corner, so expect a huge surge of reveals and details on some of the biggest upcoming games. If you want to know exactly what to expect, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<p>With E3 dead and gone, Gamescom is the ultimate annual event for gaming fans to soak up the latest news and get their hands on huge titles ahead of launch, and 2025 is shaping up to be a huge year.</p>



<p>From the biggest AAA titles to indie games to keep an eye out for, we’ve highlighted everything announced for Gamescom 2025 in this guide.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Opening Night Live will showcase huge games. Image via Gamescom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Games set to headline Gamescom 2025 include Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Hollow Knight: Silksong, EA FC 26, and lots more—with surprises also set to feature.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-start-date-times-how-to-watch-how-long-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live event</a> will be stacked full of trailers, first-look exclusives, gameplay showcases, and special guests.
