            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Woojer is back with another iteration of the Vest, an innovative haptic device that allows you to feel the games you play. It’s a somewhat comical device at first blush that reveals itself as something quite impressive on use, and having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-haptic-vest-feel-games-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used the Woojer Vest 3</a> a year ago, I can attest to the Woojer Vest 4 being an evolution of sorts.</p>



<p>With the Woojer Vest 4, users can secure punchy haptic feedback from any audio experience, but it’s marketed much more for <strong>gaming</strong>. That’s where I connected with the Woojer Vest 4, linking up with some pulse-pounding games to get the most out of this device.</p>



<p>Is the Woojer Vest 4 worth it? Find out in this snapshot review.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-woojer-vest-4-any-good">Is The Woojer Vest 4 Any Good?</h2>



<p>I was very familiar with Woojer, having used the Vest 3 for many hours across desktop and VR gaming experiences. It was a seamless transition into the Vest 4, which takes on mostly the same form and function but boasts a few changes. I noticed that it <strong>felt more comfortable </strong>to wear, despite there being few differences in the makeup of the Vest itself.</p>



<p>As I mentioned, the Woojer Vest 4 might look funny at first glance, but there’s a lot of clever technology lurking under the surface. This haptic device boasts six transducers that offer immensely powerful and physical feedback when playing games.</p>



<p>In case you’re unfamiliar with the concept, the Woojer Vest 4 offers physical and haptic feedback in collaboration with the sound emitted from your games, music, and movies. It takes an input and cleverly translates that into vibration and shocking feedback, allowing you to feel, at multiple points around your body, the sound that you’re hearing.</p>



<p>I was eager to use the Woojer Vest 4 in a few rounds of <strong>Battlefield 6</strong>, so I connected the device to my PC and linked it with my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-a50-wireless-headset-review/">Astro A50 headset</a> and <strong>felt every gunshot, explosion, and rumble of tank tracks</strong>.</p>



<p>If there’s one complaint I have about the Woojer Vest 4, it’s that the latency is a bit off-putting for reflexive gameplay, and even the in-built low-latency mode that can be activated via the Woojer app doesn’t change much.</p>



<p>That being said, it wasn’t a deal-breaker. The Woojer Vest 4 is truly a one-size-fits-all device, and it even accommodated my much larger frame for several hours (note: battery life is advertised as 10 hours maximum). If you play VR in tandem with the Woojer Vest 4 (like I did), you’ll get a little toasty under the device, but it’s designed to be as breathable as possible.</p>



<p>If you’ve never seen or used a Woojer Vest, you’ll quickly get to grips with the Vest 4. It’s easy to use, comes with handy start-up guides, and has an app with a clean UI that makes it a wonder to use. The front-facing control unit is easy to reach, there’s a nice spot of RGB lighting, and the inputs are tactile.</p>



<p>There are so few things I found that turned me off from the Woojer Vest 4. Even the price point has come down from the near $500 heights of the Woojer Vest 3. It’s now floating around $340, which is more comfortable.</p>



<p>If you’re a VR fan and want to make your experiences much more immersive, I’d say the Woojer Vest 4 is an easy buy. If you’re a console or desktop-based gamer, it’s perhaps less worthwhile, and if you’re interested in getting the vest for movies or music, I’d probably suggest reconsidering that decision.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if the Woojer Vest 4 sounds like your kind of technology.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X ‘gaming soundbar’ ticked more than a few boxes for me. It was punchy, easy to use, and it had a tasty splash of RGB that made it a tantalising pick for any gamer. When I was putting together my Katana V2X review, I put this two-part soundbar through its paces, and I’m pleased to say that it impressed me in every aspect.</p>



<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X from Creative is the culmination of decades of work in the audio space, and it’s a compact yet powerful thing that looks great and works with just about any device you connect to it.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out my full review of the Sound Blaster Katana V2X soundbar.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-katana-v2x-soundbar-is-power-in-a-small-package">The Katana V2X Soundbar is Power in a Small Package</h2>



<p>The Sound Blaster Katana V2X is a perfectly sized solution for gamers short on space but eager to achieve some of the best audio results possible. The soundbar measures just 600mm by 95mm and has a height profile of just 62mm, which means it should fit nicely in front of, under, or behind any setup, television or otherwise.</p>



<p>This soundbar comes with a company subwoofer that’s 423mm tall, 250mm deep, and 116mm wide, and despite that scaled-down size factor, I found it to be a <strong>very </strong>capable piece of equipment. It adds a tasty touch of bass to the core soundbar without needing anything more than a coaxial connection to the back of the device.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about that sound power.</p>



<p>The Katana V2X soundbar boasts tri-amplified amps and represents an evolution of the earlier models of the same soundbar. It has two mid-range drivers, two tweeters, and the bolt-on subwoofer drive, all of which combine to produce a deep audio range, cinematic diversity, and stunning clarity.</p>



<p>It doesn’t take much to run the Katana V2X soundbar, and you can connect it to <strong>almost anything </strong>via Bluetooth 5.0, HDMI ARC, optical, aux, and USB-C. I would be blasting music via my phone in one minute, then pressing a single button and connecting to a PS5 in the next.</p>



<p>This multi-functional soundbar even has built-in microphones, which is a nice-to-have rather than a need-to-have. It’s all customizable too, and the sound profiles, RGB strip, and saved settings can all be tweaked.</p>



<p>Creative has been in the business of audio technology since 1981, and the Sound Blaster technology has been tried, tested, and optimized over <strong>many</strong> <strong>years</strong>. It’s now at a point where the Katana V2X soundbar should be considered one of the best gaming soundbars you can get for the price.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in the Katana V2X soundbar, it’ll set you back around $259 – $280, depending on where you buy it. I’d say it’s worth every penny, especially if you’re looking for a compact yet powerful audio solution, preferably being twinned with a TV and home console arrangement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 has revealed its roadmap for 2026 ahead of its release and hints at some new free and paid DLC.</p>



<p>If you enjoy cozy games, PowerWash Simulator is a familiar name to all. The simple maintenance simulator took the world by storm in 2022, getting everyone to do something many hate doing: cleaning. With its huge popularity, the game teamed up with iconic IPs like Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2024-every-game-shown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shrek</a>. A sequel was announced earlier this year, with a release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed just this month</a>. Now, with its release in a few hours, Futurlabs has shown off its planned roadmap for 2026, as well as how it’ll spend 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-powerwash-simulator-planning-three-major-paid-free-dlc-in-2026-teases-crossovers">PowerWash Simulator Planning Three Major Paid + Free DLC in 2026, Teases Crossovers</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have our PowerWash Simulator 2 Roadmap to share with you all 💦</p><p>Coming in 2025/2026 ⤵️</p><p>– 3 Paid IP DLC<br>– 3 Free Caldera Chronicles Jobs<br>– A bucket full of other planned additions</p><p>For the rest of 2025 we’re focusing on fixes, further optimisations and QOL improvements! <a href="https://t.co/eUOk2bfEzP">pic.twitter.com/eUOk2bfEzP</a></p></div>— PowerWash Simulator (@PowerWashSim) <a href="https://twitter.com/PowerWashSim/status/1980972487199379614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from PowerWash Simulator’s <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1980972487199379614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Twitter/X account</a>, the roadmap for 2026 is now available. As shown above, the team plans to have new paid and free DLC every quarter, starting with Q1. No specifics were given for what to expect, but the free DLC, called the Caldera Chronicles, will likely be similar to the original’s Muckingham Files. As for the paid DLC, it’ll be based on other IPs, so we may see some zany crossovers like last time. </p>



<p>Additionally, updates to the game, including community events and costumes, will be added over time. No DLC or new content is coming out in 2025, as the team plans to focus on QoL and optimization fixes. Reviews for PowerWash Simulator 2 came out today, and, for many, it maintains the charm and fun the original did. Given how much of a sleeper hit it was, its sequel may just give it the attention it deserves. Plus, with a Day One release on Xbox Game Pass, it’s sure to keep many of us company (and make us clean freaks again).</p>

<p>Sonic Rumble is making its way to PC and mobile devices in early November.</p>



<p>The party royale game, which capitalizes on Fall Guys’ success, has been in development for quite some time. Gameplay consists of players choosing their favorite Sonic characters and duking it out with others in fun and interesting mini-games. Despite positive feedback from early playtests, Sonic Rumble was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-delayed-yet-again-by-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met with multiple delays</a>. Earlier this month, however, it was announced that the game would release in November. Now, we finally have the official release date, as well as a cool new trailer to debut it.</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-rumble-sets-november-5th-2025-release-date">Sonic Rumble Sets November 5th, 2025 Release Date</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/ZSF2uZ7W5Ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a short YouTube video</a>, SEGA and Sonic Team officially reveal the release date for Sonic Rumble: <strong>November 5th</strong>. The game will launch on Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App Store, with pre-registration available now. Currently, there are no announced plans to bring the game to consoles like Nintendo Switch 2. Regardless, given its successful playtests, it may very well happen. Plus, given the popularity of similar titles like Fall Guys and the Sonic brand, it’ll likely gain some attention.</p>



<p>The last update for Sonic Rumble <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-pc-mobile-launch-november-2025/">provided some insight</a> as to what the full release will look and play like. With the playtests, the development team took the feedback from fans and fine-tuned many elements. For example, the progression and rewards system is now more streamlined, as well as an overhaul of the game’s user interface and onboarding. In addition, many new features like skills and joinable Crews with friends add more to the competitive side of the title. While it has taken a while for it to arrive, Sonic Rumble will finally see the light of day, and it won’t be long until we get to see how it goes.</p>
