<p>Competitive Call of Duty is being kicked off early in Black Ops 6, but it’s not being backed by Activision.</p>



<p>ZooMaa’s ‘The Flank’ has announced a triple-threat of tournaments that’ll take place between October 29 and November 6, and as a collective, they boast a $100,000 prize pool. It’s a CDL AR &amp; SMG spree that boasts 12 teams made up of four players each, and it comes before the 2025 CDL season has even been formally announced.</p>

<h2 id="h-into-our-own-hands">Into Our Own Hands</h2>



<p>From the moment Black Ops 6 was released, the more competitive players among us were looking for an angle from which they could earn. Wagers sprung up, $8s started running rampant on social media, and amateur kick-off tournaments were set up far and wide.</p>



<p>This is by far the biggest Black Ops 6 tournament to surface, and it comes mere days after the game was released.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Flank has revealed the following schedule:</p>



<ul>
<li>October 29 – $25,000 tournament</li>



<li>November 1 – $25,000 tournament</li>



<li>November 5/6 – $50,000 tournament</li>
</ul>



<p>On tonight’s episode of The Flank, the teams are being picked live, and the expectation is that it’ll be mostly CDL and Challengers players that make the cut, with a few Warzone competitors sprinkled in as cannon fodder.</p>



<p>It’s an exciting time to be a Call of Duty fan – the off-season and pre-season events hosted by brands like OpTic and The Flank are typically more entertaining than the official CDL events. Don’t tell Activision I said that, though.</p>

<p>Popular lifestyle and gaming organization, 100 Thieves, revealed a brand-new Adidas Merch line, which is set to drop this November. The drop, which includes shoes, sweatshirts and more, is another perfect example of how very few gaming organizations are doing it like 100 Thieves.</p>



<h2 id="h-100-thieves-x-adidas-merch-release-date">100 Thieves x Adidas Merch Release Date</h2>



<p>The new merch by Adidas and 100 Thieves is currently set to release on the following date:</p>



<ul>
<li>November 6, 2024.</li>
</ul>



<p>Those looking to purchase the drop can do so at the official <a href="https://t.co/lud7N2Kfep">Adidas website</a> and select retailers. However, 100 Thieves fans will be able to get early access to the new merch at <a href="https://100thieves.com/">100 Thieves’s website</a> on November 2, 2024.</p>



<p>100 Thieves has been dedicated to providing gamers with sleek-designed merch for years now in hopes of combining both lifestyle clothing and gaming.</p>

<li>Long Sleeve Shirt</li>



<li>Jacket</li>



<li>Shoes</li>

<p>It has become quite common for large brands, such as Adidas, to work with gaming companies and organizations. 100 Thieves, however, continues to put out merch like no other.</p>



<p>Will you be purchasing any of the upcoming 100 Thieves merch? While prices have not been revealed, it will more than likely be a bit more on the expensive end.</p>
