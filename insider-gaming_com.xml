<p>Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3 takes players back home with the return of Verdansk, adding new movement adjustments, original game modes, weapons and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-verdansk-details">Warzone Season 3 Verdansk Details</h2>



<p>With the return of the popular battle royale map, the developers are adopting a back-to-basics approach. The map will now feature 150 players, and the original announcer is returning. Players will be able to shoot during freefall and should expect new infill and exfil cinematics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, with Verdansk, we see the return of the original supply box colours, floating loot, and the original armour satchel. Moreover, the original bus station inventory and the original buy station placement will be returned, too. Furthermore, the Original Armor Box, Deployable Cover, Heartbeat Sensor, Ammunition Box, Recon Drone, and Trophy System will also return.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-movement-adjustments">Warzone Season 3 Movement Adjustments</h2>



<p>Warzone Season 3 makes movement adjustments while keeping omnimovement as the foundation. Originally, the battle royale mode adopted the movement from the multilayer mode; however, the developers have realised that new adjustments are needed to make the gameplay more engaging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With season 3, the player movement speed will be scaled back. These adjustments will help players experience Warzone more in line with its early days. Moreover, the devs are changing omni-sprint speed scaling and slide friction to address the strength of strafe engagements while preserving the feel of sprint-strafe reloading and general movement.</p>

<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-killstreaks-contracts-and-events">Warzone Season 3 Killstreaks, Contracts and Events</h2>



<p>Keeping the theme of bringing the originals back, Warzone Season 3 will see the return of Original Cluster (Mortar) Strike, Precision Airstrike, and UAV. Moreover, Contracts such as Original Bounty, Most Wanted, and Scavenger Contracts will reappear too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coming to events, players should expect the Original Fire Sale, Jail Break, Loadout Drop, and Restock events along with the Original Capture the Flag Gulag Variant.&nbsp;</p>
