<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is coming sooner than some might think.</p>



<p>As first mentioned on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQeluxqHMIE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest episode</a> of Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast, Insider Gaming has learned when the remake of the 2003 action-adventure game is set to release.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson has regularly reported that Ubisoft’s plans called for the Prince of Persia remake to release prior to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake</a>. And, as of publish, that remains the case.</p>



<p>According to sources close to the game, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is <strong>scheduled to release in mid-January 2026</strong>. In addition to the release plan, sources believe it’s likely that the next look at the game will come at The Game Awards on December 11, 2025. That’s always where the official date could be revealed.</p>



<p>First announced back in 2020, the Sands of Time Remake has had an up and down development cycle. It was originally scheduled to release in January 2021 but was delayed to March 2021 in December 2020. A month before its March release, the game was delayed again to an unspecified date.</p>



<p>After that, Ubisoft went silent for a while until it was announced that development was being moved to Ubisoft Montreal in May 2022. When Ubisoft Montreal took over, development on the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was completely restarted</a>. The restart included a more ““realistic approach” to the game, including a graphical overall, new animations, and new mechanics for both combat and parkour. </p>







<p>Another two years later, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-joins-development-on-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Toronto had joined</a> the development and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the game was planned</a> for a 2026 release.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[UK Unveils ‘Military Esports Games’ In Alliance with 40 Countries]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/uk-unveils-military-esports-games-in-alliance/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/uk-unveils-%E2%80%98military-esports-games%E2%80%99-in-alliance-with-40-countries.1361272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today, the International Defence Esports Games (IDEG) was unveiled in the United Kingdom. The initiative, which brings together ’40 allied nations’, endeavours to ‘sharpen the cyber skills that are critical for modern warfare’. This news comes mere months after the United Kingdom’s government moved to recognize esports as a ‘military sport’.</p>



<p>In a press release from the UK government, it was said that IDEG26, the inaugural tournament in the ecosystem, will take place next year and has been partially inspired by Ukrainian forces using drone simulator games to train operators in the field.</p>



<h2 id="h-from-the-battlefield-to-potentially-battlefield">From The Battlefield to (Potentially) <em><span>Battlefield</span></em></h2>



<p>It hasn’t yet been confirmed which games will serve as the foundation of the IDEG’s esports initiative, but it’s safe to assume it’ll be militaristic shooters, given the link.</p>



<p>Battlefield just got into the esports arena with a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-elite-series-announced-with-1-million-prize-pot/">$1 million REDSEC tournament</a>, so perhaps that could serve as a staging ground.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-launches-military-esports-games-to-boost-cyber-skills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> published by the UK government, the Minister for Veterans and People, Louise Sandher-Jones, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Strategic Defence Review has shown us clearly that the nature of war is changing, and we must change with it. The Government’s Plan for Change demands forces are ready for digital battlegrounds, where our personnel must be as skilled in cybersecurity and with controllers as they are in traditional combat.</p>



<p>Lessons from Ukraine have shown how gaming technology can train drone operators and develop the rapid decision-making skills essential for modern warfare. The International Defence Esports Games (IDEG) positions Britain at the forefront of this transformation, ensuring our armed forces are prepared for the conflicts of tomorrow.]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the statement, the Deputy Commander of Cyber and Specialist Operations Command said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The International Defence Esports Games represent a significant step forward in developing the cyber and digital skills essential for modern military operations. Lessons from conflicts including Ukraine have demonstrated the real-world value of gaming technology in training drone operators and enhancing cyber capabilities.</p>



<p>IDEG will strengthen our warfighting readiness whilst building crucial partnerships with allied nations who share our commitment to technological innovation in defence.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In October 2026, the first IDEG tournament will surface, taking place at the National Gaming and Esports Arena in Sunderland. As a hybrid event, it’ll also feature a cybersecurity, AI, and drone operations summit.</p>
