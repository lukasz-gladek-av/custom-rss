<p>Player spending in NBA 2K25 grew by a huge margin in the final months of 2025. So much so that it helped Take-Two Interactive meet their revenue forecast for the latest financial quarter.</p>



<p>According to Take-Two’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/quarterly-earnings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly earnings</a> for Q3 2025, the performance of NBA 2K25 “greatly surpassed” the company’s expectations. The report says that the “outstanding performance” of NBA 2K helped Take-Two reach the “guidance range,” or financial forecast, of the quarter. Essentially, Take-Two earned the amount of revenue from spending it predicted it would because of NBA 2K’s overperformance.</p>



<p>The statement reads that Recurrent Consumer Spending (RCS) in NBA 2K grew over 30 percent, attributed to “new features and innovation in our game modes.” In NBA 2K, this RCS metric includes virtual currency, in-game advertisements, and other in-game purchases. Overall, this helped Take-Two Interactive reach a 9% growth in RCS, despite only a 6% increase in mobile spending (below the company’s expectations), and a decline in GTA Online spending.</p>



<p>During this quarter, NBA 2K25 released a number of seasonal updates, including a patch in November that finally added Easy Anti-Cheat for PC users. Each seasonal update also came with a purchasable season pass for $10 or an upgraded “Hall of Fame” version of the pass for $20. Since release, NBA 2K25 has sold 7 million units.</p>



<p>While the overperformance of NBA 2K25 is certainly something Take-Two Interactive is happy about, it’s clear that the company is looking further down the line. In their earnings report they stated that 2025 could be the “strongest [year] ever” for the company. 2025 will see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-goes-gold-ahead-of-release/">the release of Civilization VII in just a few days</a>, followed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-mafia-the-old-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> in summer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/">Grand Theft Auto 6 in the fall</a>, and Borderlands 4. The company is confident they will hit “record levels” of revenue in Fiscal Year 2026 and 2027.</p>

<p>On social media, the OpTic Gaming team revealed that Pred is making his way back into the OpTic Texas starting roster ahead of Major II of the CDL 2025 season. This news comes more than two months after Pred went on a hiatus from the team after struggling with a personal situation that was never clearly explained.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-pred">Return of the Pred</h2>



<p>Pred has returned to OpTic Texas, and Huke is now out in the open, with his future sitting in an unknown state.</p>



<p>Here’s what OpTic posted on socials to address that situation:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Thank you </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Huke" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Huke</a><span> for your dedication &amp; passion playing for OpTic.

We appreciate you always, best of luck.</span></p></article></div>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/huke-replacing-pred-in-optic-texas-starting-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Huke joined OpTic Texas</a> on December 11, joining the team and taking up a familiar mantle while Pred took a break from competing to deal with his mental health. He mentioned during a stream yesterday that his return wasn’t far off, and just one day later, he’s back on the team.</p>



<p>The return comes just as the Call of Duty League prepares to land in Texas for an OpTic-backed Major event.</p>



<p>Recently, OpTic Texas fell short at the Madrid Major, being kicked out of the elimination bracket by the Carolina Royal Ravens, who ultimately ended up going through to finish in fourth place.</p>



<p>The Major in Madrid was the first EU-based CDL tournament ever, and it was a boon for OverActive Media, the event’s host. The event saw 12,000 people attend – 80% of which came from <strong>outside </strong>Spain. The broadcast also picked up 250,000 peak viewers on platforms like YouTube.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see Pred back on OpTic Texas? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-interactive-reconfirms-gta-6-will-launch-in-fall-2025.1102530/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rockstar Games has once again reconfirmed that Grand Theft Auto 6 will launch in 2025, despite the lack of a new trailer.</p>



<p>The announcement was made during <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take-Two Interactive’s quarterly earnings</a> for Q3 2025.</p>



<p>“Looking ahead, this calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for Take-Two, as we plan to launch…Grand Theft Auto VI in the Fall,” it read.</p>



<p>The news may come somewhat as a surprise to some readers, as online discourse for the past few months has led most to believe that the game will undoubtedly be delayed due to the lack of updates.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, GTA 6 has not received its second trailer, with the first being released in December 2023. From trailer one to trailer 2, it’s now the longest time between trailers seen for a Rockstar Games titles.</p>



<p>That being said, Rockstar Games and take-Two Interactive seemingly are in no rush as the games reveal trailer broke several YouTube records, including, Most Viewed Video Game Reveal on YouTube in 24 Hours,’ ‘Most Viewed YouTube Video in 24 Hours,’ and ‘Most Liked Video Game Trailer on YouTube in 24 Hours’.</p>



<p>In short, Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games are confidence that no matter when the next GTA 6 trailer releases, it’s going to do big numbers and with a staked lineup for Take-Two releases this year, they might be thinking that focusing the spotlight on other games for the time being makes the most sense.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to GTA 6? And do you think it will actually release in 2025? </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-cs2-active-duty-map-pool/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-the-cs2-active-duty-map-pool-all-currently-active-cs2-maps.1102476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-cs2-active-duty-map-pool/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Valve and numerous community creators have created hundreds of Counter-Strike maps over the years, but CS2 currently utilizes what’s called the Active Duty map pool. Active Duty maps, in Valve’s own words, represent the most balanced and competitive maps in the total pool.</p>



<p>But the Active Duty pool is subject to change, in order to keep the iconic first-person shooter gameplay from feeling too stale.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-current-cs2-active-duty-map-pool">What is the current CS2 Active Duty map pool?</h2>



<p>The Active Duty map pool consists of seven maps that are used in CS2’s primary competitive mode, Premier. The Active Duty map pool is also the selection of maps used at every competitive tournament, from smaller online and local events to the illustrious Majors.</p>



<p>While Valve doesn’t always make a change to the Active Duty pool after every Major, the changes do occur then. This gives pro teams time to get used to the current map pool before the start of the next Major.</p>



<p><strong>Here is the current Active Duty map pool in Counter-Strike 2:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Ancient</li>



<li>Anubis</li>



<li>Dust II</li>



<li>Inferno</li>



<li>Mirage</li>



<li>Nuke</li>



<li>Train</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-adds-train-to-map-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Train is the newest addition to the Active Duty pool</a>, having been added in January 2025 after making its CS2 debut months earlier. Mirage is the longest standing map in the Active Duty pool, and it is the only map that has never been rotated out. Mirage has been played at every single Counter-Strike Major, dating back to DreamHack Winter 2013. Overpass, Cobblestone, Vertigo, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-is-cache-in-counter-strike-2-answered/">and Cache</a> have also spent time in the Active Duty pool.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Active Duty pool is only a fraction of the total number of maps available in Counter-Strike 2. CS2 also features newer community creations like Edin and Basalt, or the maps specifically made for modes like Wingman or Arms Race. Still, Active Duty maps are the most recognizable ones to most Counter-Strike players.</p>



<p>How would you change the Active Duty map pool after the next Major? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The tease of wireless mouse functionality for the new Joy-Cons on the Nintendo Switch 2 appears to be more than just that. A recently <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">discovered patent</a> seems to explain the feature while also providing drawings of the mouse functionality.</p>



<p>According to the patent, the Joy-Con features a “mouse operation sensor” that “detects reflected light from the detected surface that changes by moving on the detected surface with one of the first side surface and the second side surface placed on the detected surface.”</p>







<p>The sensor is located under the side of the Joy-Con—callout 170 in the images below. Based on the images, it appears players will be able to use one Joy-Con as a mouse while using the other in a standard way. Both Joy-Cons, however, appear to have the mouse sensor feature.</p>



<p>You can see the patent drawings depicting the feature below (click the image to enlarge).</p>

<p>Full details on how this new use for the Joy-Con have yet to be revealed. However, it could be assumed that Nintendo will go into more detail on that when it hosts its Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-direct-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">direct event on April 2</a>. During the show, Nintendo is expected to reveal full specs about the console as well as show the first set of games for the system. A price and release date announcement is also anticipated.</p>
