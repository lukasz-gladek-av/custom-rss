            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Over three dozen United States (US) lawmakers want the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to dive deeper into the pending sale of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electronic Arts</a> (EA).</p>



<p>In a press release recently shared online, the leaders of the Labor Caucus along with over 40 members of US Congress are asking FTC chair Andrew Ferguson to take another look at the sale. In the letter, the Labor Caucus chairs say they have “serious concerns” regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sale of EA to the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund</a> (PIF). </p>







<p><strong>“We are committed to preserving fair, competitive labor markets and safeguarding American jobs, and given the impact of this acquisition on workers, labor market concentration, and the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. video game industry, we urge you to thoroughly review this transaction,”</strong> <a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/media/press-releases/labor-caucus-calls-for-review-of-electronic-arts-acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the letter reads</a>. </p>



<p><strong>“Workers in the video game industry are already navigating an environment marked by instability, shrinking opportunities, and repeated rounds of layoffs. EA is one of the largest employers of video game workers in the United States, and evidence suggests the company already wields significant wage-setting power.”</strong></p>











<h2 id="h-congress-worried-ea-sale-could-lead-to-more-layoffs">Congress Worried EA Sale Could Lead To More Layoffs</h2>



<p>The lawmakers add that with the deal including $20 billion in debt being added to EA after the sale, the new owners would be incentivized to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-employees-publicly-oppose-sale-saudi-arabia-equity-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hold more layoffs</a> in order to recoup money. They also express worry that more offshoring, restructuring, and studio closures could come after the closing of the deal.</p>



<p><strong>“These actions would not only jeopardize thousands of high-skilled American jobs, but also further concentrate already fragile labor<br>markets for software engineers, artists, writers, testers, and other professionals whose skills are essential to the industry,”</strong> they said.</p>



<p>The Labor Caucus chairs say that FTC’s 2023 merger guidelines explicitly state that any mergers that harm workers or allow firms to reduce labor demand “may violate antitrust laws”. Due to the size of the deal—$55 billion—the group feels that extra scrutiny is essential to protecting the rights of American workers that are involved. </p>



<p>They are asking the FTC to <strong>“conduct a thorough investigation into the labor market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA’s existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labor-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labor outcomes.”&nbsp;</strong></p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is Getting a New Ban System, But Players Don’t Think It’s Tough Enough]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ban-system-not-enough/</link>
            <guid>1417837</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders underwent a major update today as Embark Studios delivered Headwinds, the first of <strong>four </strong>content drops coming between now and April. It introduced seven new quests, a minor map condition, two new Augments, and some other bits and pieces. The team at Embark also revealed that, very soon, a new anti-cheat <strong>ban system </strong>will be implemented to combat malicious players.</p>



<p>In a footnote in the patch notes for the recent ARC Raiders update, the team explained that a permaban is the result of a cheating spree, but players don’t think getting to that point is happening <strong>fast enough </strong>for it to be effective.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-need-tougher-anti-cheat">Does ARC Raiders Need Tougher Anti-Cheat?</h2>



<p>Over the festive period, ARC Raiders players were suffering under the weight of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploits, cheaters</a>, and a bit of content stagnation brought on by everyone at Embark Studios going off on a well-deserved break.</p>



<p>Now that they’re back, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive roadmap</a> has been revealed, detailing content up to April 2026.</p>



<p>Today, the first part of that roadmap, an update dubbed ‘Headwinds’, was delivered. It introduced some fresh content, a map condition that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fills Buried City with birds</a>, and seven short new quests for players to conquer. It effectively opens up some of the game’s lore, too.</p>



<p>However, one element in the recent patch notes hasn’t filled players with the joy that the positive notes have.</p>



<p>Almost at the end <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-13-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of the update</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A three strikes progressive ban system is in the process of being implemented. Bans will progress from 30 days, to 60 and finally a permaban for repeat offenders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Those who tussled with these more malicious players in recent weeks feel that the ban loop isn’t strong enough for anyone <strong>caught cheating</strong>. The item was subtitled ‘Anti-Cheat’, but it reads like this is a <strong>general </strong>approach to banning players caught breaking the rules, and not <em>just </em>cheaters.</p>



<p>In any case, a cheater being banned for just 30 days feels like little more than a slap on the wrist. The second infraction earns them a 60-day penalty, but it takes <strong>three offences </strong>for them to receive a permanent ban. That’s three times that somebody could be caught <strong>using cheats to manipulate the game </strong>before Embark Studios says, ‘Enough.’</p>



<p>Other extraction shooters, like Escape from Tarkov, issue permanent bans upon <strong>a single detection </strong>of cheating, and they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheaters-banned-battlestate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly reveal which users</a> have been kicked from the game. Sure, they might make a new account and come back, but the strong-arm approach is there at the initial stage.</p>







<p>Do you think ARC Raiders needs tougher anti-cheat, and that Embark Studios is risking displeasing the majority of its userbase? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
