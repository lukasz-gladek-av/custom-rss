            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-streamers-death-of-game/</link>
            <guid>1426687</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders was released at the end of October, emerging into a blossoming extraction shooter space and making immense waves. It quickly became one of the most successful games of 2025, smashing sales expectations and topping charts worldwide, both in terms of players and <strong>viewers</strong>.</p>



<p>However, that latter aspect has surfaced in a nasty way in recent days. On social media, the concept of <strong>streamers ruining ARC Raiders </strong>has gained traction from a debate perspective. Many feel that Embark Studios could be listening too much to streamers, a concern that could lead to the game’s ‘death’.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-streamers-ruin-arc-raiders">Will Streamers Ruin ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p>In the weeks that followed the launch of ARC Raiders, we saw countless content creators leap head over heels into the game. It made sense, as it was a game that made for excellent content, and for a while, it was one of the most-watched games on Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>It even spawned a creator-backed ‘war’ between the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/">Hutch and TheBurntPeanut</a>, which was fun for all of about five minutes.</p>



<p>Now, a comment that surfaced on social media has spawned a somewhat virulent debate, suggesting that ‘try hard, super f***ing losers’ that populate streaming and social spaces will bring about the death of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>In a post on Twitter (now X), <a href="https://x.com/TheTopGEight/status/2019239505971278265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ghost of Eight wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Call of duty died because they listened to the streamers. H1Z1 died because they tried to make it competitive. Arc Raiders is going to die if they listen to the streamers. Gaming is dead because of streamers and developers listening to social media, which is mostly filled with try hard, super f***ing losers</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The post quickly gained traction, racking up hundreds of thousands of impressions and stacks of comments from the community. In one comment, a user stood on the side of the developer, admitting that ‘streamers are the loudest voices in the room, so devs think they represent the majority.’</p>



<p>In another comment, a user bagged on streamers and their fickle, collective mentality: ‘The same streamers that immediately go and play whatever new game is out. These clowns have zero loyalty.’</p>



<p>In recent weeks, ARC Raiders has suffered under the weight of exploits, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/">cheaters</a>, and a slow update cadence that is rewarding players with <strong>one new map in five months</strong>. Most of the complaints regarding all this come from the streamers that generate audiences in the tens of thousands while playing ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>As another user wrote under Ghost of Eight’s comment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I agree. Streamers cry to change things like it’s their own personal playground.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Far too often, we see the power of streamers, as one thing commented on by the likes of shroud brings about a major change in a game. Admittedly, it can sometimes be for the better, but the examples are few and far between.</p>







<p>It’s the PvE vs PvP debate all over again. Do you think streamers are ruining ARC Raiders? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-ninjutsu-nioh-3/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You should not underestimate the power of Ninjutsu under any circumstances in Nioh 3. If a boss is performing a big attack, leaving you cowering, you should be hurling some Ninjutsu its way to deal damage and maybe even immobilize it.</p>



<p>Ninjutsu is the secondary aspect of the Ninja style in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/nioh-3/" id="170917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a>. Samurai is all about hitting hard; Ninja is about hitting often. Another way to inflict damage (or disable) is by using the best Ninjutsu weapons and gear.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-ninjutsu-you-should-use-in-nioh-3">Best Ninjutsu You Should Use In Nioh 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>OP. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Burrow is hands down the best Ninjutsu ability you need to equip in Nioh 3.</strong></p>



<p>Nioh 3 becomes a different game once you unlock and equip Burrow. Tired of unmissable Boss attacks hitting you? Tired of being struck by those sneaky, irritating combos you can’t remember the sequence for and don’t know how to deal with? Are you also tired of getting hit by annoying mob enemies when you just want to get past? Burrow is the answer.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>This is an absolute game-changer and lifesaver in one. We all know how difficult it can be to dodge or evade a boss’ grab attacks. Why try to dodge when you can quite literally vanish for a few seconds underground? Not only that, but you can emerge behind the enemy and deal extra damage.</p>



<p>It’s much handier for boss fights than it is for general exploration, so bear this in mind. It might be worthwhile swapping it out for something else in the meantime. But given that the biggest timesink will undoubtedly be bosses, Burrow is the clear favorite here.</p>

<p><strong>You get three slots to use in your Ninjutsu setup for Nioh 3, and you should be using Burrow, Cicada Shell, and the Paralysis Shuriken.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-trophy-list-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3 Trophy List—How To Get All Achievements &amp; Trophies &amp; Difficulty Rating</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This is the best Ninjutsu setup by default. Now, is it an imperative in every situation? Absolutely not, but these are the best three to have together, so let’s explain why.</p>



<h3 id="h-burrow">Burrow</h3>



<p>Pretty much see above. There is few very circumstances where Burrow won’t save your life, give you some kind of advantage, or get you somewhere quicker by evading or sidestepping a mob. It’s the best Ninjutsu, and given what it does, it seems a natural fit for the bottom slot.</p>



<h3 id="h-cicada-shell">Cicada Shell</h3>



<p>You might sense that we’re putting defense and self-preservation as more important factors than offense, and you would be correct. Cicada Shell makes it so that once activated, if you get hit, you will <strong>teleport behind the enemy</strong>. This is another defensive solution that can get you out of a fix and help you deliver some cheap shots.</p>



<h3 id="h-paralysis-shuriken">Paralysis Shuriken</h3>



<p>This one is fairly interchangeable depending on the opponent. If you’re facing a boss, paralyzing them is always a HUGE benefit. Anything that immobilizes a foe, slows them down, and generally gives you a chance to get in some free shots needs to be utilized to the fullest. Plus, if you can synergize the paralysis infliction with gear or Accessories, it will speed up and prolong the effect.</p>



<p>If the boss has a certain weakness, then maybe the fire version of the Shuriken should be equipped, and so on.</p>

<p>YAPYAP isn’t just about casting Spells and causing chaos, as there are plenty of monsters to avoid and counter, some of which are truly terrifying.</p>



<p>Monsters in YAPYAP come in a variety of forms, ranging from the frustrating, but easily defeatable, to powerful Monsters that will quickly end any run if you encounter them.</p>



<p>For tips on how to counter every monster in YAPYAP, Insider Gaming has you covered, and more monsters will be added to this article when counters are discovered.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-yapyap-monsters">All YAPYAP Monsters</h2>

<h3 id="h-goblins">Goblins</h3>



<p>The biggest threat posed by Goblins is if they overwhelm you with their numbers, but they can easily be kept at bay by using the Aero Spell with the Wand of Winds. This doesn’t eliminate their threat entirely, however, but there’s an easy way to do that.</p>



<p>With the Grotesque Wand, cast Fish-Yuk at a Goblin to turn them into a fish, which can then be picked up and moved, and you can throw them off the edge into the abyss. If there’s no edge nearby, turning them into fish still allows for a quick getaway.</p>



<h3 id="h-guards">Guards</h3>



<p>Red Knight Guards are one of the most powerful monsters in YAPYAP and can eliminate you with just a couple of hits. They do have weaknesses; however, if you have the right tools in your arsenal, knocking their helmet off is a great way to earn extra Chaos.</p>



<p>Be quiet around the Guards, as they are attracted to your voice, and loop around them to create space, as they are slow movers. With the Wand of Illusions, you can cast the Float Oculus spell and take over a Guard, moving them out of the way, or attacking other monsters with them to clear an area.</p>



<p>The Wand of Illusions can also be used to cast a duplicate of yourself with the Echo Me Spell, which is an easy way to distract the Guards, and the Fish-Yuk Spell can turn Guards into Fish, but there’s a limited time to get rid of them before it transforms back.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-eye">The Eye</h3>



<p>The Eye has an annoying habit of spawning in areas where there is limited room, making it hard to avoid its ranged attack that quickly blitzes through your health bar, but thankfully, it is a static enemy that can’t move.</p>



<p>Breaking the line of sight with The Eye disables its attack, so jump behind anything you can to neutralize it, with walls and pillars being the best options. Once the line of sight has been erased, The Eye will disappear, but it isn’t gone completely and will, more than likely, return.</p>



<p>While it’s not too difficult to avoid The Eye, the real danger comes when it serves as a distraction with other monsters in the area, so be alert. It’s another monster that you can turn into a fish, but there is a short period of time to get rid of it.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-slime">The Slime</h3>



<p>The Slime is a slow-moving cube of jelly that is mostly harmless, as the damage it deals is low, but getting trapped inside the cube will slow you down majorly, making you easy pickings for another monster.</p>



<p>Though they are mostly easy to avoid, unless they’re blocking your exit, they’re also easy to defeat using the Piss-Yuk Spell with the Grotesque Wand, so cast the Spell and make sure to keep a constant flow of noise to increase the rate of urination.</p>



<p>Unlike other enemies, The Slime cannot be transformed into a Fish.</p>



<h3 id="h-spider">Spider</h3>



<p>The Spider is one of the most terrifying monsters in all of YAPYAP, and the best point of action is to just avoid it entirely. Keep an ear out for scuttling sounds, which are a big indicator that an eight-legged freak is nearby, and navigate cautiously.</p>



<p>That’s all well and good, but sometimes there is no avoiding the Spider. In these instances, the Wand of Fire is the best bet, as it can deal decent damage with Ignis Breath and Ignis Doom, but the most valuable Spell is Ignis Legs, providing a speed boost to help you escape.</p>



<p>Turning the Spider into a fish with the Fish-Yuk spell is an option, but the duration is very short, so use any time to escape and don’t try to pick the fish up.</p>



<h3 id="h-mimic">Mimic</h3>



<p>The Mimic can easily catch you off guard, as it will take the form of you or a teammate, but it is relatively easy to defeat, with most Spels that deal damage effective against them.</p>



<p>Similar to Goblins, the Fish-Yuk Spell with the Grotesque Wand is an easy option, turning them into fish that you can throw off the edge of the map into the abyss, but any damage-dealing spell with the Wand of Fire is similarly effective.</p>



<h3 id="h-gargoyles">Gargoyles</h3>



<p>Gargoyles fall into the same sort of category as Mimics and Goblins, as they’re not too challenging when isolated and can be easily defeated with the Fish-Yuk approach and hauling them off the edge of the world.</p>



<p>The biggest threat posed by Gargoyles is the potential jump scare, as they will start off looking like any Gargoyle statue on the map before springing to life. As such, take good care around these objects, and be ready to fight back.</p>



<h3 id="h-time-ghost">Time Ghost</h3>



<p>There is no defeating the Time Ghost, which appears when you and your teammates run out of time, and it will kill you instantly, and there’s no counter.</p>



<p>Instead, keep a close eye on the countdown at the top-left of the screen, which indicates how much time you have left, and ensure you extract before the timer reaches zero.</p>
