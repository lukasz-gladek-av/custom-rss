            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-will-last-80-hours-with-side-content/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed by the creative director of Assassin’s Creed Shadows that the game will last more than 80 hours if you’re pursuing all the side content available. The base campaign will last around 30 to 40 hours, depending on your playstyle, but that extra meat on the bones more than <strong>doubles </strong>what’s available.</p>



<p>This is a similar tactic employed in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, which is the longest Assassin’s Creed game, thanks to the sheer amount of side activities and expansions. Those hoping for a slimmer experience akin to that found in 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage are out of luck – but we kind of knew that.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-expansive">Expansive</h2>



<p>In an interview with Genki, Jonathan Dumont explained that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is nothing short of expansive.</p>



<p>If the campaign being 30 – 40 hours long wasn’t enough, the side content will bring up your total playtime to around 80 hours, depending on your style. If <strong>that </strong>wasn’t enough, the team at Ubisoft is also looking at adding New Game+ and ‘other modes’ based on post-launch feedback.</p>



<p>The full breakdown <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1896738405993865410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Genki</a> on social media included several tidbits of information about the upcoming game, which launches later this month. The ‘vast, dynamic, breathing open world’ will be populated by recruitable characters, minigames, and dynamic world elements like a weather system and day-night cycle.</p>



<p>By all accounts, Assassin’s Creed Shadows seems like a solid title, but it’ll need to be something special to pull Ubisoft out of the rut it finds itself in. The game has proven to be a controversial one in the months leading up to its release, but Jonathan Dumont pointed out that the developers are more interested in ‘delivering an outstanding game.’</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-barber-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2%E2%80%99s-barber-mode-update-detailed-in-livestream.1125612/</guid>

<p>Warhorse Studios recently hosted a livestream that touched on the future of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The game, which might be my GOTY, was released in February to an overwhelmingly positive reception, turning heads worldwide. Midway through March, the ‘Barber Mode’ will be added to the game in the first of a long list of major updates.</p>



<p>During the stream, the team at Warhorse Studios revealed some of the hairstyles and facial hair sets coming to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 with the Barber Update, which doesn’t have a confirmed release date at present.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changing-henry">Changing Henry</h2>



<p>Henry of Skalitz, the game’s protagonist, has aged since the first title, but he’s still a <strong>bit </strong>of a babyface. When the Barber Mode update arrives, that’ll change, as players will have the option to adorn the medieval adventurer in a beard and mullet if they so desire.</p>



<p>The full suite of beards, moustaches, goatees, and hairstyles was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1izqgrp/kcd2_beardstyles_from_the_new_barber_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">captured by eagle-eyed users on Reddit</a>.</p>



<p>The team at Warhorse Studios also took time to dive into the ‘Hardcore Mode’ update that’s also on the horizon. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 represents a realistic and challenging experience, but the Hardcore Mode will take things to the next level.</p>



<p>With this punishing setting enabled, players will lose most of their UI, enemies will be tougher, fast travel will be locked, and your position will never be shown on the map. It might be one of the most immersive ways to play the game, but it’s guaranteed to be stressful for even the most talented gamer.</p>



<p>The Barber Mode will be the first in a long line of releases coming to expand the world of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Last month, the team at Warhorse Studios revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">three major DLCs</a> coming throughout the year.</p>



<p>Are you eager to change Henry’s look in KCD2 with the Barber Mode update? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>It was recently revealed that Tencent had made further investment in FromSoftware’s parent company, Kadokawa. The move, which has been labelled ‘part of a capital business alliance between the submitter and the issuer’, brings Tencent’s stake in Kadokawa to 7.97%. For a point of reference, Sony’s stake is just 10%.</p>



<p>The additional stake represented a 1.1% increase in Tencent’s investment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-key-strategies">Key Strategies</h2>



<p>Tencent is one of the biggest players in the gaming space, which is hardly a secret. The super-sized gaming titan has fingers in many pies and investments across the board, giving the company a foothold in almost every corner of the gaming world.</p>



<p>The latest investment into Kadokawa means very little in the grand scheme of things, and it’s a humble sum compared to some of Tencent’s more recent investments. The news was confirmed recently by <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC038QE0T00C25A3000000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei</a>, a Japanese outlet.</p>



<p>For example, in 2022, Tencent’s stake in Ubisoft increased from 4.5% to 9.99%, an increase of more than 50%.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Tencent owns 99% of Riot Games, 84% of Supercell, 40% of Epic Games, and around 10% of KRAFTON.</p>



<p>In December, Kadokawa was in the news after rumours surfaced suggesting that Sony was fielding an intention to acquire the company. This turned out to be an investment rather than a full buyout, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-alliance-kadokawa/">Sony formed a ‘strategic alliance’</a> with the company, securing 10% of the firm’s shares.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-season-20-coming-march-18/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fallout 76’s <strong>20th season </strong>arrives on March 18, and it has been dubbed ‘Glow of the Ghoul’. This is in recognition of the most critical element of this new season – players can finally become a ‘ghoul’ character in the game. This long-awaited change was revealed several months ago, and when Glow of the Ghoul finally arrives on March 18, it’ll be available in-game.</p>



<p>Fallout 76 Season 20 will run from March through to June, and plenty of events and limited-time offers are popping up over the next few months, including an all-new event called ‘The Big Bloom’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fallout-76-glow-of-the-ghoul">Fallout 76 – Glow of the Ghoul</h2>



<p>Glow of the Ghoul ushers in one of the most dramatic changes to the post-apocalyptic MMORPG in recent years. Players will be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-ghoul-character-meta-change/">turn into a ghoul</a>, soaking up radiation and altering their image, biochemistry, and abilities – but don’t worry, the change can be reverted if you don’t enjoy the new build.</p>



<p>On March 20, Bethesda Game Studios is kicking off a ghoul-based photo mode contest to see which characters look the best with this new build base.</p>



<p>Here’s the full calendar for Fallout 76 Season 20:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Big Bloom starts on April 29 and runs to May 13. This new limited-time event is one of the first seasonal events to be added to the game in a very long time, as the calendar typically portrays a rinse-and-repeat model of prior events. That’s true here, but The Big Bloom is a nice addition to the rotation.</p>



<p>Of course, a new season also means a stack of new items in the Atomic Shop, so it’ll be worth keeping an eye open with the resets to see what pops up. This season is all about toxicity, radiation, and disease – which is probably more exciting than it sounds.</p>



<p>Here’s a short trailer promoting Fallout 76 Season 20:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Bethesda Game Studios is doing a great job of keeping the fires stoked in Fallout 76, but some players have criticised the Season 20 update on social media. Aside from the new ghoul transformation – which not everyone will take advantage of – Fallout 76 Season 20 offers very little in the way of changes.</p>



<p>Typically, Fallout 76 has one or two major updates a year, and while this fairly dramatic change is a series first and quite a milestone for Fallout fans, it’s not <strong>exactly </strong>what fans were hoping to see for the game’s <strong>twentieth season</strong>.</p>



<p>Will you be turning into a ghoul when Fallout 76 Season 20 launches on March 18? Let me know in the comments.</p>
