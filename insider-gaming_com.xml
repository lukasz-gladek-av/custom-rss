<p>PC gaming is outgrowing console gaming when it comes to total number of players.</p>



<p>In the 2025 PC and Console Gaming Report from <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Newzoo</a>, global data indicates that more players started playing games on PC than they did on console. According to the report, PC player numbers rose 3.9% year-over-year (YoY) from 873.5 million to 907.5 million in 2024. Console players growth, on the other hand, while still up, only grew 2.3% from 615.6 million to 629.5 million.</p>



<p>Looking to the future, Newzoo projects that player growth will steadily continue to rise for 2025 and through 2027. It projects that PC numbers will increase to around 930.1 million this year while console players will jump to 653.1 million. By the end of 2027, Newzoo suggests that PC and console player numbers will be around 971.7 million and 698 million, respectively.</p>

<p>Despite PC players growing at a higher rate and there being more of them, console revenue was slightly ahead of PC. In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/console-gaming-revenue-fell-in-2024-thanks-to-premium-game-revenue-dropping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console gaming made $42.8 billion</a> in revenue while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/58-of-pc-gaming-revenue-came-from-microtransactions-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC gaming came</a> in at $37.3 billion. With a total of $80.2 billion for the year, that was a bit less than the $81.9 billion in revenue in 2023. Still, it’s expected that gaming revenue in general will grow in 2025 to $85.2 billion. By 2027, Newzoo expects revenue to surpass $92 billion for the year.</p>



<p>A reason for the increase in overall gaming revenue projections? New hardware. The Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025 and the expected new hardware around 2027 will lead to more gaming purchases for players.</p>

<p>Console gaming revenue fell 3.9% year-over-year (YoY) thanks to a 14% YoY drop by premium paid games. This according to the 2025 PC and Console Gaming Report from Newzoo.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report</a>, which takes gaming data from around the world, Premium Games accounted for $19.9 billion in console gaming revenue in 2024. That was still good for 46% of the $42.8 billion in total revenue for year. However, it was the only business model to see a decrease on the platform.</p>



<p>Microtransactions made up 32% of console gaming revenue, pulling in $13.9 billion for the year. That was a 4.5% increase over 2023’s amount. Following behind were subscriptions, which grew 14.1% YoY with $6.9 billion in revenue. Lastly, DLC made up 5% of the total revenue with $2.2 billion. That 5% is still a 2.5% increase compared to 2023.</p>



<p>As far as what led to the growth in revenue for microtransactions and DLC, the report points to six games. On the microtransaction side, Fortnite, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and NBA 2K25 helped push the total up 4.5%. For DLC, it was Elden Ring, Diablo 4, and Destiny 2 leading the way. </p>



<p>Console gaming revenue came in slightly higher than PC, which pulled in $37.3 billion in 2024. It also saw a different trend as PC gaming revenue saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/58-of-pc-gaming-revenue-came-from-microtransactions-in-2024/">58% attributed to microtransactions</a>. </p>



<p>Newzoo’s projections have console gaming revenue predicted to grow to $47.3 billion in 2025 and all the way to $52.4 billion by 2027.</p>

<p>The Last of Us Complete Edition is now available on PlayStation 5 for $99.99. It was published today, following announcements from Naughty Dog that revealed a physical edition will be launching in July.</p>



<p>This is yet another re-release of the franchise that spans just <strong>two games </strong>but has managed to cover more than a decade of entertainment. I’m a massive fan, and this will be an easy purchase. And as you read this, I’m arranging my pre-order for the physical collector’s edition.</p>

<h2 id="h-back-in-the-apocalypse">Back in the Apocalypse</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_complete_ps5_collectors_edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snapshot blog post</a>, Naughty Dog wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Available today on the PlayStation 5 console, The Last of Us Complete allows players to experience both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II Remastered in one package. </p>



<p>The Last of Us Complete makes it easier than ever to experience the full story on PS5, whether you’ve played both entries, just one, or have yet to immerse yourself in the world of Joel, Ellie, Abby, and all of our characters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans with a little more dough in their pockets (and patience) can pre-order The Last of Us Complete Collector’s Edition for $109.99, exclusively from PlayStation. It’s an attractive version of the game that comes with an exclusive steelbook, comics, and lithographic art prints. </p>



<p>You’ll also get a ‘thank you letter’ penned by Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last of Us.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Annoyingly, the Collector’s Edition comes with physical discs <strong>only,</strong> and there’s no indication that it comes with digital ownership codes, which means if you’ve got a Digital Edition console, you’re buying this for the collectables, and those alone aren’t worth $109.99. </p>
