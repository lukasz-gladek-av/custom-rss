<p>Sledgehammer Games once had plans to have a massive Halo collaboration in Modern Warfare 3, where some Halo maps would come to Call of Duty.</p>



<p>That’s according to leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1884053078682566742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@TheGhostOfHope</a> on X (formerly Twitter), who has seemingly returned back to form and started to leak details in regards to Call of Duty again after taking a break.</p>



<p>In a new post, Hope revealed that “Sledgehammer Games had plans to do a huge collaboration with Halo with Modern Warfare III which would have added various maps from the Halo franchise.”</p>



<p>Another leaker and dataminer by the name of Alaix seemingly confirmed the details by saying, “maybe one day i’ll feel generous enough to share some of the screenshots I have from this collab.”</p>



<p>While it’s currently not known on what maps, weapons, or outfits would have made it into Modern Warfare 3, it’s intriguing to know that there where at least plans at one stage, with Alaix’s comments implying that there was even assets made.</p>



<p>It means that Microsoft could visit such collaborations again in the future, depending on how the Call of Duty franchise performs and how much interest such collaborations would bring in.</p>



<p>But this isn’t the first time we’ve heard that Microsoft have been considered Call of Duty and other Microsoft IP crossovers. In November 2024, it was claimed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-doom-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soon feature collaborations between Halo, DOOM, and Gears of War</a>. While those leaks are yet to come to fruition, where there’s some, there’s fire.</p>
