<p>Reflector Entertainment, the developer behind Unknown 9: Awakening, is the latest studio to be hit by layoffs. The news comes after what its CEO calls the “failure” of the game.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reflector-entertainment_activity-7287227402995269633-s4i-/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy statement</a> posted on LinkedIn, CEO Herve Hoerdt said that he made a decision to “not greenlight further work on a future project that was in the conceptualization phase and thus terminating this development line”. This decision, he says, wouldn’t have been sustainable for the company and, with it, comes layoffs.</p>



<p>“This decision correlates directly with the failure of the studio’s ambitious and courageous first project, a new IP with a rich transmedia universe,” Hoerdt said. “The performance of the release didn’t come near the company expectations, after numerous timeline adjustments and investments, both financially and other, and didn’t warrant any further exploration in this universe.”</p>



<p>Hoerdt added that the decision will also affect back-office staff as the studio moves its support teams to be inline with a “single project approach the studio will adopt for the imminent future.” </p>



<p>“Where possible, staff will be assigned to this project, based on an existing Bandai Namco IP, which is shaping up very well,” he said.</p>



<p>Hoerdt closed his statement by saying that those impacted will receive severance packages, health benefits, mental health support, and more.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Reflector Entertainment for clarification on the number of people let go in the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Sniper Elite Resistance is the latest sniper-centric release casting us into the heart of World War Two. It carries on a lot of the good work of the previous iteration and we’ve rounded up the crucial release details.</p>



<p>Rebellion Developments (more commonly known as Rebellion) has developed and published numerous games since 1991. But the Sniper Elite series has become one of its biggest hits in the last 10 years. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> is a continuation of the refined and reliably violent stealth shooter. I say stealth, knowing full well many of my missions over the years have descended into unbridled chaos.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, 2025’s Sniper Elite Resistance presents another war-torn power struggle with a new marksman at the lens. Here’s everything we know including its release date, price point, and platforms. </p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-release-date">Sniper Elite Resistance Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We aim to please. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Sniper Elite Resistance has a January 30 release date.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-releasing-in-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest games in January 2025</a> haven’t set the world alight. But Resistance is looking to be the bright spark that adds a bit of warmth and character to the year’s beginning. Who doesn’t want the searing heat and intensity of a whirring Sniper Rifle bullet whistling into their chest?</p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-release-time">Sniper Elite Resistance Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Until Rebellion says otherwise, we’re likely locking and loading for a midnight launch for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>Special launch times are sometimes issued for releases—deviating from the norm. But it’s looking like a basic midnight launch window for <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>. This means Rebellion’s newest shooter has the same start time, but where you live dictates how long it is until you get to sample the sniping for yourself.</p>



<p>New Zealand residents always get midnight launches first because of time zones. Releasing at the same time in every country isn’t common, and I don’t expect it to be the case here. </p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-platforms">Sniper Elite Resistance Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are the main platforms for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>I’m quite surprised to see the continued support for old-gen consoles. This is good news for everyone as it allows more players to try out Resistance, and gives the release every chance to maximize its success. I think we call this a (fitting) bullseye.</p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-price">Sniper Elite Resistance Price</h2>



<p><strong>Sniper Elite Resistance retails at $59.99 or £54.99 for the Standard Edition, and $89.99 or £73.99 for the Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>If you buy physical editions of games, you’re unlikely to pay this much. <strong>Various retailers are bound to offer it much cheaper</strong>, and the good news is the Deluxe Edition isn’t a digital exclusive—depending on how keen you are for more content.</p>



<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-editions">Sniper Elite Resistance Editions</h2>



<p><strong>You can buy a Standard or Deluxe Edition for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, there’s no Collector’s Edition for die-hard fans. If you’re a long-time fan desperate for a replica Sniper Elite Rifle or a bizarre, lifesize eye replica—I’ve seen more unusual items in Collector’s Editions—you’re out of luck. </p>



<hr>



<p>How long have you been a fan of the Sniper Elite franchise? Could Resistance be the finest release yet?</p>
