<p>According to a report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-amazon-1236173978/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Amazon’s Tomb Raider series could potentially cast Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner as Lara Croft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report states that the parties are negotiating to get Sophie Turner to play Lara Croft in Amazon’s upcoming Tomb Raider series. Their <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/tomb-raider-sophie-turner-lucy-boynton-lara-croft-1236161243/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> from last month stated that Turner was auditioning for the part along with Bohemian Rhapsody’s Lucy Boynton. Sophie Turner is currently working on two shows, Joan and Haven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the writer and executive producer for Amazon’s Tomb Raider series. During the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-live-action-show-coming-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>, Waller-Bridge expressed her love for the franchise and how honoured she feels to be a part of the series. She stated, “I can’t wait to go on this adventure. Bats ‘n all.” Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, also called the upcoming series “epic” and “globetrotting” during the reveal.</p>



<p>The series does not have a release window at the moment, and no plot details have been revealed. If the reports are accurate, securing Lara Craft for the upcoming live-action Tomb Raider series will be the first significant development for the show. </p>



<p>In other news, the Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered Collection <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-collection-arrives-in-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released in February 2025</a>.

<p>My wife enjoys laughing at me because I spend time daily going through the most wishlisted upcoming Steam games on the digital storefront in search of anything new I might have missed. Something is launching daily, and new game announcements occur weekly, so it’s not outside the realm of possibility that my nearly 1,000-strong wishlist is missing something. I’m sure I’m not alone, which is why I’m sharing with you the ten most wishlisted upcoming games on the platform for November!</p>



<h2 id="h-top-wishlists-on-steam-for-november">Top Wishlists on Steam for November</h2>



<p>For the most part, the top ten <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=popularwishlist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlists on Steam</a> don’t change too frequently. Many of these games, like Monster Hunter, Deadlock, and Hollow Knight, remain in the top ten month after month. They likely will until launch. But it’s nice seeing titles like Delta Force, Arena Breakout, and the upcoming STALKER 2 make an appearance!</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Deadlock</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></li>



<li><strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</strong></li>



<li><strong>Delta Force</strong></li>



<li><strong>Marvel Rivals</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII</strong></li>



<li><strong>ARK 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Light No Fire</strong></li>



<li><strong>Arena Breakout: Infinite</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Just narrowly missing the top ten list are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-path-of-exile-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>, inZOI, and Unrecord. I imagine Path of Exile 2 will push into the top ten slot this month, following the developer’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming livestream showcasing the launch-day build, classes, and end-game content</a>!</p>







<h2 id="h-upcoming-game-releases-in-november-worth-keeping-an-eye-on">Upcoming Game Releases in November Worth Keeping An Eye On</h2>



<p>Of course, just because something isn’t on the top wishlists on Steam doesn’t mean it’s not worth your time. November is chock full of hot releases, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong></li>



<li><strong>Metro Awakening</strong></li>



<li><strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership</strong></li>



<li><strong>Funko Fusion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</strong></li>



<li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws (Steam)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Genshin Impact (Xbox Series X|S)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Towers of Aghasba</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Who could forget the recently released Farming Simulator 25? It launches with a few day-one issues that require a patch promptly from Giants, but it’s still a fun, relaxing experience!</p>

<p>Motorsport Games’ latest earnings report has revealed a grim outlook for the future of the company. Despite reducing costs and increasing general revenue for the third quarter of 2024, the company is still facing a significant uphill climb to continue.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://ir.motorsportgames.com/static-files/dac01c29-57fd-4ad6-a3dd-04e22275663b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest earning’s report</a>, Motorsport Games saw a slight increase in revenue of $1.8 million. That’s a $0.1M increase in year-over-year revenue. The company did have a net loss of $0.6 million for Q3 2024, which is an improvement compared to the $3.5M net loss from Q3 2024. That said, despite some improvements, there is a concern from the company regarding its ability to continue forward.</p>



<p>As of October 31, 2024, Motorsport Games has just $0.5M in cash with “no assurances” that they can find the liquidity and investments needed to continue.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>“We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future,” the company said in its report. “Accordingly, our financial condition raises substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.”</p>



<p>The company’s current deficit sits at $86.3M as of September 30, 2024, and they still owe $0.6M for the 2021 purchase of Studio 397. They are set to lose the ability to sell their NASCAR video games on December 31, 2024 as part of the deal that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-announces-new-console-game-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold the NASCAR license</a> to iRacing. It was also said that the company expects to receive a letter of deficiency from the NASDAQ regarding its compliance for a continued listing.</p>



<p>Even with the concerns, CEO Stephen Hood said that the company will continue the work towards turning things around.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to see an improvement in several key financial performance indicators, highlighting that the business is now in a stable position for the next phase of growth,” Hood said.</p>



<p>This is the latest development for a company that has seen its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-turmoil-at-motorsport-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share of turmoil</a> and issues over the last couple of years. Most recently, they<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motorsport-games-suffers-more-layoffs-as-struggles-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laid off more staff</a> while announcing its plans to consider “strategic alternatives” for the company.</p>



<p>“[The] Motorsport Games board of directors and I are in the process of reviewing the options available to us with a view to improve our long-term funding needs in order to produce the great game experiences we have proved that we can offer under our new business structure,” Hood said. “The number of expressions of interest received serves to reinforce our belief in the opportunities ahead.”</p>



<p>Should the company not be able to gain additional investment, they have listed a number of potential alternatives ranging from selling assets and reducing staff further to “discontinuing operations” entirely. </p>



<p>Motorsport Games is currently operating on a reported $100,000 monthly burn rate after multiple cost-cutting measures. For the year, they are sitting at a negative cash flow of $0.7M.</p>



<p>For now, the company continues to work on updates to its simulation racing title Le Mans Ultimate. The latest update in September saw the introduction of a new co-op mod, stave states, and more. There is also a new update coming in December that will add GT3 cars to the game.</p>

<p>I’m no stranger to genuinely odd and, occasionally, terrifying first-person shooters that make you scratch your head—for instance, Vladik Brutal or Cruelty Squad. But today’s release is something for the history books. 420BLAZEIT 2: GAME OF THE YEAR -=Dank Dreams and Goated Memes=- [#wow/11 Like and Subscribe] Poggerz Edition—yeah, that’s the game’s full title—hereby known as 420BlazeIt 2, is a trippy first-person shooter full of memes and rather tight gunplay. It’s immensely fun!</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gameplay Reveal Trailer Game of the Year 420 Blaze It 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUI6Oc1BQgE?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<blockquote>
<p>Prepare yourself for the long awaited sequel. You will blaze it. You will no scope. You will see some weird af s*** as you fight and xD in 999fps to destroy the Illuminati and rescue the memes. Are you ready for 420BLAZEIT 2????!!1</p>



<p>Normal Wholesome Games is a studio dedicated to one goal: never do what the player expects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Well, they’ve certainly achieved that goal. I think at one point when Illuminati Mecha Sherk dabbed on me before exploding and falling backward into his swamp, whatever I thought this game was going to be went out the window.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With a 10% launch discount that lasts until November 21, you can grab this whacky FPS on Steam for under $10. For you achievement hunters out there, 420BlazeIt 2 features a staggering 94 achievements to unlock as you progress deeper into the Illuminati rabbit holt. </p>



<p>Furthermore, and rather unsurprisingly, while only a handful of Steam user reviews are currently live for the game, they’re all positive and relatively glowing. </p>

<p>For the longest time, you could only find me using Steam. I wouldn’t touch another digital storefront or launcher if I could help it, but GOG inevitably won me over. Now, I have a growing library of classic titles, such as Jade Empire, The Suffering, and World in Conflict—all classics in their own right. Well, it turns out their offerings continue to improve. GOG is launching its game preservation program to ensure titles like Fallout and Resident Evil remain available and functional for players years after release.</p>



<p>As of this writing, the program features 100 unique titles, with an average rating of 4.2 out of 5, and more than 500 game improvements implemented by the restoration team at GOG. Some of the titles in the program include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Theme Hospital</li>



<li>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</li>



<li>SWAT 4</li>



<li>Empire Earth</li>



<li>Fallout: New Vegas</li>



<li>Diablo + Hellfire</li>



<li>System Shock 2</li>



<li>Dungeon Leeper 2</li>



<li>MYST</li>



<li>Heroes of Might and Magic III Complete</li>



<li>Jagged Alliance</li>



<li>Dragon Age: Origins</li>



<li>Demonicon</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p>The GOG Preservation Program ensures classic games remain playable on modern systems, even after their developers stopped supporting them. By maintaining these iconic titles, GOG helps you protect and relive the memories that shaped you, DRM-free and with dedicated tech support.</p>



<p>In a world of rapid technological change, we see the urgent need to save video games from vanishing. The GOG Preservation Program is committed to keeping beloved classics alive and playable for future generations.</p>



<p>Our goal is for all games, whether recent or classic, to eventually become part of the Preservation Program. For a game to qualify for the Program, our team must run it through many quality tests. If these tests fail, our team updates and improves the game until it matches our quality standards. Only then, we stamp the game with our Preservation Program and grant it Good Old Game status.</p>



<p>There is a long backlog of classic games available on GOG that may already qualify for the program, but our team has not been able to confirm that yet. We aim to support as many games as possible, but it’s not always entirely up to us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To this end, GOG recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-resident-evil-joins-gog-sequels-coming-later-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched the Resident Evil bundle</a>, featuring the first three classic survival horror titles in a single, functional package that allows modern gaming computers to run and play smoothly. But that’s not the end of the road for the preservation program, as the team intends to add hundreds more titles to the program by the end of 2025, but not before thorough quality assurance checks clear each game.</p>
