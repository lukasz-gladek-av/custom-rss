<p>In a rare interview, Michel Ancel said that problems between management caused Beyond Good and Evil 2’s development issues.</p>



<p>The new interview came from French outlet <a href="https://www.superpouvoir.com/entretien-avec-michel-ancel-le-createur-de-rayman-et-beyond-good-evil-se-confie-sur-sa-nouvelle-vie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Superpouvoir</a>, where Ancel answered elaberated on the development issues of Beyond Good and Evil 2 and where he believes some of the accusations of toxic management, of which he denies, originates.</p>



<p>“On&nbsp;BGE2, for example, there were too many problems between managers. The artistic director wanted to redo everything constantly, <span>and the&nbsp;game director&nbsp;wanted to make a game of generated dungeo</span>ns. I dreamed of a space adventure. We could not agree and the&nbsp;game director&nbsp;took the project in other directions,” he said. </p>



<p>Ancel continued, “In this type of situation, teams find themselves tossed around and don’t even know who’s in charge and making decisions. The producer is supposed to sort things out, but that didn’t happen.&nbsp;Yves Guillemot&nbsp;even had to go down to Montpellier to get things back on track, but that wasn’t enough and the&nbsp;<em>game director</em>&nbsp;continued in his stubbornness. When I read in Libé that I was the one directing the game and asking for changes, I thought I was going to choke.&nbsp;<em>BGE2</em>&nbsp;is the game on which I don’t think I’ve ever questioned a decision.”</p>



<p>Michal Ancel left Ubisoft in 2020 to spend time in a wildlife sanctuary following burnout while working on games. One week later, though, accusations of toxic leadership by Ancel began to circulate, which Ancel firmly denied and continues to do so.</p>



<p>As of the time of writing, Ubisoft’s Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development. After nearly two years of development, it finally found its footing in early 2017. Speaking with sources, the game is still a couple of years out, though. We’ll share some exclusive details on the game later this week.</p>



<p>What do you think of the issues surrounding Beyond Good and Evil 2? Do you think it will ever be released? &nbsp;Let us know how it’s going on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Per a recent report, Apple and Sony are collaborating to bring third-party controller support for the Vision Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Apple approached Sony at the beginning of 2024 to bring support for PlayStation VR 2 controllers for the Vision Pro. Moreover, Apple has also had conversations with other third-party developers about featuring third-party controller support for their games on the VR platform. The controllers will not only be a valuable addition for gaming on the Vision Pro but also provide more control over the entire operating system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report adds that Apple and Sony had planned to announce PlayStation VR 2 controller support for the Vision Pro “weeks ago”; however, the announcement was postponed due to an undisclosed reason. Also, Sony has another hurdle to cross: selling their VR controllers as standalone accessories, as right now, they can only be acquired by purchasing the PlayStation VR 2 console. When the announcement does come, players will seemingly be able to grab the PS VR 2 controllers from Apple’s retail and online stores.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In their latest update, Palworld developers have changed the behaviour of Pal Spheres while battling Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pal Spheres work like Pokeballs and capture and summon Pals in Palworld. However, after <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236636060484669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">version v0.3.11 </a>(spotted by <a href="https://nichegamer.com/palworld-removes-pal-sphere-summons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NicheGamer</a>), the Pal Spheres will have a different activation. Now, whenever a player uses a Pal Sphere, their Pal will be summoned near the player without them needing to throw the sphere. Also, the new update will display a reticle while aiming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest developments</a> on Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld, the former has alleged that the latter has infringed three different patents and is seeking damages of 10 million Yen (approximately USD 66,000). Pocket Pair replied, stating they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings” in the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Palxworld is getting its biggest island yet in December, which is about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-december-dlc-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six times bigger than Sakurajima</a>. Also, Palworld has finally launched for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-finally-launches-for-ps5-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 consoles in Japan</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/royal-ravens-on-top-following-first-week-of-the-cdl-2025-season.1055466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/royal-ravens-on-top-cdl-2025-season/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The first week of the CDL 2025 season has wrapped and it’s the Carolina Royal Ravens that sit atop the standings. With a record of 2 – 0 and a win/loss of 6 – 2, the Royal Ravens outpaced the other eleven teams in the CDL this past weekend. First, the team handed a smackdown to Team Falcons, and that was followed up with an unexpected win over LAG M8.</p>



<p>The power players are getting well-established quite early on this year, with LAT, Rokkr, and Toronto Ultra all bursting out of the gate without a single loss this week.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-miserable-elsewhere">Miserable Elsewhere</h2>



<p>Uncharacteristically, Atlanta FaZe sits near the bottom of the CDL standings after the opening weekend of play. The squad failed to secure a point, being beaten down by both LAT and Toronto Ultra. The LAT match was a burner, though – almost every round (except the opening Hardpoint, oof) went down to the wire.</p>



<p>Cloud9, Vegas Falcons, and LAG M8 all also failed to secure any CDL points, with C9 NY putting up the worst record – just one single map won out of seven played, tieing the squad with Team Falcons, which many predict will be the worst-performing org this season.</p>



<p>Out of the twelve teams in the CDL 2025 season, the ones to watch have been made clear.</p>



<p>LAT’s combination of Scrap, HyDra, Envoy, and Ghosty is a nasty one. Scrap and HyDra are running wild slaying out (props to HyDra’s 40-bomb), while Ghosty’s IGL role and Envoy’s veteran support bolsters the squad immeasurably. It could be LAT’s year, and it’s well deserved, given how much Nadeshot has poured into the organisation this time around.</p>



<p>Ultra had a great weekend, too. They dealt a massive blow to Atlanta FaZe and followed that up by taking Surge down a peg. The Canadian side made some major changes heading into the new season, picking up Beans and JoeDeceives to flesh out the EU-dominant roster that includes long-timers Insight and CleanX.</p>



<p>This was a fantastic weekend of play all round, and a few technical blips didn’t do too much to mar the entertainment. It’s no big secret that viewership could have been better, but co-streams and watch parties will undoubtedly do bits for the CDL this year.</p>

<p>Steam has once again proven that PC gaming is on the up, securing a new all-time high peak user count and notching up 39,205,447 concurrent players. This record came during a busy weekend that saw the successful launches of Marvel Rivals and Path of Exile II in early access, among others.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Steam has gone from strength to strength in recent years, seeing a sharp increase in user activity during the COVID-19 pandemic and never really slowing down since. The data revealed in charts on SteamDB tell the story from the last twenty years:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The ‘A’ flag on the chart is the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. This event saw millions of gamers worldwide locked down by their respective governments, and more than ever before turned to gaming and content creation as a way of occupying their time – and perhaps making a little money.</p>



<p>That of course warranted a massive growth in the number of PC players around the world.</p>



<p>This weekend, the popular PC platform hit almost 40 million concurrent users – a staggering number by all accounts. Since 2024 kicked off, Steam has been soaring, but some games understandably contribute to that success much more than others.</p>



<p>For example, Counter-Strike 2 maintains a regular 24-hour peak of around 1.5 million users, with PUBG and Dota 2 coming in behind with around 700,000 players. This weekend, Marvel Rivals hit a peak of almost 500,000 players, and Path of Exile II, which is in early access, stormed the charts and racked up 578,000 concurrent users.</p>



<p>It’s worth highlighting that the number displayed is <strong>peak concurrent users</strong>. That doesn’t mean they’re actively playing a game, they’re just <strong>online </strong>on Steam. At the time that the 39 million mark was hit, just over 12 million users were playing games.</p>

<p>On December 6, Grand Theft Hamlet was released across the UK and Ireland in select theatres, and it’s coming to streaming platforms next year. This zany representation of Shakespeare’s work was planned, performed, and recorded entirely in GTA Online by Pinny Grylls and Sam Crane, and it’s making a wealth of impressions on critics worldwide.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, the ‘documentary’ has won awards at film festivals everywhere, including SXSW, Vancouver, and Philadelphia, and it scooped a prize and several nominations at the British Independent Film Awards.</p>

<h2 id="h-yes-it-s-real">Yes, It’s Real</h2>



<p>When I say ‘Grand Theft Hamlet’, that’s what I mean. It’s a story showcasing the telling of Shakespeare’s Hamlet <strong>in </strong>Grand Theft Auto Online.</p>



<p>The idea was concocted by Sam Crane during the COVID-induced lockdown in the United Kingdom in 2021, and he roped in Mark Oosterveen to star alongside him. Pinny Grylls was eventually brought in to direct the documentary, which is proving to be a rip-roaring success with critics and viewers.</p>



<p>The recently released theatrical trailer gives you an indication of the origins of the project:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Most of the documentary is spent unveiling the trials and tribulations of the team making their way towards the ultimate performance, which unravels at the end of the 90-minute flick.</p>



<p>The reviews speak for themselves. In <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/grand-theft-hamlet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Empire</a>, Grand Theft Hamlet was dubbed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘…a riotously funny, unexpectedly poignant ode to gaming, Shakespeare, the indestructible nature of art, and the benefits of befriending bazooka wielding extraterrestrials.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://theface.com/culture/grand-theft-auto-gta-hamlet-film-mubi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Face</a>, Grylls explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that it’s also important to think about the fact that&nbsp;<em>GTA Hamlet</em>&nbsp;is not really just a&nbsp;film of the play. It’s a&nbsp;story about this crazy adventure to try and put on this play which seems impossible. It’s a&nbsp;kind of comedy adventure story and it was edited to be really, really entertaining and fun, like the big eighties blockbuster movies Sam and I&nbsp;grew up watching, like&nbsp;<em>Back to the Future.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>This isn’t the first time a video game has been used as a platform for a production like this – but it’s certainly the most impactful occurrence. </p>



<p>For instance, the ‘Wasteland Theatre Company’ in Bethesda’s Fallout 76 pieced together and staged a performance of Shakespeare’s works in the post-apocalyptic MMORPG a year or two ago.</p>
