<p>A new Elden Ring Nightreign datamine reveals that developers are working on an endless ranked mode called ‘Deep of Night’. </p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign’s developers, FromSoftware, have been constantly churning out new content for the game for players to immerse themselves in. They recently added the highly requested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-1-02-patch-notes-july-31-update-duos-finally-added-along-with-relic-filter-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duos mode</a> and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-set-of-everdark-sovereigns-arrive-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new set of Everdark Sovereigns</a>. Interestingly, the latest development reveals that FromSoftware could be cooking a brand new game mode for the title. </p>

<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, a new post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adminisitrator/comments/1mh908l/elden_ring_nightreign_new_mode_deep_of_night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> talks about Elden Ring Nightreign’s upcoming endless ranked mode, which was datamined from the duos mode patch. The upcoming game mode is called ‘Deep of Night’ and it will be added to the Expeditions menu. The description states that players will not be able to choose these targets, and “difficulty increases with depth”. The player’s rating will increase with every victory, allowing them to proceed to “even greater depths”. The last statement says, “The boundless dark stretches out unto infinity.” </p>



<p>The player ratings in Elden Ring Nightreign’s endless ranked mode will be recorded through ‘Depth’. Victories will increase the player’s Depth rating, and losses will decrease it. There are 5 Depth Tiers to progress through: Depth 1 (Rating 0-999), Depth 2 (Rating 1000-1999), Depth 3 (Rating 2000-3999), Depth 4 (Rating 4000-5999), Depth 5 (Rating 6000+). Once a player is promoted to a higher tier, they cannot be demoted. Also, players will be matched with others of the same Depth; however, if there aren’t enough players in the same Depth, then the pool will be expanded.  </p>



<p>Regardless, players should take this information with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source and wait for an announcement from FromSoftware. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony has confirmed that Bungie’s Marathon will still release by the end of its current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, 2026.</p>



<p>The news came following Sony’s latest earnings report during its Q&amp;A section, where one investor asked for an update on the game and its management, as well as if the game could be canceled entirely.</p>



<p>Sony’s Chief Financial Officer, Lin Tao, responded to say that Bungie’s Marathon is still slated to release this current financial year. The statement comes just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-fy25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two months after a previous statement</a> saying the same thing.</p>



<p>“We are now fixing the problems. So we believe this launch will happen. And if this launch is canceled, we need to do a revision of the valuation. However, as of now, this is not expected,” Tao said.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon was delayed following a lukewarm reception to its reveal and playtests, with additional issues stemming from a huge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/artist-accuses-bungie-of-plagiarizing-work-for-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism accusation from a concept artist</a>, to which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie responded</a>.</p>



<p>On its delay, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie said</a> that the community’s messages have been “strong and clear”.</p>



<p>“The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling—survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining FPS combat,” the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post reads</a>. “We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like&nbsp;Marathon&nbsp;is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unlikely that Marathon will do well if it releases this fiscal year, or to be honest, ever. Nonetheless, Bungie seems determined to get the game out of the door and in at least some kind of playable and engaging fashion.</p>



<p>Do you think Marathon will succeed if released by March 2026? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>
