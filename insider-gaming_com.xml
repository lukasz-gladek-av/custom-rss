<p>The story behind the recent layoffs at 10:10 Games is more than just a case of simple restructuring. Insider Gaming has spoken to multiple sources who have provided new details about what led to the layoffs at the Funko Fusion developer, what they were told, and more.</p>



<p>According to those who spoke under the condition of anonymity, staff at the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/details-funko-fusion-developer-1010-games-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found out about</a> the layoffs in mid-January and that there would be 19 jobs at risk. Those who were being let go were told by management that they would be “fully supported through this process”, including assistance with finding more work. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming was told that hasn’t happened yet.</p>



<p>As far as those let go, some were on Holiday—which the company had encouraged them to take. After being told while out of work, those let go were still expected to attend consultation meetings at the given time. That included those that happened to be abroad in different time zones.</p>

<p>“Management seemed very keen to wrap up the process quickly, and despite saying that they were fully open to suggestions and feedback, none of it has been taken on board,” one source said.</p>



<p>Once layoffs were finalized, meetings wrapped with those affected by the end of January. In those meetings, Insider Gaming learned that they were told there would be no real severance package. What they received was what one called “the bare legal minimum” that included notice periods and payment in lieu of any unused Holiday time. As mentioned above, Holiday time was encouraged to be used over the holiday season. </p>



<p>Many of those spoken to believed that the company knew they were going to be holding these layoffs and w anted to avoid paying it out after the fact.</p>

<p>After the layoffs were announced, employees were—obviously—wondering what led to the decision. It’s understood that it all stems from 10:10 Games’ first release, Funko Fusion.</p>



<p>Sources say that Funko Fusion was a “complete commercial and critical failure”. Because of the poor performance of the game, the studio has failed to secure funding for more than one future project as of now. That led to lower-level staff being told that there “isn’t enough work to give the whole team”.</p>



<p>Layoffs were said to be based “entirely on the needs of the next project” which many who spoke to Insider Gaming believe hasn’t been  fully designed yet. It’s also believed that no senior-level or upper-management staff were impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming was told that studio heads Paul Flanagan and Arthur Parsons initially told staff that they wanted to take responsibility for the layoffs when it became public. However, the studio is reportedly having a different firm handle public contact, with no official statement on the moves.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to contact 10:10 Games for response to what has been said regarding the layoffs. As of publishing, a response has yet to be received.</p>
