<p>The cost to show your game at Opening Night Live is set to get even more expensive for studios. According to a new report from German outlet <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/gamescom/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-werbespots-preise-211124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesWirtschaft</a>, Geoff Keighley’s annual event at Gamescom is charging up to nearly $500,000 for an spot on Opening Night Live 2025.</p>



<p>The report claims that prices start at $146,800 (€140,000) for a 30-second ad and rises to roughly $487,506 (€465,000) for a 180-second (three-minute) ad, based on currency conversion rates as of writing. The three-minute ad is one of two new tiers offered for 2025 along with a 150-second ad for roughly $419,360 (€400,000). In total, there are six different tiers to choose from, all more expensive than the reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-costs-up-to-288000-to-show-your-game-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost for the same amount of time</a> in 2024. Across the board, the increases range from 17.4% up to 21.9%.</p>



<p>Opening Night Live 2025 is scheduled to air August 19, 2025, the day before Gamescom 2025 officially begins.</p>







<ul>
<li><strong>30 seconds</strong>: $146,776 or €140,000 ($125,000 or €115,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>60 seconds:&nbsp;</strong>$214,922 or €205,000 ($179,600 or €165,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>90 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$283,068 or €270,000 ($234,000 or €215,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>120 seconds:&nbsp;</strong>$351,214 or €335,000 ($288,000 or €265,000 in 2024)</li>



<li><strong>150 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$419,360 or €400,000 </li>



<li><strong>180 seconds:</strong>&nbsp;$487,506 or €465,000 </li>
</ul>



<p>It’s worth noting that neither Keighley himself nor the Gamescom promoters have confirmed these prices. Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out for comment, though no response has been received as of publishing.</p>

<p>Trophies and Achievements galore await you in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and the shooter has a ton of optional objectives for you to complete from killing a certain amount of enemies to being a collecting completionist.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> arrives 15 years after the last iteration in the first-person shooter saga. Aside from some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-fix-input-lag-in-stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">input lag issues</a> and other problems, the reception for Stalker 2 has generally been quite positive. </p>



<p>It offers another guided tour of Chornobyl’s metaphorical house of horrors, and you are rewarded for extracurricular activities in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone—courtesy of the extensive Stalker 2 Achievement and Trophy list.</p>
