<p>Embark Studios has revealed why the investigation into ARC Raiders’ exploits took so long and how they will be serving punishments to players who used them. </p>



<p>For those unaware, ARC Raiders has been experiencing several glitches recently, mainly the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-release-hotfix-for-duplication-glitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">duplication</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ammo-glitch-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ammo</a> glitches that players were exploiting to gain an unfair advantage. The developers have already released hotfixes for both, and now that the investigation is complete, enforcement can begin. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-players-who-used-exploits-will-face-the-consequences-next-week">ARC Raiders Players Who Used Exploits Will Face the Consequences Next Week</h2>



<p>In their blog <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/an-update-on-recent-exploits-and-corrective-actions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a>, Embark Studios first explained why it took so long for them to investigate the ARC Raiders’ exploits. There is a specific process that the developer follows, which includes validating reports against data, confirming the scope and effect of the exploit, separating accidental/edge-case behavior from repeated and intentional abuse, and, lastly, assessing the measurable impact on the economy and competitive integrity. </p>



<p>The developers want to “act once, with intention, and with confidence that we’re doing the right thing,” which is why the process took so long. Now that the investigations are over, Embark will be taking actions based on severity, intent, frequency, and impact. Low-severity cases will receive only a warning. If exploit activity is observed, coins will be removed, and in severe cases where there is a significant impact on the in-game economy or other players’ experience, suspensions will be served. </p>







<p>In other news, the ARC Raiders <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-confirmed-for-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shrouded Sky update has been confirmed</a> to release next week. Additionally, the game has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-brings-in-close-to-6-million-players-every-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">14 million copies and attracts 6 million players</a> each week.

            <title><![CDATA[Does Marathon Have Early Access?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-marathon-have-early-access/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When it comes to extraction shooters, it can be every man for themselves, and one way to guarantee your success is by getting ahead of the rest. Early access is a great way to do so, but not every title offers it before launch. </p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>, the latest extraction shooter to break onto the scene. Developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, it’s bound to feature intense gunfights, and you’ll want any advantage you can find—including early access.</p>







<p>But are Bungie kind enough to offer it? Insider Gaming reveals all down below.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-through-early-access">Can You Play Marathon Through Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shoot first. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no early access available for Marathon, which means that you’ll have to wait to play the full game at launch alongside everyone else. </strong></p>



<p>The lack of early access for Marathon can be seen as both a positive and a negative. On the one hand, it ensures that everyone starts their journey on the same footing, but on the other, it means waiting longer to dive into the game!</p>



<p>However, just because the full game won’t have early access, that doesn’t mean that you can’t play Marathon before it launches…</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-before-launch">Can You Play Marathon Before Launch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play Marathon before launch, during the Server Slam Playtest, which begins on February 26 and ends on March 2.</strong></p>



<p>It might sound like early access, and whilst it technically is, you won’t have access to the full game. Instead, it’s supposed to serve as a stress test for the servers before Marathon officially launches worldwide.</p>







<p>That being said, Bungie are packing the playtest full of content, with two maps fully explorable, as well as a host of entry-level quests ready to be tackled.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has a full breakdown of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Server Slam Playtest</a> up already, so if this interests you, check out how you can get involved!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite continues to drop regular new content, and though the start of the next season has been delayed, a fresh drop lies ahead with the deployment of V39.50.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battle-royale/" id="127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth has already seen some huge collabs and crossovers so far in 2026, including the likes of South Park and The Office, and new content is on the agenda to appease fans frustrated by the delay to the start of Chapter 7 Season 2.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fort</a>nite V39.50 is due to arrive this week, and Insider Gaming has all the important details on exactly when it drops and what you can expect to be added.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-fortnite-update">When is The Next Fortnite Update?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Return. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite’s next update is set to arrive on Thursday, February 19, when Epic Games deploys v39.50 into the fold.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games is pretty settled when it comes to regular updates, deploying major updates and downtime every few weeks. With the l;ast update landing on February 5, it’s time for a new update and new content to be added to the game.</p>



<p>It won’t be the final update of Chapter 7 Season 1, however, with the current season extended until March 19, so there will be at least one more update before Season 2 begins.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-fortnite-v39-50">What’s Coming in Fortnite v39.50?</h2>



<p><strong>New collabs and a fresh slew of content are arriving in Fortnite with the v39.50 update, including the new Lantern Fest event and map in Reload.</strong></p>



<p>The Reload Map will feature teams with up to eight players, and the ranks for Reload will also be reset by the update. Additionally, expect new cosmetic items to be available as part of the Lantern Fest event.</p>



<p>In the main Battle Royale, the schedule for the Love &amp; Legends event already revealed the return of the DeLorean in the update, but, more importantly, there should be a slew of details about the imminent return of The Seven, along with further hints on what to expect next season.</p>



<p>As for collabs, Solo Leveling is expected to debut, further details of the Honkai: Star Rail collab are expected, and more details about the Looney Tunes collab could also be uncovered.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Pokémon Pokopia a Nintendo Switch 2 Exclusive? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2-exclusive-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>1438081</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon fans are set to be spoiled in 2026 as the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary, and Pokopia is a major release that is right around the corner. However, questions continue to be asked about platforms.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> will be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" id="157069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 5</a>, a week after the expected flood of news emerges on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-2026-pokemon-presents/" id="172098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Day</a>, providing players with a new way to explore the world of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a>, taking the form of a humanoid ditto.</p>



<p>If you’re unsure whether Pokopia is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-pokemon-pokopia-a-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive">Is Pokémon Pokopia a Nintendo Switch 2 Exclusive?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Next gen. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia will only be available to purchase on Nintendo Switch 2, and is the first platform exclusive for the newest system for the franchise.</strong></p>



<p>While Pokémon Legends: Z-A was available on both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> consoles, Pokopia is being released solely for Switch 2. Additionally, it’s expected that any future releases for Pokémon moving forward will be Switch 2 exclusives, excluding mobile titles.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will not be a physical copy of Pokopia, and those who purchase a boxed version of the game will be provided with a Game-Key Card, which prompts a download. Unlike codes, however, they can be resold or shared with others, like a regular game cartridge.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pokemon-pokopia-on-the-original-nintendo-switch">Can You Play Pokémon Pokopia on The Original Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, while Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia won’t be released on the original Nintendo Switch, the game can still be played on the original console, though there are significant limitations.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia’s Gamershare feature allows users to invite another player to their game to create a 2-player co-op session, including the ability to send invitations to players with an original Switch console.</p>



<p>Shared games are only playable during the active session, however, and cannot be played independently by a player on the original Switch console later.</p>



<p>While this opens the door for players to enjoy Pokopia without splashing out on a Nintendo Switch 2 console, you will require someone with the game. If you want to enjoy everything Pokopia has to offer and work through the story at your own pace, you’ll need access to a Switch 2 yourself.</p>

<p><strong>No, Marathon will not be available on Xbox Game Pass when it releases on March 5, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Just because it’s on the platform doesn’t mean it’ll break into the Xbox game’s service, as sad as that may be. If anything, it’s a coupe that Marathon will even be playable on both Xbox Series X|S, so it might be a case of taking your wins and moving on. </p>



<p>However, whilst it’s not on Xbox Game Pass at launch, that doesn’t mean it can’t feature in the future, does it?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-added-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Marathon Be Added To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no news suggesting that Marathon will ever release on Xbox Game Pass, and considering it’s developed by Sony-owned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, it’d be incredibly unlikely.</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft tend to release almost all of its first-party titles day and date on Xbox Game Pass, with many third-party titles very much on the cards in the future. However, it’s currently rare enough to find a PlayStation title on Xbox, let alone on Game Pass.</p>







<p>That being said, stranger things have happened, so until it’s officially ruled out, don’t write it off. Who knows, in a year or two, Marathon may well be on Game Pass—just don’t hold your breath.</p>
