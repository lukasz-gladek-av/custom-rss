<p>The Pokémon franchise is set for arguably the biggest year ever, with the 30th anniversary celebrations coming alongside major releases, significant changes to the competitive scene, and there’s likely to be even more on the horizon.</p>



<p>After the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" id="2273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> last year, a boom in the TCG hobby, and two releases already confirmed for the year ahead with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-champions/" id="2457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Champions</a>, 2026 is set to be a big one, and Pokémon EUIC displayed the very best that the franchise has to offer.</p>



<p>Across four action-packed days in London for Pokémon EUIC, here are the main takeaways I learned from the event.</p>







<h3 id="h-pokemon-s-growth-shows-no-signs-of-stopping">Pokémon’s Growth Shows No Signs of Stopping</h3>

<p>Pokémon’s boom in the past decade, following the release of Pokémon Go, has been well-documented, and excitement for the franchise has reached fever-pitch levels heading into the 30th anniversary. However, it’s clear that this isn’t the height of the peak.</p>



<p>The attendance at Pokémon EUIC was over 17,000, including over 7,000 competitors, numbers that dwarf the Pokémon World Championships attendance from London 2022. Around a third of ExCel London was taken over by Pokémon, and there’s still plenty of room to grow.</p>



<p>With the VGC format moving to Pokémon Champions, lowering the barrier of entry as the title will also be available on mobile devices, and the Pokémon games venturing into new genres, Pikachu and the gang are here to stay.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-could-be-the-next-pokemon-go-like-hit">Pokopia Could Be The Next Pokémon Go-Like Hit</h3>



<p>The release of Pokopia is now just a few weeks away, and the latest entry in the Pokémon franchise blew me away in my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" id="176556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, showing it can have the same sort of momentum that Pokémon Go did a decade ago.</p>



<p>Pokémon Go was a title that spread like wildfire across the world, bringing new fans into the Pokémon franchise, and Pokopia has the ability to do the same. With an Animal Crossing-like approach and a clear cozy vibe, new gamers could be attracted, and diehard fans will also be thrilled with the experience.</p>



<p>The Pokémon Company has not been afraid to venture into new genres and try out new things in recent years, and fans can reap the benefits.</p>



<h3 id="h-lego-pokemon-sets-are-incredible">LEGO Pokémon Sets Are Incredible</h3>



<p>Ever since the first reveal of the debut <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-pokemon-scavenger-hunt-codes/" id="169235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Pokémon</a> sets, it was clear that they were going to make waves, but having now seen the sets in person, they completely blew my socks off.</p>



<p>There are no stickers on the sets, with the eyes and any other accents all printed directly to the bricks, showing a more premium approach to the set. Of course, with the high prices of LEGO, fans will expect the very best, and this is exactly what they are getting.</p>



<p>It’s not long now until the LEGO Pokémon sets will arrive in the hands of fans worldwide, and I can’t wait to see what other sets are on the horizon this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-competitive-pokemon-is-much-tougher-than-i-imagined">Competitive Pokémon is Much Tougher Than I Imagined</h3>



<p>I’ve always been more of a collector in the world of Pokémon, both in the games, hunting down everything needed to fill out my Pokédex and in the world of the TCG, and I truly had no idea just how tough the competitive scene truly is.</p>



<p>The tactical approaches in the VGC scene were far beyond what I could envision, with competitors always trying to be two steps ahead, and my head was spinning with the knowledge those in the TCG had. Add in the quick reactions of those playing UNITE and Go, and it was incredible to witness.</p>



<p>Esports continues to grow and will have greater prominence in the years to come, and Pokémon will certainly have a big part to play.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-world-championships-is-a-bucket-list-addition">Pokémon World Championships Is A Bucket List Addition</h3>



<p>The one major thought that stuck with me throughout the weekend at EUIC and since I returned home is that I need to attend a World Championship, and I’ve got my eyes on San Francisco in August.</p>



<p>I loved every single second of Pokémon EUIC, and attending such a huge event has immediately led to attending Worlds jumping into my bucket list.</p>



<p>I highly recommend that any Pokémon fan look to attend one of the major events, and to keep an eye out for Pokémon Play! Schedules, to meet other members of the community and have an experience you’ll remember for the rest of your lives.</p>







<p>There’s no denying there’s a lot of negativity often spread around Pokémon, particularly on the TCG side of things, and the difficulty getting your hands on sealed product, but there was zero sign of this at EUIC.</p>



<p>Instead, the weekend was filled with moments that show the very best of the Pokémon community. One parent of a competitor in the Junior TCG category told me about how other parents rallied to help create a replacement deck after an initial one was lost, ensuring they wouldn’t have to exit the tournament. While the original deck was found, the new deck, including cards from a variety of languages, showed the very best of the community.</p>



<p>Throughout the entire event, everyone I spoke to was welcoming, there was absolutely no gatekeeping, and every attendee was there to share their love of the Pokémon franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Clickout Media, owner of websites such as Esports Insider and The Escapist, has told its staff that they are being laid off. The layoffs come just a week after they began laying off freelancers and pausing all future freelance hires. </p>







<p>Insider Gaming understands that the company is making a heavy pivot to AI content, resulting in almost all of its editorial staff being let go.</p>



<p>It was said that Clickout Media will be maintaining a skeleton crew of “AI Editors.”</p>



<p><strong>“Sad to say that my role at The Escapist is up for redundancy, and that means a lot of things that I’m still not quite getting my head around,”</strong> The Escapist writer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lloydcoombes_sad-to-say-that-my-role-at-the-escapist-is-activity-7429538899200270336--5Xj/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lloyd Coombes wrote</a>, though he did not mention the AI pivot in his posting.</p>



<p>It’s also believed that employees being let go are being forced to sign an NDA from speaking publicly about the layoffs, at risk of not receiving their severance payouts. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Clickout Media for comment on the layoffs and AI pivot. As of publishing, a response has not been received. </p>



<p>This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Marathon Have Crossplay? Cross-Platform Status, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-marathon-have-crossplay-cross-platform-status-explained/</link>
            <guid>1438249</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> is almost ready to be shared with the world, with the multiplayer extraction shooter arriving on multiple platforms at launch. However, that poses the question: Will Marathon have crossplay and cross-progression?</p>







<p>It’s a common question when it comes to multiplayer titles, especially for scattered friend groups dispersed between the likes of PlayStation, Xbox and PC. Although it’s more common these days, not every title offers crossplay, so it’s important to check before deciding whether Marathon will be your next multiplayer game.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-marathon-have-crossplay">Does Marathon Have Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Friend or foe? Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Marathon does have Crossplay across all platforms, allowing you to team up with friends across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a> is no stranger to multiplayer shooters, as it’s mastered the art of juggling multiple platforms with the likes of Destiny 2. It looks like that will translate directly to Marathon, as anyone on any platform can engage with one another directly from launch.</p>



<p>It will be turned on by default, and it works through Bungie, meaning you won’t need to be signed into any external accounts. However, if you prefer to stick to dealing with those on your platform, it will also be toggleable in the menu. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-marathon-have-cross-progression">Does Marathon Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Marathon will also have cross-progression at launch, meaning your save data will transfer between any platform you decide to play on. </strong></p>



<p>If you decide to pick the game up on console, but change your mind and switch to PC, then fear not, as all of your saved data and progression will transfer right over to the new platform. </p>







<p>Bungie hasn’t yet revealed the full details on how this operates, but it’s likely that it will work similarly to how Destiny 2 handles cross-progression. It all revolves around your Bungie ID, which ties your saved data together. Just sign in to the same account, and everything should be right where you left it.</p>
