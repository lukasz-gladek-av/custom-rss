<p>Recently, it was announced that after just a few months on the market and amid the failure of the game’s first season, both Spectre Divide and Mountaintop Studios will be shutting down next month. Spectre Divide, an ambitious first-person multiplayer shooter, was first released in August 2024, but the player base quickly dwindled.</p>



<p>The Mountaintop team revealed that, despite funding, the game isn’t making enough money to remain online or support the studio, so it’s being closed down. In response, the team at FragPunk, which is another free-to-play multiplayer shooter released just a week ago, posted an image on social media that has been slammed as ‘disgusting’ by the Mountaintop team.</p>

<h2 id="h-that-might-not-age-well">That Might Not Age Well</h2>



<p>The FragPunk post has now been removed, but not before eagle-eyed gamers grabbed screenshots:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>One of the first people to share this online was Marcus Schubert, one of the producers working at Mountaintop Studios. He <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/schuby_netease-games-this-is-disgusting-shame-activity-7306005072939794432-SxA6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>NetEase Games, this is disgusting. Shame on you. For those unaware, the top post is our farewell letter indicating that Mountaintop Studios is shutting down.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>FragPunk is published by NetEase, the same gaming titan behind the overwhelmingly successful Marvel Rivals. The post was likely the work of a social media intern or community manager somewhere, but that shouldn’t be used as an excuse to brush it under the rug. </p>



<p>At a time when studio closures, cancellations, and layoffs are tearing the industry apart, publishers and developers should support one another rather than mocking the downfall of a hard-working team. If recent trends are anything to go by (XDefiant and Concord, for example), then FragPunk shouldn’t potentially be casting stones in a glass house.</p>



<p>Presently, FragPunk has a peak on Steam of more than 110,000 players, while Spectre Divide peaked at just 26,200. However, XDefiant had millions of players, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/">we all know what happened</a> with that.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is on the way soon, and various Japanese analysts are expecting the console’s price to be around $400 or more when it releases.</p>



<p>In a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, many expect the system to be the most expensive in Nintendo’s history—the original Switch launched at $299—but still have no problem moving units right away.</p>



<p>“They will sell boatloads of Switch 2 in the first months in particular, almost regardless of the price,” Tokyo-based analyst Serkan Toto told Bloomberg. “We can expect a great software lineup in year one, from new&nbsp;Mario Kart&nbsp;and&nbsp;3D Mario&nbsp;after eight years to&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;and&nbsp;Metroid Prime 4.&nbsp;There will also be third-party support from day one, most probably including blockbusters like&nbsp;Call of Duty.”</p>



<p>As far as a release date is concerned, multiple analysts expect a June launch for the console. One analyst, Robin Zhu of Sanford C. Bernstein believes there will be inventory of 6-8 million consoles available on day one. </p>



<p>“That suggests that if early sales go as planned, the new console would mark the biggest console launch ever,” Bloomberg writes.</p>

<p>Everyone has a one or a few personal favorite heroes they lock in to win in Marvel Rivals, but the win rate data says that some are just plain better than others. While a higher win rate doesn’t automatically mean they’re a better hero, it’s certainly nothing to scoff at or take likely.</p>



<p>So which heroes in Marvel Rivals win the most? Let’s take a look at the top performing heroes according to win rate.</p>



<h2 id="h-hero-win-rates-in-marvel-rivals-march-2025-season-1-5">Hero Win Rates in Marvel Rivals (March 2025, Season 1.5)</h2>



<p>Similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-popular-marvel-rivals-heroes-highest-pick-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our highest pick rates piece</a>, we’re taking into account competitive and quick play. For competitive play , we’re using current data from tracker sites&nbsp;<a href="https://rivalstracker.com/heroes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsTracker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsMeta</a>. For quickplay, we’re using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero Hot List</a>&nbsp;from the official Marvel Rivals website. Even though the Hero Hot List was last updated February 17th, it’s a better source of quickplay rates than the incomplete data on RivalsTracker and RivalsMeta.</p>

<p>The Human Torch and The Thing have not been included because the quickplay win rates for them are not available yet.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-strategists">Best Strategists</h3>



<h4 id="h-rocket-raccoon">Rocket Raccoon</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rocket Raccoon’s sheer healing output and duelist-buffing teamup options establish him as the winningest strategist. He has a <strong>54.04% win rate in competitive, and a 55.23% win rate in quick play</strong>. His secondary fire healing can rapidly heal a group of allies stacked together, and both Punisher and Winter Soldier thrive when teamed with him. His damage amplifying ultimate also swings any teamfight in his side’s favor.</p>



<h4 id="h-mantis">Mantis</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mantis’ ability to provide healing and damage buffs, plus her individual firepower, make her on the same winning level as Rocket Raccoon. She has a <strong>53.99% win rate in competitive, and a 55.85% win rate in quick play</strong>. Mantis is especially strong at lower ranks, as her heals and buffs are easy to apply. She can also use her sleep and a personal damage boost to solo kill a squishy DPS that tries to challenge her.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-vanguards">Best Vanguards</h3>



<h4 id="h-peni-parker">Peni Parker</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Peni Parker is the winningest vanguard hero in Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>52.44% win rate in competitive, and a 54.82% win rate in quick play</strong>. Peni has arguably the best ranged damage capabilities of any vanguard, and she’s an infuriating nuisance to dig out of an objective once they get their mines down.</p>



<h4 id="h-thor">Thor</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thor has the second highest win rates of any vanguard in Marvel Rivals. He has a <strong>52.15% win rate in competitive, and a 54.71% win rate in quick play</strong>. Thor’s ability to close the distance and thrive in the chaos of a hectic teamfight translate into huge winning potential.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-duelists">Best Duelists</h3>



<h4 id="h-storm">Storm</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Storm is the winningest hero in all of Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>54.29% win rate in competitive, and a 58.11% win rate in quick play</strong>. Storm is a mobile, hard-to-hit, damage-dealing menace that can lead a teamfight with her thunderous Goddess Boost. There’s virtually no escape from her Omega Hurricane ultimate, especially when she can combo it with The Human Torch.</p>



<h4 id="h-magik">Magik</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Magik is the second most winning duelist in Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>52.60% win rate in competitive, and a 53.14% win rate in quick play</strong>. Magik is one of the few pure melee characters in the duelist class, dashing through portals and swinging her sword at anything in range.</p>
