<p>New reports suggest that Hellblade 2 and Gears of War will be making their way to the PlayStation 5 later this year.</p>



<p>That’s according to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/the-game-im-most-excited-for-in-2025-is-already-discounted-before-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WindowsCentral</a>‘s Jez Corden, who corroborated yesterday’s rumors that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> would be making their way to other platforms.</p>



<p>In the new report, Corden states that Hellblade 2, Age of Mythology, and potentially Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition are all also slated for PlayStation 5 later this year.</p>



<p>Corden also points out that most of Xbox’s upcoming games slate will primarily be timed exclusive games for Xbox and PC, which is a direction I think most of us in the industry expected Microsoft to go eventually.</p>



<p>As for when all of these games will be announced to be coming to other platforms, it remains to be seen, but seeing those slated for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acknowledges-recent-nintendo-switch-2-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> would be welcomed announcements whenever Nintendo decides to hold its next Nintendo Direct. The games going to PlayStation may be announced during some “third-party” conference, possibly around the time of Summer Games Fest in June, if those releases are in the latter half of the year.</p>



<p>From the original rumors, NateTheHate also suggested that Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, both PlayStation 5 console exclusives, will come to the Xbox platform soon.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft changing its gaming strategy to release its exclusive games on other platforms? Do you think Microsoft runs the risk of alienating its hardware?

<p>The Call of Duty League’s first Minor is taking place as we speak, with every pro team coming together to compete for a $20,000 one-shot prize. In the opening round, the first losses were dealt, and as swiftly as they entered, Vegas Falcons, Miami Heretics, LAG M8, and Vancouver Surge were all eliminated from the running.</p>



<p>In a shocking finish, LAG M8 were reverse-swept by Minnesota Rokkr, suffering a huge blow that left LAG sitting on a donut for the season so far – not a single game won.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-expectations-tapered">Expectations Tapered</h2>



<p>LAG M8 has had a rough season thus far. The team, which is made up of three former world champion players and a talented newcomer, has failed to secure a single win against any other CDL squad. In most cases, the team has fallen just a few steps shy of landing a win, but that trend has continued into the Minor.</p>



<p>In the opening fixture for the CDL Major I, LAG M8 went 2 – 0 up after two close finishes, but Rokkr turned things around during the Control with a 3 – 0 result. From there, LAG imploded, getting steamrolled by Rokkr in the second Hardpoint and final S&amp;D round.</p>



<p>The team was understandably muted on social media following the loss:</p>











<p>Elsewhere, the Vegas Falcons were also eliminated from the tournament without winning a single map. It was a tall order, with the team facing off against OpTic Texas in the first round, and despite a valiant effort, the Vegas Falcons were roughly booted from the running.</p>



<p>Sadly, the Falcons boast one of the worst records in CDL history at this point, sitting on a win/loss record of 0 – 5 and a game-win percentage of just 14.2%. OpTic Texas is white hot right now, so you can’t really blame Vegas for the loss.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-round">The Next Round</h2>



<p>As we move into the next round, four enormous matches have been lined up:</p>



<ul>
<li>Royal Ravens vs. Cloud 9 NY</li>



<li>Boston Breach vs. OpTic Texas</li>



<li>LA Thieves vs. Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Toronto Ultra vs. Minnesota Rokkr</li>
</ul>



<p>The likes of the Ravens, Boston, LAT, and Ultra all earned a bye ahead of the tournament thanks to their performance in the first round of qualifiers. They’re the undoubted power players of the tournament thus far, with the Royal Ravens leading the pack on a perfect record with a 75% game-win record. </p>



<p>LAT and Ultra follow close behind with identical records of 4- 0 and a 70.5% win percentage.</p>



<p>The tournament is warming up, but it won’t last for long. On Sunday evening, the victor will be crowned and they’ll be $20,000 richer.</p>
