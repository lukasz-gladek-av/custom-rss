<p>2025 has seen AI dominate various forms of media, leading to a significant impact across the entire spectrum of the world, including the gaming industry. However, this is merely the tip of the iceberg, and the impact is likely to intensify in 2026.</p>



<p>The past 12 months have seen AI become increasingly prominent in gaming, ranging from additions like an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-faces-unfair-labor-practice-charge-for-use-of-ai-darth-vader-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-voiced Darth Vader in For</a>tnite to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully AI-generated game</a>, with a smattering of other controversies in between.</p>



<p>While these incidents have sparked discussions at various points of the year, 2025 is set to be only a drop in the ocean for AI in video games, and a huge crossroads lurks ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-major-turning-point">A Major Turning Point</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Controversial. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s important to remember that AI in video games isn’t anything new, and the fact of the matter is, games would simply not be able to run without some AI. All of the enemy soldiers you defeat in a Call of Duty campaign, the opponents you come up against in single-player in EA FC 26, and the NPCs you meet across the vast worlds require AI, in some capacity, to work.</p>



<p>The turning point, however, has been how AI is being used. Rather than using AI to support human-created elements, that step is being skipped in many cases to reduce the workload and have AI do the creation, where it’s artwork to coding. While it’s a crucial tool that can help prevent crunch at studios, controversy remains about its use and whether it will ultimately cost people their jobs.</p>



<p>Using AI as a replacement for human work has been problematic, and gamers have a keen eye to spot where AI has been used, particularly in artwork, with accusations cast towards a slew of major games for certain aspects of work published in 2025.</p>



<p>The discovery of AI use in 2025 has led to backlash, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game Awards disqualifying Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> for generative AI usage and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/">Battlefield 6 coming und</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">er</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/"> fire</a> for suspected use of AI in cosmetic items, and the big question now is how long that furore will last.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-backlash-ease">Will The Backlash Ease?</h2>



<p>Heading into 2026, using AI, particularly generative AI, is somewhat of a death note, as it’s certain to cause backlash among gamers, and there’s no hiding any usage, as players don their detective gear to uncover the truth of whether AI has been used in assets. Essentially, it’s a PR nightmare.</p>



<p>What’s unclear is whether that backlash will remain, as the growing use of AI may eventually be the norm, rightly or wrongly. When used in the right way to support developers and ease tasks, AI is a handy tool, but it’s hard to look across the wealth of layoffs in the industry in recent years and see higher-ups not viewing AI as a handy cost-cutting measure.</p>



<p>This isn’t restricted to gaming, as the use of AI has attracted huge criticism in all forms of media, while it also has both environmental and political impacts. For now, the general view of AI is a negative one, but don’t be surprised if millions upon millions is splashed to try and alter public opinion.</p>



<p>AI use is not a problem unique to gaming, but the future does look bleak, particularly for those employed in a creative industry. Unfortunately, there are no signs of the problem going away, and 2026 could be the stage for a major shift.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft’s CEO Wants People to Stop Calling AI ‘Slop’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-ceo-ai-slop/</link>
            <guid>1395973</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella has taken up a spot of blogging to share his thoughts on advances in technology, specifically around AI.</p>







<p>In a new blogpost posted to his new website named ‘<a href="https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/?v=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snscratchpad</a>‘, Nadella remarks that 2026 will be a “pivotal year for AI,” noting, “Yes, another one [year]. But this moment feels different in a few notable ways.”</p>



<p>According to Nadella, “We have moved past the initial phase of discovery and are entering a phase of widespread diffusion. We are beginning to distinguish between “spectacle” and “substance”. We now have a clearer sense of where the tech is headed, but also the harder and more important question of how to shape its impact on the world.”</p>



<p>“We are still in the opening miles of a marathon. Much remains unpredictable. Amidst this “model overhang,” where capability is outpacing our current ability to use it to have real world impact, this is some of what we still need to get right,” he continued.</p>



<p>In point one, Nadella states that “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our “theory of the mind” that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.”</p>



<p>He later continues to say that “we need to make deliberate choices on how we diffuse this technology in the world as a solution to the challenges of people and planet. For AI to have societal permission it must have real world eval impact. The choices we make about where we apply our scarce energy, compute, and talent resources will matter. This is the socio-technical issue we need to build consensus around.”</p>



<p>While true, it isn’t at all surprising to see Nadella fully in support of AI, after all, Microsoft has seen tens of thousands of layoffs in the past 36 months as the company continues to invest in AI.</p>







<p>Even now, it’s almost impossible to use any of Microsoft’s ecosystem without having some form of AI use, with Microsoft Copilot being at the forefront of the company’s drive.</p>



<p>It’s certainly looking like 2026 will be another year focused on AI, but with new issues coming to the forefront, including an unprecedented rise in RAM prices and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-prices-to-5000-in-2026/">hardware including GPUs</a>, it poses the question to what extent will AI be pushed and the price that we’ll, quiter literally, have to pay.</p>

<p>The next year is shaping up to be a big one for gaming, with 2026 including a wealth of major releases from huge publishers across the world, but there are also plenty of exciting Indie releases on the horizon.</p>



<p>From sequels to popular titles to entirely new creations, Insider Gaming has selected eight of the biggest Indie games to watch out for in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-2026-indie-releases">Biggest 2026 Indie Releases</h2>



<h3 id="h-hytale">Hytale</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Finally. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where else is there to start? After being scrapped by Riot Games, Hytale is back in the hands of it’s original creators at Hypixel Studios and an early access release is set for January 13. After a long, long wait, this could be one of the biggest releases of the year.</p>



<p>Hytale began life as a Minecraft server, and the inspiration from the Mojang title is clear to see, but the big differences are the embracement of modding, with all in-game assets being made available to the community to create with, opening the door to an infinite number of ideas.</p>



<p>The early access release merely marks the next stage in the Hytale journey, and players have been warned it’s far from the finished product, but, either way, Hytale will be huge in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-demon-tides">Demon Tides</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Washout. Image via Fabraz</figcaption></figure>



<p>A platformer set in the open seas, Demon Tides will see players explore the waters of the world to uncover dark secrets, with “dozens of locales” and gear to upgrade, and the game is set to be released on February 19.</p>



<p>The demo, initially released in February 2025, earned rave reviews, and even received an update dropping additional content, and the full adventure is now right around the corner.</p>



<h3 id="h-beastro">Beastro</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Cooking up a storm. Image via Timberline Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>No release date has been set for Beastro, but a demo is now available on Steam, with the title seeing players take control of Panko, tasked with creating culinary masterpieces to serve to a variety of characters, and the dishes you create will build a deck for their adventures.</p>



<p>The food-based fantasy adventure’s unique mix of cooking and deck building, with a variety of ingredients to unlock and secrets to discover, will certainly cause a stir, and it’s a title you should definitely keep your eyes peeled for in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-aniimo">Aniimo</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Journey awaits. Image via Pawprint Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Two years after Palworld set the gaming world alight, a new open-world, creature-catching game is on the horizon with Aniimo, which, like the Pocketpair title, will be open to a wide audience due to its inclusion on Xbox Game Pass from release date. </p>



<p>Full details of the release are yet to be shared, though they could come in Xbox’s Partner Showcase in January, but the countdown is well and truly on, with reveals showcasing an array of Aniimo’s to collect, vast social interactions, and an exciting world to explore.</p>



<h3 id="h-slay-the-spire-2">Slay the Spire 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sequel. Image via Mega Crit</figcaption></figure>



<p>Set for launch in March 2026, Slay the Spire 2 is the sequel to the original title, once again inciting players with a roguelike deckbuilder filled with challenges and variety.</p>



<p>The original Slay the Spire, released in 2019, is still extremely popular to this day and is ranked overwhelmingly positive on Steam with close to 70,000 reviews, showing that there is already an extremely strong playerbase, and more players are set to be drawn in.</p>



<h3 id="h-coromon-rogue-planet">Coromon: Rogue Planet</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Going rogue. Image via TRAGsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another creature-catching game releasing in 2026 is Coromon: Rogue Planet, a sequel to the original Coromon, which focuses on a roguelike approach—which could set it apart from other games in the genre.</p>



<p>While there’s plenty that will be familiar to players, like choosing your starter Coromon and battling wild monsters, the roguelike approach gives a different spin to the game, and could lure in a heap of players as a result.</p>



<h3 id="h-big-walk">Big Walk</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Follow the leader. Image via House House</figcaption></figure>



<p>The creators of Untitled Goose Game are back in 2026 with the release of Big Walk, a cooperative online walker-talker where players can “hang out and get lost with close friends in a big world.”</p>



<p>Filled with challenges, puzzles and discoveries, there’s a heap of adventures on the horizon, and the scope to just hang out with your friends, or boot your companions into the ocean, the choice is up to you.</p>



<h3 id="h-neverway">Neverway</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Haunted. Image via Coldblood Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neverway is described as a mixture of a horror, life sim, and action RPG, where players take charge of Fiona, who starts over on a farm. If this sounds like your cup of tea, and you’re a big fan of Stardew Valley, Neverway’s release in 2026 is something that can’t be missed.</p>



<p>With farming, combat, dating, and plenty to collect, Neverway could be one of the biggest titles in 2026, and the fact it was co-created by the pixel artist of Celeste adds another feather into Neverway’s cap.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 Jailbreak Rumors Have Caused A Star Wars Game to Increase 1000% in Price]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-game-hike-in-price/</link>
            <guid>1395940</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new PlayStation 5 rumour suggesting that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-rom-keys-leak-jailbreaking-concerns-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console can be jailbroken</a> has caused one Star Wars game to increase in price by over 1000%.</p>







<p>That’s because, according to the rumours, the jailbreak method can only be done with a physical version of one particular game.</p>



<p>The game in question is Star Wars Racer Revenge, which, before the rumours, was selling for around $50. Now, listings on eBay are as high as $500, meaning that the price has increased tenfold.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gezine</a> on X, one of the reasons for the sudden price increase is that the game only has around 10,000 copies in the market, which is a relatively low number in the grand scheme of things. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Wars Racer Revenge [Full Game | No Commentary] PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7TXXOtvIG8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As of yet, Star Wars Racer Revenge is the only game that works and according to the rumours, it works because the exploit targets the PlayStation 5’s disc authentication used for backwards compatibility.</p>



<p>Sony is yet to respond to the rumours, but if true, the jailbreaks could pose security concerns for the brand. As for what it currently means for jailbroken PlsyStation 5’s is also unclear, but it’s a step in the direction to soon having jailbroken consoles flooding the market.</p>







<div><p>So, with the price increases, it might be worth checking your library of physical games to see if you have a copy lying around. You might just be sitting on a fortune!</p><p>What do you think of the news that the PlayStation 5 may be jailbroken?
