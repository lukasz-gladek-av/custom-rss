<p>NetEase has <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1890096608580366518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the biggest and most lucrative Marvel Rivals tournament series to date. The Marvel Rivals Invitational will see teams across the world compete in one of four regional tournaments, with $400,000 on the line across the whole series.</p>



<p>Could this be the first major step toward a serious Marvel Rivals esports scene?</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-invitational-announced">Marvel Rivals Invitational Announced</h2>



<p>The Marvel Rivals Invitational will consist of four separate tournaments, one for each major region. Each region’s tournament will feature its own $100,000 prize pool, meaning a total of $400,000 will be given out across the five week span. The Marvel Rivals Invitational will begin with the Oceanic tournament, then Asia, then EMEA, and finally North America.</p>



<p>The matches will be broadcast on both the official Marvel Rivals <a href="http://twitch.tv/marvelrivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch channel</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com/@MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a>. Here are the dates for each region:</p>



<ul>
<li>Oceania – February 15-16</li>



<li>Asia – February 22-23</li>



<li>EMEA – February 28-March 2, March 7-9</li>



<li>North America – March 14-16, March 21-23</li>
</ul>

<p>NetEase and Marvel Rivals have been hesitant to jump head first into a dedicated esports scene. Many point to the rushed creation of the Overwatch League as something that did more harm than good, as OWL was announced the same year that Overwatch released. Back in January 2025, Marvel Rivals game director Guangyun Chen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that he wanted to cater to both casual and competitive players</a>. As of now, Marvel Rivals is not rushing to put together a massive esports league.</p>



<p>Still, there’s been no shortage of interest in a potential esports scene. Streaming star Shroud mentioned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-organisation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potentially starting an organization</a> just to play Marvel Rivals back in January. He then <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1888686812044103965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that he’s building an organization after reaching a $150,000 donation goal during a charity stream a month later. He also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAssembled/status/1887877669955514717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met</a> with Sentinels CEO Rob Moore, who said he would be open to Shroud running a Marvel Rivals team under the Sentinels brand.</p>



<p>Is a tournament of this size going to ignite the Marvel Rivals esports scene ?Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Ubisoft is happy with the pre-launch build for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Despite multiple delays that pushed the game out of 2024 to March 20, 2025, Ubisoft’s CEO Yves Guillemot says that the interest in the game has seen strong preorders overall.</p>



<p>During Ubisoft’s Q3 2025 <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2GbdOQTUuRZV3mqGXgTfeK/520f2262c4f60b4bc13f0f3a59ec37e7/Ubisoft_FY25_Q3_PR_English_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call on Thursday</a>, Guillemot said that preorders for Assassin’s Creed Shadows are “tracking solidly, in line with those of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, the second most successful entry of the franchise”.</p>



<p>Aside from the pre-orders, Ubisoft says that the previews of the game have been strong from multiple angles.</p>



<p>“Early previews have been positive, praising its narrative and immersive experience, with both characters playing critical roles in the game’s storyline, as well as the quality and complementarity of the gameplay provided by the dual protagonist approach,” Guillemot said.</p>



<p>He continued: “I want to commend the incredible talent and dedication of the entire Assassin’s Creed’s team, who is working tirelessly to ensure that Shadows delivers on the promise of what is the franchise’s most ambitious entry yet.”</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was originally scheduled for release on November 15, 2024. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was then delayed</a> to February 14,  2025 for more polish and updates. In January, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed again</a> to March 20.</p>



<p>What do you think of Assassin’s Creed Shadows preorders being as strong as they are? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>
