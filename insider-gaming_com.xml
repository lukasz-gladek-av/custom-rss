<p>Warlocks have come to the world of Diablo 2 as the game has received its first major update in a quarter of a century.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/blizzard-entertainment/" id="87642">Blizzard Entertainment</a> announced the Reign of the Warlock DLC during a presentation spotlighting 30 years of Diablo. The trailer featured actor Rahul Kohli from Midnight Mass. Kohli narrated the trailer from the Warlock’s point of view in the update that is now available for Diablo 2: Resurrected.</p>

<p>In addition to coming to Diablo 2, the Warlock class is also coming to Diablo 4 and Diablo Immortal. The Immortal update will be available this summer, and the Diablo 4 update will be available in April 2026.</p>



<p>As another teaser, the Blizzard staff featured in the presentation teased a major announcement coming for BlizzCon this September.</p>







<p>Along with the update, the game is now available on Xbox Game Pass and PC on Steam. The announcement of the new class on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2536520/view/490465019074445508?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam </a>came with a note from the development team that they are aware of issues impacting players:</p>



<p>“We are aware of an issue impacting Diablo II: Resurrected Infernal Edition bonus incentives for Diablo IV and World of Warcraft, where some players who purchase on Steam may not see these items unlock immediately. Our team is actively working on a fix, and eligible rewards will automatically unlock once resolved,” the statement reads.</p>

<p>Unfortunate news coming out of Wildlight Entertainment.</p>



<p>Alex Graner, Senior level designer for Highguard, revealed in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?datePosted=%22past-24h%22&amp;keywords=Wildlight&amp;sid=~Hb">LinkedIn </a>that he, “along with most of the team at Wildlight,” was laid off on February 11.</p>



<p>Notably, he says there was a lot of unreleased content that he and the team had designed for the game, which he was looking forward to sharing with the public.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-bumpy-road-for-highguard">The Bumpy Road for Highguard</h2>



<p>Highguard launched on January 26 and received mostly negative reviews on Steam from the outset. They continued to push forward with updates, including new modes and events, but less than a month later, news broke of massive layoffs.</p>



<p>The game was launched with big hype as the final announcement from the 2025 Game Awards ceremony. However, there was virtual radio silence following that event until the game’s launch.</p>







<h2 id="h-layoffs-becoming-more-common-in-the-gaming-space">Layoffs Becoming More Common in the Gaming Space</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, mass layoffs are becoming a trend in the gaming industry. Ubisoft recently underwent a major restructuring, resulting in the cancellation of multiple projects, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.</a></p>



<p>Wildgate also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wildgate-developer-moonshot-confirms-layoffs/" id="171549">recently announced</a> layoffs. As did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">Riot Games.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Wildlight for comment. We will update the story as new information becomes available.</p>
