<p>Balatro and Luck Be A Landlord have won their respective appeals against their PEGI ratings. Both will now be rated PEGI 12 as opposed to the PEGI 18 rating they have had since launch.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PEGI website</a>, explanations were given for the move down for each game. </p>



<p>For Balatro, the PEGI Complaints Board says that “although the game explains the various hands of poker, the roguelike deck-building game contained mitigating fantastical elements”.</p>



<p>In regards to Luck Be A Landlord, the board had the same arguments as it did for Balatro. It added that “although the game features a slot machine mechanic, there were no specific transferable gambling skills”.</p>



<p>“PEGI acknowledges the finding of the Complaints Board appeals panel in regards to amending the classifications of these games,” the organization wrote. “The PEGI system continuously evolves in line with cultural expectations and the guidance of independent experts who support our assessment process. PEGI strives to apply ratings criteria fairly, consistently, and transparently to ensure that audiences understand the type of content that is present in games.”</p>



<p>The announcement concluded saying that “on the basis of these appeals” the PEGI Experts Group will “develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes”.</p>



<p>What do you think of Balatro and Luck Be A Landlord winning their appeals and seeing their PEGI ratings adjusted to PEGI 12?

<p>If you’re unsure when Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 will release, we’ve whipped up a handy hub with all the early details: Its likely start date, Verdansk coming back, and much more.</p>



<p>You only have to look at Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone’s player counts to realize Season 3 is the most important yet. Dwindling numbers and a lack of interest mean Activision needs to deliver. October and November 2025 saw Call of Duty’s Steam numbers exceed 300,000. Now, CoD is barely scraping together 100,000 players—and the count is falling more.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 &amp; Warzone Season 3’s release may dictate the next six months. Let’s take a deep dive into the latest plans—including news of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk returning to Warzone</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-amp-warzone-season-3-release-date">Black Ops 6 &amp; Warzone Season 3 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Verdansk dropping in. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The end of the Season 2 Reloaded Battle Pass tells us Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 likely commences on March 20.</strong></p>



<p>Most (if not all) live service games have a Battle Pass, and the majority have a countdown timer telling us how long the season has left. It’s the same case with Black Ops 6 and Warzone’s Season 2 Reloaded Battle Pass. If we go by its remaining days—and factor in every CoD season ever—then March 20 is the day of Season 3.</p>



<p>Maintenance or mishaps can get in the way of this. We’ll update this if we hear more or if Activision has a different plan.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdansk-rumored-to-return-in-warzone-amp-black-ops-6-season-3">Verdansk Rumored to Return in Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 Season 3</h2>



<p>Verdansk’s long-awaited return is the big news and easily the most anticipated addition in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3. It’s been in the pipeline for months (daresay years) and <strong>Activision confirmed the news on Aug. 28, 2024</strong>.</p>



<p>“Run it back. Verdansk will return to Call of Duty Warzone in 2025,” said the official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1828873802551271432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty X account</a>. There’s still no official word on when it’s coming back, but all signs point to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-is-reportedly-returning-to-warzone-in-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk returning in Season 3</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re worried about <em>which </em>version of Verdansk we’re potentially getting, you don’t need to. According to leaker TheGhostOfHope, “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s pretty much the OG March 2020 version</a>.” </p>



<p>We’re checking socials every day for official word of Verdansk in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3. Keep checking back for the latest updates and leaks.</p>



<h2 id="h-season-3-leaks-roze-rumors">Season 3 Leaks—Roze Rumors</h2>



<p>There’s no roadmap so far, meaning this is purely speculative for now: But leaks suggest the <strong>infamous Roze skin</strong> is another dose of nostalgia for Season 3—along with other returning Operators and the usual seasonal content.</p>



<p>You’re lucky if you never had the displeasure of coming up against a user running the Roze skin, you’re lucky. The original Warzone’s Roze wore an all-black military suit that blended in with a lot of the environment. It eventually became seen as a pay-to-win skin as players were effectively being camouflaged—giving them the advantage in firefights.</p>



<p>Call of Duty news source <a href="https://x.com/DETONATEDcom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Detonated</a> claims: “Hudson, Roze, and Mace Operators are rumored to return in Black Ops 6, most likely with Season 3. It’s also fair to assume more maps, game modes, a new Battle Pass, and more Operators are on the way.</p>



<p>We’ll update this hub with more details once we hear more.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s obvious Verdansk is the biggest talking point approaching Season 3. How do you feel about this? Will Black Ops 6 let the vintage Verdansk take the adulation and glory? Or are you not bothered and more interested to see how Black Ops 6 can bring players back? Let us know.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s plans for its new Muse AI technology for video games appears to be ready to move into full gear. In a recent interview, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the company is getting ready to start training its new AI system on a “catalog of games”.</p>



<p>Speaking on the Dwarkesh Patel Podcast—h/t to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-train-its-gaming-ai-on-a-catalogue-of-titles-soon-satya-nadella-says-and-then-start-playing-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>—Nadella says that the plan is to train the AI system on games so that it can actually start playing them.</p>



<p>“When&nbsp;Phil Spencer&nbsp;first showed it to me, he had an Xbox controller and this model basically took the input and generated the output based on the input. And it was consistent with the game,” Nadella said.</p>



<p>“That to me is a massive, massive moment of ‘wow’. It’s kind of like the first time we saw ChatGPT complete sentences, or Dall-E draw, or Sora. This is one such moment.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As far as how this ability and training will help with game development and gamers, in general, Nadella didn’t go into any specifics. </p>



<p>According to Microsoft’s announcement of Muse, not only does it have the potential to assist with game development and accessibility, but it could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-technology-could-help-game-preservation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help with game preservation</a> as well.</p>



<p>The idea of AI in gaming continues to be a much discussed topic. Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-players-want-to-filter-out-games-that-use-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam users began requesting</a> the ability to filter out games that use generative AI. Even CEO’s have gotten in on the topic with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick believing</a> that there’s truly no such thing as “artificial intelligence”.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft using games to train its AI model to play them? Let us know down below, and join the discussion further in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1691/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>
