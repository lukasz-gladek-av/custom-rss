<p>Retailers are expecting that they will run out of pre-order units for the Nintendo Switch 2 on day 1, despite Nintendo allegedly accumulating a large quantity for launch.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs according to internal emails and documents provided to Insider Gaming from a large US retailer, who are anticipating they will sell out of the Switch 2 on the same day they open up the pre-orders due to a limited unit allocation from Nintendo.</p>



<p>According to the documents, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 is scheduled to release in June</a>, a release month that has already been a widely rumoured and was a highly talked about by developers at this year‚Äôs GDC.</p>



<p>However, the documents do add a little confusion as to when the pre-orders go live, especially following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Buy Canada ‚Äúleak‚Äù </a>earlier this week that revealed they‚Äôd go live on April 2nd.</p>



<p>According to the documents from the US retailer, pre-orders are set to go live on April 9th, one week after the Nintendo Switch 2 direct. The documents include a messaging strategy following the direct to include ‚ÄúPre-Order Coming Soon‚Äù messaging and a Countdown Clock that will end on April 9, with an exact time to be confirmed by Nintendo on April 2.</p>



<p>The documents also included details on a exclusive collectible coin for those who pre-order the console.</p>



<p>Whether or not Best Buy Canada‚Äôs ‚Äúleak‚Äù was a mistake or not is unclear, but the company did promptly remove the information after it started circulating online. In any case though, pre-order‚Äôs are almost certainly going to live within a week of the direct.</p>

<p>Developer Pearl Abyss has announced that it is ending support for Black Desert Online on last-gen consoles.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.console.playblackdesert.com/News/Notice/Detail?boardNo=19140&amp;countryType=en-US&amp;boardType=0&amp;searchType=&amp;searchText=%C2%A4tPage=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video going over</a> the plans, the studio revealed that the game‚Äôs native update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will launch on June 26, 2025. At that point, the game will ‚Äúshift to an exclusive PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S service‚Äù. This will result in support for the game on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4‚Äîboth of which received the game in 2019‚Äîofficially coming to an end.</p>



<p>‚ÄúGameplay on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will no longer be available after the porting update on June 26,‚Äù said Brian Choi, Black Desert console‚Äôs live service manager.</p>



<p>He continued to assure players that all game data will be saved and stored. Account information as well as all entitlements to Black Desert Online will be accessible when players decide to make the jump to the current-gen console version of the game.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe understand that this news may be disappointing to many of you,‚Äù Choi said. ‚ÄúBlack Desert has been consistently updated to provide a better experience for adventurers. However, as we mentioned in our previous video, despite the ongoing efforts to optimize and update content for older generation consoles, we have reached the point where hardware limitations make it increasingly difficult to deliver the latest content smoothly.‚Äù</p>



<p>When the update is released, it will be available at no additional cost for players who are making the jump to the current-gen systems.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Direct event to reveal all of the features of the Nintendo Switch 2 takes place on April 2, but that doesn‚Äôt mean rumors aren‚Äôt going to stop spreading before then. In a new claim by a known leaker, the Nintendo Switch 2 will have a unique feature that connects to the current-gen Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://youtu.be/l2QbjzzdVj8?si=TzuZlQutPSLgmFJk&amp;t=546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2‚Äôs mysterious ‚ÄúC‚Äù button will have multiple functions. One specific function, however, is that it will let you connect the new system to an original Nintendo Switch. This will reportedly allow players to use the Switch 1 as a controller or screen for Switch 2 games.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the only function, or it will have more,‚Äù eXtas1s said via translation. </p>



<p>He then went on to give an example of how this would work based on what his sources explained to him. Using Mario Kart 9 as an example, the Switch 2 user will be able to hit the ‚ÄúC‚Äù button and connect to the Switch 1, letting it then be used as another controller for the game. That would also allow, in this example, for Mario Kart 9 to be played on the Switch 1 screen to avoid split-screen play.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs unclear what‚Äîor how many‚Äîgames this feature would work with.</p>



<p>As with all rumors, please take this with a grain of salt unless Insider Gaming can independently verify the information or it is confirmed by Nintendo itself.</p>
