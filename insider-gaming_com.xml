<p>Multiplayer games have always been about more than just winning or losing. They’re the late-night sessions that go longer than planned, the friend you squad up with every weekend, and the moments that turn into stories you still bring up years later. Whether it’s competitive chaos or cooperative problem-solving, multiplayer experiences have a way of creating memories that single-player games simply can’t replicate.</p>



<p>That sense of shared experience is reflected in the voting for the Insider Gaming community’s Best Multiplayer Game of 2025. In one of the closest results of all the awards, it was clear that the community was torn between two contenders. But, in the end, it was ARC Raiders that stood out on top as the Best Multiplayer Game.</p>







<p>The extraction shooter from Embark Studios received 31.3% of the votes in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>. It just beat out the other major multiplayer juggernaut of the year, Battlefield 6, which came in second at 26.8%. </p>



<p>Coming in a distant third were actually two games as both Peak and Split Fiction received 10.7% of the votes. They were followed by Mario Kart World at 8.9%. Other games receiving votes were Marvel Rivals, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and Escape From Tarkov.</p>



<p>Circling back on Arc Raiders, what makes the game so special? Well, just take a look at what Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill had to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">say in his review</a>.</p>







<p><strong>“I was holding fire on ARC Raiders for the longest time, but I need to admit that it’s everything I’m looking for in an extraction shooter,”</strong> Taylor-Hill wrote.</p>



<p><strong>“There are plenty of places to loot and explore, the resource pool is diverse, and the core concept of the game is intriguing and engaging. I’m a huge fan of the combat, which invites you to try out a range of fighting styles and approaches, and I love how accessible the game is, catering perfectly for casual players just as much as die-hard veterans of the genre.”</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Tarkov is Made for Satisfaction, Not For Fun’, Battlestate Games Explains]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-battlestate-satisfaction-not-fun/</link>
            <guid>1392571</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As you might know, Escape from Tarkov is one of the most soul-crushing games on the market. It’s also one of the most rewarding, provided luck is in your favor when you decide to play it. It’s the pioneering extraction shooter that popularized the genre, and for several years, it has been known as one of the most challenging titles ever made.</p>



<p>Recently, we caught up with Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, the developer behind Escape from Tarkov. As our conversation unravelled, we learned about the team’s goal when it comes to evoking emotion in players, and as it turns out, it’s not about encouraging <strong>fun</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-you-don-t-play-it-for-a-good-time">You Don’t Play It For a Good Time</h2>



<p>If you’ve never heard of Escape from Tarkov, you might be missing out. As the premier extraction shooter, Escape from Tarkov challenges players to load into a borderline milsim environment, accepting that a single bullet can destroy their entire session and cause them to lose everything.</p>



<p>But for as off-putting as that sounds, it’s a hugely satisfying game when things <strong>go right</strong>. If you go on a winning streak, you’ll be elated, and every raid that you launch in Escape from Tarkov has the <strong>potential </strong>to yield massive rewards.</p>



<p>It’s gambling, in a way. That’s why extraction games are so successful, and it <strong>all started </strong>with Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Talking to Nikita Buyanov on the most recent episode of Access Granted, we learned how the team views Escape from Tarkov from an emotional perspective:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People really want to play this kind of game, they really want to play something intellectual, hard, punishing, unforgiving… Something that will actually shake their emotions, not the game for the enjoyment.</p>



<p>Tarkov is made for satisfaction, not for fun. Not for enjoyment.</p>



<p>To have a chance to get the satisfaction or to frustrate. It is what it is. It’s polarizing. You get everything or you get nothing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s an honesty that is rarely seen in the industry. This is a developer acknowledging that their game can be challenging to the point of ‘not being fun’, but that’s entirely the point. It’s why Escape from Tarkov has spent so long at the top of the extraction shooter table. It knows what it is, and it delivers so perfectly on what might seem like a bizarre gameplay loop to some.</p>



<p>If you want to check out the full interview with Nikita, you can do so on the Insider Gaming app, available now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.insidergaming.app">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insider-gaming/id6753984648">iOS</a>. It’s available exclusively for Insider Gaming Premium subscribers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Knife Arena Codes (December 2025)]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Knife Arena monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including release cases and much more.</p>



<p>Knife Arena is a fast-paced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-anime-ragnarok-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> FFA battleground where players engage in knife-only combat, testing their reflexes and tactical skills in close-quarters battles. Unlike games with varied weapons and complex progression systems, success in Knife Arena hinges entirely on your blade mastery, movement precision, and split-second decision making. The game’s instant respawn system ensures continuous action, making every match an intense test of timing and precision as you dash, dodge, and deliver devastating strikes.</p>







<p>Progression revolves around the game’s skin collection system, where players can unlock various knife cosmetics to personalize their gameplay experience. Although knife skins and other cosmetics can be earned through regular gameplay by accumulating coins from victories and kill streaks, the fastest way to enhance your collection is by redeeming codes. While the base mechanics remain consistent, having rare knife skins adds a visual flair that helps you stand out in the arena.</p>



<h2 id="h-active-knife-arena-codes">Active Knife Arena Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li>freecase – Release Case</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-knife-arena-codes">Expired Knife Arena Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes, so players can redeem the active codes safely.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-knife-arena-codes">How To Redeem Knife Arena Codes?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Knife Arena Codes Redemption Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Follow these steps to activate all the active codes in Knife Arena:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot Knife Arena in Roblox</li>



<li>Click on the setting buttons on the top-left corner</li>



<li>Then click on the Redeem Code button shows up</li>



<li>Type or paste the code into the text box</li>



<li>Press redeem and enjoy the freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-knife-arena-codes">Where To Get More Knife Arena Codes?</h2>



<p>Knife Arena codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Discord server, where you can join discussions and see announcements before they’re widely known, the One Hit Studio (9D GAMES) Roblox group page, and their social media accounts where they post updates about the Roblox game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones, major updates, or special events, but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. The developers don’t typically announce expiration dates for codes, making it crucial to redeem them promptly. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In 2025, PlayStation Plus members can enjoy an impressive lineup of titles. Explore the vibrant streets of Night City in Cyberpunk 2077, embark on an epic journey through the breathtaking realms of God of War: Ragnarök, or face the chilling horror of Alan Wake 2. There’s something thrilling for every type of player to discover this year.</p>



<p>PlayStation Plus adds tons of titles to the subscription service each year, providing access to more and more games for every higher tier. Out of this massive library, some titles are certified hits, whereas some are just space fillers. Check out Insider Gaming’s top 10 picks for PlayStation Plus 2025 games below. </p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-playstation-plus-games-of-2025">Top 10 PlayStation Plus Games of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>First up is the game that came out in January, a sequel to one of PlayStation’s most popular franchises, God of War. If you have played the first game, then you should definitely give Ragnarök a try as it improves on the base game immensely, adding new gameplay elements, fresh realms to explore, and a proper conclusion to the story.</p>



<h3 id="h-high-on-life">High On Life</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>High on Life is a first-person comedy adventure developed by Squanch Games and released in 2022. It is known for its humorous narrative, filled with quirky characters and featuring talking guns as the highlights. You are tasked with saving Humanity, who is threatened by an alien cartel that wants to use them as drugs. The title is also receiving a sequel soon, so it might be the perfect time to catch up on the first game.</p>



<h3 id="h-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are into 2D platforming metroidvania games, then Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown might be an excellent pick for you. It features an original story in which players explore a Persian-inspired world filled with larger-than-life landmarks. You also get to use time abilities and platforming skills, which can be used to perform combos against time-corrupted enemies and other mythological creatures. </p>



<h3 id="h-hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you haven’t had the chance to try Hogwarts Legacy and are a big fan of the Harry Potter franchise, then there is no better game in this list for you. Though the game’s events take place 300 years before the books and movies, it is a familiar magical world that players get to explore as a new character. It features an original story, familiar location, spell casting, crafting potions, and everything else that you love about this universe, all revolving around an original story. </p>



<h3 id="h-blue-prince">Blue Prince</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Blue Prince is a new indie title released in 2025 that has won the hearts of many around the globe. The critically acclaimed title takes players to Mt. Holly, a mysterious manor with shifting rooms. The player has inherited this manor and is searching for Room 46. To get to this room, players will have to go through all the doors, which lead to new and exciting chambers with their own secrets and challenges. </p>



<h3 id="h-cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is my pick of all the games. I can tell you that I spent over 70 hours just scouring through the open world, not even finishing half of the story, with my total gameplay coming in at 140 hours. I am not a fan of first-person games; however, this title has been the best entry into the genre. The world of this game is so incredibly dense, and the characters are so well defined that you will spend most of your game exploring Night City, which, to be honest, is the real main character of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-lies-of-p">Lies of P</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are looking into testing a challenging soulslike title, then Lies of P might be more your speed. In this game, you get to play as Geppetto’s puppet, who has been tasked to slay unearthly monsters while unearthing the secrets of Krat, a city set in the Belle Epoque era. The 2023 title is Neowiz’s take on&nbsp;the beloved fairy tale of Pinocchio, with a dark, grim spin. </p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-spider-man">Marvel’s Spider-Man</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, if you are a PlayStation player, then this game cannot be missed. Marvel’s Spider-Man is one of the biggest PlayStation games and also one of the best superhero games out there. It is a remastered version that features higher resolution and a higher frame rate, while offering players an original story in which they play as Peter Parker, fighting crime and iconic villains as they swing through New York.</p>



<h3 id="h-alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Alan Wake 2 is the critically acclaimed sequel to the 2010 title; however, players don’t need to play the first game to experience this mind-bending survival horror. It features Alan Wake, a writer trapped in a nightmare, and Saga Anderson, who is in the world of the living. Players get to play as two characters and even explore two locations, the majestic landscapes of Cauldron Lake and the nightmarish cityscape of the Dark Place. The game puts you in close-combat situations with various supernatural enemies, and the ultimate weapon for survival against them is the light. </p>



<h3 id="h-red-dead-redemption-nbsp">Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Red Dead Redemption is the first game in the series, even though the events of the game take place after RDR2. Players get to play as John Marston as he tracks down the last remaining members of the Van Der Linde Gang in his quest for revenge. The new version of the game offers higher resolution and a higher frame rate, making it better suited for current-gen consoles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Insider Gaming’s Best Action-Adventure Game of the Year 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-best-action-adventure-game-of-the-year-2025/</link>
            <guid>1392472</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Action-Adventure category gets more intense and serious year on year. With the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S capable of delivering high-end games that no one thought possible two decades ago, we’re seeing the best of the best in the genre. This year’s Insider Gaming Action-Adventure nominees are incredible, and one stands above the rest in 2025.</p>



<p>Combining exhilarating action you’d normally associate with a Hollywood blockbuster epic with the storytelling and nuances of an adventure movie, book, or game is a difficult duality to master. Masterfully succeeding at two genres means you’ve created the ultimate hybrid, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> has picked out four key contenders for this award.</p>







<p>The breakdown begins with the winner.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-action-adventure-game-of-2025-winner-hollow-knight-silksong">Best Action-Adventure Game Of 2025 Winner—Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, Insider Gaming got a chance to play Silksong before most, and claimed: “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The game you’ve been waiting for is worth the wait</a>.” Come release day, this statement aged very well. Silksong is an all-time Metroidvania great, and its intricate level design pairs up beautifully with the usual tropes of dropfeeding abilities and blocking your way with tough bosses.</p>







<p>Unusually, Silksong offers more freedom than the typical Metroidvania. There are multiple optional areas and bosses; you don’t have to go on the same path each time, and there are so many side quests and gambits to consider. Sometimes this is to get away from the game’s excessive difficulty, mind, as Silksong is certainly not an experience the casual gamer will enjoy. It requires a gut full of fortitude and patience to beat, but the alluring graphics and beautifully designed enemies and environments make it worth it.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong took longer than anyone would’ve liked to arrive, but it’s earned its place.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-action-adventure-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Action-Adventure Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sucker Punch Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima wasn’t perfect, but it sure was pretty and plentiful. Ghost of Yotei is an improvement in most areas, but still stumbles into the same pitfalls as its predecessor, and the story perhaps doesn’t quite live up to the first game. Still, this is a PlayStation 5 exclusive worth the money, and further flexes Sucker Punch’s creative muscles.</p>



<p>The studio has admitted it might move onto <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sly, inFamous</a>, or something new entirely moving forward. If this happens, Ghost of Yotei is a good note to end on (or briefly put on hiatus) and was a strong contender for the Best Action-Adventure prize.</p>



<h3 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another in the ‘sequel to the original that basically does it better’ department. Hideo Kojima’s schedule is busy with OD and Physint, but Death Stranding 2 was always going to be the focus. With returning cast members and another glittering array of video game royalty joining the action, there’s no expense spared for Death Stranding 2.</p>



<p>As with any Kojima title, there’s an unbelievable sense of grandeur and pomp in DS2. The game sometimes crumbles under its own lofty premise and vision, but take nothing away from what Kojima Productions has achieved here. It’s a technical marvel and one worth the price of admission for <em>that </em>spinning lights section!</p>



<h3 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hazelight Studios has quickly gained a reputation as a studio that can’t do any wrong. The new-ish studio already has A Way Out and It Takes Two under its belt. When you win Game of the Year in only your second try, every subsequent release comes with the unenviable burden of expectation. If there was one way to describe Split Fiction, it’s more of It Takes Two: Two-player-only gameplay, two different characters going through a host of mini-games and new and innovative mechanics, and a heartwarming story to pull them together through the adventure.</p>



<p>Split Fiction is near-enough on par with It Takes Two, but there might be an argument that it’s a trick we’ve already seen before—lessening its spectacle and impact. Hazelight’s newest work is still a GOTY contender—one <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gamings-the-game-awards-2025-winner-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming think was cruelly overlooked by The Game Awards 2025</a>—and needs to be played.</p>



<p>Was Hollow Knight: Silksong the clear and oustanding candidate in this category? Or has IG made a misfire on this list somehwere?
