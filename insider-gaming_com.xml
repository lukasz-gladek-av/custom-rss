<p>The worst level in Halo: Combat Evolved is getting some much-needed changes in Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p>



<p>Announced at the Halo World Championships,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>&nbsp;remakes the 2001 classic Halo: Combat Evolved. The game will tell the original story of Master Chief and Cortana beating the Covenant and saving the universe. As a campaign-only title, the game is set to release in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and, for the first time ever,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>. With excitement about the gameplay alive and well, the team told Xbox Wire about a change to the controversial Library level.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">a blog post from Xbox Wire</a>, members of Halo: Campaign Evolved’s development team spoke on the remake. Max Szlagor, the game’s Creative Director, talked about changes being made to certain levels that weren’t done for the Anniversary Edition. Chief among them was the dreaded Library level. Speaking on it, Szlagor said,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We learned from&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</em>&nbsp;that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters,” Szlagor states <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">in the blog</a>. “In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We’ve added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there’s new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out. We’re not changing the stories, it’s about refining and adding context to this moment, and other levels like it, so players can stay on track.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you played Halo: Combat Evolved, you know how annoying The Library level is. Countless droves of The Flood and horrible level design made it a challenging chore. Fortunately, new fans, like those on PlayStation, won’t have to suffer much. Plus, with new dialogue for Guilty Spark, the intriguing lore will get the justice it deserves. From developer comments, a lot of changes are in the works for the game, so returning players will have new content to look forward to.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see The Library getting changes for Halo: Campaign Evolved? What are your feelings about the level? Will you be getting the remake?

<p>PlayStation is finally getting a Halo game, Halo Studios confirms.</p>



<p>The battle between Xbox and PlayStation has gone on for almost two decades. Each company would try to outsell the other in consoles and games. However, despite all that the Sony-backed company had, Microsoft had Halo. The premiere FPS multiplayer series was seemingly undefeatable, even at its lows. Now, as Xbox has brought exclusive franchises like Gears of War to PlayStation 5, its golden goose has been let loose from the cage.</p>

<p>At the Halo World Championships, Halo Studios confirms that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> will launch on PlayStation 5 alongside Xbox and PC consoles. The news appears at the end of the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efThjRym-ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, which reveals gameplay of the Combat Evolved remake. Furthermore, all upcoming Halo games will release on PlayStation consoles. However, it’s unknown if other titles, like Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo: Infinite, will come to the Sony console. The game, a remake of Combat Evolved, releases in 2026, but there is no release date. In addition, cross-play is now in the game, letting you play with players from other consoles.</p>



<p>Despite the competitive nature of the two companies, having Halo on another console is a good thing. As we’ve seen with games like Final Fantasy XVI, staying exclusive can hurt sales and restrict player bases. With Halo: Campaign Evolved coming to PlayStation, more people can finally experience the series the way many of us had back in the day.</p>

<p>Halo: Combat Evolved Remake has now been confirmed by Halo Studios, and it’s coming quite soon.</p>



<p>For almost 30 years, Halo has revolutionized the FPS genre with its space opera military setting and great combat. As Xbox’s semi-flagship series, it’s now a household name and one every Xbox fan has played at least two times over. However, it all started with one of the original Xbox’s launch titles: 2001’s Halo: Combat Evolved. Now, at the Halo World Championships, the team at Halo Studios revealed that what has relentlessly been leaked is, indeed, true.</p>

<p>Today, Halo Studios finally confirmed that a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved is in development and will be released in 2026. The trailer, <a href="https://youtu.be/efThjRym-ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, shows off some impressive gameplay of fan-favorite scenes, complete with Master Chief in all his glory. The game, which brings back the original 2001 title, is called Halo: Campaign Evolved. As you can guess, the remake is now confirmed to be only the campaign, so no multiplayer will be included. It will also launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, a first for the series. The game will bring back split-screen and new crossplay across all consoles. During a development video, the team also said that new content, like interactions and scenes, will be added. </p>



<p>As mentioned before, a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved has been rumored for a while. After Halo Studios’ tease last year, leaks regarding an in-development, campaign-only version of the classic game showed up, with evidence becoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more and more real</a>. Luckily, they can be put to rest, as we’ll see the title reborn for the next generation of consoles.</p>
