<p>It has been revealed that the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox helped increase engagement as well as sales for the PS5 and PC versions. </p>

Tao first talked about how their live service titles “overall accounted for more than 40% of our first-party software revenue.” Even though performance is different for each title, they observed that live service games are “a recurring source of revenue” similar to the previous quarter. </p>



<p>Tao then spoke about Helldivers 2, stating that it was also released for Xbox in 2025 and “is doing extremely well.” The group CFO added that the Xbox port has not only helped bring in new players on Xbox but also increased engagement from existing users on PS5 and PC.

<p>LEGO has announced that a new Legend of Zelda set is coming in 2026, though details on what exactly it entails are scarce.</p>



<p>The partnership between LEGO and Nintendo has seen a host of epic sets released, including the Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set and a host of Super Mario sets, and the catalogue is being expanded upon next year.</p>

<p>A short video on the LEGO website shows a minifigure of Link, with Zelda blurred in the background, standing still as an ominous shadow approaches.</p>



<p>The video ends with a message for builders across the world, telling them to ‘Build the Legend’ and confirming a new set is coming in 2026. However, that’s all the details that are available for now.</p>



<p>LEGO and Nintendo are set for a big year in 2026, as it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed back in March</a> that Pokémon sets are coming next year—coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the franchise.</p>
