<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is finally here, bringing Max Caulfield back to our screens after almost a decade. Aside from a brief reappearance in the Before the Storm ‘prequel episode’, this is the first major appearance of Max Caulfield in a Life is Strange game since the first title debuted in 2015.</p>



<p>I had the phenomenal opportunity to sit down with Hannah Telle, Max Caulfield’s actor, to talk about the impact of returning to this iconic character after so many years.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<h2 id="h-return-of-the-max">Return of the Max</h2>



<p>Double Exposure is already becoming a fan-favourite title studded with twists, turns, and emotional sequences—much like the other games in the series. It was assembled by Deck Nine over three years and is a direct follow-up to the episodic game released in 2015.</p>



<p>The difference is, that this is a one-shot game – there are chapters but no iterative episodes to download or wait for.</p>



<p>Hannah walked me through the changes she had to take on board to ensure that an ‘older’ Max Caulfield was properly represented in Double Exposure:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was so excited that people wanted to see more Max and that she was going to get to continue her story. I love this character and I hold her very dear to my heart.</p>



<p>I knew that there would be a lot of people who had very strong opinions about what they thought Max would be like as an older person. I had a lot of pressure and wanted to make sure that the fans would be happy. </p>



<p>I also wanted to make sure that I stayed true to this character’s organic trajectory, and I really related to her journey of experiencing some success as an artist.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While many people expected a new Life is Strange title, not many could have predicted the return of Max Caulfield. In our interview, Hannah explained how she had to go off the radar and become very vague about her life as Square Enix facilitated a relocation across the country from California to Colorado to work on Double Exposure in the utmost secrecy.</p>



<p>By the end of the development cycle, Hannah had spent three years working on motion capture and various avenues of voice acting for Double Exposure’s Max Caulfield.</p>



<p>It’s not the end for Max, though. At the end of Life is Strange: Double Exposure, players are advised that the character will return in the next game – but Hannah was tight-lipped about that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In terms of the future, I don’t know anything, but I’m really, really excited, and I hope Max is coming back, and that we get to learn more about her future and her inner world, and I think she’s got worlds within her.</p>



<p>There’s so much to explore with her, and I’m just excited to see where she ends up. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>In case you were wondering, in a world where powers are possible, Hannah Telle would opt to become invisible at will, using that power to spy on people and be present without anyone knowing she was there. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-reveals-why-the-game-was-delayed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay was recently addressed by the franchise’s Vice President Executive Producer, Marc-Alexis Côté. Côté addressed the franchise’s “inconsistency in quality” over the years and talked about “changing that narrative,” not just for the franchise but for the entirety of Ubisoft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the Bafta event yesterday, Marc-Alexis Côté was able to answer several questions regarding Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay through an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. Côté started by acknowledging that “Ubisoft’s portfolio has faced criticism in recent years for a perceived inconsistency in quality.” He speaks about how the community wishes for “more polish, more innovation and deeper engagement” from the games they release, which is helping them “to be better”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Côté explains that by delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, they have the opportunity to “change that narrative, not just for Assassin’s Creed” but for the whole of Ubisoft. Côté expands, stating that the upcoming game “has the potential to be one of the best in the franchise’s storied history”; however,&nbsp; he knows that “being amongst the best is just not enough anymore.”</p>



<p>This is why Côté decided to delay the game. The playtests and feedback “made it clear” that the game has immense potential, but it needs more time to meet the players’ expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the “most ambitious and complex project” for the franchise, featuring “interconnected mechanics, narrative and technology” while being released across a larger number of platforms. With the delay, the developers can “polish every aspect and set a new standard for the franchise”. The decision will reflect their “commitment to delivering an experience worthy” of their players’ time and attention on day one.</p>

<p>The first set of new maps coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have been revealed. On Monday morning, the game’s official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1853467391688110288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> channels shared a teaser look at the three new maps coming to Black Ops 6 season 1. </p>



<p>The new maps are Heirloom, Hideout, and Extraction. </p>



<p>All of the maps will be available for 6v6 multiplayer gameplay. Heirloom, however, will also be available for 2v2 combat. More details about the maps will come closer to the start of Season 1, but the teases should give players an idea of what to expect.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 1 will feature new maps, weapons, and other additions for all players. It’s set to kick off on November 14 with a full reveal happening shortly before.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is available now. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review of the game</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill said that “Black Ops 6 feels accommodating to both newcomers and veterans. It’s as typical a multiplayer offering as you can ask for, but you&nbsp;just get it<strong>&nbsp;</strong>so much faster than previous titles.”</p>



<p>Check out the teaser below, and let us know what you think in the comments. You can also take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/call-of-duty.12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. </p>
